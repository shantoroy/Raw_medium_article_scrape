And revealing the truth is important for everyone looking to be a part of the next big innovation.Ripple is dominatingYou\u2019ve heard the news. Ripple has the 2nd highest market cap out of all cryptocurrencies\u200a\u2014\u200aa whopping $128 billion USD. A valuation higher than Uber, Airbnb, and Slack combined with $20 billion left over in pocket change. Ripple was the best performing cryptocurrency of 2017, with a staggering 36,000% increase from the beginning of the year!Coinmarketcap.com Jan-Dec\u00a02017Things have certainly been going well for Ripple. And to some it\u2019s no surprise. They\u2019ve been killing it for years. From 2012\u20132016, Ripple raised $93.6 million from Andreessen Horowitz, GV (Google Ventures), and many more of the top VC firms in Silicon Valley. These are the kinds of the firms that routinely invest in startups like Facebook, Slack, and Uber when they\u2019re starting up. Them backing Ripple means they believe in the mission and they believe in the team.Major banks using the Ripple\u00a0platformAnd Ripple is everywhere online. Successful pilot programs, working with 100+ financial institutions, and even the Japanese government seems to be behind them.Everything is perfect.A textbook case of a company with innovative technology that\u2019s taking the market by storm.And this would be true, if it wasn\u2019t for some of the finer details that have HUGE IMPLICATIONS.1. XRP is not\u00a0RippleWhen people hear Ripple they instantly think of their coin XRP. This makes sense since other communities and coins are one and the same. When you buy ETH you are betting on Ethereum and when you buy BTC you\u2019re betting on Bitcoin. Why would Ripple be any different?Well, this is where things become interesting. To understand the differences between XRP and Ripple, first we need to examine Ripple the company.Ripple was founded in 2012 as Opencoin, renamed to Ripple in 2015, and is currently based in San Francisco, California. They have more than 150 employees, a nice office, and they sell banking software that uses blockchain.Ripple headquarters in CaliforniaWhat does Ripple do? They have 3 products\u200a\u2014\u200axCurrent, xRapid, and xVia.xCurrent is their flagship product. It gives banks the ability to efficiently move money across borders. It uses RippleNet, the Ripple blockchain, but does NOT use XRP. Banks like this software because it allows them to save money and time when sending payments, without introducing much risk or changes to their workflow.xRapid helps banks improve liquidity when trading in emerging markets. It is the only Ripple product that does use XRP. Banks like it because it helps them free up mountains of money they\u2019re stuck sitting on, but dislike it because it introduces unknowns\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as the volatility of XRP.xVia is still in development and scheduled to come out in early 2018. It\u2019s similar to xCurrent, but allows entities besides banks (such as corporations and payment providers) to send money through banks. xVia also does NOT use XRP.Remember that impressive 100+ list of financial institutions Ripple is working with? Guess what, they are all using xCurrent. And xCurrent does not use XRP. Of the 100+ partnerships Ripple has, ONLY ONE actually uses XRP the cryptocurrency. There is just one small \u201cnon bank financial institution\u201d from Mexico called Cuallix that is using xRapid.This means that the headlines showcasing Ripple\u2019s partnerships with more and more banks are good\u200a\u2014\u200aRipple the company is succeeding\u200a\u2014\u200abut also don\u2019t mean much for XRP gaining adoption.Now this isn\u2019t to say that banks will never adopt xRapid (and start using XRP). In fact, this has been a part of the Ripple business plan from the very beginning. Get banks using xCurrent and then cross-sell them into xRapid. Banks may come to love xRapid.Or they might not.For Ripple this difference doesn\u2019t matter much. For investors in XRP, this is the difference that makes or breaks their investment.2. XRP is not the currency of the\u00a0futureWhen people hear Bitcoin, they think digital money. As in, you can send money to anyone in the world without limitations.XRP might become this in the future, but right now XRP is stuck in banking. And Ripple has made no mention of changing this anytime soon.This is completely fine and makes perfect sense for Ripple as a company to choose. By focusing on just banks and financial institutions, they can provide value and create a profitable venture.The problem for XRP investors is that XRP can become overbought by people that think it will beat Bitcoin, replace fiat, and become the world currency. This means the market cap can be artificially higher and undergo a correction when this becomes common knowledge.Given that Ripple is going after global bank payments, their real goal is to replace SWIFT, the 45 year old society responsible for moving money between banks internationally.In 2016, SWIFT earned $31 million in profit, sending a huge amount of money through their system. Yet this was small compared to the over >$1,000,000,000,000 in monetary assets around the globe.Being limited to the SWIFT market reduces the opportunity of XRP by many orders of magnitude below that of a true digital world currency.3. XRP is not disruptive technologyRipple isn\u2019t the only company interested in revolutionizing banking.R3 is doing the exact same thing as Ripple. They\u2019ve raised $107 million from top venture capitalists and are using blockchain to help banks move money internationally. They\u2019re currently in 70 of the world\u2019s largest banks and the reason you might not have heard of them is simply because they have been doing this WITHOUT their own coin.SWIFT is working with more than 11,000 institutions and employs over 2600 people. To capture this market, Ripple will have to 100x. The challenge here is that there is no reason SWIFT couldn\u2019t develop their own blockchain technology and use their already established relationships to roll it out faster than Ripple can grow.SWIFT Headquarters in La Hulpe,\u00a0BelgiumWill SWIFT develop their own blockchain? Harry Newman, SWIFT\u2019s global head of banking seems unphased. He looks at blockchain as simply a new technology which can be integrated into their existing systems if the benefits outweigh the cons.\u201cIf it makes sense to build it into our global payments innovation offering over the next few years then we will. That is why I don\u2019t see this as a disruption. I see these as constructive technologies that can be examined and adopted and\u00a0used.\u201dAnd their actions align with their words. They have completed a proof-of-concept with 22 banks using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to help them free up capital stored in their nostro accounts. They have also tested smart contracts.Maybe we should all jump on SWIFT\u2019s coin if they come out with one?Stellar Lumens (XLM) was created by the founder of Ripple, Jed McCaleb, in 2014 to solve the problems he saw with Ripple.Stellar has since grown to number 8 in total market cap and is boasting deals with IBM and payment providers in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Korea.By expanding their focus outside of banks, Stellar has the potential to be much larger than Ripple. And the Stellar protocol supports smart contracts, a key component of the popular Ethereum network. A recent win for them on this front was Kik, the $1B messaging app, committing to moving their KIN tokens from Ethereum to Stellar in 2018.4. XRP is not decentralizedRipple controls RippleNet and they own a whopping 62% of the total XRP coins in existence. This has understandably worried XRP investors and Ripple\u2019s response was to lock up 55 billion coins in escrow.As with any centralized system, investors now have to trust Ripple to keep their word.And they most likely will. Given their strategy is to release 1 billion each month for the next 55 months, they stand to gain a lot of money by selling these 55 billion XRP tokens at the current market price.But the risks of being centralized extend beyond simply whether or not you trust Ripple to keep your best interests in mind and play fairly.The issue is also resilience. The reason digital currency have failed in the past is because a centralized digital currency is too easy to kill with regulation. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization is one of the reasons it\u2019s survived when digital coins of the 2000s (like E-gold, Liberty Reserve and Tencent) failed.Ripple faces the same weaknesses of these early digital currencies. It is one entity to attack legally when things inevitably go wrong.5. XRP adoption \u2260 price\u00a0increaseAssume everything goes according to plan. Ripple works with 100x more banks. The banks love using blockchain and xCurrent, then decide to take a chance on XRP through xRapid. They love xRapid and feel confident enough in it to process all of their transactions through it\u200a\u2014\u200aeven ones in the millions of dollars. SWIFT drops the ball hard and completely fails to innovate, losing all of their customers and shutting down.You\u2019re happy. There are more than $5 trillion dollars being transacted daily in XRP. The price of XRP should be to the moon. Right? Well, not necessarily.The value of XRP is driven upwards by people holding the asset and believing it will be worth more in the future. Banks looking to move money across borders are not speculating. In fact, they have a disincentive to hold XRP, since they take on risk due to natural XRP volatility.This means banks will hold XRP for the absolute minimum amount of time they can. And given the speed of the Ripple network; that time is 4 seconds. With banks\u200a\u2014\u200athe actual users of XRP\u200a\u2014\u200anot holding onto their coins, XRP\u2019s market cap will decrease and EVEN AT SWIFT LEVELS will only result in approximately $230 million.This is worlds apart from the current speculative value of $128 billion.ConclusionRipple is good, but XRP\u2019s success for investors is an uphill battle.First Ripple the company needs to do well. Since XRP is centralized, if Ripple dies so too does XRP.Next Ripple needs to sign up 100x as many banks and financial institutions on xCurrent to become as big as SWIFT at sending payments internationally. Then the banks need to start using xRapid and settling transactions with XRP.In this process, SWIFT, a 45 year old group that has been evolving with technology over that time, needs to fail to offer a competitive product to Ripple and lose their entire market share. Also R3 and other startups breaking into this space have to fail too.And only at this time will all 100 billion XRP coins be worth approximately $231 million, or $0.0023 per coin.This being said, Ripple is still an amazing company. Even if they fail to capture the entire SWIFT market, they could still offer a valuable suite of products to banks. They could still generate significant revenue and command a high price per share.This just might not be the outcome XRP investors are hoping for.Enjoy this article?

Install\u00a0Atomic.Ripple and\u00a0XRPRipple is a funds transfer company that created RippleNet and XRP. XRP is a digital asset running on it\u2019s own blockchain. The main purpose behind XRP was to create a decentralized custodial free payment system which will use another consensus algorithm than Bitcoin. The project was initially based on the idea that you can exchange any asset or goods by using XRP ane currency bridges (exchange your currency to XRP and then transfer it to the other address via public ledger in just a couple of seconds).Ripple featuresIn XRP the system is handles by the verified or trusted nodes from the UNL (unique node lits) owned by the Ripple company and third parties. Two years ago it was possible to critise the project, but nowadays XRP is working hard to make their network more decentralized and trustless. Don\u2019t trust, verify!More than 150 nodes are running all over the globe right now and only 10 are governed by Ripple. In the past there were only 10 nodes and the whole XRP Ledger was governed by Ripple company. To decrease the risk of any failures in the validation Ripple decided to make a devirsification of nodes by their region, computing powers and other requirements. They validate tranasctions and protect the network from any maliscious actions. For example, to make changes into the blockchain the whole majority of nodes (80%) should vote for two weeks for these changes. Every node has only one vote, it\u2019s fair and trustless.The next step for centralization will be to decrease Ripple nodes from validation. Ripple will decrease the number of self-governed nodes with every two newcomers to the UNL (unique node list). Then every node will receive their own Token (unique number) that will be used for Vailidators Rotation. And the final step for the nearest future will be implementing Cobalt consensus algorithm.Sound impressive, isn\u2019t it?XRP real world use\u00a0casesRipple is working with different financial institutions (banks and etc.) to provide a better and faster option for cross-border money transfer and exhange.Buy XRP (Ripple) instantlyNow you can Buy Ripple with a bank card easily!

To control these assets fully, you need to get familiar with some nuances.These assets use Destination Tag technology, the purpose of which is to assign the specific recipient of the transaction.What is Destination Tag?For example, some trader gives you their XRP address to send coins to, and you suddenly notice that this is the same XRP address as yours. How\u2019s that possible?It happens since exchanges often use a one XRP address for all their XRP traders. The only difference is the Destination Tag, a short complimentary code piece that assigns your transaction to a certain account.The Destination Tag is mandatory for the overwhelming majority of transactions. Once you set random numbers or inappropriate values instead of the required combination, you\u2019ll lose your funds. Either the funds will be sent to any other user having that combination as the tag, or to the exchange storage as an unassigned transaction.The Destination Tag purpose is to identify a transaction recipient.It\u2019s like the numbers of rooms. If you live in the same building, you\u2019ll need to use exactly your room number. If you live in a private house, you won\u2019t need one.How to use Destination Tag?The Destination Tag is not needed if you have your own personal wallet address for these coins. Atomic Wallet provides every user with their own wallet address. However, when it comes to exchanging your coins using centralized services, the Destination Tag becomes mandatory.Don\u2019t use the name of an exchange service as a Destination Tag! Otherwise, your transaction will get stuck as unassigned.In Stellar, the Destination Tag is called \u00abMemo ID\u00bbIn Monero, the Destination Tag is called \u00abPayment ID\u00bbIt\u2019s just the different names of the same feature.XRP Destination Tag in Atomic Wallet\u00a0UIDestination Tag\u00a0freeIf you want to use the custody-free wallet for Ripple, Stellar, Monero and other altcoins and tokens, download and install Atomic Wallet at atomicwallet.io.

Ripple is aiming to bridge the remittance cost-gap between institutions across the globe\u200a\u2014\u200aFinancial Institutions. something that has torn the cryptocurrency community due to the decentralized nature /ideals of the markets.Why has Ripple been such a major topic in the cryptocurrency community?Well, take a look at the image below. I don\u2019t have a clue when this picture was created, but Bitcoin fees and Credit Card Processing fees continue to take center-stage topic as more and more retail consumers enroll in the markets. Why fees? I thought the magic of Bitcoin was in it\u2019s Decentralised Organisational Structure? It is, still. Bitcoin will not be regulated by any government and cannot be shut down unless governments in every country across the globe shutdown electricity to every individual supporting the network via Bitcoin Mining. More below.The reason Bitcoin still has such high-fees is because the network is currently developing different technological solutions to solve this problem, allowing Bitcoin to scale. Instead of staying patient, a faction of the original Bitcoin community led by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu decided to continue supporting the old fork which, today, is known as Bcash (short for Bitcoin Cash), in an effort to expedite the process of Bitcoin becoming a tool for payment processing and Remittances.Looking above at the original Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto, we can see the title clearly states:\u2018Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u2019Key-word = Peer-to-Peer. While Bitcoin Cash is still a decentralized Blockchain (database), it is very, very heavily influenced by a centralized force of commercial Bitcoin miners. This takes away the original peer-to-peer ideals out of the BCash network because it is so centralized\u200a\u2014\u200athe miners are controlled by a couple people which gives a major threat to 51% attacks on the Proof Of Work (POW) Bitcoin Network.51% attacks are prevented by having a majority of the network\u2019s mining hash power distributed across individuals as opposed to running ASICS-powered mining rooms in one building, centralized. Since BCash is a centralized blockchain network, it can be compared with Ripple\u200a\u2014\u200aanother centralized blockchain aiming to create a remittance system for institutions who will ultimately allow their customers to make low-cost remittances through the Ripple payment network.Now that we know the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash when it comes to the nature of the blockchain, we can look at Ripple through a similar lens that we look at Bitcoin Cash through\u200a\u2014\u200aa company using blockchain technology strategically to increase the quality of service for companies using their service, but in a centralized manner.For the purpose of this article, it\u2019s important to know the difference between a truly decentralized blockchain network and one that is centralized, but using blockchain technology to power the network. The hurry to become a payment processing network will likely impede BCash\u2019s growth progress because security is far, far more important than being first-to-market. Look at the recent Equifax Data Leak (September 2017). This is one of, if not THE, world\u2019s biggest Credit Rating Agencies in the world\u200a\u2014\u200athe WORLD.You can look into the statistics yourself, but over 150 million customer\u2019s information was stolen\u200a\u2014\u200ayours, mine, your parents, etc. This is an issue Blockchain Technology aims to solve by using Public-key Cryptography to thwart hackers\u2019 ability to steal mass amounts of data in one fowl swoop. As soon as the Lightning Network is established and Atomic Swaps become more stable, the Bitcoin Economy will be easily integrated into other blockchain networks as it continues to become more efficient.A major lack of patience is what caused the Bitcoin Cash chain to continue running after the Bitcoin Cash Hard-Forks From Bitcoin (August 2017)\u200a\u2014\u200athat and the sometimes uncontrollable characteristic of human-greed.Anyway, let\u2019s dive into Ripple and how this centralized blockchain network may have the ability to garner Visa, MasterCard\u2019s, or any other Credit Card Processing company\u2019s business, and what type of price movement this could create for the Ripple (payment network).One of the pictures above displays that Ripple already has a much, much lower fee than the distributed Bitcoin network and Visa\u2019s current fee schedule. Even Bitcoin\u2019s currently inefficient network beats Visa\u2019s payment processing fees. Ripple has a highly-dedicated team of Finance and experienced technology professionals fueling their growth and they are either aiming to integrate with credit card processors like Visa OR simply take their market-share. Either way, it should be interesting to watch Ripple\u2019s price in the process!The sheer statistical figures below give us some interesting potential scenarios that I will have fun projecting below in this article!Okay so 16,600 Financial institution clients\u2026do we really need to go through every single stat? I don\u2019t think so\u2026we all know Visa owns a significant portion of the market so let\u2019s have fun diving into potential Ripple projections!According to CoinMarketCap\u2019s Ripple profile, there are currently 38,739,144,847 XRP in circulation with a total of 100 billion XRP in max supply, held by Ripple leadership and a fund of XRP used to ease the price growth of XRP as the company increases the volume and attention on their products. I will keep all figures the same as they are now in the projections below:38,739,144,847 XRP.$8,900,000,000,000 is Visa\u2019s yearly total payment processing volume.Now, keep in mind that Ripple will be used for payment PROCESSING. Meaning, Ripple will not always be held for the entire time it is being used to send value, right? For example, you or I might send U.S. Dollar to somebody in Europe where the USD is instantly converted into XRP, sent to the final destination at a bank in Europe, and then settled in Euro (currency) or the proper tender in the country sent to. However, Visa will not be the only provider that would use Ripple, it would be major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan and other behemoths.Since Ripple is a Digital Currency/Virtual Currencies, financial institutions and especially Assets Under Management institutions can add it as an Asset Diversification strategy in their client Portfolios. So we don\u2019t know how much volume will be transacted in XRP by these institutions, so let\u2019s have some fun!$8,900,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= $229.742 XRP.Kind of cool to think about, heh? The equation above is IF Ripple\u2019s XRP captured ALL of the value of the Visa payment network, something unlikely to occur. However, as mentioned, Visa isn\u2019t the only company Ripple can serve. What about Mastercard?Interestingly, I could not find a single number that made sense to include in this article because one source says that Mastercard was processing $5.5 trillion in transactions as of 2003 and another source (image above) says 10\u2013years later, in 2013, Mastercard is processing $3.5 trillion\u200a\u2014\u200acompanies do not usually shrink over time, but maybe Visa or other payment processors took some Mastercard volume?

Considering Mastercard and Visa\u2019s payment processing equates to something like $12.4 trillion in annual volume, that\u2019s just a drop in the bucket compared to the large and separate $71 trillion AUM market.What if, say, all major asset funds used the \u20185% rule\u2019 to diversify into 5 different major currencies, one of them being Ripple\u2019s XRP?

Lately I\u2019ve been getting a few questions from followers on why I\u2019m still holding XRP after the (~36,000%) returns in 2017, and why it\u2019s still the only digital asset I own. There are a few reasons which I\u2019m happy to share publicly:#Progress. Most people see MoneyGram\u2019s recent announcement to adopt XRP as a brave and spectacular management decision. But it really isn\u2019t. What alternatives are there? MoneyGram could keep on processing crossborder payments through SWIFT and the correspondant banking system, which takes days, is unpredictable, expensive and ties up some >$900MM in interest bearing liquidity. Or it could try and utilize eg Bitcoin, having transaction fees of around $20+, no settlement finality and whose throughput and scalability isn\u2019t anywhere close to allow for commercial implementations. So in the end, adopting XRP (4 second settlement time, 1500 transactions per second and fees of around 1/100th of a cent) is actually \u2018just\u2019 a very rational and economic decision. What\u2019s driving MoneyGram is also driving other money transmitters. So I do expect a constant and positive newsflow of XRP-adopting institutions in the upcoming months and years, fueled by a \u2018disclosure incentive\u2019:#DisclosureIncentive. Ripple continues to have a very strategic and long term approach when it comes to XRP. Working with financial institutions usually is a lenghty process, covered by non-disclosure-agreements (\u2018NDA\u2019). Note that first rumours of a MoneyGram partnership came up in 2015(!). As much as I understand the reason for NDA\u2019s, it does hold down market prices, because the public isn\u2019t aware of potential heavyweight partnerships and how the overall \u2018pipeline\u2019 looks like. But something remarkable happened recently. While cryptocurrencies had a negative connotation (\u2018bubble!\u2019), hindering corporates to disclose respective partnerships, they are now being rewarded by capital markets for making their ties to Ripple and XRP public. Recent examples are Seagate, WesternUnion, SBI Holdings, and MoneyGram.#UtilityValue. It\u2019s an unpopular view because XRP also profits from overall (rallying) market developments, but in my view it\u2019s almost certain that today\u2019s market for cryptocurrencies is in bubble territory: 1,380 cryptocurrencies are heavily traded, complexity is high, beliefs are strong, utility usually not in sight. All strong bubble indicators. I\u2019m not having a view when useless tokens finally disappear. Could be next week, could be 2020. Encouraging sign: with the world\u2019s second largest money transmitter planning (besides two other TOP5 names) to integrate XRP into its core payment flows, Ripple scored a \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d. Via Ripple\u2019s liquidity offering \u2018xRapid\u2019, XRP has reached a turning point, now building true utility value. Evidence is there, that xRapid already works for small Mexican money transmitter Cuallix (the first confirmed xRapid customer), including the desired impact on XRP. It\u2019s important for an investor, as natural buyers act as a downside protection. Imagine you are MoneyGram and need to transfer a $1MM payment from the US to Europe. Today you\u2019d need 500k XRP for it (XRP/USD = $2). If the exchange rate drops to $1.90, you\u2019d now need 526k XRP to bridge the next $1MM payment, generating 26k XRP outright demand, driving the exchange rate back up. Of course this also works in the other direction, but overall it entails stability. Decreasing volatility attracts a new set of financial institutions and corporates. And there are quite a few on the sidelines (~30,000 banks globally + a decent number of payment providers).#Potential. Speculative value is dominant in every crypto, including XRP. Utility value is hardly existant, maybe non-existant. As an investor I try to minimize my downside, so I like to think of a scenario in which all speculative value has vanished. How big could the utility value of a given crypto grow? XRP is unique in a way that its potential utility value by far exceeds today\u2019s market/ speculative value. XRP would need to bridge a fraction of today\u2019s $155tn annual crossborder payment volumes and/or to replace a fraction of the $27tn of stuck capital in global nostro accounts. I\u2019m not talking the dimension of eg a company that successfully built a global social network with some billions of quarterly ad-based revenues. I\u2019m talking about an asset that is intended to move around a share of the entire world\u2019s monetary value.#VirtuousCircle. Ripple is the biggest holder of XRP and also intends to use its pile to incentivize adoption. Ripple also incentivizes market makers to quote competitive spreads against XRP, so more payment volume is bridged through XRP, so network effects keep on building. In other words: every rise in XRP\u2019s price makes it more likely to succeed. Having a >$100bn (XRP equivalent) holder whose goal is to make XRP the world\u2019s primary value transfer vehicle is something very powerful.#Holders. The majority of XRP investors understand the overall strategy, and they are in it for the long run (enabling an even more powerful virtuous circle).#Hedge. To me XRP has become the perfect short/medium term hedge for every investor\u2019s portfolio. Interest rates are at historical lows. Global central banks are becoming more vocal on raising main refinancing rates. It\u2019ll make equities, bonds, commodities and real estate suffer at the same time once interest rates rise. It\u2019ll also make opportunity costs for $27tn of (stuck) capital in nostro accounts rise, which should put XRP in heavy *demand*. It\u2019s a second order effect, but it should enable you to watch everyone\u2019s net worth going down while yours is going up.", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "What is\u00a0Ripple?", "author_name": "Tiffany Hayden", "link": "https://medium.com/@haydentiff/what-is-ripple-efc179bc02ae?source=search_post---------9", "post_date": "May 18, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "1.3K", "content": "What is\u00a0Ripple?A study guide for Cryptocoins NewsTiffany HaydenBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 18, 2017\u201cThe technical description of Ripple is rather ambiguous.\u201dIt was once said that it would take the average person around 6 months to fully understand Ripple. I have to agree. I can understand why people would shy away from putting in the effort. What I can\u2019t understand is why uninformed people keep choosing to write about it though. Hopefully, I can help clarify things a bit.To start, it\u2019s helpful to look at Ripple as something completely different from Bitcoin. Ripple is back-end infrastructure and not a consumer facing product. Ripple is not a currency. It\u2019s an open-source, global exchange. Anyone can access it and everyone has an equal right to use it. Ripple, the company, does not control the network, collect fees, or limit access.Ripple is a distributed, real-time payment protocol for anything of value. It\u2019s a shared public database, with a built-in distributed currency exchange, that operates as the worlds first universal translator for money. Ripple is currency agnostic and has a foreign exchange component built right into the protocol. Ripple acts as a pathfinding algorithm to find the best route for a dollar to become a euro or airline miles to become Bitcoin. It will look at all the orders in the global order book. ANYBODY can put a bid-ask on anything of value. The Ripple protocol is designed to route every transaction to the cheapest price available in the market.XRPThere is a transaction fee to use the exchange (~.00001XRP) and it must be paid in XRP, the native asset of the network. This transaction fee is not collected by anyone; the XRP is destroyed and ceases to exist. Having a cost associated with ledger entries helps prevent ledger flooding attacks. Like Bitcoin, XRP has no counterparty risk. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP transactions clear in 4 seconds or less. XRP is a digital asset with verifiable mathematical properties, similar to how we can reliably verify gold as a substance made of 79 protons. XRP also serves as a currency of last resort that can bridge between any currency, asset, or thing of value in the world. If every currency is liquid to XRP, it is also liquid to other currencies. By design, 100 billion XRP were created at Ripple\u2019s inception, and per the protocol rules, no more XRP can ever be created.Nostro AccountsTied-up capital accounts for more than 80% of payment costs for every industry. Worldwide, businesses have more than $27 trillion in capital sitting idle in nostro accounts. Ripple aims to free up this capital by using its global exchange as a market place for float. Financial brokers, market makers, anyone, really, can offer up their cash positions. With a marketplace for cash inventory, businesses no longer need to keep funded positions in every country they send payments to. This also means that the payments will be sent from a local provider, allowing businesses to avoid hitting the international SWIFT rail, which is expensive, slow, and doesn\u2019t scale.Global SettlementThe global foreign exchange market does $5.7 trillion per day and that\u2019s the market Ripple is after. Ripple Consensus Ledger can handle 1,000 transactions per second and XRP Payment Channels allow transaction throughput to increase to tens of thousands of transactions per second, bringing scalability to the same level as Visa.XRP is not the core utility of Ripple. External currencies are the focus of the protocol. Ripple is a global settlement network.There\u2019s been a lot of quasi-religious Bitcoin nonsense spewed, ever since the price of XRP started to rise. Alleged free market capitalists are horrified that Ripple, the company, wants to make a profit and doesn\u2019t plan to distribute XRP in any sort of socialist, utopian manner.Because Ripple is a payment network first and foremost, XRP will be used to make the network as healthy as possible, which will most likely mean managing liquidity with XRP.", "responses": "20"}, {"title": "XRP is now available on\u00a0Coinbase", "author_name": "Coinbase", "link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/xrp-is-now-available-on-coinbase-d884e33fa8b7?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 28", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "1.2K", "content": "XRP is now available on\u00a0CoinbaseCoinbaseBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 28Starting today, Coinbase supports XRP at Coinbase.com and in the Coinbase Android and iOS apps.

After launching their blockchain in 2012, Ripple Labs has been working with financial organizations to build one of the largest payment networks in the ecosystem, proving one of the first B2B use cases for the fledgling industry.Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have used this as a sign that XRP will be very valuable in the future. In order for these financial institutions to run any operation on the blockchain, they need to spend a small amount of XRP to complete the transaction. And according to the market, this means high value for XRP:Just this year, the value of XRP has grown from below $.01 per token to it\u2019s currency price of $.25, a 25X jump that rivals even the growth of BTC.So why would someone believe that XRP wouldn\u2019t be worth very much in the future? In this article, I\u2019m going to make the case that despite Ripple Labs impressive growth and strong partnership network, XRP has already become obsolete due to the emergence of permissioned blockchains in their market.What is\u00a0Ripple?Before we can understand the problem, we need to understand what the Ripple does. Ripple is an open-source, semi-permissioned blockchain run by Ripple labs. On the surface, there\u2019s a lot that Ripple offers that\u2019s not too different form other blockchain applications: It has a distributed ledger, a variety of wallet applications and a native asset, XRP.Where Ripple decided to differentiate itself from blockchains like Bitcoin is in it\u2019s use of gateways, issuance and trust lines. Here is a basic overview of these features:A blockchain gateway is feature to allow for transfer of non-native assets (blockchain or otherwise) onto a particular blockchain. This includes a bank being able to lock USD, Yen, or even another blockchain asset like BTC/LTC and be able to transact with it on the Ripple Network.An issuance is a method for an individual account holder on the blockchain to \u2018lock\u2019 a particular asset (let\u2019s say Gold) on the blockchain ledger. Similar to a gateway, after an issuance is made to the blockchain, you can then send it to other accounts, thus taking advantage of Ripple low fees.Trust lines are Ripple\u2019s way of securing issuance transactions between individual parties. As opposed to XRP, which can be sent to anyone, an issuance can only be sent to parties who both agree to open a line of communication. So while I can send and receive XRP from anyone in the world, I can only send the gold I claim to have to accounts that actually trust my word.These three features are special, because they gave Ripple the momentum to move into the financial world in a big way. By allowing banks to create their own network of partners and allow them to transact assets on the blockchain, they introduced a new way to cut transaction costs.This is the secret sauce behind Ripple\u2019s success: by being able to create low cost transactions on the network, financial institutions were able to take advantage of the blockchain. And by using XRP to secure every transaction, Ripple gave a powerful incentive for these institutions to use XRP.Who Is Ripple\u2019s Competition?In the emerging blockchain industry, every value driver is creating a small industry. Monero and Zcash are leading the way for the privacy focused cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, NEM, Waves and a plethora of other blockhains are competing to be the top platform blockchain. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are competing to be the \u2018top\u2019 cryptocurrency overall. There are other markets forming as well.When you look at the market for Ripple and try to find their competitors, something odd jumps out. Despite being one of the oldest cryptocurrencies with the clearest use case, there are surprising lack of direct competitors for financial payments\u2026 at least financial payments for large corporate banks. Platforms easily have 20+ blockchains all competing for Ethereum\u2019s place, but Ripple only seems to be competing with the Stellar Network and few other organizations. For as mature as Ripple is in the ecosystem, you would expect more. So where are Ripple\u2019s competitors?It turns out that Ripple has very stiff competition\u2026 but you\u2019re not going to find them on CryptoMarketCap. Ripple\u2019s chief competition today is coming from the new class of cryptocurrencies called \u2018permissioned blockchains\u2019. As opposed to permission-less system, where anyone globally can join, permissioned blockchains require an invitation from an organization before you\u2019re allowed to join.Today, there are a handful of permissioned blockchains that are offering similar services that Ripple offers. These organizations include R3 Corda, Hyperledger, the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) and SWIFT(Ripple\u2019s chief rival, at least according to Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas). These businesses are creating products similar enough to Ripple\u2019s feature set and partnership network that these organizations constitute the financial payment network market.Why Ripple\u2019s Market Matters for\u00a0XRPIf you accept that Ripple\u2019s competitors are permissioned blockchains, then it\u2019s useful to compare their features to understand how, say, SWIFT\u2019s blockchain payment network might be more useful than Ripple. One thing that jumps out immediately about every permissioned blockchain is that these networks don\u2019t have native assets, despite offering the same basic services that Ripple can offer.Here\u2019s a statement about SWIFT and considering native asset:One area SWIFT will not be considering is generating its own digital assets, or cryptocurrency, Grainger said. This is at odds with other cross-border payment services, notably Ripple, whose digital currency XRP is used to conduct payments over its distributed ledger network.Here\u2019s another analysis from Philipp Sandner, comparing Hyperledger, Corda and Ethereum:Even Ethereum through the EEA are creating permissioned blockchains (such as JP Morgan\u2019s Quorum) that do not require the need for native assets.If part of the market was split, and only half the market had native assets, this might be less odd. Diesel engines were still produced even after alternatives appeared on the market. But that fact that every major competitor has opted out of having a native asset, one that has allowed Ripple to control billions in value through XRP, signals a change in the market.What A Lack Of Native Assets\u00a0MeanLet\u2019s think about the implications of this: strong competition has appeared in the market, as to be expected. But instead of creating a native asset to secure the network, these competitors have decided to use another method (Native Identity Management, in this case) that secures the network. These blockchains can offer similar features without the need for an XRP-like component.We can argue whether SWIFT, R3 Corda or Hyperledger really have a better set of features than Ripple, but that is beside the point. What these projects have shown by universally disregarding native assets is that that component of Ripple is no longer required to provide value. It\u2019s an obsolete component of Ripple\u2019s blockchain. In the same way that CD drives were slowly eliminated from new PC\u2019s after flash drives became more common, native assets for blockchain payment networks have a better alternative.Even if Ripple remains the best payment network for financial institutions, XRP remains a vestige of what Ripple Labs thought the market would become. But the market changed. Ripple\u2019s competitors will get better and strong, and financial institutions will start considering alternatives, with XRP sticking out as a sore thumb. Even if Ripple is the best, it is not because XRP offers some great advantage. If anything, it\u2019s an additional cost that none of their competitors will have.How Does This Affect\u00a0XRP?Ripple still has a better partnership network, a more mature product line and strong leadership. But with competitors like IBM and R3 Corda entering the industry, it is only a matter of time before the competition will get stronger. In this race, XRP offers no competitive advantage and only represents an additional cost.At the end of the day, Ripple Labs is valuable because of their ability to provide great value to financial institution. But if an organization like SWIFT begins to win the market, Ripple Labs will be forced to respond. As Ripple already owns 55% of all XRP, it would be easy for their organization to either sell XRP as a market discount, or give it away entirely to new organizations who want to join their network. Increasing the price of XRP does not strengthen their position in winning the financial institutions market. When competition get intense, XRP will be one of the first factors to be eliminated, either through devaluing XRP significantly or giving it away entirely.This is ultimately the fate of XRP is: at best, a potential incentive to have new organizations join their business, at worst, an additional cost that is completely eliminated by giving away XRP (or close to it). In either case, the value of XRP is simply not supported by it\u2019s use case and will be unlikely to retain it\u2019s value.", "responses": "16"}, {"title": "XRP Is A Cryptocurrency Like The USS Zumwalt Is A\u00a0Boat", "author_name": "Tiffany Hayden", "link": "https://code.likeagirl.io/xrp-is-a-cryptocurrency-like-the-uss-zumwalt-is-a-boat-3b25be5226b8?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 13, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "1.2K", "content": "XRP Is A Cryptocurrency Like The USS Zumwalt Is A\u00a0BoatTiffany HaydenBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 13, 2017Image stolen and altered from a presentation given by Stefan\u00a0Thomas.XRP is a cryptographically secured digital asset with verifiable mathematical properties, similar to how we can reliably verify gold as a substance made of atoms with 79 protons. The XRP ledger\u2019s headers are like Bitcoin\u2019s block headers, both chain & incorporate transactions by hash.]The XRP Ledger is a cryptographic system. Accounts are identified by cryptographic identities. Transactions are authorized by cryptographic signatures matching these identities. Users can use cryptographically signed transactions to store and transfer almost anything (euros, gold, company shares, etc).Among other things, XRP is a cryptocurrency.By design, 100 billion XRP were created at Ripple\u2019s inception and, per the rules of the protocol, no more XRP can ever be created. Transactions are verified through Consensus, in which the entire network agrees on the same ledger. All of this happens independent of a central bank.Some people claim that XRP is \u201cpre-mined.\u201d That\u2019s inaccurate. Ripple Consensus does not involve proof-of-work (commonly referred to as \u201cmining\u201d) therefore XRP cannot be \u201cpremined.\u201dCryptocurrencies are created from code by coders. Crypotcurrencies are not divine gifts from God. Whoever conceives of the idea has full control over distribution. It\u2019s the philosophical underpinning of a new currency that determines whether the first 5% will be \u201cmined\u201d right away by its creator, while everyone else is forced to jump through hoops for the next 131 years, or whether the new currency will be generated and available immediately, or somewhere in between.It has also been said that \u201creal\u201d cryptocurrencies have their own blockchain. XRP meets this requirement. It exists natively on the XRP Ledger as a counterparty-free asset, similar to Bitcoin. XRP forms a core part of its blockchain as part of an incentive scheme. There is a transaction fee to use the XRP Ledger (~.0001XRP) and it must be paid in XRP. This transaction fee is not collected by anyone; the XRP are destroyed and cease to exist. Having a cost associated with ledger entries helps prevent ledger flooding attacks.https://ripple.com/xrp/XRP consistently handles 1,500 transactions per second, 24x7, and can scale to handle the same throughput as Visa. (50,000 transactions per second, as of July 15, 2017.)XRP transaction fee = 1/100th of a cent!UTILITYXRP comes with a utility that most people fail to recognize. Aside from providing an anti-spam mechanism, XRP comes equipped with GPS! The XRP Ledger has a pathfinding algorithm designed to route every transaction to the cheapest possible path. It\u2019s currency agnostic and even has a built-in foreign exchange component.To illustrate how important (and unsolved) pathfinding is for other projects, take a look at misguided comment by Greg Maxwell\u2019s (Blockstream CTO) about using Ripple\u2019s pathfinding method for the Lightning Network. (Hint: They can\u2019t.)https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/43kyev/greg_maxwell_accidentally_tells_the_truth/czjh0s5/XRP was designed as a settlement asset. It\u2019s quick, scalable, and cheap. While banks may use the Ripple network to swap their own private IOUs, only a digital asset without counter-party risk can provide instant settlement.So Much\u00a0FUDXRP CANNOT BE\u00a0FROZEN!The XRP Ledger has no administrative functions.Issuers of assets (IOUs) on the XRP Ledger can freeze their own assets, but XRP is not an issuance and nobody can freeze it. Additionally, Ripple can\u2019t freeze ANYTHING because Ripple doesn\u2019t issue assets.https://ripple.com/build/freeze/Ripple doesn\u2019t issue any assets on the ledger and there are no trust lines that end at Ripple.The XRP Ledger is a tool, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain. KYC tools cannot be built into a global ledger because nobody has that kind of jurisdiction. Any business that chooses to build on either of these protocols is responsible for complying with their jurisdiction\u2019s anti-money-laundering regulations and they would add compliance features ON TOP OF THE PROTOCOL.Permissioned? Hell\u00a0no.Similar to the Blockchain, the XRP Ledger is an open-source protocol, with globally distributed validators. Anyone can access the protocol and everyone has an equal right to use it. It\u2019s a system with no central authority. Ripple does not control the network, collect fees, or limit access.Moreover, Ripple validators do not have the ability to censor transactions. The rules of the protocol determine whether or not a transaction is valid. Validators order transactions using deterministic rules. They do not have the power to make arbitrary decisions.With Bitcoin, however, miners have complete freedom to select which transactions to include in a block.Anybody who wants to participate in the network is free to do so. Running a Ripple validator is similar to running a Bitcoin full node. By running your own, you don\u2019t have to rely on somebody else. Ripple doesn\u2019t pay people to run validators, so rent-seekers will have to look elsewhere.Setting up a validator is easy.

The ledger is powered by a network of peer-to-peer servers. All accounts on this network can send or receive XRP to/from each other, while XRP can be used to send underlying fiat currencies between two parties. In this way, XRP can function as a bridge currency in transactions involving different currencies such as US dollars, Japanese yen, Euros, Francs, and others in use on the XRP network.Please also note that XRP is not yet available on Coinbase.com or via our mobile apps.

We highlighted Ripple\u2019s great company fundamentals and XRP\u2019s speculative investment potential\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh risk and high reward.The fundamentals in the case of XRP are basically its long term probability of becoming a quasi-reserve currency (QRC) for financial institutions. We say \u201cquasi\u201d because we do not believe central banks will ever fully relinquish their local currencies without a fight. The path to QRC status will need to include demonstrable growth within the following areas:Liquidity and market makersInstitutional derivatives that would allow banks to hedge foreign exchange exposure on their balance sheetOn-boarding financial institutions onto xCurrent + xRapid in both exotic and non-exotic corridorsShort Term XRP Trading\u00a0AnalysisThe crypto space is in a speculative \u201cfrothy\u201d frenzy currently. Under these circumstances, fundamental analysis becomes less important in the short term since speculators will trade on emotion and greed compared to fundamentals. Pugilist made an XRP trading recommendation to our internal investor network right after we released our report last month. We stated that despite XRP\u2019s long term hurdles, their price action and technical analysis charts were setting up nicely for a price spike. At that time, XRP was trading between $0.25\u200a\u2014\u200a$0.30. We did not forecast a specific price target given we don\u2019t own a crystal ball, but we did see an interesting dichotomy forming.DichotomyPugilist Ventures maintains its speculative fundamental evaluation AND positive short term trading view for XRP; simultaneously. Furthermore, if XRP maintains its exponential growth during 2018, then its long term fundamentals may change for the positive according to the Theory of Reflexivity a la George Soros.Reflexivity TheoryBy simple definition, Reflexivity is a three part process whereby an asset\u2019s price increase drives investor expectations higher which positively changes the asset\u2019s fundamentals, resulting in further price appreciation. Rinse and repeat.Reflexivity for\u00a0XRPReflexive price appreciation and expectations may substantially increase demand and mainstream adoption for XRP. For example, imagine if XRP supersedes bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) market cap in 2018. This speculative demand spike would dramatically increase liquidity and potential derivatives coverage, which would help Ripple on-board more banks (fewer objections to adoption) onto xCurrent + xRapid, thus improving XRP\u2019s fundamentals, i.e. the path to QRC status.SummaryXRP is being driven primarily by speculation in our opinion. However, this speculation may actually increase the long term probability of success for XRP by increasing market liquidity, derivatives coverage, and mainstream adoption as medium of exchange and store of value; while planting the seeds of a future QRC debate. All of which provide fuel to Ripple\u2019s most important business goal of growing financial institutions using both xCurrent and xRapid for global payments. Only time shall tell if this path bears fruit for Ripple and XRP.\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200aDisclaimer: Neither the author of this article, nor Pugilist Ventures, provide investment, financial, or legal advice.

The insinuation being: \u201cif this piggy doubles after listing, you could pocket a cool $100mm in the trade.\u201dLess standard by public equities standards, but this dynamic isn\u2019t unique in crypto.Earlier this week, Autonomous Research published a report that claimed the average listing fee charged by top crypto exchanges stretched up to $3mm, 10x what you\u2019d expect in the public markets.The problem is crypto companies tend to want things both ways.Act like a securities offerer when it\u2019s convenient from a capital formation perspective or when you\u2019re doling out \u201cfounders\u2019 rewards\u201d. Pretend you\u2019re actually selling a currency or commodity when it becomes markedly less convenient from an investor disclosures standpoint.There\u2019s a reason for public equities listing fees, by the way. They usually carry with them the expectation that listees will be regulated and subject to some level of standardized reporting. They only get to list in the first place if they\u2019ve abided by widely accepted rules.In that case, I suppose we should welcome this week\u2019s news!I look forward to working with Ripple on standardizing disclosures around how they (and other token teams) manage their treasuries.I\u2019m sure board members like Gene Sperling (former Economic Advisor to Presidents Clinton and Obama) and Ben Lawsky (creator of the infamous NYS BitLicense) would push fervently for better disclosures around XRP\u2019s treasury management and distribution.Especially given Lawsky\u2019s mandate at the company:Here\u2019s a starting point for disclosures:+ How is Ripple paying its strategic partners? What are the terms with respect to discounts, lock-ups, etc? How do the rebate programs work for companies testing XRP? Are they like Coinbase offers\u2026free money \u201cloans\u201d?+ Why did the company implement a programmatic selling program where they aimed to sell 25 bps of global XRP volume per quarter only to ratchet that back in Q4? Did the $91.5mm in XRP sales look like it might set off alarms, so they stopped short of selling $300mm?+ Why does the company write about XRP price appreciation as if it\u2019s a milestone? Why do they do little to tamp down speculation around XRP enterprise adoption? No, why do they actively insinuate big news is coming by writing things like \u201cXRP markets began to connect the dots once again?\u201d+ What are Ripple\u2019s insider trading policies with respect to XRP? Are any employees or advisors paid in XRP? If so, what are the terms?It might seem annoying to pester the company like this, and indeed it would be more convenient to approach their marketing team\u200a\u2014\u200awho is doubling as investor relations, but we can\u2019t call it that\u200a\u2014\u200ato answer these questions in private.But the company is managing a \u201cbridge currency\u201d that they package to retail investors, who buy on the assumption that they are front-running big bank purchasers.That makes this a public conversation. How about an analyst call, Brad?****Note: I hope they will sit down with a real journalist soon and answer macro questions about their policies. A good interviewer wouldn\u2019t let them off the hook because \u201cconfidentiality agreements.\u201d NDAs prevent a company from discussing specific deals. They do not preclude you from discussing general distribution strategy.

China\u2019s crypto ban in late 2017 resulted in the boom of underground traders known as \u201cbitcoin mules\u201d. These traders buys cryptocurrencies in other markets (such as Thailand or Japan) and sells them at a premium to investors in China, who cannot otherwise get them. Aside from the geographical arbitrage, the traders also exploit lesser known exchanges by buying cryptocurrencies cheaply on lesser-known exchanges and selling them for a profit on more liquid and widely used platforms. With the downturn in recent crypto markets combined with the flood of traders in the space, the premium for crypto has fallen from 30\u201340% at its height to around 7% or so.

My wallet said the transaction was successful, but no transaction ID was provided to me. When I looked on the exchange, there was no pending transaction either. At the time, the coins that vanished without a trace were worth approximately $1200.I was not the only person to encounter this issue. I assume 25% of Ripple deposits failed last night, but I could be wrong there. Lots of folks posted about similar instances on the /r/Ripple community as well.So what happened?According to the ToastWallet creator, one of Ripple\u2019s servers, s2.ripple.com was experiencing issues and was down. It looks like my transaction went to this server, and that\u2019s why my coins went missing.The Ripple network did not re-route my request to the other 3 available servers: s1, s3, & s4.ripple.com. Instead, it waited for s2 to become available again and process the missing transactions. Ripple informed my wallet that the transaction was successful, but I had no transaction ID and I couldn\u2019t see evidence of the transaction anywhere. It was as if the coins, and my money, just vanished.At the time, the exchange told me that this was not their issue to resolve. The developer of the wallet told me the same thing, but he was able to tell me about s2 being down and I was able to confirm by visiting s2.ripple.com. It displayed an error regarding the ledger.There was no public statement from Ripple about the network issues.There was no public statement from the Binance exchange about the network issues, although they did tell me when I opened the ticket that they disabled withdrawals (but I had issues with depositing) in order to try to stabalize the Ripple network.Here\u2019s what should have happened:Statements from Ripple & all exchanges about network congestion.2. The Ripple network should have either rejected my request because s2 was down and asked me to try again, or re-routed to one of the available networks. It should not have informed my wallet that the transaction was successful.There\u2019s still no statement from Ripple about last night\u2019s issues, or from the exchanges.I understand the risks of trading on an unregulated market, and I was only involved this weekend out of curiosity to see what it was like. Exchanges are not new technology, and having a pool of available servers, marking one server down, and re-routing traffic is a very basic concept. Most online companies with web servers do this.My coins finally showed up 9 hours later, once s2.ripple.com had recovered and I was able to sell and get out. If you do a quick Google search for \u201cXRP coins missing\u201d you\u2019ll see this has happened before.The above issue has happened lots of other folks on other cryptocurrency networks in the past.

It brought the Ripple Effect as a form of touch feedback, doing away with fully opaque selectors, but omitted an easy way to customize both the ripple and background color via xml attributes. I built the CustomRippleView library to create a seamless ripple customization starting with the TextView.The ripple is clever design because it buys time for an event to occur. The user\u2019s attention shifts to the button to gauge if the event is happening, and not to the operation itself. The effect produces perceived performance of a system. Also, it mimics nature; anyone seeing such a ripple would expect the ripple to dissipate naturally. It\u2019s a powerful concept, unfortunately relegated to trivial, but that is false. The best companies care about these details, not because they have the resources, but because beauty, aesthetics, form and function all matter in the end.See the Quick Implementation section directly below to quickly add the CustomRippleView to your app, and/or read on for more on how it is built.Quick ImplementationDeclare the library in gradle and call the desired files.build.gradle (app module)compile 'com.ebay.customrippleview:customrippleview:1.1'Define the rippleColor and backgroundColor attributes. If you don\u2019t specify the attributes below the view will use the default value of gray.recycler_headercell.xmlRetroRecycler Sample App (API level > 21, left and API level < 21,\u00a0right)How Custom Ripple View Is\u00a0MadeI built a library in order to implement custom ripples by adjusting 2 attributes in the XML layout. To implement the custom ripple effect for the type of view desired, create a custom view and extend the desired view type. I implemented this with the RippleTextView to start. There\u2019s a myriad of views the ripple effect would be useful for. Code contributions to the GitHub project are welcome!Alternative SolutionsPrior to this library one could implement a default gray ripple using a background or foreground xml attribute, create numerous drawable xmls for customization, or define a style to a view.Background or Foreground XMLThe downside here is the inability to customize the background or ripple.android:background=\"?attr/selectableItemBackground\"android:foreground=\"?attr/selectableItemBackground\"orandroid:background=\"?attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless\"android:foreground=\"?attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless\"and android:clickable=\"true\"DrawablesBy building drawables you have the customization, but it takes more time and creates more resources than needed.API Level 21API Pre 21Selector in normal stateSelector in pressed stateStyleSetting a view\u2019s style is almost as quick as using this library and achieves the custom ripple effect.Set the ripple effect with the background attribute. I just discovered the foreground attribute and am updating this post. You should also be able to set the effect with the foreground attribute, but I have not implemented this yet to ensure it will work.Define the custom ripple color with the colorControlHighlight attribute. For some reason, this attribute needs to be called from a separate style in order to work.Behind The Scenes: Custom Ripple\u00a0ViewCreating a Custom View\u200a\u2014\u200aStep 1 of\u00a04Create a Custom View extending the type of View you\u2019d like to implement the Ripple Effect on.

Graph credit: Andy\u00a0PatelEnter @XRPTrumpRyan Selkis\u2019 Twitter account had been hacked the previous day. Two days prior to that, Laura Shin tweeted a link to an episode of her podcast (Unchained) where she was joined by Ryan and Matt Leising:This was my first experience observing the XRP Army on the attack. To get a better sense of what that entails, I would encourage you to scroll through the replies to Laura\u2019s tweet (there are hundreds!). I have included a few of those replies below:On May 10th, 2018, Ryan shared some thoughts re: XRP/Ripple:Ripple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, replied (almost immediately) with this tweet:Ryan\u2019s Twitter account was hacked at some point later that day. Given the timing, I can totally understand why he would suspect that XRP was behind this attack:Intrigued, I decided to acclimate myself with the XRP Army:Later in the thread I highlighted 100+ accounts which contain \u201cXRP\u201d or \u201cRipple\u201d in their usernames:XRP-supporting accounts chimed in with questions about the graph/data and to state they know some/most of the accounts:I would soon learn that two core members of the XRP Army/community are @haydentiff and @XRPTrump. Despite my best efforts, members of the XRP Army have always twisted my words.Fortunately, it seemed that @XRPTrump\u200a\u2014\u200aan anonymous account which is highly knowledgeable re: XRP/Ripple \u2014was (finally) interpreting my words based on what had actually been stated:I was encouraged by the change in their tone (see below tweet) and opted to continue the discussion via Twitter DM:The Calm Before The\u00a0StormLater that same day, @XRPTrump suggested that I \u201c[come] forward with a list of people that [I am] confident [are] bots and share with Tiffany [@haydentiff] and [him] privately\u201d (side note: between May 11th and Jul 14th, 2018, I traded quite a few DMs with @XRPTrump; discussion was always civil):That exchange took place while my Twitter account was getting bombarded by the XRP Army (for tweeting this graph and data earlier that day). Hence, I was in no rush to identify/share accounts with @XRPTrump (even privately) which I was confident were fake/bot accounts, as I wanted to halt the attack (rather than prolong it).Instead, I would later share a handful accounts with @XRPTrump, which, to me, appeared suspicious. I never stated that I was confident they were bots, although the XRP Army would later twist my words (they love to gaslight!).Two of those accounts\u200a\u2014\u200anamely, @Ripple_Expert (username has since been changed to @California_luve) and @xrptips (58.6K followers)\u200a\u2014\u200awere presented to @XRPTrump on May 15th, 2018:@Ripple_Expert had a substantial following (23.2K followers) and only followed 171 accounts. One of those accounts happened to be @XRPTrump:@Ripple_Expert has since changed their username to @California_luve; screenshot from May 15th, 2018; at that time, @XRPTrump was one of 171 accounts being followed by @Ripple_ExpertWhen asked, @XRPTrump stated they were not familiar with @Ripple_Expert, yet they engaged with the account (@California_luve below) on Jan 26th, 2018:Above @XRPTrump likes a tweet from @California_luveAlthough @XRPTrump wasn\u2019t quite to the point where they were ready to acknowledge the presence of fake/bot accounts, they certainly appeared to be warming up to the idea:In fact, on July 13th, 2018, @XRPTrump even shared two accounts which they referred to as being \u201cvery dodgy\u201d:I didn\u2019t actively pursue proving to @XRPTrump (or others from the XRP Army/community) that there are large numbers of fake/bot accounts which support XRP/Ripple, because, frankly, it requires lots of work.About 6 weeks ago, however, something happened that compelled me to finally take on this task.Enter @JoelKatzOn Jul 14th, 2018 (the day after @XRPTrump shared what he referred to as two \u201cvery dodgy\u201d accounts with me), I resurfaced some older tweets, retweeting the previously mentioned graph and data tweets.Immediately, @haydentiff\u200a\u2014\u200awho was following my account at the time\u200a\u2014\u200areplied to the (two-month) old thread with the following:Note the surge of (fake) followers above @haydentiff\u2019s reply/retweetWithin minutes, my Twitter account was being hit with fake followers. Given the timing, I (naturally) suspected the XRP Army was behind it. Shortly thereafter, I went ahead and shared what was happening with a friend, Mike Dudas, who I knew similarly has had his fair share of dealings with the XRP Army.When I next grabbed my phone, I noticed there were a ton of Twitter notifications. After seeing this tweet from Mike, it all made sense (side note: thanks for throwing me under the bus, Dudas!):Tweet from @mdudas on July 14th,\u00a02018Ripple\u2019s CTO, @JoelKatz, who is very active on Twitter, joined the discussion this go-around. On the one hand, David expressed cynicism re: XRP/Ripple fake/bot Twitter accounts (\u201cseems like a crazy conspiracy theory to me\u201d); on the other hand, he didn\u2019t rule out the possibility (\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that some number of fake/bot accounts exist\u201d):David was kind enough to agree to a silly little bet I proposed: if I can prove that XRP/Ripple fake/bot accounts exist, then he has to change his profile image to a robot (if I can\u2019t, then I have to change mine to the XRP logo)Thanks to @XRPTrump for the suggestion (re: @GiantGox)!Profile of @GiantGox (August 26th,\u00a02018)Dissecting @GiantGoxBefore we jump into the network graph, let me explain what we\u2019ll be reviewing.When the data was collected (July 21st, 2018), @GiantGox was following ~19K accounts and had ~36K followers. Each dot/node in the graph represents an account which was following and/or was being followed by @GiantGox at that time. Most accounts which were being followed by @GiantGox were also following @GiantGox (there were ~3K accounts followed by @GiantGox which were not following back).To refresh your memory, here\u2019s the network graph representation of Twitter accounts connected to @GiantGox (graph contains 39,131 nodes/accounts; first includes edges, second does not):Network graph representation of Twitter accounts connected to @GiantGox.

What Is\u00a0Ripple?As per ripple.com\u00a0:Ripple connects banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges and corporate via RippleNet to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally.Ripple is quite different from other cryptocurrencies as it doesn\u2019t have its own public blockchain. Internally, the XRP Ledger network runs on an internal blockchain which they call an \u201cEnterprise blockchain\u201d ledger, it doesn\u2019t use proof-of-work and little else is known about it.Ripple functions like RTGS and is a digital currency exchange developed by Ripple company\u00a0. Ripple was released officially in 2012 with an intent to enable instant & secure financial transactions of any size with no chargeback. It is currently a world third largest digital currency.Is Ripple More Like a\u00a0Bitcoin:Ripple does share some technical similarities with bitcoin but it is quite different from it. Like many digital currencies it uses cryptography to secure transactions, but it doesn\u2019t actually have a public blockchain like Bitcoin or Litecoin. And it came into existence to mainly transform the payment transfer system, for the purpose of sending instant and secure transactions across network participants and that what is more known for.Ripple is more like payment system, remittance network, and currency exchange & now Ripple has built its network that includes its own cryptocurrency Ripple, or XRP.RTXP:Ripple Transaction Protocol or simply we can call Ripple Payment Protocol uses distributed open source Internet Protocol, consensus ledger & native crypto called XRP(Ripples). Ripples circles around shared database or public ledger which uses a consensus mechanism to allow payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.The goal of the ripple system, according to its official web portal, is to enable people to break free of the \u201cwalled gardens\u201d of financial networks\u200a\u2014\u200aie, credit cards, banks, PayPal and other institutions that restrict access with fees, charges for currency exchanges and processing delays.How Ripple Works\u00a0?sourceLet\u2019s understand its working mechanism through simple example. Here Sender will send $=500 To the Receiver, Both parties involved in transaction lives in a different city.Where,Sender =Jim, Receiver = Rony\u00a0, Senders Side Agent = Krish, Receiver Side Agent= Tim.Jim gives Krish the money to send to Rony with a transaction password that Rony is required to answer correctly to receive the amount. Krish alerts Rony\u2019s agent, Tim about the transaction details- of amount of funds to be transferred to Rony and the required password to be validated at Rony\u2019s side by him. Here rony has to respond with the right password, then only Tim will release the fund from his side\u00a0. Once Rony does so he gets the required amount. But here Krish owes $500 to Tim\u00a0. Tim can record a journal of Krish\u2019s Debt or IOUs which Krish would pay on the agreed date or can make immediate counter transactions to balance out the debt he owe to Tim.This explanation would have given you some basic idea of how ripple transaction systems work. The key here is that there is a trust based mechanism working here between sender, receiver, and the local agents involved as security agentsWhat the original Ripple project sought to accomplish is effectively the democratization of this idea: everyone can be their own bank, issuing, accepting and acting as a conduit for loans all at the same time.Ripples Use Case\u00a0:Let\u2019s Discuss its Use Case Sector Wise\u00a0:Image Source1.

By upgrading existing infrastructure, Ripple increases end-to-end processing efficiencies and can ultimately allow banks to make new business models economically viable through lower costs.They claim 60% cost savings for an average payment size of $500. That can be the reasons most of the global banks are adopting their solution.Some of them\u00a0are:SantanderAxis BankYes BankWestpacUnion CreditNBADUBS& Many More\u00a0..Ripples Current Market Details: (Source Ripple.com)Market Cap - $47.13 Billion\u00a0USDCurrent Price (As of 15 Dec\u00a02017):XRP /USD = 0.73314Ledger Close Time - 3.33\u00a0SecondsNetwork Transaction Fee\u200a\u2014\u200a$0.0000561 USDTransactions Per Seconds\u200a\u2014\u200a13.36 /1000+\u00a0TPSSome of my other Technical Stuff which can be of your interest\u00a0:NLP Fundamentals: Where Humans Team Up With Machines To Help It SpeakGetting Started With Kotlin Language\u00a0: A Beginners GuideGetting Started With Android & Kotlin\u00a0: A Kickstarter GuideGetting Started With Node.js\u00a0: A Beginners GuideAll About Node.Js You Wanted To Know\u00a0?A Guide to MVP: Minimum Viable ProductReferences\u00a0:https://ripple.comBitcoin.orghttps://coincentral.comhttps://coinranking.com/Keep Investing Also, If You Can Take Some Time Out To Appreciate \ud83d\udc9a\u00a0\ud83d\udc9a:It Will Really Inspire, \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f Clap & Click Here to subscribe & hear more from\u00a0me.For More Such Artciles You Can Also Check Out My Personal Blog\u00a0:http://www.techprenuer.com/Thanks for your valuable\u00a0time\u2026", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "Former Ripple VP Brian Rankin Assumes Role as Modern Finance Chain\u2019s VP of Banking Integrations, Senior\u00a0Advisor", "author_name": "Modern Finance Chain", "link": "https://medium.com/@mfchain/former-ripple-vp-brian-rankin-assumes-role-as-modern-finance-chains-vp-of-banking-integrations-dc5f77a50d4f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 12, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "2.7K", "content": "Former Ripple VP Brian Rankin Assumes Role as Modern Finance Chain\u2019s VP of Banking Integrations, Senior\u00a0AdvisorModern Finance ChainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 12, 2018MFChain is pleased to announce the addition of Brian Rankin as Senior Advisor, VP of Banking Integration for Modern Finance Chain. Brian Rankin, technology operations and client services specialist in blockchain and distributed ledgers and a former VP of Clients Services at Ripple (XRP), led the original Ripple\u2019s 21-person international team that includes project management, business architecture, integration engineering, and customer success. He built Ripple\u2019s professional services team from the ground up, leading enterprise delivery of blockchain solutions to Tier-1/2/3 multinational banks across NAM, EMEA, and APAC.Rankin was also a Head of the Global Payments Steering Group (GPSG), a consortium composed of Tier-1 Multinational banks focused on redefining an international cross-border payments network as an alternative to the SWIFT payments network. The group, under his leadership, leveraged blockchain technologies to reduce correspondent banking relationships and allow near-real-time cryptographically validated settlements.As the VP in Ripple, Rankin established delivery best practices and built a customer-oriented PMO, created SOW and MSA templates based on blockchain LOE, and best practices for technical, legal, compliance, infosec, and functional standard requirements in the financial services sector. He also partnered with Sales and Business Development Divisions to implement deals with strategic FinTech partners including Accenture, CGI and Deloitte.\u201cMFChain will greatly benefit from Rankin\u2019s extended experience in integration of blockchain solutions in FinTech industry,\u201d says Craig Neil, MFChain CEO, and adds that, \u201cBrian\u2019s key qualifications and expertise in implementations of distributed ledgers in traditional FinTech operations will further ensure timely and effective integration of a wide array of MFChain\u2019s financial products.\u201d", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "Why Ripple Is Causing The Integrity Of The Media To Go Down in\u00a0Flames", "author_name": "Tiffany Hayden", "link": "https://medium.com/@haydentiff/why-ripple-is-causing-the-integrity-of-the-media-to-go-down-in-flames-88f952e5928e?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 11, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "782", "content": "Why Ripple Is Causing The Integrity Of The Media To Go Down in\u00a0FlamesTiffany HaydenBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 11, 2018A revision of \u201cWhy the Hot Cryptocurrency Ripple is Going Down in Flames.\u201d\u201cRipple allows everyone to participate in the global economy.\u201d Everyone.Ripple\u2019s dramatic price increase\u2014 a staggering 33,000% over a one year time period\u200a\u2014\u200aoffers a stark reminder to investors and speculators: Not all news sources are the same.The stratospheric rise of bitcoin over the past year has brought along a number of so-called \u201cwriters.\u201d Many of these hobbyist bloggers claim to offer readers in-depth insight into advanced technology, like Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, even though they are personally benefiting from the Bitcoin/Ethereum crazed narrative they create.But amid the broad sellout of journalists in recent months, XRP\u2019s ascent has been nothing short of breathtaking. While the price has recently dropped after a sudden spike, it hasn\u2019t caused anywhere near as much drama as the 234 obituaries hiding under Bitcoin\u2019s belt.Ripple\u2019s token, XRP, which had been trading at around $0.006 this time last year, now hovers at around $2.00.\u201cThere is limited upside in Ripple,\u201d argued Alexander Kravets, a guy who has not known about cryptocurrency for a full year yet.Why Is Ripple\u00a0Rising?Reason #1: Decentralization. Rather than naively view centralization/decentralization as binary, Ripple recognizes that decentralization can take many forms and likely resembles more of a spectrum than a dichotomy. \u201cThe view that something is either decentralized or centralized is harmful and draws attention away from what we should actually care about\u200a\u2014\u200ato what extent particular systems have particular beneficial characteristics,\u201d said David Schwartz, Chief Cryptographer at Ripple. Schwartz said making massive progress on decentralization in 2018 is his number one priority. Accordingly, Ripple recently released their Decentralization Strategy Update.Reason #2: There was a change in how prices are calculated. The crypto exchange Coinmarketcap.com made a change this week, excluding many Korean exchanges from its price calculations. Previously, CMC did not reflect what U.S. holders could actually sell for, and that caused a lot of confusion. The new price is more accurate and meaningful.Reason #3: XRP\u2019s appeal to businesses is strengthening. After announcing that three of the top five money transfer companies worldwide will be implementing Ripple\u2019s XRP token in their payment flow systems this year, Ripple and MoneyGram announced they had partnered.\u201cMoneyGram is the latest example of Ripple\u2019s masterful cadence of announcements of deals with large companies,\u201d said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital.Oliver Isaacs, cryptocurrency investor and influencer, proclaimed that Ripple is \u201cgaining momentum.\u201d He spoke to the digital currency\u2019s growing visibility, stating:\u201cEvery cryptocurrency investor and hedge fund I have spoken to have asked me about Ripple\u2019s potential in the market.\u201d.Tiffany Hayden", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "Ripple effect in React\u00a0Native", "author_name": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Ot\u00e1hal", "link": "https://medium.com/react-native-motion/ripple-effect-in-react-native-1cb0ad568e91?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 16, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "407", "content": "Ripple effect in React\u00a0NativeJi\u0159\u00ed Ot\u00e1halBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 16, 2017Here\u2019s a tutorial how to make ripple effect for Material Design\u2019s Icon Button.

No. Because there could be a situation when user presses the button for a longer time. Then we need scale animation to run first and wait for onPressOut event that runs opacity animation. It\u2019s exactly how the icon button\u2019s ripple effect works. I simulated that with red star icon in the last example above.Let\u2019s code\u00a0\u2026First of all, we\u2019ll create blank page for this example. Then we\u2019ll create IconToggle component and the ripple effect animation. Finally, we\u2019ll make some correlation.Now, we have a view with Toolbar which is known from Material Design by Google. The Toolbar is not a goal of this tutorial, so we took it from react-native-material-ui library. Then, we put the IconToggle components and implement it in the following Gist.Again, we took Icon component from react-native-material-ui. So, we have something like this. And now, the animation.Let\u2019s animate\u00a0\u2026On lines 14 and 15 we created two Animated.Values. One of them for scale animation and second for opacity animation. We pass them to Animated.View via its props. The scale animation begins inside of onPressedIn function, that is fired after user presses icon. It starts from 0.01 (not zero) because there is an issue in React Native. Later, when user releases the button, the opacity animation will start. It doesn\u2019t matter if the scale animation is still running or not. After the opacity animation is done, we need Animated.Values to be set to init values (line 34). That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole ripple effect.In this code, we just added a colour for icon and ripple effect. Look at line 12 and 18. We would like to use native thread for Android platform because then the animation doesn\u2019t block the JS thread. In real application we\u2019ll probably fire onPress callback and there will be another code to run. We don\u2019t want to block it, so it\u2019s better to use native thread for animation.Last word\u00a0\u2026You can find the whole code in my github account. Note that it\u2019s not ready for production. For this purpose you can use react-native-material-ui that I\u2019m developing as an open source and using it for our booking system created in Reservio.com.", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "Where Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, And Other Cryptocurrencies Be Twenty Years From\u00a0Now?", "author_name": "Forbes", "link": "https://medium.com/forbes/where-will-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-and-other-cryptocurrencies-be-twenty-years-from-now-27763f5f0cbf?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 5, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "Where Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, And Other Cryptocurrencies Be Twenty Years From\u00a0Now?ForbesBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 5, 2018(Photo Illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images)By Panos MourdoukoutasBitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies have been on a roller coaster lately.

The Ripple coin (XRP) currently trades at 78 cents per token and has the third largest market cap in cryptocurrencies (following Bitcoin and Ether). Ripple is a big deal, but at one point it was even bigger.During a brief period in January 2018, Ripple\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman, Chris Larsen, had $59.9B in Ripple tokens, more money on the blockchain than Mark Zuckerberg had in Facebook shares. His Ripple holdings also briefly made Larsen the 5th richest man in the world as Ripple prices surged more than 30,000% in a year.Larsen was richer than the founders of Google.How Ripple Became a SensationRipple was actually created in 2004 by Ryan Fugger (then called Ripplepay) to be a peer-to-peer payment network that centered around debt and was in essence a network of imaginary credit lines. Ripple\u2019s founding in 2004 makes it older than Bitcoin, which Satoshi Nakamoto first dreamed up in 2009.While Ripple showed some adoption in its early years, it was inherently limited in scale by its centralized network (in which you had to be invited in by someone already in the network) and so Ripple never entered mainstream conversations until 2012 when Ripple decided to revamp its business. Enter the A-list management:Jed McCaleb\u200a\u2014\u200aa programmer responsible for the creation of the first Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, one bound to infamy with a hack of 850k stolen Bitcoin before Mt. Gox\u2019s dissolution forever marring its nameChris Larsen\u200a\u2014\u200aa serial entrepreneur, the co-founder of E-Loan, an online mortgage lender, and Prosper, a peer-to-peer lender.Together, Larsen and McCaleb envisioned Ripple tokens to be a replacement to Bitcoin, a replacement that was faster and more efficient with its transactions as all of the Ripple tokens are pre-mined. According to the Ripple website, Ripple can settle payments in 4 seconds, compared to 2 minutes for Ethereum, over an hour for Bitcoin, and 3\u20135 days for traditional systems.In total 100 billion Ripple coins were created when the Ripple network we know today launched in 2012, but the powers that be at Ripple decided not to release all of the tokens to the public at once, but instead to release fractions of the hoard over time. Larsen and McCaleb kept 20 billion coins for themselves, and the rest went to the company. To date, Ripple still holds nearly 50 billion Ripple in escrow.However, the XRP token is only a fraction of Ripple\u2019s business. The buzziest element of Ripple, and its true appeal, is not its token, but its business. RippleNet is an open-source software that enables money transfers between wallets globally. The Ripple token is just one of many currencies that can be transferred through RippleNet.Revolutionary? Not quite. But it is efficient across international borders, which is what caught the eye of the banks, including Santander and American Express, among a hundred or so others. However, it\u2019s worth noting that banks can use RippleNet without actually using XRP tokens, which is a fact that is lost on many investors. Speaking of investors\u2026The lawsuit that could unravel RippleOn May 3rd 2018, Ryan Coffey filed a class action suit against Ripple. Ryan is an investor who purchased Ripple at $2.60 as an investment when the token was exploding in value in January 2018. Coffey lost $585 when he sold his Ripple tokens at $1.30.You could argue so what? Who cares that an investor lost $500. This is a small amount, and investors lose money all the time. What\u2019s the fuss? Usually, you\u2019d be right that the story ends here because the old adage \u201cinvestor beware\u201d holds true to this day. Losing money on an investment is par for the course in the speculation of early-stage companies. If every investment was guaranteed to not lose money or investors would get their money back, then there would be no sellers; there would only be buyers.What is unusual about this situation and this particular class action suit is Coffey\u2019s claim that Ripple sold unregistered securities to investors. That is fraud, if true. With this kind of claim, an ordinary investor can easily go to court and be made whole with their losses. Because this is a class action suit, it in theory represents all of the U.S. based investors who purchased Ripple.This can amount to billions of dollars in claims that investors can ask the company to repay. This would demolish Ripple and its founders, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse (McCaleb left Ripple and started Stellar, and Larsen is now the executive chairman after stepping down as CEO last year). This lawsuit names others with the ambition to sue every single person in the Ripple food chain, including those who marketed it to investors.According to the lawsuit, the suit \u201carises out of a scheme by Defendants to raise hundreds of millions of dollars through the unregistered sale of XRP to retail investors in violation of the registration provisions of state and federal securities laws.\u201dThe lawsuit further alleges that the \u201cDefendants have since earned massive profits by quietly selling off this XRP to the general public, in what is essentially a never-ending initial coin offering.\u201d The lawsuit goes on to use Ripple\u2019s attempts to bribe exchanges to list XRP as well as their conflation of XRP with RippleNet as further evidence of misleading investors and attempts to inflate the price of XRP, which is directly tied to the amount of money Ripple Labs brings in.Since Coffey (and likely the majority of XRP investors) purchased the tokens with reasonable expectations of profit, and Ripple Labs itself marketed XRP as a promising investment, then XRP is indeed a security to the eyes of the SEC.If Coffey\u2019s lawsuit succeeds, this is a serious blow to the crypto industry. Not only does it beg the question of how many cryptocurrencies are actually securities, but it also means that every exchange that listed XRP is in trouble unless they are an exchange registered with the SEC or a broker dealer using an ATS. Hint: that is zero of the exchanges that list XRP.As the clamor for regulation grows, this lawsuit could very well be the tipping point that changes the name of the game for crypto and cleans the house of unregistered exchanges.

Yesterday it became known that the large American investment bank JPMorgan in the next few months will begin testing its own digital currency\u200a\u2014\u200aJPM Coin.JPMorgan makes daily transfers of more than 6 trillion dollars worldwide. It is expected that a small part of settlements between customers of the bank\u2019s payment unit will be carried out using JPM Coin.The investment bank is gradually creating a foundation for the transition to the future, where all cross-border payments will be carried out using blockchain technology. However, in order for such a future to come, banks must create an appropriate infrastructure that will allow making payments with lightning speed. In such a reality, there will be no room for old technologies, such as electronic money.In a conversation with the CNBC channel, the head of the blockchain development department at JPMorgan Umar Farooq identified 3 main areas of application of bank tokens: international payments with the ability to instantly make payments that are made between large corporate clients; operations with securities, which will minimize the time lag between the settlement of the transaction and its payment; and the replacement of dollars that are at the disposal of the divisions of corporations that use the services of JPMorgan stores.\u201cMoney sloshes back and forth all over the world in a large enterprise,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cIs there a way to ensure that a subsidiary can represent cash on the balance sheet without having to actually wire it to the unit? That way, they can consolidate their money and probably get better rates for it.\u201dJPM Coin is a stablecoin provided by the US dollar. Clients will receive this token immediately after the payment of fiat money to the bank. Once all the calculations have been completed successfully, JPMorgan will burn JPM Coin and return the corresponding amount of fiat dollars to the deposit to the owner. According to preliminary data, access to the token can be obtained only by tested large institutional clients, for example, corporations, banks, and broker-dealers.Faruk also admits that it is likely that in future the bank will be used to perform settlements between devices connected to the Internet:\u201cBut we can talk about this after the application of the blockchain technology is finally tested, and we will be sure that this direction is promising\u201d.Recall that the head of JPMorgan Jamie Dimon has relatively recently been one of the most ardent opponents of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. However, he subsequently stated that he regretted the past negative comments about Bitcoin.Today JPMorgan is not only one of the main supporters of cryptocurrency technologies but is actively involved in the development of this area. A week ago, JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said that the cryptocurrency market had gone through a \u201cbubble\u201d phase and looked quite reliable.Is JPM Coin Serious Competition for\u00a0Ripple?The launch of JPMorgan, the financial giant\u2019s own digital asset, has sparked fierce discussions in the international crypto sector. Some experts see a great opportunity in this step, other prominent voices such as the CEO of Ripple sees the project is not sustainable.Already In 2016, four major banks entered into a cooperation agreement to launch the Utility Settlement Coin, a digital asset designed to streamline cross-border transactions, reduce fees and speed up processing of remittances. UBS presented the idea too, among others, Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon. NEX, Barclays, CIBC, Credit Suisse, HSBC, and MUFG are also on board. The test phase was already started in the middle of last year, but only a few results have been leaked to daylight.Ripple boss, Brad Garlinghouse, sees bank-issued digital assets as an unrealistic and misguided solution for the industry. In an article on his LinkedIn profile, Garlinghouse explains why bank-sponsored cryptocurrencies are doomed to failure. Here are two different scenarios conceivable:\u201cA bank-issued digital asset can only really efficiently settle between the banks who issued it. Then, two scenarios can play out. Scenario one: all banks around the world put aside competitive and geopolitical differences, adopt the same digital asset, agree on its rules, and harmoniously govern its usage. Fat chance. Scenario two (the more likely scenario): banks not in the issuing group issue their own digital assets with their own sets of rules and governance.We\u2019re kinda seeing this already, as the FT points out, with Citi\u2019s Citicoin and Goldman Sachs\u2019 SETLcoin. The result would be an even more fragmented currency landscape than what we have today. If banks of different digital asset groups want to settle trades with one another, they\u2019ll have to make markets between their unique digital assets or trade between their digital assets and a common fiat currency. What a mess!The second big problem with the \u2018utility settlement coin\u2019 is it seems it\u2019ll be backed by a basket of currencies. Once backed by cash, it\u2019s no longer an asset; it\u2019s a liability. Trading liabilities then ultimately requires moving cash across borders, re-creating today\u2019s system but adding more friction!\u201dIf each bank launches its own digital asset to handle payments across the globe, over time it could create a wealth of new currencies that flood the market. Ripple tries to prevent this and therefore provides an infrastructure that can be used easily and quickly by any financial institution worldwide:\u201cWe strongly believe banks need an independent digital asset to enable truly efficient settlement and we believe XRP is best positioned for that role. It goes back to the fundamentals of what makes digital assets unique and special\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re universal currencies, meaning anyone can use them as units of value anywhere in the world. That universality gives digital assets global reach and the ability to settle much faster than traditional assets.Compared head to head with other independent digital assets (like Bitcoin or Ether), XRP settles the most efficiently cross-border, in just seconds. In fact, we\u2019ve run tests with global banks to prove XRP can lower liquidity costs for cross-border trades.\u201dAuthor: Marko Vidrih@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

It hasn\u2019t been necessary to have a specific good and trade it for some other specific good for a long time. For most of written history, there were only two types of currency: fiat or commodity. Fiat currencies have been the dominant currency since the 1970s, when the US ended the Bretton Woods system and abandoned the gold standard.Fiat currencies are great because they don\u2019t require physical commodity reserves and countries can control their own money supply. Currencies can be valued constantly against each other in floating exchanges. As for integrity and widespread implementation, governments are generally trustworthy and are a central regulating force that ensures transactions are fair, accurate, and not manipulated.Today, with the advent of cheap computing power and networked systems (i.e., the Internet), there is a new contender to the currency game. The new guy to disrupt the duopoly of currency is the cryptocurrency. These are Bitcoin and its peers that have only become feasible in the last twenty years or so.You can track personalised news for these cryptocurrencies on our award-winning platform CityFALCON here.What Cryptocurrencies are, and their\u00a0benefitsCryptocurrencies exist only in computers. This shouldn\u2019t scare you, though, because the majority of most fiat currencies also only exist as numbers in a computer system. They require distributed systems to ensure integrity and reliability, and they can be a good alternative to national currencies. They are, in the simplest terms, digital records held by many parties that track how much currency any single wallet holds.Some of the benefits of cryptocurrencies include decentralisation, deregulation, anonymity, increased transaction transparency, and the facilitation of cross-border trade. Cryptocurrencies are not based in any single country or jurisdiction, because the ledgers and servers are spread out over the globe. Since there is no central bank, the system is distributed and therefore not easily manipulated either by large institutions or by governments. This means there is little regulation and more freedom on who spends how much on what and where. This benefit is enhanced by the fact that there is less private information attached to each transaction. There are even cryptocurrencies whose main goal is to provide an untraceable, secure, and anonymous means of payment.Payments are transparent because every transaction can be verified by anyone. This means fraud is more difficult because there are many copies of the transaction record available for anyone to see. Furthermore, everyone knows how much every wallet contains (though real names are not included). The public balances come from the way in which balances are implemented in the technology.As for cross-border trade, since cryptocurrencies are non-national, anyone can pay anyone anywhere without needing to convert currencies. This raises interesting questions on conversion and payments, as owning 1 BTC (Bitcoin\u2019s currency symbol) in France and owning 1 BTC in Thailand are not the same. If converted to a local currency, it means much different buying power in the two host countries.How they\u00a0workThere is a distributed ledger or a publicly viewable list of transactions. Since they are distributed, there is more than one copy (there are actually a lot of copies). There are \u201cminers\u201d, who are like the keepers of the system.Whenever a transaction is made, the keepers of the system broadcast the transaction to everyone. The transaction is placed in a pool of pending transactions, whose order of addition to the chain is determined by competing miners. Participants choose a transaction and solve a math problem linking it to the last recorded transaction. Whichever miner can solve their problem first gets to add their transaction to the end of the chain, effectively determining a unique order.If two miners finish different blocks at the same time, the blockchain branches. Each node keeps its own copy of the transaction set and works from that. Once the next block is solved, all nodes switch to the transaction set used by the last solve.Since transactions are simply messages with the sender, receiver, and an amount, it is essential that all transactions are signed. This is completed using the sending wallet\u2019s private key, and the signature is unique for each transaction, so it cannot be duplicated. Furthermore, a message cannot be altered or the resulting signature will no longer be valid. Even more, since transactions are lumped together in blocks, if one transaction changes, the hash output of the entire block changes, and hence doesn\u2019t link correctly with the next block\u200a\u2014\u200ai.e., it is not possible to modify blocks undetected.Balances are not stored in the system, but they are based on previous transactions (basically add prior transactions A + B +\u00a0\u2026 to determine if you have enough for transaction 1). This requires that \u201cunspent\u201d transactions be added every time one wants to send money, but it does not require the processing of the entire blockchain (that would be rather inefficient).Where does Cryptocurrency get its\u00a0valueLike fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. They\u2019re just numbers stored on a system somewhere, much like the way modern digital banking treats national currencies. Fiat currencies then derive their value from the collective faith of a society using them. If A believes B will accept USD, then A will accept USD for whatever they want to trade, too. B will only accept USD if s/he thinks C will also take USD, and from this collective faith, the value of USD arises.Cryptocurrencies are similar. They are only worth as much as everyone deems them to be worth. One advantage for national fiat currencies is that a central authority issues and regulates them, and one can generally trust the government in this regard. Furthermore, governments require that taxes be paid, and they will usually only accept their own currency for this. Hence, to be a citizen of a country, one must deal with the national currency. This is a good basis to simply use the same currency for every transaction within the country.Major Price Gains (and a major adoption\u00a0event)One major reason for the generally increasing value of cryptocurrencies is more widespread interest. While cryptocurrencies may not be prevalent, they do have a following on the Internet, and many people will ask for cryptocurrencies donations or payments. If the demand for such currencies increases faster than units are added the price will rise.Looking at the charts of the four largest cryptocurrencies after conversion to USD, it looks like there has been a significant increase recently in all four (not all the same scale, as these are the lifetime charts). This is a phenomenon that is clear in 2017.Fears over capital restrictions and government spying may be pushing up the price. A renewed interested in privacy, especially after the Snowden leaks, might be a reason. The increasingly watchful eye of Big Data by both Google et al. and the banks and credit card companies may be a reason. The wider general acceptance is almost certainly a reason.Chart Source: Highcharts.comChart Source: Highcharts.comChart Source: Highcharts.comChart Source: Highcharts.comGovernment Acceptance?This acceptance extends to governments. Most notably, Japan, a market highly accepting of innovative technologies, recognised Bitcoin on April 1st, 2017. It is also set to standardise blockchain technology. This acceptance by the world\u2019s third largest economy is a huge boon to cryptocurrencies. There is a clear uptrend for the four largest cryptocurrencies around the time of recognition. Russia is also attempting to legitimise, as it would help the government crack down on money laundering.Why is cryptocurrencies value always fluctuating against national currenciesIt is important to note that national fiat currencies are valued against other currencies based on the state of the issuer\u2019s economy. If it is expected that many people will want to buy Korean products, there is more demand for KRW. This means each KRW costs more JPY, whether the central bank of Korea does anything or not. Cryptocurrencies are really no different, but they fluctuate much more.Looking at any charts of cryptocurrencies against a national currency (usually the USD, but it doesn\u2019t matter), one can see there are huge fluctuations. Since there is no central authority, there is no one to stabilise cryptocurrencies against national currencies. One of the libertarian goals of many cryptocurrencies is exactly this fact: market forces are the only forces that influence the value.Advocates of a global cryptocurrencies system argue that as it becomes more popular the value should stabilise on its own. The main driver of upside movements so far has been more interest, i.e., more demand. It is somewhat similar to real estate. If someone buys 100 acres in a secluded area, it may not be worth much at first. However, if the area starts to become populated, the original owner can divide the 100 acres, unchanged in physical size, into smaller pieces, each worth as much as the original 100 acres. However, there is an upper limit to the divisions, because people can\u2019t build houses on one one-hundredth of an acre (let\u2019s ignore building up for this example).Cryptocurrencies may appreciate over time, but there is also an upper limit to the number of units that are available in a currency. For example, Bitcoin miners will no longer receive coins for solving the blockchain linking problem around 2140. This is when the supply is expected to hit 21 million BTC, which is the set upper limit. At this point, coins will probably start to fall out of circulation without a replacement.Each cryptocurrency has an associated \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d, or what the entire exchange would trade for in a national currency equivalent. This can be a determinant in which system to use because someone trying to move large amounts wouldn\u2019t be able to trade on a small exchange or currency.Differences between Various CurrenciesNote: the charts in this section reflect MARKET CAPITALIZATION over the last year (as of May 17, 2017). The previous section was prices over the last few years. These are not in exact lockstep because the number of coins (units) increases with time.There are many cryptocurrencies out there. They have different features for different users. This is actually one major problem for widespread adoption\u200a\u2014\u200awithout a dominant currency, which one should people adopt? Small ones inveigle people with potentially large gains, but big ones have a better chance of acceptance by more people. Being early on a new social network could give you star status later, or you could forever be confined to a quiet corner of the social media space.Here are the four largest ones, each with a market capitalisation over 1B USD.Bitcoin (BTC, MC: ~30B USD)\u200a\u2014\u200aby far the largest and most well-known, this is the cryptocurrency that really kicked off the revolution. Its market cap (MC) is around 30B USD, and it has reached 350k transactions per day on busy days. The currency has an upper limit on the number of possible coins (21 million), but you can trade as little as one one-hundred-millionth of a BTC, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it becoming too expensive to do daily transactions.Chart Source: Highcharts.comLitecoin (LTC, MC: ~1.6B USD)\u200a\u2014\u200athis cryptocurrency\u2019s main feature is that it is much faster to transact. Since each transaction takes so much calculation, BTC transactions take upwards of 10 minutes to confirm. This is not feasible for paying on-the-go. LTC gets the time down to about 2.5 minutes, though that is still much longer than the seconds it takes for credit cards or cash.Chart Source: Highcharts.comEthereum (ETH, MC: ~8B) \u00ad\u2013 ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, sitting at about 8B USD. ETH was originally designed to be a platform and not really a cryptocurrency. The transaction time is on the order of 10\u201315 seconds for confirmation, which is a huge improvement. ETH are also released every year, so there is no hard upper limit of ETH like with other cryptocurrencies. This means that not all the coins are in the hands of early miners.Chart Source: Highcharts.comRipple (XRP, MC: ~7.2B USD)\u200a\u2014\u200aXRP has no public ledger, but instead uses an \u201citerative consensus process\u201d. The result is a much shorter transaction time (a few seconds), and it uses much less computing power. Ripple is its own exchange, and hence there is no fear of an exchange vanishing (like the fiasco that was Mt. Gox).Chart Source: Highcharts.comThere are many more cryptocurrencies, and here I mention a couple with interesting features. This is by no means an extensive list, as there are literally hundreds of CCs. These are just a couple that have interesting features (both I and others (1, 2) think they\u2019re interesting).Monero (XMR, MC: ~420M USD)\u200a\u2014\u200athe interesting feature here is that there is a \u201cring\u201d of signatures for enhanced privacy. Fake signatures are mixed in with real ones, so it isn\u2019t possible to tell which account sent which request.Chart Source: Highcharts.comQuarkcoin (QRK, MC: ~2M USD)\u200a\u2014\u200aclaimed to be a more secure cryptocurrency compared to BTC, with 9 rounds of hashing from 6 different functions. This means there is even less ability for fraudsters to change transaction history. It is also meant for consumer miners, so its maintenance does not require massive server farms. The CC peaked in early 2014 but has since fallen very farChart Source: Highcharts.comPeercoin (PPC, MC: ~50M USD)\u200a\u2014\u200adesigned for large PPC holders to get even more. Its system to ensure integrity implies those that have a bigger stake are more likely to win the mining competitionChart Source: Highcharts.comDangers to Widespread AdoptionThe greatest barrier to widespread adoption is acceptance. If you can\u2019t use it to buy a coffee at your local shop or a train ticket at the station, no one will use it. The first step in expanding acceptance is for large companies to accept them, and some do. Here is a list, longer than one might expect, of companies that accept at least Bitcoins. Unfortunately, there are not many big names on there. Once your local shops start to accept it, it will become more feasible for the average person to adopt it.Another major problem is fragmentation. Currently, Bitcoin is the largest one, but there are many competitors that take market share. One must be adopted as a standard\u200a\u2014\u200apeople don\u2019t want to use five different currencies, all fluctuating against each other, in their everyday life. Businesses also don\u2019t want to have to set up all the tech to accept five different currencies and always adjust their prices.It not only exposes businesses to wild fluctuations between customer cash inflow and material buying cash outflow, but sovereign nations will also be open to the fluctuations of the global market without a means to control the money supply in their own economies. This is something hardcore libertarians champion, but the average person is probably not interested in his country losing control of such an important affair as the economy.Technical issues are another issue. Of course, it is possible that a bank\u2019s electronic accounting system fails, but CC systems are very new. Do we really want to risk a potentially catastrophic meltdown of our economy because there was some exploit? At least with fiat currencies, people can still trade physical notes of cash to buy food and water even in a disaster.ConclusionSo, what do we make of cryptocurrencies? They are an interesting technological novelty for now. If they can be completely secured, beyond doubt, and many people start to adopt them, it is entirely possible the future will be transacted in cryptocurrency. At this time, though, they are really only useful as a speculative investment tool for early capital gains or FX traders who think they can guess the direction.You can track personalised financial news for these cryptocurrencies on our award-winning platform CityFALCON here.", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "Analysis between Dash, Zcash, Ripple (XRP) and BRAVO\u00a0Pay", "author_name": "BRAVO Pay", "link": "https://medium.com/@BRAVOPay/analysis-between-dash-zcash-ripple-xrp-and-bravo-pay-134dc925edf0?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 8, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "2.6K", "content": "Analysis between Dash, Zcash, Ripple (XRP) and BRAVO\u00a0PayBRAVO PayBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 8, 2018With the emergence of new technologies, many individuals are gearing towards cash-free systems for the sake of convenience and ease. This means that privacy, speed, and security have become the base on which money is rooted.The BRAVO Hybrid Consensus Protocol offers a Hybrid Blockchain solution which fulfils all three of these fundamental requirements without compromising on its key focus: to offer an easy, cash-free payments protocol for P2P payments and enterprises to facilitate everyday payments.In order to fully appreciate the features that BRAVO offers, one can look at other similar cryptocurrency projects to see how the blockchains match up.A detailed comparison can be found in BRAVO\u2019s whitepaper of the differences between BRAVO\u2019s Blockchain application platform interface (API) and that of Ripple, ZCash, and Dash. These tokens, like BRAVO, are also highly focused on privacy and strive to offer quick transactions times.Several fundamental features are explored in order to show how the BRAVO Protocol performs next to the three cryptocurrency companies.Ease of use and consumer app:BRAVO\u2019s first DApp (BRAVO Pay) introduces a user friendly experience that for the first time will allow users to have a similar experience as in our current Fiat version where you find the user either by proximity or via a username or a private 4 digit code (no long keys or long wallet addresses needed). It is a simple experience that will allow adoption at the mainstream level of cryptocurrency (no longer for the tech-savvy people). BRAVO pay app supports instant and private transactions. We eliminated the use of long keys to permit for a simple experience in the front-end thanks to our hybrid blockchain technology. The experience of paying with BVO is instant and allows privacy on demand. The only other company offering a mobile app payment tool for instant payments is Dash, but there are several important differences with BRAVO. With the Dash app, you can have an \u201cinstant send\u201d which is supported by the Masternodes to confirm the transactions preventing the \u201cdouble spent\u201d problem, but their phone wallets cannot support private send.Blockchain Protocol:With regard to the blockchain protocol, both Zcash and Dash are Proof-of-Work (POW) protocols, while XRP uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus protocol, such as BRAVO except that BRAVO is a Hybrid Blockchain that not only uses FBA but also an anonymizing Proof-of-Stake protocol.Transactions per second (TPS):Both Zcash and Dash complete between 23\u201326 successful transactions per second on their public blockchain, while Zcash completes 6 transactions per second using its private blockchain. Ripple and BRAVO complete between 1500\u20131800 successful transactions per second, but unlike XRP, BRAVO has a private blockchain that completes nearly 30x the transactions per second than that of Zcash. BRAVO\u2019s FBA block time is a short 3.5 seconds and PoS block time is 1 minute. This, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 10-minute block time, makes for exceptionally speedy transactions. BRAVO\u2019s confirmation time is even more impressive. XRP user\u2019s face 3.5 seconds before transactions are confirmed, Dash transactions are confirmed within 15 minutes and BRAVO\u2019s FBA transactions take a further 3.5 seconds to be confirmed. That\u2019s a maximum of 7 seconds for a full transaction to take place on the FBA blockchain.Privacy and Compliance with KYC/AML:BRAVO has created a solution that allows users to utilize an option for an anonymous payment, but also the option for a lower fee public payment is they choose. Make no mistake, this process is for the those who prefer to keep their personal details undisclosed day-to-day public transactions. BRAVO creates high priority in vetting their users and places a great sense of priority in remaining KYC/AML complaint at all times. Dash, Zcash and XRP do not use KYC/AML for onboarding users who use their payments mechanism although Dash offers independent businesses to use the AML/KYC features if they choose.Scalability:XRP is a strong competitor to BRAVO as it provides a scalable solution, unlike Dash and Zcash. However, after much analysis it is clear that BRAVO dominates as a solution for peer-to-peer, business-to-business and peer-to-business solution and targets more verticals and markets beyond that of just general payments such as settling bets, tipping, live and instant payments to streamers.BRAVO is the first Hybrid Blockchain of its kind and the only between the four analyzed coins. It is also the only blockchain of the four that will be offering an API for developers to use the Protocol to build applications of the future that require low fees, fast transactions and on-demand anonymity in the transfer of value.The BRAVO Pay app has a successful proof of concept which will also become their first blockchain integrated app deployed on the BRAVO Hybrid Blockchain early next year. This will be sure to migrate all tens of thousands of users to the new app which will have fully enabled crypto payments solutions with the option of a fiat payments too. As a business that is focused on bringing crypto to the mass market, this is a recipe for success after having already captured a piece of the market and to soon introduce a solution of further enhanced features to entice them into the world of blockchain.In general, BRAVO\u2019s blockchain is a unique blend of fast scalable technology with privacy and regulatory compliance. Many coins will fall victim to regulatory backlash due to a lack of compliance, but BRAVO Pay has found the balance between enhanced game-changing features and full compliance throughout all of their business to ensure they reach the goal of bringing crypto payments to the masses.Our ICO is open to Non-U.S. persons only & other restrictions apply\u200a\u2014\u200asee disclaimer: http://bvo.trybravo.com", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Is Ripple The Devil?

CEO Under Fire at Disrupt\u00a0SFCue the Rolling\u00a0Stones.Martine ParisBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 13, 2018When Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, took the stage at Disrupt SF last week, he was met by TechCrunch\u2019s Mike Butcher with an unrelenting line of questioning into the activities of the controversial fintech company. It was a masterful interview focused on clarifying whether Ripple has been manipulating the market to boost the XRP price, which is now down 90% from its 2018 high.Ripple Labs, which offers enterprise global payments on the blockchain, is the issuer of XRP, the world\u2019s third largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The company has been sued for securities fraud by irate investors who lost money in the recent crash and allege that Ripple created the XRP token to fund its operations and the development of the XRP ecosystem. Under the Howie Test, based on investor expectations and how it was marketed, XRP could be ruled an unregistered security in violation of SEC regulations.Are you in fact the devil?\u201cI\u2019m not the devil,\u201d Garlinghouse replied laughing. \u201cPeople who say that Ripple is somehow the devil, it\u2019s because we\u2019re partnering with the man. Cross border payments today are slow and expensive. Ripple invented a series of technologies built upon the XRP ledger that allows institutions, banks and even in some cases, government to dramatically accelerate the nature of transactions.\u201dMike Arrington, Founder of TechCrunch and Arrington XRP Capital agreed, \u201cXRP is a fantastic currency to use for among other things, funds. We need to move a lot of money very quickly. We make investments all over the world. Using banks to move money is a pain. Have you ever sent money in an international wire? You gotta call, did you get it? And what? No I didn\u2019t get it. It takes a day or two to move money around the world. With XRP, our very first close was $50 million. We moved that money in like three seconds and I think it cost 20 or 30 cents.\u201dArrington discussed his longtime friendship with Garlinghouse. \u201cWhen TechCrunch originally sold to AOL, and eventually became part of the Verizon behemoth, Brad was at AOL. He\u2019s the primary person that make that deal happen. He made me wealthy, not as wealthy as him, but wealthy. And it turns out now he\u2019s the fifth richest person in California or something. When Brad first joined Ripple, I went to him for advice and he helped me raise the fund by introducing me to most of our large LPs that hold large amounts of XRP.\u201d Arrington noted that Ripple isn\u2019t an LP and XRP is now only a small part of their portfolio.How much is too much?Garlinghouse tops the Forbes list of crypto billionaires, along with Ripple founders Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb (also the founder of Mt. Gox and Stellar).Ripple has not only been in the news for lawsuits, it\u2019s also been in the news for charity. Ripple investor Ashton Kutcher of Sound Ventures has been speaking on behalf of the company, announcing high profile donations by Ripple to celebrity-backed charities like Madonna\u2019s Raising Malawi campaign and Ellen Degeneres\u2019 Wildlife Fund. On March 26, Ripple made history with the largest single cryptocurrency donation ever, giving away a stunning $29 million in XRP to fund all 35,647 campaigns on DonorsChoose benefiting 16,500 schools and over 28,000 teachers.Butcher questioned whether the XRP infusion was truly philanthropic or merely a desperate attempt to pump excess XRP from the pre-mine into the ecosystem to boost prices. \u201cSo, you come up with a fantastic ability to move money around the planet, but XRP prices are crashing. You\u2019re trying to get the banks to use the actual currency. They\u2019re using the Ripple protocol but they\u2019re not using XRP, are they? You pre-mined all this currency and made a heck of a lot of money. You\u2019re trying to get people to use XRP. \u201d Butcher said.Garlinghouse responded, \u201cSilicon Valley doesn\u2019t do enough to give back. We may be accused of being the devil in terms of how we partnered with the system. I\u2019ve never been accused of being the devil for, you know, being philanthropic and supporting causes that are actually good for the planet.\u201dWhen asked, Arrington said he was never offered free XRP to seed his fund.Butcher then asked Garlinghouse if he paid social media influencers to hype XRP. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the XRP fanboys on Twitter. Are you paying them to shill? Are they just trying to boost the currency?\u201dGarlinghouse replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t pay them.We have a lot of advocates.\u201dArrington added, \u201cOne of the most interesting books I\u2019ve read is Guns, Germs and Steel. We are naturally tribal and form teams. Fanboys for Bitcoin and Fanboys for XRP are saying almost the same thing, they\u2019re actually enthusiasts who have changed their lives and the lives of their family.\u201dButcher continued, \u201cYour criticism of Ethereum is it\u2019s got a big developer network, and you\u2019re trying to boost the amount of developers using XRP with Xpring. You\u2019re trying to boost the market, do you think?Garlinghouse replied, \u201cThe observation I\u2019d make about the Ethereum ecosystem today is that there is a lot of experimentation. There\u2019s not a lot of successfully deployed, solving real problems. There\u2019s one project that I find very interesting called Augur.\u201d Garlinghouse added that he didn\u2019t own any ether, but he did own bitcoin.Regarding Ripple, Garlinghouse said, \u201cRipple has very specifically decided to go very deep in a particular vertical with a clear customer, a clear value proposition in solving a clear problem.\u201d He discussed his Peanut Butter Manifesto which he wrote at Yahoo about companies that spread themselves too thin. \u201cI was meeting with some of the IBM team and they were talking about using a blockchain to track flower freshness. I don\u2019t get it. More often than not a database is going to be more efficient than a blockchain. People use words like blockchain and crypto as catnip for the investors.\u201dPointing at EOS, Arrington said, \u201cI think that these projects that come out and raise a lot of money, in some cases billions of dollars, don\u2019t need that much money, and so I always think that\u2019s odd. If you look at the history of Silicon Valley, there are as far as I know, zero examples of companies that have raised massive amounts of funding before launching a product and being successful.\u201dAbout that air gapGarlinghouse went on to explain why XRP could not be considered a security, \u201cA security is something that represents ownership in a company that gives you rights to dividends, gives you rights to governance. XRP and Ripple are two separate things. We have shareholders, we have investors that include Google Ventures, we have banks that have invested their own share of Ripple the company. When you buy XRP, that doesn\u2019t give you any rights to the profits or ownership of Ripple the company. If Ripple the company shutdown tomorrow, the XRP ledger would continue to operate.\u201dResponding to claims that Ripple maintains a centralized XRP ledger, he said, \u201cPeople are saying the XRP ledger is centralized. It\u2019s factually not true. The XRP ledger is fully decentralized. Ripple the company cannot control the XRP ledger apart from the fact that you control a handful of nodes. We control, I think, 7% of all of the public nodes on the XRP ledger. In contrast, you have (three) miners in China that control north of 50% of the Bitcoin blockchain. By any measure, the Bitcoin blockchain is more centralized that the XRP ledger. People say Ripple can block a transaction. Not true. Can we rollback a transaction? We actually can\u2019t.\u201dAnd the crash\u2026Addressing concerns about the drop in XRP price, Garlinghouse commented, \u201c18 months ago the entire crypto market was worth $20 billion. Today it\u2019s worth $230 billion. In between it hit about $850 billion. If we drew a straight line from 18 months ago to today you\u2019d say it\u2019s been a huge bull market. There have been in the last five or six years multiple crashes that have been effectively reconsolidation. You\u2019re going to see a separation between those that are purely speculative and those that are actually solving real utility problems in the marketplace.\u201dUnintended consequencesArrington shared his thoughts on what will happen if the U.S. continues with their lack of support for the blockchain ecosystem. \u201cI\u2019m Libertarian. I don\u2019t like the government in general. 80\u201390% of our investments are in Asia, Europe and Israel right now, because they\u2019re actually countries where there\u2019s enough regulatory certainty that entrepreneurs feel safe starting their blockchain companies there. Here they don\u2019t. There\u2019s so much regulatory uncertainty. And then add to that the tax burden and the visa burdens of coming here. And then our current federal government\u2019s stance on immigration in general. They\u2019re just saying f*ck it, and they\u2019re staying in Singapore, Israel and Europe, instead of coming here and starting companies. The SEC needs to get their act together. If they had done that with the Internet in 1994, 1995, none of us would be here. We\u2019d all be living in Shanghai or somewhere else. They\u2019re single-handedly wrecking the stage of technology development.\u201dGarlinghouse added, \u201cThere are unequivocally bad actors in the ICO ecosystem. There have been frauds and massive scams. Hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars have been heisted and if anything, I\u2019m surprised the SEC hasn\u2019t been more aggressive going after some of those bad actors. I agree that there is a risk that a lot of this development ends up non-US. The impact on the United States economy for having the Internet that we think of today being very U.S. centric has been very positive for the United States.\u201dThe Future Is CryptoButcher closed by asking Arrington to share his thoughts on the next 10 years in crypto and blockchain.\u201cI\u2019m a little tired of the VC game,\u201d said Arrington. \u201cIt\u2019s all new players in crypto. It\u2019s younger, fresher, more interesting people from all over the world. The VC game has gotten very tiring to me. Crypto moves much more quickly than the tech world, which already moves quickly. But a few months feels like a year or two in crypto. And I actually like that. I think it\u2019s keeping me young. It\u2019s keeping me excited. And it\u2019s just a lot more fun.\u201dOriginally posted in The FinTech Times, September 13, 2018, by me!", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "XRP and ETH going to the moon, INGOT Coin creates a better\u00a0World", "author_name": "Ahmed Khawanky", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/xrp-and-eth-going-to-the-moon-ingot-coin-creates-a-better-world-abc5a89ca8de?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 26, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "1.1K", "content": "XRP and ETH going to the moon, INGOT Coin creates a better\u00a0WorldAhmed KhawankyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 26, 2018The world of cryptocurrency is rapidly changing and evolving. Innovators and entrepreneurs are constantly introducing new cryptocurrencies, each promising new and varying characteristics to attract investors and users. Global official sector reaction to cryptocurrencies varies as the decentralized technology does not fit easily into existing regulatory definitions and structures. This sector will likely continue to be cautious as it monitors the risks to financial integrity, consumer protection, financial stability, tax evasion and treatment, and monetary policy. Leaders in regulation, like Japan, are likely to set the standard for the rest of the world in a scenario where the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies requires a cohesive and collaborative effort.The cryptocurrency world is an unstable and volatile place, constantly shift between bear market and bull market periods. Some investors are taking advantages of this and others not so much. Reaching a stable value cryptocurrency has long been the target of many projects that aim to take crypto a step beyond just a middle of exchange and into the land of a store of value. If I put $10.000 into Bitcoin, ETH (Ethereum) or XRP (ripple) today, nobody can be guaranteed what it will be worth tomorrow which puts off businesses and everyday users that want to use crypto beyond just a speculative investment as a method to accept payments or pay salaries. Mass adoption is the ultimate aim for cryptocurrencies, but a stable cryptocurrency is needed in order to achieve that. Cryptocurrencies are reacting more like stocks and less like currency with their incredible volatility. They give more incitements to trade with them, not to pay with them. The concept of making a stable cryptocurrency is complicated. Many have tried to create such a coin and failed. In time the crypto markets will get well founded, leading to a more stable nature of the top cryptocurrencies. The crypto markets are becoming increasingly more competitive, because they are some of the easiest to trade on.The justification for the big fluctuation of cryptocurrency prices is the supply and demand. The supply is more or less fixed but the demand is always changing due to people\u2019s behavior and speculation. A normal currency can have a broad use, it can store value and be a unit of exchange. You can\u2019t have a currency that isn\u2019t backed by value. Fiat currencies are collateralized by assets and gold. If they weren\u2019t, they would depreciate fast. Though most banks are printing money at some rate, the US dollar is the only currency that can be printed without limit from the US central bank. But the problem with printing infinite amounts of money is that they will depreciate, without being backed by value. The US dollar is experiencing something like this. Compared to the stable Euro, the US dollar is losing value at an alarming rate. A solution for this problem is currently being talked about and is planned for the future. But a solution for the stability of cryptocurrencies is something else.With all of the talk of cryptocurrencies in today\u2019s news, there are necessarily always going to be questions raised about \u201cwhy does this have any value?\u201d Even at face value, it\u2019s definitely not the case when talking about cryptocurrencies as a movement generally, but even on top of that, there are certain cryptocurrencies that carry a lot more weight to them\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s where the INGOT Coin system comes into play.Though there is plenty of fair skepticism of any new asset class in the expanding world of FinTech and cryptocurrencies, there are also certain coins that stick out a lot more than others. While plenty of coins and tokens rely mainly on public perception of value or speculation about the potential for value in the future, the INGOT family of coins is the first to come to the market to offer real, tangible value for the cryptocurrency.INGOT Coin will create a complete solution by integrating 6 core ecosystem components and providing a one-stop-shop for the digital asset, traditional asset and currency markets to solve all the above-mentioned challenges, thus, creating a link between the crypto market and the traditional market. The IC Ecosystem will establish 6 different components to work hand in hand under one umbrella, providing all community members the chance to capitalize on upcoming opportunities in all markets. The Ecosystem\u2019s components, as shown below, are the IC Wallet, IC Exchange, IC Brokerage, IC Digital Bank, IC Certifier and IC ICO Accelerator.INGOT Coin will provide a platform that meets the needs of beginner as well as advanced traders to trade with minimal initial capital. IC will also provide its own cryptocurrency, which will be available on different exchanges for all investors and market participants to purchase.

The Ripple protocol enables direct and instant value transfer between two parties anywhere in the world with negligible fee.Gateways in the Ripple system issue and facilitate transfer of anything from USD, gold to airmiles and mobile minutes using the Ripple Protocol also known as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP). Validation of transactions in Ripple happens with the help of consensus among the validating nodes unlike mining in Bitcoin. If you\u2019re not familiar with how cryptocurrencies work, we suggest you to first check out our guides on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.HistoryBack in 2004, Ryan Fuger a web developer from Canada, came up with the idea of a peer to peer decentralized monetary system\u200a\u2014\u200aRipplePay. The main intent was to create a global financial network without intermediaries like banks involved. Jed McCaleb creator of Mt Gox and now co-founder of Stellar was working on his own currency system where the validation of transactions on the network would happen using consensus among the members unlike the proof of work system in Bitcoin which requires mining. He, along with Chris Larsen now Chairman of Ripple and the richest man in crypto, approached Ryan with an idea of a digital currency and then together formed a new company called OpenCoin.OpenCoin started with the development of the Ripple Transaction Protocol for solving the problems they found in the banking system. They introduced the system of the validating server where trusted nodes on the network could come to consensus and validate transactions on the network. They also introduced XRP, the digital asset native to the Ripple protocol which could be used for instant value transfer anywhere in the world.OpenCoin changed its name to Ripple Labs in 2013 and open sourced the protocol code under the ISC license. XRP became the second largest cryptocurrency overtaking Litecoin in 2014. Over this period Ripple Labs received funding from various VC firms and banks, including Google Ventures and Santander. The name was changed once again and this time it was changed from Ripple Labs to Ripple. Over the years, Ripple has partnered with more than 100 banks and payment services companies. XRP now is one of the most liquid assets with easy buying/selling access worldwide.How is Ripple different from\u00a0Bitcoin?Bitcoin vs\u00a0RippleBitcoin aims to be the global decentralized digital currency while Ripple aims to be the payment system that disrupts networks like SWIFT. There are more differences than similarities.DistributionBitcoin is distributed to the miners that solve the mathematical puzzle and include transactions in a block every ten minutes. There can only be 21 million Bitcoins ever. XRP distribution is different. When XRP was introduced, 100 billion XRP units were created. While some of the supply was distributed early among the founders and Ripple, most of it is now held in an Escrow.XRP SupplyFaster and\u00a0CheaperXRP is very fast compared to other cryptocurrencies. Your transaction on Ripple will go through in less than 4 seconds. Ripple claims to process more than 1500 transactions per second on its network.Ripple on\u00a0TwitterSuch fast transactions make it attractive for people looking for micropayments and remittance solutions. The minimum transaction fee is just 0.00001 XRP.Validation and VerificationBitcoin is a proof-of-work system. Miners who want to participate in mining have to provide extensive hardware and software resources at the networks disposal. Ripple works differently. In order to include transactions into the ledger, all the validators in the network need to reach a specific quorum in order to accept a transaction and add it to the XRP Ledger. In order to maintain security and reliability of the network, Ripple uses trusted validator nodes. These nodes are diversified all around the world so that any risks with single point of failure can be mitigated.XRP, Ripple, RippleNet etc, what\u2019s the difference?People are sometimes confused about the relationship between these entities and how the adoption of Ripple Protocol affects the demand for XRP the token. Here\u2019s an easy breakdown of how these are interconnected:Ripple: This is a private company that looks after the development of the Ripple Protocol and also holds a significant share of XRP. Ripple provides solutions to banks and payment companies.XRP Ledger: This is the public ledger that is used to transact in different currencies. Users can issue currencies, commodities or any other assets and use it for value transfer anywhere in the world using this ledger.XRP: XRP is the digital asset native to the above mentioned XRP Ledger. XRP serves the purpose of being a medium of exchange and anti-spam measure for the ledger. XRP is also needed for using some advanced features on XRP like payment channels and escrow services.RippleNet: This is a private implementation of Interledger Protocol (IPL) by Ripple which provides it as a service to its partners. RippleNet consists of solutions like xCurrent, xRapid, xVia.It has to noted that only one of these solutions, xRapid, requires an absolute necessity to use XRP. xVia and xCurrent doesn\u2019t need XRP to work efficiently.PriceXRP for most of its existence has spent time below $1. It\u2019s in 2017, when it first hit parity with a dollar. Following that, it went into a parabolic trajectory reaching all time highs of $4 on some exchanges.XRP has always maintained its position in the top 10 on coinmarketcap since 2013. The first major spike we saw in 2013 was during the end of the year where it went from $0.01 to $0.05 rising more than 400% in two weeks making it reach just shy of $500 million market cap.2013\u20132014It reached an all time high market cap of $800 million for the first time in January 2015. The price for the next two years kept bouncing between $0.005 and $0.01.It was in 2017, when with more partnerships and investment announcements, the price of XRP took a huge surge. It went more up than 4000%, starting at < $1 billion market cap and < $0.001 a unit in March 2017 to $0.4 at all time highs and $15 billion in market cap by the end of May.In the same year it broke new records. In the first week of December 2017, it crossed $1 for the first and went ahead to go upto $4 the next week making it much more valuable than Ethereum for few days in terms of market cap reaching $120 billion at its peak. XRP at the time of writing trades at Rs 75 on Zebpay.2017FutureUAE Exchange recently partnered with Ripple to use one of its RippleNet solutions for cross border payments as they slowly start to come out of beta. Even giant banks and payment companies like Santander, American Express, Barclays, HSBC and even India\u2019s Axis Bank, Yes Bank have teamed up with Ripple. The company seems to be doing great but the topic of actual usage of XRP between these partners is doubtful and has faced strong criticism. That being said, how Ripple grows and is used in day to day life is yet to be seen. To learn more about Ripple, visit the official site.

All you need to do is look at the BTC chart & it will more or less tell you the price action in the rest of the digital coins. Having said that there are exceptions sometimes like we saw Ripple diverging from the rest of the lot on the news of it getting listed on the popular U.S based exchange Coinbase. More on that later, let\u2019s talk about two other significant events that are lined up for the popular dApp platforms of Ethereum & Tron\u200a\u2014\u200aboth of which are the members of the Top Ten Crypto Elite club sitting at Number 2 and Number 9 by market cap respectively.Ethereum (ETH)The much-awaited system-wide upgrade Constantinople & St. Petersburg is finally scheduled to go live during Ethereum\u2019s 7,280,000 mined block sometime on Feb. 28th. The proposed hard fork which was originally planned for mid-January by its team of developers had the deadline pushed forward after a security vulnerability in one of the five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) was found by the smart contract audit firm ChainSecurity. According to the official blog post of Ethereum, the transition could take place a little earlier or later depending on the block times. You can follow the countdown timer or monitor the system-wide network upgrade in real-time. There have been previous upgrades on the Ethereum network as well like Spurious Dragon and Byzantium, however this time it is a bigger deal since the upgrade combo of Constantinople & St. Petersburg is taking place together on the same block.DDI Editor\u2019s Pick\u200a\u2014\u200aCertified Ethereum\u00a0ExpertIt is easier said than done since the decentralized nature of the blockchain networks demands that consensus be reached among the developers, community members & network clients. Also, the change in the underlying consensus protocol from PoW to PoS is a fundamental shift which requires additional technical upgrades. So far, the upgrade has been relatively non-contentious which is good news for the second most popular blockchain network. Ethereum Miners & Node operators should beware that they risk getting stuck on an incompatible chain if they don\u2019t participate in the upgrade. For my techie friends here are changes that are going to be implemented via the EIP.EIP 145: Bitwise shifting instructions in EVMEIP 1014: Skinny CREATE2EIP 1052: EXTCODEHASH opcodeEIP 1234: Constantinople Difficulty Bomb Delay and Block Reward AdjustmentREMOVING EIP 1283: Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty mapsTRON (TRX)The dApps platforms has presented itself as a serious challenger to the hegemony of Ethereum ever since its inception\u200a\u2014\u200aimproving on the shortcomings of the Ethereum network specially with its high scalability claiming processing speed of 2000 TPS as compared to ETH\u2019s 25 TPS. No wonder Tron CEO, Justin Sun has been an open critic of the Ethereum network\u200a\u2014\u200awe will leave \u2018which one is better\u2019 for some other day & stick with the hard forks. Coincidentally, TRX will be undergoing Tron Odyssey 3.5 hard fork the same day (Feb. 28) Ethereum upgrades to its next-gen version. The announcement was made by Sun on his Twitter account. Tron has grown in stature & popularity under the leadership of Sun with his sharp business acumen. However, he has been criticized vehemently by the Ethereum proponents for his public condemnation of Tron\u2019s predecessor & main competitor.Tron made headlines last June with the high-profile acquisition of the P2P file sharing BitTorrent platform with a claimed subscription base of over 100 million users. The file-sharing company last month decided to issue its own native cryptocurrency called BitTorrent Token (BTT), which will run on the Tron protocol\u200a\u2014\u200aTRC 10 token (comparable to the ERC-20 tokens that run on top of ethereum). This follows the announcement of Project Atlas in Aug. 2018. Project Atlas enables the users to earn & spend digital coins while sharing files. Coming back to the main features of the Tron network upgrade they include:Multi-signature support & account management features for Institutional investorsDynamic energy adjustment would enhance the energy efficiency by streamlining the energy consumption in real-timePerformance upgrade by 50%\u200a\u2014\u200ato address the mammoth increase in the dApp developers flocking to the open source platformProviding better security features for the Tron Virtual MachineRipple (XRP)After excessive speculation for the most part of 2018, Coinbase finally decided to list XRP (third most popular digital token) on their Professional platform. The Coinbase blog lists the details of the listing process & the availability of trades for users in detail. Coinbase, which has one of the biggest user bases for a regulated digital exchange & most synonymous with crypto trading has been on a listing spree recently with the addition of BAT, 0x, USDCoin among others. It had, however, shied away from listing XRP on regulatory concerns previously. Finally, it caved into the demand of its user base & continued adoption and popularity of the cross border remittance currency. XRP immediately jumped 12% as a result (figure above). Although it has retreated to its pre-listing lows with the rest of the Cryptoverse, the so-called \u2018Coinbase effect\u2019 has sprung life in the digital asset.Hard forks have been historically known to cause a spike in volatility\u200a\u2014\u200aa twin platform upgrade on the same day could provide an interesting day of price movements in the Cryptos. Speculatively speaking, if the hard forks in both digital assets go ahead without any incident, they should see healthy gains. Listing of Alt. coins on big name exchanges have had a similar impact\u200a\u2014\u200aas we saw in the case of Ripple. Will these three provide the way to a Crypto spring?

ShutterstockAs you may remember on December 22nd, 2017 just before X-mas, Bitcoin fell from above $17000 to $12500. Not to mention we were used to its volatility by then, it was still a 1400% for the year.What happend next, showed the decentralized globalization that cryptocurrencies represent. Ripples in one part of the world, influences the whole (no pun intended).As cryptocurrencies were plummeting, something extraordinary happend to Ripple due to South Korea and Japan. Ripple overtook Ethereum to become the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. Today it stands at $78 Bn. as opposed to Ethereum behind at $73 Bn.East Asia Gives Ripple a\u00a0LiftRipple bills itself as the:One Frictionless Experience To Send Money\u00a0GloballyHow is that for a tag-line? As Millennials globally are storing an increasing amount of their investments in late 2017 in crypto stores of value that may have high ROI, Ripple has shown itself to be a big winner.When three of Japan\u2019s big credit card companies signed up to use Ripple\u2019s technology, it was simply more evidence of Japan leading the way in BTC and XRP adoption. Like Bitcoin futures, this is a FOMO wave, where many other countries will have to follow.The Market Cap of Cryptocurrencies is SkyrocketingRipple\u2019s XRP token climbed to above $2 for the first time. That\u2019s an increase YOY of more than 20,000% in 2017. Thought of another way, if you didn\u2019t think cryptocurrencies were for real\u200a\u2014\u200aconsider this: Ripple\u2019s current market value would put it among the world\u2019s 30 biggest banks, ahead of the likes of UK\u2019s Lloyds Banking Group or Japan\u2019s Mizuho Financial Group.The market cap of crypto assets and currencies may even be the beginning of a change in the financial order of how we store, invest and exchange our funds. Witness the rise in 2017 of Coinbase\u2019s app. Cryptocurrencies have broken into the mainstream, and banks will have a hard time competing against cryptocurrency exchanges in many respects in the not-so-distant future.If you think of how blockchain scales before 2020, you must consider how major institutions adopt cryptocurrencies. Ripple Labs is already five years old, working hard to sign up legacy financial orgs to build one seamless payment network ecosystem on the blockchain. When in mid 2018, the blockchain scales, who do you suppose will have a competitive advantage with B2B use cases in what once felt like a fledgling industry?Sure 2017 has been a stunning year for several altcoins: bitcoin (1,500%), litecoin (5,000%), or ethereum (8,000%). But who has the scope to bridge the gap between mainstream finance and the new financial world? It\u2019s\u00a0Ripple.If the Bitcoin ponzi scheme is fueling consumer interest and Ethereum is fueling the smart contract era of the blockchain, Ripple certainly has a lot of potential as well.In early 2018, I\u2019d wager Ripple, Cardano and Stellar all scan scale very well. In terms of the quality of ICOs we are also witnessing more innovative projects such as SingularityNET, Filecoin\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain data storage network which raised $257 million, and Kik\u2019s Kin Token. This means as cryptocurrency, blockchain and smart contracts become more mainstream, so too will the quality of ICOs we will bear witness to.This isn\u2019t just Crypto futures we are talking about, this means that to keep up with innovation, how we fund our startups might completely change as Venture Capital is investing less and less early startup funds that\u2019s crippling innovation in North America. This is especially true when we compare the pace of innovation, R&D funding and new unicorns in China.2018 is the Year of how Blockchain ScalesForget Bitcoin reaching 20,000 for a moment, to the future of blockchain, Ripple hitting 2$ is much much more relevant.This is because 2018 is all about how the blockchain scales, not just in terms of application but in terms of speed of transaction per second. The blockchain platform wars between Ethereum, NEO and Cardano is just getting started.You cannot just anticipate the future, you have to build it. You have to hit tight deadlines to keep up, and as the rest of cryptocurrencies catches up with Bitcoin; we will witness the blockchain revolution and we still don\u2019t fully imagine all that it will entail.The Best Use-Case of Blockchain is\u00a0SpeedRipple\u2019s cross-border payments system is electronic record-keeping system on the blockchain, that is, instantaneous transactions. As it\u2019s a low cost between countries and currencies; it\u2019s a force for globalization and decentralization that few can predict the precise outcome if it wins. If the American dollar is the gold standard of value pre 2020, what will be that same standard post 2020? The entire global economy is changing, and the next recession may be a proving ground.If it takes legacy banks between 2 to 5 days to transfer fees across borders, with red tape and added fees and it takes Ripple a matter of seconds, who do you suppose will win?In a world that\u2019s going cashless (China is already there), we see WeChat Pay, Walmart Pay, Apple Pay, Amazon Pay and Alipay all gaining traction. Paypal is still around and Stripe is growing fast, the future of payments is getting seriously interesting.The winner of payment ubiquity is likely to transform banking,\u00a0forever.Cross border payment solutions and peer-to-peer solutions are transforming the way we think of transactions and avoiding expensive bank fees. Transferwise, Venmo, Zelle and Ripple along with many others, will continue to change how we think of P2P and CBP.There\u2019s zero chance ethical consumer Millennials will just keep trusting banks ahead of all of these more convenient and faster alternatives. And, it should terrify legacy financial institutions.The Key Use Case of the Blockchain is the Intersection with\u00a0AIAs Ethereum seeks in 2018 to move in the direction of becoming a decentralized world computer that replaces server farms, the sweetspot is the intersection of the blockchain and AI.The future of the blockchain then, has become so much more than just transactions or cryptocurrencies. In that decentralized world computer, the future of consensus and collective decision making, might mark the most radical political innovation since many thousands of years.There\u2019s no hiding that Government, politicians, the media networks, banks and many other domains could all seriously use an overhaul. Blockchain mediated by smart contracts and AI could be the answer.The idea of physical banks, just like corruptible politicians, will soon become obsolete. It\u2019s ironic maybe that it will take advances in AI, for us to implement the next levels of social justice, equality and improved well-being for all in a blockchain society. Ripple will play its part, and as cryptocurrencies scale in 2018 at faster frequencies per second, we might see suddenly the end of many legacy systems in favor of blockchain solutions and iteratives. Consider the classical example:Bitcoin is processing ~7 transactions / secondEthereum is processing ~15 transactions / secondPaypal is processing ~200 transactions / secondVisa is processing ~2,000 transactions / second but has the capacity to process 56,000 transactions / secondAs the tech and consumption adoption continues in 2018, the Crypto Singularity will start to have more widespread B2B and B2C implications.Correct me if I\u2019m wrong?If Ripple is a metaphor for blockchain transactions, 2018 might be its\u00a0year.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "Styling AppCompat Button with Ripple\u00a0Effect", "author_name": "Travis P", "link": "https://blacklenspub.com/styling-appcompat-button-fab-with-ripple-effect-c6f811eca2f5?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 26, 2016", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "191", "content": "Styling AppCompat Button with Ripple\u00a0EffectTravis PBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 26, 2016No Drawables RequiredThis story is available in ThaiWe all love AppCompat, right?

The demo will use buttons.<button ripple>Interact with me</button>Thinking about the effect. We need some form of container for our ripples.<button ripple>  Interact with me  <div class=\"ripple--container\"></div></button>Each ripple will be a span element within the container.We could do this with CSS pseudo elements but the effect won\u2019t be as anticipated as we can only use one instance of\u00a0:before/:after at a time.The solution we are going to use is that on mousedown the ripple effect will fire from the point where our user clicks within a button. This involves creating a span whose default styling will animate the ripple.Imagine a user spam clicks our button, the effect would be similar to<button ripple>  Interact with me  <div class=\"ripple--container\">    <span style=\"top: 5px; left: 20px;\"></span>    <span style=\"top: 5px; left: 20px;\"></span>    <span style=\"top: 5px; left: 20px;\"></span>    <span style=\"top: 5px; left: 20px;\"></span>  </div></button>JSThink what we need to do with our script.Add the ripple container to our buttons.Upon mousedown, add spans with the correct positioning to that container.Debounce the mouseup event to allow our ripple effect to fully animate before cleaning out all the span tags from our buttons.(Note; I\u2019ve implemented a simple debounce function for the code which I won\u2019t cover here but you could use something like lodash for this. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with debouncing a function call, you can check out some info here.)var ripples = document.querySelectorAll(\u2018[ripple]\u2019),  rippleContainer,  ripple;for (i = 0, len = ripples.length; i < len; i++) {  ripple                    = ripples[i];  rippleContainer           = document.createElement('div');  rippleContainer.className = 'ripple--container';  ripple.addEventListener('mousedown', addRipple);  ripple.addEventListener('mouseup'  , debounce(cleanUp, 2000));  ripple.rippleContainer    = rippleContainer;  ripple.appendChild(rippleContainer);}We iterate over our buttons and add the ripple container to each, binding our mousedown/mouseup events.addRipple = function(e) {  var ripple = this,    size     = ripple.offsetWidth,    pos      = ripple.getBoundingClientRect(),    rippler  = document.createElement('span'),    x        = e.pageX - pos.left - (size / 2),    y        = e.pageY - pos.top  - (size / 2),    style    = 'top:' + y + 'px; left:' + x + 'px; height: '              + size + 'px; width: ' + size + 'px;';  ripple.rippleContainer.appendChild(rippler);  rippler.setAttribute(\u2018style\u2019, style);};Our addRipple function grabs the element position and uses this in conjunction with the click coordinates to calculate the new span positioning within the button.For example, if a user clicked in the middle of a 100 by 100px button, the span positioning would be 50px both top and left.cleanUp = function() {  var container = this.rippleContainer;  while (this.rippleContainer.firstChild) {    container.removeChild(container.firstChild);  }};The cleanUp function will clear out the span elements once the last ripple animation has finished. This is ensured via the use of a debounce.CSSThe styling is relatively simple. We just need to ensure that our container and button will contain our animated rippling span elements and that our spans produce the correct ripple effect.[ripple] { position: relative; overflow: hidden;}[ripple] .ripple--container { position: absolute; top     : 0; right   : 0; bottom  : 0; left    : 0;}[ripple] .ripple--container span { transform       : scale(0); border-radius   : 100%; position        : absolute; opacity         : 0.75; background-color: #fff; animation       : ripple 1000ms;}@keyframes ripple { to {   opacity  : 0;   transform: scale(2); }}Span elements will start off at a scale size of 0 and the animation will scale them up to double their size.", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "Ripple Surging While PayPal Goes After Crypto\u00a0Patent", "author_name": "Michael K.

Meanwhile PayPal filed for a patent related to Bitcoin.The company\u2019s patent filing was for an \u201cexpedited virtual currency transaction system\u201d. PayPal is definately eyeing a way to boost the speed of cryptocurrency payments; with speculation even the likes of Facebook might enter the cryptocurrency realm. Coinbase has seen customer complaints more than double in January, as its number of users surged in December 2017.Bitcoin\u2019s rebound from an ugly start to 2018 is up to its highest point in a while at $11,677.80 but it\u2019s Ripple that is truly surging of late up again over $1.04.Coinbase Will Likely Start Supporting RippleRumours that Coinbase will start to support Ripple have added to the fuel of speculation around it\u2019s progress. South Korean banks have okayed Ripple as it enters the mainstream already there after reports of successful tests of Ripple remittance.The price of the third-largest cryptocurrency Ripple, was up by total value is up 16 percent based on the Coinbase\u00a0rumor.Cross Border Payments set to be DisruptedIt\u2019s safe to say that major U.S. exchange could be next on the list to add support for XRP trading. We know that in terms of order of magnitude, the dollars transferred in the cross-border payment market unsurprisingly, dwarfs the value of every market in existence. This means of course that Ripple could integrate into the mainstream banking infrastrucutre the easiest of any cryptocurrency since the value proposition in the real-world is so high.As recently as the end of 2015, balances tied up globally in nostro accounts exceeded $27 trillion. As the world shifts from wealth stranded in the fossil fuel economy and moves to the green tech economy, that will represent a major shift of funds. In that sense, Ripple could have a very concrete future.The traditional cross-border payment systems was always going to be one of the ways that distributed ledger technology as going to disrupt, enter blockchain solutions.There are over 39 Billion XRP coins already in circulation so it makes perfect sense for Coinbase to start to integrate with them. Stellar and Ripple are hot in 2018, and the price is right. It\u2019s market cap is now about $41.05 billion. So far Coinbase offers trading for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ether, so by adding XRP, it could enable a new outlet for retail trading.Coinbase is the leading U.S. marketplace for buying and selling major digital currencies, though this could change as the cryptocurrency markets and apps are still very nascent.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Ripple Effects, No, and Chips On Shoulders\u2026", "author_name": "John Cutler", "link": "https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/ripple-effects-no-and-chips-on-shoulders-a4037b683f81?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 24, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "233", "content": "Ripple Effects, No, and Chips On Shoulders\u2026John CutlerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 24, 2018A little narrative\u2026.I\u2019m not sure the C-suite truly understand how their decisions impact the team! It\u2019s easy to ask for that in a conference room\u2026but someone will need to DO the work. The just don\u2019t stop to think about the blast radius for their decisions.Interesting. Did someone push back and explain the impact on the team?Not really. We did hint at it though, but they kept pushing and we retreated. First, it would take a while to explain. Second, by opening that door, you open the door to tons of micromanagement. I\u2019d have to answer \u201cso what is X working on\u201d for every member of the team. Or we\u2019ll have to go line by line and give a wishy washy estimate on every line-item.That all makes sense. So it sounds like you just want to say \u201cnot now\u201d, and for that to be taken on face value. You want leadership to just trust you?Sure. I mean who doesn\u2019t want to be trusted? I just think they\u2019re not aware of how much we actually have on our plate at the moment. And that what they\u2019re asking for isn\u2019t as simple as they think.Why don\u2019t they know what you have on your plate? I\u2019m assuming the team isn\u2019t slacking, right?We\u2019ve got a TON on our plate. And I\u2019ll be honest, it isn\u2019t moving all that quickly. Part of the reason we have a ton on our plate, is that we keep saying yes to this stuff. There\u2019s a ton of support needed for legacy decisions. And the slower we go, the more time they have to come up with new ideas. Honestly, I somehow feel it is not in my best interest to say no\u2026we have a culture of being proactive here.Is anyone slacking?No. Not at all. I mean\u2026well, ok, I have doubts about this one team, and we did have this embarrassing misstep\u2026but overall\u2026OK. And about the complexity? Why would they assume it is simple?Ugh. When we bring up the complexity, we have to bring up all of the tech debt we\u2019re currently managing. And the complexity of the current org structure\u2026all of these handoffs. They\u2019re tired of hearing about it. I mean on some level it SHOULD be simpler, but not nearly as simple as they think. Honestly, the last time they did something similar was like 20 years ago. The world has changed. They just don\u2019t get it\u2026BUT, there\u2019s an ounce of truth in what they\u2019re saying.Backing up I\u2019m hearing a couple things. I\u2019m hearing that you should probably say No, but that saying No doesn\u2019t feel like an option. You\u2019ve dropped hints, and they aren\u2019t biting. Leadership has some cause to ask questions, but they\u2019re also somewhat complicit in the problem. You\u2019re eager to please and don\u2019t want to be pegged as obstructionist. It sounds like a wicked loop of sorts.Who will break the cycle? Someone should break the cycle, right? As long as this persists, things will just get worse and trust and confidence will degrade further.Hmmm. I see what you mean. Someone needs to take the high road it sounds like. And swallow their pride. I guess I could do that?At the moment they have absolutely no sense of the business impact of their decisions. I\u2019d say that as a first step you need to establish some flow in the system, even if that means putting some items on hold. And then lower utilization rates such that emerging opportunities like this can be addressed with minimal disruption.But I mean that will require us to be way more transparent. And tell stakeholders that their work in on hold. I\u2019m worried they will micromanage everything. They\u2019ll think we are crazy!You have to start. You have to take the high road. They don\u2019t know how this works. You do. You need to show the way. You need to ask them to take a risk on you, and then\u200a\u2014 in return\u200a\u2014 show them some positive results. I know having the burden of proof SUCKS. It probably seems unfair.It does. It just feels like I should be trusted to do what I am trained to do\u2026Stepping back, have your explained, for example, how much all those legacy product decisions cost to maintain? How do these interruptions impact throughput capacity? How have cycle times suffered as debt increased? How is high WIP impacting the team?Not really\u2026So now is a good time to start.

I\u2019ve always been a loner and that could be attributed to the times I spent in my room as a child\u200a\u2014\u200afinding ways to entertain myself. The first words I shared came in the form of poetry\u200a\u2014\u200aeven before I understood the stylings.The sublet I\u2019ve been inhabiting for about a year\u200a\u2014\u200asuddenly became too small this past week\u200a\u2014\u200awhen I was up every night\u200a\u2014\u200abattling a sinus congestion. We\u2019ve battled the symptoms of very bad colds\u200a\u2014\u200athat leave us restless for any level of relief. This time my nostrils were closing in on me with the audacity of something much more potent and deadly.Around 11:49 pm on a Thursday night\u200a\u2014\u200aI began to perspire with urgency as the panic attack of labored breathing and sporadic dizziness tossed me out of bed and into the arms of nothing but the air that I couldn\u2019t breathe.As I paced around the tiny studio in the dark\u200a\u2014\u200aI started imagining a scenario that would put me near someone who lives for the moments of distress that call for that tender loving care. For the first time in like forever\u200a\u2014\u200aI felt truly rejected and vulnerable to the inconsistencies of being conveniently single\u200a\u2014\u200auntil it\u2019s no longer ideal.The breathing exercise didn\u2019t work and I was back at my bedside searching for my phone. I found it on the floor and picked it up as I turned on the light and noticed that it was way past midnight. The silence was deafening as my beating heart provided the soundtrack to my impending doom.What if I died here\u200a\u2014\u200aall alone\u200a\u2014\u200ain my tank top and roomy underwear\u200a\u2014\u200awith my eyes wide open in disbelief and my cold skin\u200a\u2014\u200adamp with the sweat that I worked up for nothing?We spend every waking hour keeping ourselves occupied with the tools that are tasked with that exact mission\u200a\u2014\u200aand when push comes to shove\u200a\u2014\u200aand we\u2019re faced with the reality of our common existence\u200a\u2014\u200athere\u2019s a deep sadness that erupts at the prospect of suffering alone.I survived the long and weary night with the growing suspicion that I was either suffering the effects of a mold-infested compartment\u200a\u2014\u200aor my nostrils were chronically dried out from the over-indulgence of a favorite habit.Either way\u200a\u2014\u200aI needed to get\u00a0out.I found the exit via my one of my oldest friends who looks twenty-five but is actually much older. She got the call and readily answered\u200a\u2014\u200aand so off I went.Los Angeles isn\u2019t New York City.You can\u2019t spontaneously hop on a train and end up where you need to be in record time. But, I managed to get the bus to appear just when I needed it the most\u200a\u2014\u200aand the ride was a haze of stuffiness and the triumph of keeping my eyes open long enough to spot my stop at the bottom of the hill.When the door swung open\u200a\u2014\u200athe relief of familiarity overcame me as I stumbled in and plopped on the couch with no words and a face featuring a thousand words. Her adorable grandson\u200a\u2014\u200awho was already used to me was in the bedroom\u200a\u2014\u200agaming.The peace of not being alone in a time of confusion borne from a crisis that was unfolding into unknown territory was both comforting and loving.Some people turn to social media for the attention of strangers that can possibly relate to the current storm that doesn\u2019t seem to be passing by\u200a\u2014\u200aregardless of time limits. I could\u2019ve been sprawled out on my couch\u200a\u2014\u200aheaving from the dry air\u200a\u2014\u200aand posting threads of how and why I was still active\u200a\u2014\u200aat an ungodly hour.Instead, I chose to be around the support system of a a dear friend who made me feel like I wasn\u2019t the loneliest girl in The Valley.The next day\u200a\u2014\u200abrought new adventures\u200a\u2014\u200aas my physical calamity was still very much in effect\u200a\u2014\u200abut not as stifling as it would\u2019ve been if I were trudging along with no witnesses.We decided to head out to the J. Paul Getty Museum\u200a\u2014\u200aa gorgeously erected haven that caters to anyone with enough time and energy to spare. It\u2019s an impressive spread that has enough charm to envelop the attention of amazingly hyper eight-year-olds.The three of us entered the tram and watched the traces of our movements against the picturesque backdrop. Once we disembarked it was straight to the business of mid-afternoon exploration under the tutelage of a kid that reminded me so much of who I was when our ages matched.As with most young boys\u200a\u2014\u200ahe wanted to stay outside\u200a\u2014\u200awith the elements that he could dance with to our thunderous applause. Outside sculptors, pillared fountains and ornamented structures\u200a\u2014\u200aglistened in the sun and provided the fanciful maze that we adhered to\u200a\u2014\u200awith the assistance of a boy who was too young to comprehend how his privilege could possibly be handicapped\u200a\u2014\u200aat short notice.I couldn\u2019t stop smiling outwardly as I nursed the renderings of Tamir Rice\u200a\u2014\u200aand how he would have enjoyed a day like this\u200a\u2014\u200aif only he hadn\u2019t been sucked into the betrayal of his controversial demeanor.My nostrils were slowly making way for some much needed deep breaths and the reassurance of an overdue break-through. My friend and I were eager to head inside\u200a\u2014\u200abut her little one needed more time to make wishes\u200a\u2014\u200awith the aid of coins and pebbles that needed to be dramatically thrown into the fountain.When he ran out\u200a\u2014\u200aI provided more and the ritual continued\u200a\u2014\u200aonly this time\u200a\u2014\u200aI paid attention.I gleefully mentioned \u201cthe ripple effect\u201d and he immediately jumped into the contest of creating the best there ever was. His childish reaction only helped to intensify the imagery of hits. I could see the waves of love responding on contact\u200a\u2014\u200aand confirming my healing disposition.The security of family that can be man-made when the feelings are easy enough to define. I had to recall the first time I met one of the most important women in this boy\u2019s life. It was a little over a decade ago\u200a\u2014\u200awe were two of four Black women working at one of the top talent agencies in the business and she was the only one who stopped by to introduce herself.I was sold after that. We bonded and even during trying times\u200a\u2014\u200awe managed to forge a sisterhood that saw us through the periods of duress, which inadvertently created the seal of life-long commandments.After the coin tossing stint wore off\u200a\u2014\u200awe veered off to other pastures and during a short interlude\u200a\u2014\u200aI observed my darling friend with the grandson who naturally looks like her son\u200a\u2014\u200aand made the mental snapshot.Nice view!Family extends past the blood vows that are uttered without\u00a0consent.I have my people and I love them dearly\u200a\u2014\u200aand even though they are far away\u200a\u2014\u200aI still summon the validity of how they apply when nostalgia creeps in. But, when the present leaves you scarily breathless and in need of care\u200a\u2014\u200ayou are bound to a commitment that brews more satisfaction than a last minute booty call.The ripple effect is no coincidence and it happens from learned interference and the openness of strangers who can\u2019t wait for your ever-evolving profile to complete its desired numbers\u200a\u2014\u200abefore reaching out.They choose to add you to the spreading virus of humanity and the possibility of a casual lunch turning into the building blocks of life\u2019s offerings.She had a child who had a child\u200a\u2014\u200aand being able to partake in that joy was heart-wrenchingly symbolic in a way that evoked my feelings of dread as I ceremoniously conceded my inability to ever replicate what she has conceived.Despite the regrets of not being impregnated at just the right time or not being able to recruit the crush from back when such a thing was my thing\u200a\u2014\u200aI was still able to breath again with the help of open spaces and the two champs that surrounded me with tender loving care.At the end of the day\u200a\u2014\u200athe lowered sun led us to separate places and I was controlled by the calm of knowing that no matter how alone I will feel when I step out of the car and wave goodbye\u200a\u2014\u200athere was no escaping the effect of being embedded in the memory of the boy\u200a\u2014\u200awho created a masterpiece when he threw the pebble in the water and walked away with pride.The love continues without me and when he remembers I will be alive again\u200a\u2014\u200aand it won\u2019t require millions of dollars or million dollar installations.It\u2019s the ripple effect. It\u2019s art teaching art how to be artfully humane.

Woah. If you want to read our shorter, 5 minute summary of Ripple, click here.IntroductionRipple as a token has been in circulation since 2012. During this time ICOs were essentially non-existent so this will be the first time we do a review on a company that didn\u2019t have an ICO, but a strategy that involved multiple partnerships, clients, and movement of tokens.Ripple is trying to revolutionize payment systems through its platform. They described the current banking system as \u201cslow, limited in transparency and expensive\u201d. And therefore claim that it is also inadequate as a Global Payment System. Their idea is to reduce these barriers of entry to enable global payment to become a truly worldwide activity. And so RippleNet was born.Talk is cheap, but Ripple has been able to deliver on their promises by partnering with some of the most successful investors in silicon valley, as well as multiple international banking institutions, regulators, and leaders in technology, such as Google and MIT.RippleNetRippleNet is the name given to the Global Payment System of Ripple. It creates a global network of banks in which people can send and receive payments through Ripple technology. They claim the system to have real-time messaging, clearing, and \u201cgross settlement certainty\u201d of transactions.Gross Settlements is the name given to the transfer of funds or securities between two banks. Gross refers specifically to the ability to enable those transactions to happen one-by-one instead of sending them as a bulk, for example if banks sent all their transactions of one day at the end of each day.The way it works is by forming partnerships between banks to have access to the RippleNet network. Once a participating bank is part of the network, users around the world can interact with that bank through their own local RippleNet-enabled Bank. Users refers to corporations, individuals, and other organizations looking to participate in banking activities.The advisory team alone for RippleNet includes members of 6 different banks (and counting).Image under caption: RippleNet Banking advisory members, from Page 14 of RippleNet Brochure\u00a0(PDF)Furthermore RippleNet has a series of products:xCurrent: Payment ProcessingxRapid: Source of liquidityxVia: Payment originationxCurrentEnables payment processing between banks.

Anyone can come up with an idea, but execution is the real difficulty. As a two-sided market business, Ripple requires both Supply (Banks) and Demand (Users, Businesses). In order to succeed they need to get the Supply side first, and that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve done.The list of banks that Ripple has as customers continues to grow, the current list is quite impressive, and it is one of the main reasons that the price of Ripple has been shooting as high as it is.Image Caption: Ripple Customer Sample from Page 15 of RippleNet BrochureHistoryPrice of Ripple from January 2014 to January 4th, 2018. Price from CoinMarketCap.com found\u00a0here.Ripplepay14 years ago, in 2004, before bitcoin was created, Ripplepay was a service created by Ryan Fugger to allow swapping of credit between trusting participants. Essentially if someone owed you $10, they could create an IOU worth $10 and if someone else trusted that person, you could then use that as IOU as $10 with that third party. This is also the way current banks operate and is one of the building blocks of the current financial system. This is a relatively simple concept and even cash notes are essentially IOUs just all issued by the same entity, i.e a bank/govt.This is very different from bitcoin, which is a trustless cash system, where you don\u2019t require trust between two transacting parties, but you do require some form of verification that the asset being traded (in this case bitcoin) cannot be double-spent. If you could double-spend the same bitcoin, it is essentially like counterfeiting banknotes and obviously that is a problem.However, in the above a payment system described by ripple, you do need trust. If I owe Bob money, a third party, Alice does not need to trust Bob to believe that my debt is valid, she only needs to trust me. You can\u2019t issue debt to someone who does not trust you. So, you need to set a trust line, or a credit limit, that defines to what extent you trust which participant. Trust lines can \u201cripple\u201d through a network, allowing trading of IOUs with participants you may not know, but with whom you share trusted intermediaries. If Bob and Alice both trust me, Bob could pay Alice with an IOU that I issued to Bob.Ripple on the BlockchainAfter the introduction of bitcoin to the world, Ripple began development of a blockchain based payment network similar to their existing product, however instead of bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work ripple used something called global consensus to verify trust, which they explain in the whitepaper leads to faster transaction times and lesser transaction fees.This implementation of global consensus was new, even though the problem it was solving is well established in computer science literature. The validation of trust through consensus is a problem known as the \u201cByzantium general problem\u201d and there are a few protocols which generated a solution for the problem, one of which was ripple\u2019s new global consensus protocol. Another company, Stellar implemented a very similar protocol and came under heat for it in 2014 when a serious bug resulted in transactions being unconfirmed forever, however Ripple vehemently denied that their protocol was the one to blame and that it was an incorrect implementation. However leading cryptologists currently do not agree on whether the protocol is sound or not.The IdeaAs explained in the history section Ripple started out as Ripplepay, a simple debt exchange platform which did not involve any counterparty risks however it required trust between the participants on the network. Thus if Bob trusted Alice and Alice trusted Charlie, the line of trust between Bob and Alice could \u201cripple\u201d through to Charlie and thus allowed Bob\u2019s debt/credit be passed on to Charlie and vice versa.While there was no issue of double-spending with debt (the same person could issue the same debts to two different people and they would just owe two different people money.) However once Ripple started working on a blockchain based verification network. Now a simple problem of having a payment network without any counter-party risk now became a problem of having a system that does not only require trust amongst the network, but also a way to ensure that double spending does not happen (i.e XRP cannot be counterfeited). However how these two pieces fit together is quite complicated so we shall break it down into the following separate sections.The TokenRipple purports these settlement issues are caused by manual settlement done in order to translate one bank\u2019s ledger system\u2019s transactions into another bank\u2019s ledger system. Ripple however introduces something called the interledger protocol which uses a new cryptocurrency (ripple [ XRP]) to settle accounts across two banks differing ledgers, allowing for much faster settlement times.Ripple\u2019s White\u00a0PaperRipple submitted multiple documents and white papers. Some focused on the business development side, such as Ripple Solutions Guide (PDF), and the RippleNet Brochure (PDF). But the company also submitted technical white papers that go very deep into their technology, Consensus algorithm (PDF)\u00a0, and the Interledger Protocol (PDF).Consensus AlgorithmRipple does not use bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work rather it uses a consensus protocol to validate transactions, this new consensus protocol is states in Ripple\u2019s whitepaper for their consensus algorithm. The consensus algorithm was new and unproven when it was initially presented but since then Ripple has carried out several validations for the transactions. This together with the fact that they have partnered with many banks has shown that the consensus algorithm works well for validations of transactions. These validations ensure that there are no double-spends of XRP, however why this needs to be the currency is the real question.Interledger ProtocolThe interledger protocol is specified in Ripple\u2019s whitepaper and is basically the way the ripple network allows for cross-currency remittances. In order to understand the interledger protocol, we need to explain how banks currently issue international remittances. They use different databases as ledgers to make sure that credit and debt assets are tallied in the local native currency. What Ripple does is it settles transactions across multiple ledgers by settling each separate ledger by using XRP as an intermediary currency.ValidatorsIn order to distribute the amount of control that the Ripple corporation exerts over the network, and more importantly, to enable the network to operate, even if Ripple fails as a company, a series of validators have been put in place.Validators (Unique Node Lists) are organizations and/or individuals that can verify a transaction on the Ripple network, so they act as a semi centralized agency. Validators also make sure transactions are not \u201cdouble spent\u201d by agreeing in the order of transactions.Amongst the current validators of the Ripple protocol there are:MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)MicrosoftCGI (Canadian Global Information)And many moreUnfortunately this list is not extensive, and there is a series of nodes and addresses that are not public. So there could be a risk of decentralization, due to the fact that we don\u2019t know if Ripple investors, employees, or the board of directors is part of this elite validators.Token DistributionThis is one of the most criticized aspects of the Ripple protocol. Ripple controls over 50% currently, and once all the XRP have been released into circulation, the ripple company will own exactly 50%.Blockchain TestThe Blockchain test refers to the question of whether or not a company requires the use of the Blockchain in order to be successful. This test was a result of a lot of companies abusing the ICO hype in order to just add the word \u201cToken\u201d after their name. \u201cThe Token for X\u201d model.In principle Ripple needs the Blockchain as an improvement on current banking financial standards. The question is whether or not it was necessary for ripple to create their own cryptocurrency, and whether or not it was a good idea for them to do so in a semi-centralized way with obscure validators. Undoubtedly they could have used bitcoin or any other already pre-existing cryptocurrency to fulfill this role and the introduction of a native currency like XRP leads to a lot of questions as to why the extra currency is necessary.Furthermore, hyperledger which is an open source protocol very similar to the interledger protocol provided by Ripple existed prior, so why Ripple chose not adopt that is a reasonable question. Ripple claims that it is hard to do the kinds of international remittances that it does through the hyperledger protocol due to lack of atomic book transactions, however hyperledger is currently working on exactly that problem, and thus it is an important point to note.Ripple has also created solutions in order to easily transfer their token for others. In 2013 OpenCoin created the \u201cBitcoin Bridge\u201d, which essentially allows users to transfer funds in any currency to a Bitcoin address. Essentially enabling anyone in the world to purchase items in exchange of Bitcoin, without having to own Bitcoin in the first place.The Bridge is one of the most interesting aspects of the Blockchain test for Ripple. It shows a great use of the technology, and also something that almost only Ripple would be able to do, since their global partnerships with banks allow them to provide the multi-currency liquidity and network to provide those services.Traction\u200a\u2014\u200aPerformanceBesides all the activities, products, partnerships, investors, and clients that Ripple has, it is also important to discuss how the token has been performing over the last years in order to demonstrate traction and the validity that people have given the token since its inception.2013\u20132016During this period of time, one of the main engines moving cryptocurrencies forward was the rise and rise of Bitcoin. In the period of August 2013 until December, Bitcoin increased in price from around $80 USD to over $1,000 USD. by March of 2014 the bubble burst, and the price of Bitcoin continued to decline until it reached less than $200 at the beginning of 2015.For many, Ripple was \u201cThe Next Bitcoin\u201d and while Bitcoin was at an all time high people saw the potential for Ripple to become the next best option. As Bitcoin prices crashed, people also lost hope on Ripple, so you can see a very similar price pattern for Ripple during the period of 2013\u20132015. However, during the all-time low of Bitcoin in 2015, many thought Ripple would replace Bitcoin to become the preferred worldwide cryptocurrency, so the price increased inversely to that of Bitcoin.Ripple Price Graph from Coin Market\u2019s Ripple found\u00a0here.Bitcoin Price Graph from Coin Market\u2019s Bitcoin during the same period found\u00a0here.2017This was by far the best year for the Cryptocurrency, and probably the reason you are reading the article now. 2017 became the most important year for investment in cryptocurrencies, so people started looking at the largest and most important ones in the market.Graph from Coin Market\u2019s Ripple found\u00a0here.For many Ripple was going to become the defacto banking cryptocurrency so a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy occurred. In the span of 12 months, the price off Ripple went from $0.006 USD (or about 0.6 cents) to over $3 for every token. This is an increase of about 50,000%. Of course, as the price kept increasing, people kept saying that the price would continue to do so, so more people invested in the currency, and the cycle continued.Part of the reason the token has become so popular recently is social media. As ICOs are becoming more popular and people are investing more, the price of cheap altcoins is attracting a lot of people to invest in it.One of the reasons that Ripple seems to be such a \u201ccheap\u201d token, is due to the massive volume of Ripple tokens that exists in production. Price is relative, and does not take into consideration a tokens total token volume. There are 100 billion tokens, so the price fluctuates much less than if there were 1 million tokens, in comparison there are 16 million Bitcoins, out of the total possible maximum of 21 million.Lately, criticisms have stopped the price from continuing to rise, these criticisms include the centralized nature of the network, the amount of tokens that the team gave to themselves and partners, and technical decisions that put in question the need for Ripple in the first place.TeamTeam History5 years before Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s famous original Bitcoin paper \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d there was Ripplepay (2004). The project was originally created by Ryan Fugge, a software developer from Vancouver.The idea came from working at a stock trading exchange and development began 2004. A year later, Fugge had a working product that enabled consumers to be able to secure transactions over the internet, just 5 years after the internet boom.6 years later, software developers Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz development began to build their own digital currency system through a consensus algorithm. The following in year, in 2012, the new system was incorporated into the new company OpenCoin Inc. Fugge transitioned into helping with the creation of the credit network section of Ripple.As OpenCoin continued to grow and develop Ripple, the team continued to acquire veterans from the finance, software, and venture capital markets. The team now is heavily stacked and connected to both cryptocurrencies and Fintech, which is one of the reasons that has justified their valuation and quick rise so far. Ripple was co-founded by Angel Investor Chris Larsen, and Software Programmer Jed McCaleb. Fugge left his role as a developer at Ripple, and is currently working ICO advisor. His websites mentions he doesn\u2019t have intentions to take new projects related to health conditions (We won\u2019t link his website, as we are sure he currently appreciates privacy).On September of 2013 OpenCoin Inc. changed its name to Ripple Labs Inc. Which is currently the name for the company and main holder of Ripple, and with Chris Larsen as a CEO.The TeamThere are an estimated 2,000 billionaires in the world. Ripple as a company has created at least 3. We find that this is an important point to mention, since our criticism section talks about the distribution of the cryptocurrency amongst its founders, which could potentially created complicated incentives within the company.Ripple\u2019s CEO is Brad Garlinghouse, he\u2019s worked at executive levels at AOL, Yahoo, SBC, and act as CEO of Hightail, and Dalpad Communications. Brad currently owns 6.3% of Ripple, making his net worth a considerable $9.5 billion dollars.Chris Larsen is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, he helped co-found Ripple, as well as multiple FinTech related companies such as E-Loan, OpenCoin, and Prosper Marketplace.Jed McCaleb, is well known for creating largest Bitcoin exchange ever by volume of BTC, the now defunct Mt Gox (hacked after McCaleb sold the company to Mark Karpeles). Jed is now worth $20B from his Ripple\u2019s token and is on the top 40 richest people on the world.The InvestorsRipple has a series of renowned technical investors in silicon valley and worldwide, includingGoogle VenturesAndreessen HorowitzCME VenturesAccentureSantanderNeedless to say the Board of Directors is equally as impressive, and extremely well connected in the financial and banking sectors.How to\u00a0BuyAs one of the largest tokens, Ripple is readily available in a multitude of exchanges. From their website, the exchanges that trade Ripple are:Bitstamp (XRP/USD,EUR,BTC)Kraken (XRP/USD,EUR,BETC)CoinOne (XRP/KRW,BTC)Bitso (XRP/MXN,BTC)Coincheck (XRP,JPY,BTC)Korbit (XRP/KRW)Qryptos (XRP/BTC)Bitbank (XRP/JPY)Bitsane (XRP/USD,EUR,BTC)BTC Markets (XRP/AUD,BTC)LikeBit (XRP/EUR)Bitcoin Co Ltd (XRP/THB)Gatehub (XRP/USD,JPY,CNY,EUR,,BTC,ETH)Bitcoin.co.id (XRP/BTC)Note: different exchanges have different authorization stages, so in some it may become much more difficult to obtain Ripple or other currencies to ultimately obtain Ripple.CriticismsBusiness Decision CriticismsThe amount of Ripple tokens that the cofounders have decided to reward themselves with has been heavily obfuscated by the company. Two of the founders are now billionaires, and one is the 10th wealthiest man in the world now. That money does not come from sales, but instead from the expectation that people have in how the cryptocurrency will behave.In order to mitigate this situation, the founders decided to escrow a large portion of their funds. This way the money will be frozen until certain events trigger the smart contracts to pay the founders. Even with this, hacking incentives to unlock these smart contracts could create incredible greedy situations. Just think about this, what would you do if you knew you are technically the 8th wealthiest people on earth, how far would you go to protect that investment?In May of 2015, the United States\u2019 Financial Crimes Enforcement Network fined Ripple $700,000.\u201cRipple Labs willfully violated several requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by acting as a money services business (MSB) and selling its virtual currency, known as XRP, without registering with FinCEN, and by failing to implement and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program designed to protect its products from use by money launderers or terrorist financiers. XRP II later assumed Ripple Labs\u2019 functions of selling virtual currency and acting as an MSB; however, like its parent company, XRP II willfully violated the BSA by failing to implement an effective AML program, and by failing to report suspicious activity related to several financial transactions.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aFinCEN fines Ripple, through an immediate release found here.Technical CriticismsAs mentioned in the above explanation of how Ripple works, XRP merely acts as the intermediary currency between cross-border ledgers to settle assets for the various banks. Initially this started off as a very centralized version of their consensus protocol with only Ripple as a validator and every transaction was verified by them. However in an effort to decentralize the trust-validation of the currency, they have started to slowly add other validators to the network and begun to dismantle the validators that they control. However this does not mean that the control over the currency is decentralized! Since Ripple (the company) controls the majority of the XRP supply, the power of usage with the currency is very centralized in the company and they control the pricing by controlling the demand/supply market.ConclusionNo matter what happens, Ripple will have a formidable story. It will either become one of the largest financial assets in the next decade, or it will have an incredible implosion and hundreds of millions of dollars will be lost to competitors, corruption, unsolved technological challenges, unused technologies, or a combination of all of these.We are not sure what the future will be, but we will definitely be watching with excitement what happens in this space. We hope this review gives you enough information to start doing your own research in the token, and your own decisions.Certainly one of the most interesting stories, and an incredible series of partners, clients, and team members.", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "India\u2019s Federal Bank Teams Up With Ripple For International Payments", "author_name": "Michael K.

Here we are talking about Private bank, Federal Bank Ltd. in India.Ripple bills itself as a frictionless way to send money globally. Ripple has been aggressive with partnerships yet it\u2019s still debatable how well it\u2019s performing. In a world where three billion people are connected online, Ripple feels more like a real-world blockchain pioneer than a decentralized crypto with XRP.India like China has a complicated relationship to crypto. It isn\u2019t known if the partnership will include cryptocurrency or not, especially since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country\u2019s central bank, issued a statement saying it wouldn\u2019t support the digital currency.The announcement that Ripple has over 200 partners reflects the recently rapid growth of their network of users of their xRapid and xCurrent products, especially among traditional financial companies and banks. So Ripple is essentially a live use case of blockchain tech for remittances and cross-border payments. I\u2019d say that in 2019 the verdict is still out.The confusion between Ripple and XRP really is a sour point of how companies that are totally centralized pretend to have a decentralized aspect. This is the same dynamic that Block.One has with EOS. A certain category of blockchain entrepreneurs decided to play both sides and it\u2019s always made me leary of Ripple and EOS as actually innovative projects.Regardless of the specifics this deal shows India is very pro blockchain. Central banks around the world are looking to bring a digital equivalent of their fiat dollars on the blockchain. We live in a world of banking consortium sand enterprise blockchain systems where places like Japan and China are leading the charge in blockchain integration. It\u2019s great to see Ripple partnering with India.XRP has been declared centralized because the plurality of XRP is in fact owned by Ripple, which created it. However this business model might after all be appropriate for partnerships with banks who might trust this arrangement more. It\u2019s entirely likely Ripple might not be what we think it is.XRP is currently ranked 3rd on Coinmarketcap.com with a price of USD $0.31 and a total market cap of nearly $13 Billion or 17.8% of Bitcoin\u2019s own market cap.

We\u2019ll start with the latter.Hawala: Informal Value Transfer\u00a0SystemHawala is an alternative remittance system that exists outside of (or in parallel with) the traditional financial channels and is based on trust.Not the only informal remittance system (Hawala: Middle East, Afghanistan, Indian Sub-Continent; Hundi: India; \u201cFlying Money\u201d: China, etc.)Not necessarily illegalDoes not entirely exclude banking systemIn Hawala, most of the time, money never crosses border: it is only a journal entry.How it works:Bitcoin: Decentralized Currency as a Medium for Value\u00a0TransferBitcoin is a consensus-based peer-to-peer network that enables a payment system and a completely decentralized currency.

For the last couple of decades, it still takes from 3\u20135 business days to settle a single bank transfer, which is caused by the legacy messaging system used across all banks globally. Moreover, on average banks take 2% fees out of each transaction, which creates enormous overheads that should be covered by individuals and corporations.Ripple aims to resolve these problems by implementing a technology which is based on the blockchain principles. They want to make all payments instant and pre-validated, source the liquidity on-demand unlocking more than $5 trillion in global liquidity, eliminate a 4% payment failure rate, and reduce global $1.6 trillion annual costs for payments down to almost zero.At the same time, their technology can\u2019t be fully considered as Blockchain. Since Ripple maintains a Unique Node List (UNL), there\u2019s a number of trusted nodes deployed solely by Ripple that preserve the integrity of the network and process all payments. The UNL imposes network rules, and if someone deploys his node, it won\u2019t work in tandem with trusted nodes. That means, technology is more centralized, rather than decentralized.What Solutions Does Ripple OfferCurrently, Ripple has 3 solutions intended for banks, SMEs, corporations, and payment providers that fix described problems: xCurrent, xRapid and xVia. We\u2019ll talk more about the first two solutions because the third one works as one standard payment interface that allows avoiding numerous payment networks integrations, which were customly designed by hundreds of banks during their existence.RippleNet by itself can be used without the XRP token, mainly because banks need a new messaging system which comes in the form of the xCurrent solution, that can replace SWIFT. This product easily resolves problems associated with transaction speeds, payment failures, immense transaction costs, but it doesn\u2019t fix low liquidity. And that\u2019s where xRapid comes into play.Breaking down the xRapid solution we can find that it uses the XRP token as the liquidity provider, which eliminates the need of banks to have nostro-accounts scattered all across the world. Nostro-accounts are simply one\u2019s bank accounts that keep a foreign currency at another bank in order to provide sufficient liquidity levels when it comes to international money transfers where foreign-to-local currency exchange is involved.Which means if banks don\u2019t store money in nostro-accounts, then trillions of dollars are released and replaced by XRP token that works as the universal liquidity provider for all financial institutions. Thereby, if banks want their currency exchanges to be liquid they have to use the XRP. That\u2019s the value proposition that Ripple boosts into the market.Price And Capitalization of XRP\u00a0Token:The current XRP market cap is $13,239,875,898 and the trading volume is $797,971,69 ( 195,827 BTC) at the moment of writing this material.

The terms I\u2019ll introduce are not interchangeable. Unfortunately, to grasp Ripple & XRP, we\u2019ll have to define a few fintech terms & concepts.Problem: The Backbone of Our Global Money System Is\u00a0OldIn the age of Facegrams & Snapclouds developers haven\u2019t exactly flocked to revolutionize the way Goldman Sachs or the European Central Bank (financial institutions) move money. This led to these invisible, yet indispensable financial products missing out on a pivotal 10\u201320 years of advancements (such as blockchain technology).Solution: Ripple As Seen Through The Eyes of\u00a0BitcoinBitcoin is a decentralized currency that settles transactions on a single blockchain (general ledger). Bitcoin\u2019s goal is to become the universal currency. Ripple is a bundle/suite of financial enterprise services & products powered by blockchain-like features that provide a centralized, universal currency transaction network. Ripple\u2019s goal is to create a new standard for how all types of \u201cmoney\u201d move. Essentially giving the $5.3T foreign exchange market & the $.12T cryptocurrency market a face-lift. Some of Ripple\u2019s exciting products deliver a real-time gross settle system (RTGS), currency exchange (this is where we\u2019ll see XRP), & a remittance network.RTGS, & The Ripple Transaction Protocol\u00a0(RTXP)Bitcoin guarantees that value has been sent or received. That value is settled in real-time (minus bitcoin delays). In that sense Bitcoin provides a very limited (only bitcoin) real-time (again, delays) gross settlement system (RTGS).Ripple uses something like a global general ledger made up of something like a network of private blockchains. The correct name for these \u201cblockchains,\u201d that represent private & sovereign entities in the Ripple network, is \u201cGateways.\u201d These gateways are the Ripple equivalent to a digital portal that companies & governments use to join the Ripple network. Collectively, this settlement environment is known as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or RippleNet. This is where most of the real hype & fundamental value of Ripple Labs as a company currently lays.What This Means For Governments & CompaniesOnce an entity joins RippleNet, it transacts with other gateways at fractions of the current cost yet at multiple times the current speed. RippleNet also enables said entity to receive payments from any existing currency, cryptocurrency or fiat. See the larger picture here\u200a\u2014\u200aRipple is built to accept any type of entity that moves massive amounts of money around the globe. Such as Apple & Amazon\u2026companies already transacting billions with financial institutions.What This Means For You, I, & The Average ConsumerRipple Labs needs revenue from selling it\u2019s software to customers. People introduced to Ripple are often surprised at how non-friendly the Ripple environment is for the individual consumer. It\u2019s designed that way: don\u2019t be surprised when it\u2019s not easy to buy XRP (later). The two Ripple products we\u2019ve discussed (RippleNet & Gateways) don\u2019t provide any immediate, tangible benefit. But that doesn\u2019t mean that individual consumers won\u2019t benefit from the ripples of, uh, Ripple in one way or another.Currency Exchange, XRP, & The Remittance NetworkIndividuals & entities need to move money around as quickly, safely & cost-effectively as possible. A \u201cremittance\u201d is an individual sending money to a foreign state, where a currency exchange of dollars is required (say, to euros).Banks provide this service. For example, pretend our personal bank account is Wells Fargo. We\u2019re sending dollars to grandma in Mexico, who uses pesos. Best case scenario, Wells Fargo has an ATM where grandma lives. Our remittance remains inside the Wells Fargo network: fast, safe, & cheap. Worst case scenario, grandma lives in a small, rural city with a local bank that doesn\u2019t have dollar liquidity. Now our dollar from Wells Fargo, is forced out of the Wells Fargo network, most likely headed to one of the conglomerate Mexican banks (Banorte), who\u2019ll ultimately provide the dollar liquidity to grandma\u2019s local bank. That\u2019s three networks that our remittance had to travel through. That costs some serious time, money & security.Imagine a scenario where grandma\u2019s local bank & Wells Fargo both have gateways & are part of the RippleNet network. Our remittance stays within the existing network & is once again fast, safe, & cheap. With both global banks & central banks joining the RippleNet, it\u2019s acting as a super effective remittance network. A key function of this remittance network, as seen above, is to act as a currency exchange between all types of money. However, as you probably guessed, this means that RippleNet has to guarantee liquidity at all times.So How Does RippleNet Guarantee Liquidity Between Gateways of Different Currencies At All\u00a0Times?By creating a bridge currency that\u2019s optimized for transactions in RippleNet. This cryptocurrency, of course, is none other than Ripple\u2019s own XRP. Ripple Labs markets XRP as the fastest & most scalable digital asset built for \u201cproviding source liquidity to banks, payment providers & market makers.\u201d Entities with gateways don\u2019t have to use XRP to transact on the RippleNet, BUT it\u2019s a safe bet that eventually all participating gateways will use XRP at one point.That, is where speculation for the price of XRP comes into play. As an individual consumer peeking into the world of cryptocurrencies, can Ripple provide fundamental value to you now? Unless you\u2019re frequently between currencies or a fintech founder, no; but this in no way detracts from Ripple Labs insanely ambitious goal of revolutionizing the way money moves around the world.Ripple Site\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://ripple.com/\u201cCryptos in 3 Mins.\u201d are cryptocurrency primers dedicated to presenting cryptocurrencies solving real problems in a digestible manner.We\u2019re launching an advanced cryptocurrency research platform @: https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/setcoinsIf you\u2019d like to join a Facebook group for all things cryptocurrency, you can find me at -> https://www.facebook.com/groups/182090605649890/", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Token valuation: The misunderstood importance of token economics (or why XRP is worthless)", "author_name": "Jose Maria Macedo", "link": "https://medium.com/@zemacedo/token-valuation-the-misunderstood-importance-of-token-economics-or-why-xrp-is-worthless-6b1b9ce5605f?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 13, 2018", "readtime": "13 min read", "upvotes": "571", "content": "Token valuation: The misunderstood importance of token economics (or why XRP is worthless)Jose Maria MacedoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 13, 2018Looking at the terminology used to understand and value tokens, a large part of it is lifted directly from the stock market/equity valuation, despite the fact that equities and tokens are fundamentally different kinds of assets. Indeed, while we may refer to both a token and an equity\u2019s \u201cmarket cap\u201d as the number of shares or tokens in circulation multiplied by the share or token\u2019s price, this apparent similarity only serves to obfuscate the fundamental difference between these types of assets and leads to misunderstandings and mistakes in the valuations of cryptoassets.Note: For the sake of this article, I\u2019ll be referring to utility rather than security tokens. Security tokens function in a very similar way to equities and are not really subject to the same distinctions and problems (i.e. they aren\u2019t as interesting).Equities represent legal ownership of an underlying company, whereas tokens represent the currency used to pay for a certain utility in an underlying protocol, platform or ecosystem. As such, when valuing an equity we need only analyse the underlying company and its ability to generate cashflows as we are assured to possess a legal ownership claim on the company\u2019s cashflows. On the other hand, when valuing a token we must look not just at supply and demand for the underlying protocol, but also at the token\u2019s economic model to ensure the price of the token is correlated to demand for the underlying protocol.In this article I\u2019ll cover this fundamental difference between equities and tokens in more depth before going over some real world examples of how this applies in practice when valuing tokens.The difference between equities and tokensWhat is an equityOwning an equity (also known as stock or share) is effectively equivalent to owning a percentage of the underlying company represented by that stock. This ownership itself is a legal construction in that the legal system recognises certain rights for equity holders which are enforceable in court. Effectively, an equity gives its owner a legal claim to a proportionate amount of a company\u2019s cashflows, whether that be in the form of actual cashflows such as dividends or \u201cfrozen\u201d cashflows in the form of assets.Valuing an equitySince an equity represents ownership which the legal system defines as giving right to a claim on a company\u2019s cashflows, its no wonder that equity valuation is based primarily on a company\u2019s ability to produce cashflows. Indeed, if a company is making a profit or in other words has positive earnings, investors may look at a company\u2019s Price to Earnings ratio which is simply the price paid for a company\u2019s cashflows. In case a company doesn\u2019t have earnings or has negative earnings, investors may speculate on the probabilities and magnitudes of the company\u2019s future cashflows (as venture capitalists and other early stage investors do) or otherwise look at a company\u2019s assets (as value investors do), which can be seen as \u201cfrozen\u201d cashflows to be unlocked either willingly or forcefully in the case of liquidation. In every case, investors are focussed on the ability of the company to produce cashflows as the primary valuation metric.While investors may also look at revenues, they are only of interest alongside an analysis of the company\u2019s ongoing cost structure such that investors can determine whether the company will be able to earn a profit on those revenues at some point in the future and generate cashflows for shareholders. As Peter Thiel famously said: a company creates X dollars of value and captures Y% of that value. X and Y are independent variables. As such, revenues can be seen as the value created by a company whereas earnings/profits can be seen as the value captured by the company.Big piece of a small pie: Value is created through revenue and captured through profit. Whereas all US airlines put together created much more value than google, they were 100x worse at capturing that value and their market cap (valuation) was thus only a quarter of Google\u2019s.What is a token?A token, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t represent any ownership in an underlying company. In fact, a token may not even necessarily have an underlying company or legal entity. So what are tokens? Most broadly, tokens can be seen to represent currency used to pay for a certain utility in an underlying protocol, platform or ecosystem which they power. Specifically, tokens either have a certain use case in the protocol (i.e. Steem\u2019s token used to stake in order to be able to work for the network) or otherwise serve as medium of exchange in the project\u2019s ecosystem (i.e. Powerledger\u2019s POWR token used to buy and sell energy on the platform).An example of a medium of exchange token is casino chips which are used as currency which can only be used to pay for gambling at the\u00a0casino.Store credit such as Sainsbury\u2019s nectar points is another example of a utility token which can only be used to pay for goods at Sainsbury\u2019s.Valuing a tokenSince a token represents utility or currency in the protocol, token valuation must be based on the supply and demand for that particular protocol. However, this alone isn\u2019t enough. Because, unlike an equity, a token doesn\u2019t entitle its owner to any legal ownership of the underlying protocol (and the protocol itself may not even generate cashflow) but is rather simply the currency used to pay for a certain utility in the protocol, a token\u2019s value must depend not just on demand for the protocol but also on the degree of correlation between demand for the protocol and demand for the token itself.To put this in different terms, we can say that a given protocol creates X dollars of value but only Y% of X is captured through its token. X and Y are independent variables. Effectively, we can think of the value created by the protocol as the \u201crevenue\u201d and the value captured by the token as \u201cprofits\u201d. Just as with equities, it\u2019s not enough to merely look at X, the value created by the protocol but we must also to look at Y, the value created by the protocol which is captured by the token.In order to determine what Y is for an equity, we must look at it the underlying company\u2019s cost structure. To determine what Y is for a token, we must look at the token\u2019s economic model (more on this later).Practical consequences and examplesThis may all seem slightly arcane and theoretical so I\u2019ll now give some examples of how this distinction applies in practice, using particular projects as examples. Specifically, I\u2019ll be looking for projects in which the correlation between demand for the protocol and demand for the token is weak or in other words the protocol creates $X of value but only a small % of that X is captured by the token.Example 1: RippleThe best example of this is probably Ripple. Ripple Labs (i.e. the company behind the XRP token) has invented a blockchain-based protocol called Ripple Network which aims to replace the SWIFT protocol in bank to bank transfers. Given SWIFT currently processes $5T a day in trans-country currency exchange or over a quadrillion dollars a year, Ripple\u2019s total addressable market is huge. Ripple Labs has already signed partnerships with over 100 financial institutions worldwide who pay it to use its Ripple Network service. By all accounts, Ripple Labs seems like an extremely promising and successful company.However, as we\u2019ve discussed, while the success of Ripple Labs the company raises the value of its equity, it doesn\u2019t necessarily raise the value of its token XRP. XRP doesn\u2019t represent any ownership stake in Ripple Labs and indeed all the evidence seems to indicate that demand for the XRP token is extremely uncorrelated to demand for the Ripple protocol.XRP serves three main purposes: (1) it can be used as a bridge currency for banks to settle international transactions with (2) it is burned to pay for transaction fees and (3) it is required as a small reserve for any address using the network. Of these, only (1) would provide any significant demand for XRP as the latter two serve primarily as anti-spam measures and long-term supply constraints. However, Ripple Labs doesn\u2019t force banks to use XRP as a bridge currency and as a result almost none of them do as they use digital IOUs instead. In fact, some sources indicate that Ripple\u2019s xRAPID system (the only one that uses the XRP token) currently only has one small user and one pilot.As a result, only (2) and (3) are left which provide minimal value to XRP. For (3), while each account is required to hold a small reserve, thus constraining supply and increasing price of XRP, this reserve is currently only 20XRP (~$17 as of 29/04/2018) per account. Even with 10M accounts (8x the current amount), this would only lock up 200,000,000XRP or 0.02% of total supply; a tiny deflationary force. For (2), while some XRP is burned to pay for transaction fees, thus constraining supply and increasing the price of XRP, the current transaction fee is only 0.00001 XRP which means that only 10XRP tokens need to be destroyed if a bank wants to settle 1M transactions in a year. In fact, only 0.00526% has been burned in transaction fees so far and daily destruction rate is an average of ~8K XRP. At this rate, even in 100 years only 0.29% of total supply of XRP will be burned. Even if we assumed a 100K daily destruction rate (10x more than the current daily destruction rate), in 100 years only 3.65% of total supply of XRP would be destroyed. Once again, a tiny deflationary force.As a result, this is a clear case in which demand for the protocol (i.e. Ripple Network) is only very weakly correlated to demand for the XRP token. Whereas Ripple Labs may create immense value for its customers, almost none of this value seems to be captured by the XRP token.Example 2: Celsius NetworkCelsius Network is a crypto-collateralised lending platform. For those who don\u2019t know, these platforms allow users to deposit cryptocurrency as collateral, let\u2019s say $150 of ETH, and receive loans paid into their bank account, let\u2019s say $100. If ETH drops in value such that it comes within X% of leaving me undercollateralised, the platform automatically sells my ETH, pays off the loan and sends me any leftovers. This loan model allows much lower interest rates on loans than than the credit check model as there\u2019s virtually no due diligence required which reduces costs and since collateral is provided and automatically sold through smart contracts the risk of default is also far lower. Also, once other assets (i.e. houses or cars) are registered onto the blockchain and possess liquid markets, these can be used as collateral in the same way.While this is a very promising space and I believe the platforms and protocols in it will create significant value, given the current token economics only a small percentage of this value will actually be captured by the token. This is because loans on the platform are issued and paid off in FIAT and, in the case of Celsius, only the interest rate and fees are paid in the CEL token. As such, even if Celsius is extremely successful, demand for the protocol is high and $1B worth of loans are processed through it every year, only a small percentage of this (equivalent to the 5\u20137% paid in interest rates and the 0.5% paid in fees) will actually comprise demand for the token. This is a case in which demand for the token is weakly correlated with demand for the platform and as such demand for the token is always likely to lag significantly behind demand for the platform.Sentinel Chain seeks to use RFID chips to register livestock to the blockchain and allow the unbanked in developing countries to use their livestock as loan collateral, turning \u201cdead capital\u201d into a fungible\u00a0asset.Example 3: CoinseedCoinseed is a service which allows users to make micro-investments in cryptocurrencies by connecting to their credit cards and automatically collecting the \u201cspare change\u201d on their purchases, rounding them up to the nearest dollars. For instance, a user connects his credit card to CoinSeed and purchases a coffee for $2.30, his purchase is automatically rounded up to $3 and the $0.7 remainder is invested onto the platform. In addition, the platform also has a portfolio leaderboard showing the portfolios with the best returns and allows users to instantly convert their existing portfolio to any other on the leaderboard, charging a 1% fee for doing this. I\u2019ll refer to this as the \u201cportfolio conversion\u201d feature.While this is an interesting idea with many companies already successfully offering this service for the stockmarket (i.e. Acorns, Stash, Clink and Moneybox), the token economics ensure that only a small percentage of the value created by the platform will be captured by the token. The CSD token serves no purpose on the platform and will entitle holders to 50% of the revenues from the fees captured from the portfolio conversion feature. Leaving aside the fact that this token not pass the Howey test and almost certainly qualifies as a security, the token\u2019s value will rely solely on how often users actually use the portfolio conversion feature. Even if the platform becomes successful and a significant number of users sign up for the core service of micro-investing their spare change, there\u2019s no guarantee they will also want to use the portfolio conversion feature. As such, demand for the protocol itself (i.e. investing spare change into cryptocurrencies) is only very weakly correlated to demand for the CSD token. Indeed, the token\u2019s value doesn\u2019t rely on the success of the platform but rather on the success of the specific portfolio conversion fee.Example 4: Swiss Alps MiningSwiss Alps Mining is seeking, among other things, to build a P2P marketplace for the purchase of energy. However, the whitepaper mentions that its token SAM is not the sole currency used on the platform as purchasers will also be able to use FIAT to purchase energy on the marketplace. This means growth in demand for the purchase of energy on the platform will not necessarily correlate to increased demand for the SAM token as these services could be paid for in FIAT instead.In general, any project whose native token is not the sole currency on the platform/protocol creates serious problems for the token\u2019s value as users do not need the token in order to use the platform.Tokens and equity as competing value capture mechanismsAn interesting corollary of this is that equities and tokens are effectively competing for the fixed amount of value created by a company, entity or protocol. Since they are both value capture mechanisms, a company that has valuable equity will necessarily have a less valuable token and vice versa.For instance, let\u2019s take the example of Ripple vs Ethereum. Ripple Labs has valuable equity since it owns ~60 % of all Ripple in existence (worth around $18B at time of writing) and also generates significant (albeit undisclosed) revenues by charging banks to use its protocol. As a result, XRP token is necessarily less valuable since much of the value created by Ripple Network is being captured through cashflows by Ripple Labs\u2019s equity. The Ethereum foundation on the other hand owns around 1% of all ETH in circulation (worth around $457M at time of writing) and does not generate any cashflows. As a result, its equity is not nearly as valuable as Ripple Labs but the Ether token is worth much more since all the value created by it captured by the token.There are some mechanisms that can be put in place in order to increase the value of the token compared to the equity. For instance, a company can charge for its services in FIAT and use its earnings/cashflows to purchase tokens and burn them (thus reducing the supply of the token and putting upward pressure on the price), effectively transferring value from the equity to the token. Alternatively, a company could charge for its services in the native token, then sell that token on the market and distribute that money to shareholders in a dividend. This would lower the value of the token by increasing supply and putting downward pressure on price, effectively transferring value from the token to the equity.The key here is that given a limited amount of value created by a service, tokens and equity are competing to capture as much of that value as possible. As such, we can think of the token used on a protocol and the equity of the company developing the protocol as being inversely correlated, the more value is being captured by cashflows, the more the equity will be worth and the less the token will be worth, and vice versa.This is why the news of Facebook looking into cryptocurrencies is so interesting. If Facebook were to launch a utility token, unless this token created additional value or captured value that Facebook\u2019s equity could not reach, it would necessarily cannibalise the value of Facebook\u2019s equity as the token\u2019s price would effectively be absorbing potential cashflows to Facebook. This begs the question of whether fiduciary duties to shareholders would even render such a move legal.ConclusionI started by describing the differences between equities which imply ownership and a legal claim on cashflows, and tokens which are a currency used to pay for a certain utility on a protocol or platform. I then showed, using the examples of Celsius, Ripple, Coinvest and Swiss Alps Mining, that it\u2019s not enough to simply look at the demand for the protocol or platform itself as we must also consider the token economics to see how much of the value created by the protocol is captured by the token. Finally I showed that tokens and equity can be seen as being in some sense inversely correlated.", "responses": "5"}, {"title": "Ripple Flash Sale on 23 February\u00a02018", "author_name": "Bitbns", "link": "https://medium.com/bitbns/ripple-flash-sale-on-23-february-2018-ed46015075e7?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 18, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "436", "content": "Ripple Flash Sale on 23 February\u00a02018BitbnsBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 18, 2018After the huge success of Stellar flash sale, Bitbns is ready to release its next big XRP flash sale in India.

The Ripple network enables secure, instant and very low cost interbank transactions anywhere in the world.OriginTechnically it is a payment network behind the XRP cryptocurrency, which is simply known as Ripple. Like Bitcoin, Ripple runs in blockchain or blockchain.But Ripple\u2019s network differs greatly from Bitcoin in many ways. Launched in 2012, it is not intended to be used as the main payment unit. Rather, the Ripple network acts as a system to verify and record transactions of all types of assets, including its own XRP currency. And while Bitcoin was founded as a network focused on the contribution of users contributing their own power of computers to process payments in exchange for Bitcoin mining, Ripple is a company that created a number of XRP -99 billion-ready coins for be distributed. These XRP coins can be sold or marketed. Or also used as a gateway between different assets to avoid traditional rates and transaction times.XRP allows transactions at a speed of between 5 and 10 secondsConsidered the cryptocurrency of banks, Ripple is a virtual system of payments in real time based on blockchain technology that is used by financial institutions as a faster and cheaper way than their traditional backup systems, since it allows them to send and receive money and settle transactions at a speed of between 5 and 10 seconds (much faster than Bitcoin). In addition, it allows the conversion between different currencies and cryptocurrencies. This is the story of Ripple and what are its main differences with Bitcoin.The Highlight about the NetworkRipple works differently than many digital currencies. Unlike Bitcoin, which is touted as a way to get away from central banks, Ripple can be actively used as a tool for bank payments. Your network is capable of handling up to 1,500 transactions per second compared to less than 10 with Bitcoin.One of the strengths of Bitcoin is its guarantee of hundred percent encrypted transactions thanks to the blockchain. But that does not make it accessible to hundreds of thousands of potential users. The Ripple network, for its part, wants to fill this gap. Although its technology was initially fully controlled by the startup, it has now begun to distribute to third parties that verify the transactions. This control has led to greater stability during network configuration, according to Ripple.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "#NewCoinAlert: XRP on\u00a0WazirX!", "author_name": "WazirX Bitcoin Exchange", "link": "https://medium.com/wazirx/newfeaturealert-xrp-on-wazirx-5c42e662e75f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 27, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "284", "content": "#NewCoinAlert: XRP on\u00a0WazirX!WazirX Bitcoin ExchangeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 27, 2018Namaste Tribe!

Let\u2019s trade more![Ongoing] Instant INR Withdrawals: We\u2019ll be announcing Instant INR withdrawals this week. Stay tuned. Withdrawing money was never this easy or fast.Maker\u200a\u2014\u200aTaker model: We\u2019re going to start work on a unique Maker\u200a\u2014\u200aTaker concept as part of our trading fees structure. We don\u2019t have a launch date for this yet but we\u2019ll keep you informed. This would be a very innovative take on the maker taker concept and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it. I\u2019ll also announce our trading fees some time this week.Reducing BTC withdrawal fees: We currently charge 0.001 BTC for withdrawals. We might have some time this week to look into it. We\u2019ll be reducing it very very soon.Android and iOS order book indicator: We\u2019re bringing order book indicator on our iOS app and Android app this week. With this, you will be able to see an indicator for your active orders on the market order book. It will have a green/red dot based on the order type. Here\u2019s a sneak peak in the image below. This feature will help you keep track of where your order is on the market. This information will help you figure out your next steps in getting your order executed.WRX updateSince we\u2019ve been busy with the trading platform, we\u2019ve not had the bandwidth to work on WRX. The winner announcement of Alpha Round 2 is pending as well. We\u2019ll announce when we start work on this but we would need more time. Be rest assured, we will build out all the necessary features needed for WRX as well as announce all the use cases of WRX at the right time. But at this point, we should concentrate on building out the trading platform as WRX gets more value only if the trading platform performs well and gets huge trading volumes.Some achievements last\u00a0weekHighest volume day: We had a peak 24 hour total trading volume of over Rs. 25 Lakhs. That\u2019s about double the highest 24 hour trading volume of Week 1. We\u2019re growing and we\u2019re growing fast. Let\u2019s take this to Rs. 1 crore soon, tribe. We\u2019re banking on you to help us do that.Total trades in week 2 increased by over 13% compared to week 1.Average rating on play store increased from 3.469 to 3.841. We\u2019ve been consistently making our apps better every week.Something to\u00a0addWhile volumes have been increasing steadily, our trading platform has been getting smoother and faster and more powerful. The reason why we\u2019re focusing so much on our trading platform is because we want you to have the most powerful trading platform. It\u2019s like this:When you participate in a car race, you better have the most efficient & fastest car. When you participate in trading, you better have the most efficient and fastest trading platform!As we grow, more Indians join the blockchain revolution. This is great for the country and for the blockchain eco-system. Keep inviting more friends and family and keep accumulating more WRX coins. You\u2019ve seen us execute but this is just the beginning. We\u2019re the youngest exchange in India but people all over are already aware about WazirX. Imagine what we can achieve as we move ahead and that will give WRX great value as well. This is your chance to jump in early and accumulate as much WRX as you can with just hard work!We\u2019re India\u2019s most trusted cryptocurrency exchange and we want to be India\u2019s largest. With you by our side, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll achieve this.Jai Hind!Nischal Shetty, CEO\u200a\u2014\u200aWazirX. On a mission to involve every Indian in the blockchain revolution!

I haven\u2019t had a regular job since 2008. During the past eight years I have started four companies with varying degrees of success\u2014from \u201cwell, at least we didn\u2019t lose any money,\u201d to \u201cgeeez, we lost everything but our shirts.\u201dTo me, the startup grind has been an addiction, fueled less by the pursuit of money and more by a strong vocation for building something much larger than any one person\u2026 or company.It is through this ambition that I recently decided to join Ripple, which is more than just a company.For the uninitiated, Ripple is an open standard\u200a\u2014\u200aa payment protocol, a distributed ledger and a global currency\u200a\u2014\u200aall created by an amazing community of devoted developers, engineers, designers and business leaders that I now have the pleasure of working with directly.In many ways Ripple is a continuation of my journey towards creating a more open, accountable and distributed financial world, which began in 2011 when I started mining bitcoin and progressed in 2014 when I co-founded Hedgy.Over the past five years, a paradigm shift has occurred in how the world thinks about money, particularly the transfer of value. Case in point, when was the last time you used cash to pay for something?You\u2019re not alone.Demand for digital payments is outpacing the underlying infrastructure, causing stress on an aging financial system that is growing more prone to security risks, fraud and costly delays.With a world-class team, state of the art technology and impressive market traction, Ripple is leading the charge towards updating the plumbing through which our global money supply flows.In the future, I believe that borders will become more seamless and secure and that the internet of value will bring the world much closer together.I am thrilled to be joining the team that is making this future a reality.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "iOS Ripple effect in React\u00a0Native", "author_name": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Ot\u00e1hal", "link": "https://medium.com/react-native-motion/ios-ripple-effect-in-react-native-30ee97a5aa8c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 29, 2017", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "173", "content": "iOS Ripple effect in React\u00a0NativeJi\u0159\u00ed Ot\u00e1halBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 29, 2017Hey guys! It\u2019s been a while since I wrote an article about animation. I\u2019ve needed to solve a problem with Ripple effect for iOS recently. Here\u2019s tutorial about how I\u2019ve done that.I am currently looking for a new job or project. If you need a help, with either React Native or React, let me know, please\u00a0;) I will be happy to help, learn, discuss, etc. I am available to hire right now! LinkedIn or FacebookThe goal\u00a0\u2026Create a RippleFeedback component that we can use for both Android and iOS. Since the Android version is pretty easy, using TouchableNativeFeedback, we won\u2019t talk about it. Anyway, you can see it in react-native-material-ui.The idea\u00a0\u2026We\u2019ll get a content for a RippleFeedback component as children. In this case it\u2019s a Button component. Then we need to create Background Layer (BL) and Ripple Layer (RL) which is represented by rounded View component (circle). Those views will be wrapped by TouchableWithoutFeedback component, because we still need to provide events like onPress, onLongPress, etc.When I tried this feature on Android I noticed it behaves slightly different for onPress and onLongPress. You will see later in this text.Immediately after onLongPress is called the BL is displayed. When user releases the button BL is animated to default value and in the same time starts Ripple animation (opacity to zero and scale value to 1).onLongPressAfter onPress is called all of these animations happen in the same time. Opacity of BL is animated to maximum value, opacity of RL is animated to zero and RL\u2019s scale value is animated to 1. After all of these animations are finished, BL is animated to default value (zero) and RL is reset to default values. Note that they are animated and reset. You will see why we don\u2019t have to animate RL\u2019s values.onPressLet\u2019s code\u00a0\u2026Here\u2019s a skeleton of code with Views rendered in default mode. You can see default animated values in constructor. RL\u2019s scale value (scaleValue) is set up to zero because we want it to start as a really small point (actually hidden point). And its opacity (opacityRippleValue) is set up to maxOpacity which is value between 0 and 1 (in this case it is 0.3). Last value is BL\u2019s opacity (opacityBackgroundValue) which started as a hidden layer (value is set up to zero) and after user presses it is animated to max opacity and back to zero. It makes a blink effect.A children node is passed to this component as a content. We just need to render it inside of TouchableWithoutFeedback component.Then we have a background layer (BL) and ripple layer (RL). BL is rendered in the same size as a container and RL is rendered as a circle with zero size by default. BL makes a blink effect and RL makes a ripple effect.Notice an order of components. We don\u2019t use zIndex. If we put children as a third child it would be over both layers Background and Ripple.One more thing here\u200a\u2014\u200apointerEvents. For both layers BL and RL we set up this to none because we don\u2019t want to get any events like an onPress. For container View, we set box-none which means we want to get only children events not events of container itself.Let\u2019s animate\u00a0\u2026First of all we need to know the point where the Ripple Effect should start.Immediately after user presses the button, we store a point where user tapped. And as you can see, in renderRippleLayer, we use this point to set up the position of RL. In other words we put a center of circle to this point. Just note that the circle has still zero size in this moment.We\u2019ll start with onPress event and only with Background Layer (blink effect). You can see Animated.parallel that runs all animations from array in the same time. It will make sense once we push RL Animation to array (next example). Line 6 animates opacity from zero (default value) to max opacity. Then after the animation is finished we need to animate value back to default. We can use start\u2019s callback which is called exactly after the animation is finished. Now, we can animate opacity of BL back to default value. Here\u2019s how the animation looks like without Ripple Animation. Blink!Only Background Layer animation (Blink)Let\u2019s animate Ripple Layer. It\u2019s the same onPress method. I\u2019ve just commented what we\u2019ve seen in previous example. Now, we animate RL\u2019s opacity from default (maxOpacity) to zero and scale value from 0 to 1.After is finished, we need to set those animations to default values to be ready on next press. That\u2019s what setDefaultAnimatedValues does. We don\u2019t have to animate the values back to defaults (we just set them). Because it\u2019s actually hidden after animation is finished. See line 11 of previous example. We animated opacity to 0. That means it\u2019s hidden and we can set those values immediately without animation. Ripple Effect without BL looks like this.Only Ripple\u00a0EffectAnd that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not so complicated, is it? Here\u2019s both of animations together.Both animation togetherThere\u2019s still onLongPress animation remaining. Anyway, it\u2019s almost the same like onPress animation. We just need to separate them. When user presses and holds the button we\u2019ll display BL. That means we animate BL\u2019s opacity from zero to max opacity. It seems like user holds the BL displayed during a holding of the button.Holding of the\u00a0buttonThen we make the magic in onPressOut method. Opacity and scale of RL\u2019s is the same like in onPress. Only difference is we slowly animate BL\u2019s opacity back to default value. We have done this step in start\u2019s callback. But now, we have displayed BL in onLongPress already so we animate it back to default here, together with Ripple Effect. It looks like this.onLongPress animationEasy peasy\u00a0\u2026I know, I know\u00a0:) I needed that to be done for Reservio application which uses react-native-material-ui. Anyway, I hope there is someone who appreciates this and maybe learn something new or just gets an inspiration. Or questions?Note that it\u2019s not ready for production. For this purpose you can use react-native-material-ui that I\u2019m developing as an open source.I am currently looking for a new job or project.

Our full review, which is about 20 minutes long and will be published on January 12th, 2018 titled \u201cRipple Coin Review\u201d found here. The purpose of this summary is to introduce to the token, traction, criticisms, and how to buy it.Ripple (XRP) just became the second largest Cryptocurrency by market cap at an astonishing $122 billion dollars. Making Ripple\u2019s co-founder, Chris Larsen, the 8th wealthiest man on earth as he holds the equivalent of about $55B USD (as of January 4th, 2018 at 16:00 hrs EST). This token has divided the crypto community and faces a lot of criticism.IdeaRipple aims to be a solution to a lot of current cross-border banking issues that are currently plaguing the financial ecosystem on a global scale. Anyone who has sent a wire transfer through the banking system knows that cross-currency settlement can take many days and is often quite slow.Ripple purports these settlement issues are caused by manual settlement done in order to translate one bank\u2019s ledger system\u2019s transactions into another bank\u2019s ledger system. Ripple however introduces something called the interledger protocol which uses a new cryptocurrency (ripple [ XRP]) to settle accounts across two banks differing ledgers, allowing for much faster settlement times.Last 3 months of Ripple\u2019s Market cap and Price in USD via CoinMarketCap found\u00a0here.TractionEven though the token has been out since 2014, the last 5 weeks represented an increase of over 1500% in price. And an astonishing increase of over 30,000% this year, from about 0.007 USD per token at the beginning of the year, to over $2 USD by the end of it. Market cap saw similar increases from $200M to $130B USD. There are over 38 billion tokens and the founders have kept most of them, so the valuation and market cap are currently deflated versus if there was a full circulation of the currency.Part of the reason the token has become so popular recently is social media. As ICOs are becoming more popular and people are investing more, the price of cheap altcoins is attracting a lot of people to invest in it. Even though the massive volume of Ripple tokens is one of the main reasons that the token is so \u201ccheap\u201d, price is all relative when not accounted with total token volume. The other aspect is ripple adding major banking partners recently which has driven major interest to it.TeamRipple\u2019s team is heavily stacked and connected to both cryptocurrencies and Fintech, which is one of the reasons that has justified their valuation and quick rise so far. Ripple was co-founded by Angel Investor Chris Larsen, and Software Programmer Jed McCaleb.Chris Larsen is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, he helped co-found Ripple, as well as multiple FinTech related companies such as E-Loan, OpenCoin, and Prosper Marketplace.Jed McCaleb, is well known for creating largest Bitcoin exchange ever by volume of BTC, the now defunct Mt Gox (hacked after McCaleb sold the company to Mark Karpeles). Jed is now worth $20B from his Ripple\u2019s token and is on the top 40 richest people on the world.Besides the co-founders, the team at Ripple has a large team of crypto veterans, as well as partnerships with six international banks.How to\u00a0BuyRipple can be bought on various exchanges through fiat (USD) or other cryptocurrencies. The biggest exchanges that support ripple are Bitstamp and Kraken in North America. Gatehub is also a way to acquire ripple and basically allows you to tap into ripple\u2019s global consensus network in order to exchange fiat into ripple. Some of the most well-respected exchanges, such as Coinbase, do not currently have plans to buy or sell ripple, since there are still a lot of concerns regarding its price, volatility, and team practices. For a detailed breakdown here\u2019s an article by CNBC on how to buy the token.Note: Complete step-by-step of purchasing Ripple available on full review.ConclusionRipple\u2019s future is very promising, but comes with a lot of complication since it involves simplifying the current banking industry. In our full review we expose the many concerns about the implementation and use of technology (specifically the introduction of the ripple token as opposed to another token completely decoupled from ripple\u2019s founders using the same protocols), as well as certain decisions made by the Ripple team with what we consider unsatisfactory explanations.However, the ripple team\u2019s decisions are calculated and well considered and if they do manage to fully implement their platform and onboard the global financial system, they will definitely contribute to a huge leap in international banking, making it as easy as intra-country banking is today.We will be addressing the good, the bad, and the ugly of this cryptocurrency in detail through our full review scheduled January 12th, 2018.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Ripple: Ask me anything, but I may tell you\u00a0nothing", "author_name": "Mark Rogowsky", "link": "https://medium.com/the-block-crypto/ripple-ask-me-anything-but-i-may-tell-you-nothing-3b014fa87aba?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 24, 2018", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "161", "content": "Photo by Mark Kamalov on\u00a0UnsplashRipple: Ask me anything, but I may tell you\u00a0nothingThe cagey crypto company circumvents the tough questionsMark RogowskyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 24, 2018Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was one of the richest people on earth back in January when his company\u2019s cryptocurrency, XRP, was trading as high as $3.36 per token. Like many cryptos, XRP has been hit hard in 2018, though, now trading around 10% of that high. Still don\u2019t cry for Garlinghouse. Based on those January estimates he might still be in the three comma club and he\u2019s most certainly still CEO of Ripple.These days, instead of counting his riches, that top job means he\u2019s focused on getting financial institutions to support his company\u2019s technology to move money\u200a\u2014\u200aideally replacing the SWIFT system, which links more than 11,000 banks in 200 countries. But banks were skeptical of using XRP, the company\u2019s cryptocurrency, to move money and while some have tested \u201cRippleNet\u201d as a SWIFT replacement / complement, XRP has less traction. (That could change later this year if the xRapid system leaves the beta test stage and is used for cross-border transfers.)While the company\u2019s success in breaking into the stolid banking industry remains worth watching, most of the short-term story has been around XRP and it\u2019s unusual characteristics. First, Ripple owns about 60% of all the XRP in the world. Second, that equals around 60 billion tokens. Third, even with XRP trading at a fraction of all-time highs the total value of Ripple\u2019s XRP is approaching $20 billion.

The integration of XRP into the BitGo platform will be complete later this year.Ripple has been building momentum for its global settlement network since it launched in 2012. Ripple enables banks and payments businesses to settle cross-border payments in real time, with end-to-end transparency, and at a lower cost. XRP can be used as the primary transfer mechanism for institutions to further reduce costs, offer greater liquidity and provide access to new corridors. In fact, Ripple reports that businesses using XRP for liquidity between currencies can cut their settlement costs up to 60 percent and expand their reach into new markets.Ripple is a perfect partner for BitGo since our mission is to make digital assets like XRP usable for business. BitGo\u2019s sweet spot is providing businesses the tools they need to integrate digital assets into their existing financial systems securely and at scale. We process over $1 Billion in transactions per month and our customers include the biggest digital currency exchanges and applications in the world.Partnering with Ripple and working with the technology behind the RCL and XRP has been outstanding. They have a dedicated and experienced group of developers. The RCL has been processing and validating transactions on the network since 2013, closing a ledger every five seconds. This team understands crypto and traditional finance extremely well and I believe they are well positioned to disrupt global settlement via blockchain.Ripple is accelerating exchange adoption with a volume incentive which reduces or eliminates costs for an initial period.

SpencerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 16Crypto tribes are like factions in the era of technology. They believe wholeheartedly that their altcoin is the best, and that Bitcoin is utterly disruptive to everything.They also petition, engage and exert a positive network effect influence of the most peculiar order.Crypto News Cycle Borders on Misinformation, Again!Take the XRP community for example. And, frankly I feel the crypto news cycle is very prone to bordering on fake news, and this for me is a weird case in point.The popular telecommunication app Skype is considering the integration of XRP for micropayment. Well, that\u2019s not exactly true. Basically XRP\u2019s community wants Skype to consider them, which isn\u2019t the same thing at all, right? This is where integrity and objective news fall apart in the crypto news cycle entirely, and it\u2019s a disgrace to how the media runs in a world of algorithms.Ripple & XRP Could be Disrupted by StablecoinsRipple has been putting in a lot of effort to net many partners and customers across various sectors in a bid to ensure that XRP stays afloat and popular. I get that, but it doesn\u2019t mean XRP has a hope of being integrated into Skype. What would be the incentives for Microsoft to even consider that? Why would they not just build their own stablecoin, like Facebook is doing for WhatsApp? It makes little sense.One XRP is worth about 3 cents, and would be an interesting way to exchange money globally on Skype. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens with Bakkt, of which Microsoft is a significant partner.I do think for global transfers, stablecoins make much more sense. I think in spite of banking partnerships Ripple could be completely disrupted in the next five years. Most cryptos born before 2017 will be, it\u2019s just how cryptoeconomics in its infancy will work. These are early days, and even if XRP seems reputable to some, it isn\u2019t even decentralized and probably is a security (just ask the SEC). This is because of the relationship between Ripple and XRP.XRP Tribe Demands Skype IntegrationWhen XRP \u201cdemands\u201d Skype integrate XRP, it\u2019s a Microsoft decision. It\u2019s also not how business transactions work. You can\u2019t strong-arm a major tech leader into doing what your own biased community wants. That sounds more like a crypto cartel than how the internet actually works.While Microsoft does a fair job of supporting open source with the acquisition of GitHub, payments or decentralization are likely not something very high on its priority list. With Amazon, it virtually owns the enterprise cloud sector. The Cloud is the very definition of enterprise software that\u2019s centralized.Ripple the company, which has built technology that uses XRP to facilitate cross-border payments sort of devalues the trustworthiness of XRP. For cross border payments, it\u2019s a crowded space and likely only to get worse. There\u2019s virtually no incentive for Skype to give in to the request (demand) of XRP\u2019s community. Skype is a legacy comms platform. Most people who use it are GenX or Babyboomer. Crypto on the other hand is a Millennial and GenZ phenomenon.Why Would Microsoft not make its own Stablecoin Instead?Microsoft is highly likely to join JP Morgan and Facebook with its own stablecoin, since it eventually needs to keep up with how younger consumers operate. If it doesn\u2019t do it, others will, which will take market share away from it. Skype is a good pilot case study for such a stablecoin pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, but I\u2019m not sure XRP is.The \u201cXRP Army\u201d is somewhat dubious as many of the crypto factions are, oblivious to real-world considerations. Airdrops and bounty programs created division in the crypto landscape, since many of these altcoins don\u2019t even have products that can scale over time. When you invest in a product, you over-value its potential, that\u2019s totally normal. But demanding BigTech adopt your solution discredits your community.Among Crypto Factions, \u201cXRP Army\u201d is\u00a0UniqueSo a group of XRP community is expecting Skype, a global telecommunication application to integrate XRP as a micro payment system. Even more curiously, they drafted a post on Skype\u2019s user voice (as a new idea on Skype customer feedback) and elaborated their prospect by detailing the key aspects of why and how should Skype consider XRP micropayments. What could Microsoft do? They said they would discuss it internally.You can read their Skype idea for XRP here.Cool idea? Or spectacular act of desperation from a crypto faction in decline. Fake News or something Microsoft would actually consider seriously?This David Olliver is an interesting character.Chat Apps will Integrate Crypto But Don\u2019t Expect Skype to be Among\u00a0ThemA world with competing crypto \u201carmies\u201d is highly problematic. Communities like these actually create more bureaucracy (as in the case of Ethereum) or more incentives for fraudulent profiteering. This includes remarkable propaganda and PR spam bordering on misinformation.Following the detailed proposal, the Skype team responded to the post and quickly edited its title from \u201cAdd XRP micropayments to Skype\u201d to \u201cAdd Cryptocurrency micropayments to Skype (XRP and others).\u201dI highly doubt the Skype or Microsoft team are up to date on the objectives of the various crypto factions or their benefits and cons as solutions.In 2019, crypto factions are basically getting desperate because they see the null at the end of the tunnel. The crypto winter means only the best solutions will make it into the next era of cryptoeconomics and a rising token economy.As a blockchain historian, it\u2019s a bit hard for me to read the crypto-news cycle that\u2019s so lacking a business knowledge perspective. The tyranny of the crowd and mob rule perverted with bounty programs and airdrops might end really badly for some Millennial and GenZ investors who believed they were ahead of the game.Full disclosure, I have been significantly trolled by the XRP community on Twitter, so my opinions may also be biased. I\u2019m losing faith in the crypto factions, and I\u2019m probably not alone.However integration chat and crypto is a strong use case that will be done by Telegram, Line, WhatsApp and many others. It\u2019s inevitable, just not likely to have Skype as a leader among them.", "responses": "6"}, {"title": "Ripple\u200a\u2014\u200areview.

We\u2019ll be posting one article about one coin from the portfolio with #cix100coinreview hashtag.Today we would like to review Ripple. Further Perspectives.Ripple (XPR) is a cryptocurrency which was launched in 2012 and focused on the banking sector of the economy. Ripple\u2019s aim was to secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.The network is decentralized and can operate without the participation of Ripple Labs. At the end of 2017 Ripple was amongst the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, together with Bitcoin, Ethereum. In fact, Ripple has the potential to replace Visa and Mastercard, but this won\u2019t\u2019 happen. Let\u2019s see why.How did it all start and how does it work?The predecessor of the Ripple payment protocol, called \u2018Ripplepay\u2019, was first developed in 2004 by Ryan Fugger in Vancouver. Fugger came up with this idea after working on a local exchange trading system. His intention was to allow individuals and communities to create their own money. The first implementation of this system, RipplePay.com, was launched in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure transfer options for members of the online community via the Internet.This led to the idea of a new system developed by Jed McCaleb of the eDonkey network, which was designed and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz. In May 2011, they started developing an electronic payment system in which transactions were confirmed by network participants, rather than the mining process used by bitcoin.The updated version of the Ripple system differed from the existing economic infrastructure bit by bit by the lack of dependence on online exchange services. In addition, Ripple uses less electricity than bitcoin and transactions are much faster.Integration with the banking marketSince 2013, Ripple has taken a clear course to work with the banking sector. The protocol accepts all new financial institutions to \u201coffer an alternative remittance\u201d for consumers. The first bank which tried to use Ripple was Fidor Bank in Munich. In October 2013, rumors appeared in the press about Ripple\u2019s cooperation with ZipZap, which was later called a threat to Western Union.In 2014, Ripple worked with several projects, including an application for the iPhone which allowed users to make payments through the phone in a decentralized manner, without contacting the bank. Unfortunately, this project was not successful and was closed. Then, in July of the same year, Ripple Labs proposed Codius, a project to develop a new smart contract system, without reference to specific programming languages.On the 5th of May 2015, FINCEN fined Ripple Labs and XRP II for $700,000 for violating the Bank Secrecy Act, based on the addition to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of 2013. The management at Ripple tried to rectify the situation and entered into an agreement allowing XRP and Ripple Trade to operate only through registered financial service institutions (MSBs). The improvement did not change the protocol itself but added AML transaction monitoring in the network and improved transaction analysis.ConfidentialityAlthough transactional information is publicly available, information about payments is not. Thus, it is difficult to link transaction information to a particular user or corporation.Ripple\u200a\u2014\u200ais the \u201ceternal\u201d ICO?Recently, many users stated that Ripple is an \u201ceternal\u201d ICO. The claim was filed in the same form as for other ICO startups. Ripple was accused of offering unregistered securities to retail investors.Investor Ryan Coffey who states he is acting on behalf of all buyers of Ripple tokens claims that Ripple Labs and its head Brad Garlinghouse sold him unregistered XRP tokens resulting in losses of over 32% of his initial investment.Ripple press\u200a\u2014\u200asecretary Tom Channik commented on the trial in an e-mail:\u201cWe found out about the lawsuit filed by the judge and published on Twitter did not receive an official summons to the court. As in the case of any other civil action, we will have an opportunity to assess the validity of the charges or lack thereof. Only the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can decide whether XRP is a security token or not. We continue to believe that XRP should not be classified as a security token\u201d.For his part, the plaintiff states:\u201cXRP is a security token. The respondents themselves admitted that investors in XRP could safely rely on profit and details of this more than once publicly advertised the positive price dynamics of the token\u201d.According to the statement of claim, in January Coffey bought 650 XRP tokens at a price of approximately $2.60 per coin, spending $1690, and a few weeks later he sold at a loss of $551.The SEC\u2019s statement inJuly17 forced a discussion about whether the Ripple token XRP and its more successful competitor Ethereum could be a security token.The former chairman of the Commission for Futures Trading, Gary Jensler, said in April that XRP and the Ethereum met the criteria for securities.This event caused a public outcry and attracted the attention of the SEC and other legislative bodies. No answer was given due to the lack of regulation still within these financial markets.What to expect in the future? Growth or fall?A huge rise in the\u0441ryptocurrency market in December 2017 helped Ripple to gain a foothold at $0.5 and hold these positions for quite a long time. As for the platform itself its future is not certain.Rippleis a good competitor for VISA, Mastercard, and other payment systems, however, it lacks widespread use, ease of payment execution and adaptation to the average user.Another, severe \u201cstumbling block,\u201d is the fact that more than 20% of the total emission of tokens in 100 billion XPR is in the hands of developers, which has repeatedly been discussed in the community.Ripple has the capacity the freeze funds. The Ripple gateways protocol freezes those trading assets to which they granted access. For example, the Bitstamp exchange gateway can freeze the USD of a user who has configured the credibility of the gateway. This opportunity was introduced at the request of regulators in response to a reversal of focus on the banking sector.The freezing of funds was applied to one of the former founders when he was trying to sell a large amount of XRP in a single transaction. Ripple intervened and utilised its \u2018Balance Freeze\u2019 feature. By doing so it enabled the company to stop the movement of XRP. In this case, since XRP functions without a gateway, no one can freeze XRP, but it is possible to freeze those assets to which XRP is exchanged.ConclusionThe Ripple system has a lot of obvious disadvantages and at the same time pluses. The company has good prospects for growing, due to its bias towards the banking sector. The position of the Ripple Labs management goes between creating competition for such giants as Visa and Mastercard, but at the same time, periodically in the media, there are references to that Ripple testing as a payment system.But at the same time\u00a0,ordinary users are confused by the fact that Ripple is inherently completely centralized. For example, Ripple has the capacity the freeze funds.. The Ripple gateways protocol freezes those trading assets to which they granted access. For example, the Bitstamp exchange gateway can freeze the USD of a user who has configured the credibility of the gateway.

Knight Foundation, Eric Schmidt\u2019s Innovation Endeavors, Pejman Mar Ventures, 500 Startups, Joi Ito, Director of MIT Media Lab, and angel investors Blake Krikorian, Magdalena Yesil and Shane Smith.Ripple is a web and mobile app that shines a spotlight on local stories at the neighborhood level. These stories, says its founder Razmig Hovaghimian, go largely untold or undiscovered\u200a\u2014\u200abut with the right amplification, they have the potential to become global narratives. Not only is Ripple a compelling media product, it\u2019s an example of the curious, tenacious, mission-driven entrepreneurship that we at Matter want to celebrate and elevate.Matter\u2019s Managing Partner, Corey Ford, says of the investment: \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you come across such an experienced founder tackling the core problem of how informed we are as a society. For us it was an absolute no-brainer to get behind Razmig and support him on his next big adventure.\u201dFrom East to West to East to WestYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a founder with a more global personal narrative than Razmig. Born and raised in Cairo to an Armenian family, he moved to LA alone when he was 16 years-old to attend high school, working the graveyard shift at a gas station and at a Subway in the evenings to fund his studies. At winter school, where he had to take extra classes to catch up with the U.S. high school curriculum, he met his future wife, an exchange student from Nagano, Japan, who\u2019s now an award-winning filmmaker.Razmig\u2019s startup education goes back to that decision to fly halfway around the world in search of opportunities in the United States.\u201cMaybe I was my first startup. I had to come and figure it out. I know I always wanted to build, and I know I wanted to do it outside of my comfort zone. I like ambiguity, fast pace and feel most creative when the difficulty level is high. You\u2019re forced to build.\u201d ~ Razmig HovaghimianAfter his first business idea (a late night pizza delivery service using a bakery\u2019s ovens after hours) flopped, Razmig was accepted to the University of California at Berkeley to study Political Economy with a minor in Business Administration. He then worked as a management consultant in Japan before attending Stanford Business School for his MBA. He and his wife have been taking turns to move for each other since high school. Their first child was born in the United States, their second child was born in Singapore. They also lived for some time in London, and have recently returned to the San Francisco Bay Area.Despite, or perhaps because of, his broad global perspective, Razmig has chosen to focus his third enterprise, Ripple, on hyperlocal news reporting. That\u2019s not only because he\u2019s convinced there is an unsatisfied appetite for it among consumers, but because he thinks it will help bridge the gap between individuals, communities and even nations.\u201cUntold stories are all around us, from yours, to your neighbor\u2019s, to those from far away who have more in common with us than we may think,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to create narratives that connect our human stories across borders.\u201dCrossing bordersThe genesis of Ripple goes back to 2006 when Razmig spent the summer between his first and second years at Graduate School with the United Nations in Sudan. This was when Sudan was one nation (in 2011 South Sudan seceded from the North and became an independent country). \u201cThere were untold stories all around me,\u201d Razmig says of his time in Juba, living in a tent. \u201cFrom seeing thugs rent guns for $5 a night, to foreign prisoners building oil rigs, to discovering that a simple rainfall insurance could solve centuries\u2019 old tribal conflicts, to seeing dozens of war children return home to Uganda and share their stories of conflicts we had never heard of. Crazy stuff that never made it to CNN or the BBC.\u201dHe dabbled with creating a citizen journalism platform for Nokia Symbian phones, which were all the rage back then, called My Voice: \u201cI thought what if I could build an app where you could just snap a photo and share the story with the world?\u201d But it was too early, so he shelved the project.Embracing EmbraceHis next venture, Embrace, was born out of a group project at the Stanford d.school where Razmig was classmates with Corey Ford. The students were applying design thinking principles such as need-finding and prototyping to entrepreneurship. Embrace, which is now part of Thrive Networks, developed a portable, reusable incubator for premature babies, decreasing the unit cost from $20,000 to $25, making them accessible to communities in developing countries.After the class ended, his team knew they had cracked a difficult problem and wanted to continue with their social enterprise. They raised money for further R&D. It took four years to bring the product to market\u200a\u2014\u200aRazmig says they since learned that calling it a \u201cmedical device\u201d automatically created more bureaucratic hurdles\u200a\u2014\u200aand the moved manufacturing to India, one of the nations where demand is highest. The Embrace Warmer is now distributed in 14 countries, served more than 200,000 infants, and has won international recognition.Viki: Wiki(pedia) + VideoRazmig\u2019s next venture, Viki, evolved to position him at the intersection of media and technology. He defines Viki as \u201cHulu for the rest of the world, with a community of tens of thousands of fans translating TV shows and movies into more than 200 languages.\u201d Originally intended to be a language-learning tool through subtitles, Viki developed over time into a global TV platform unlocking premium content and distributing shows to the rest of the world.In 2009, Razmig decided to quit his job as a senior VP at NBC Universal and pursue Viki full-time, having perceived the need for big studios to look aggressively outside the U.S. to new markets for growth opportunities. Propelled by a US$4.3 million series A round co-led by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman at Greylock Partners and Marc Andreessen at Andreessen Horowitz, Viki introduced its content arbitrage business model to the world.\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive to license TV shows for the home market. We began primarily licensing shows from Asia and brought them to the U.S., Europe and Latin America. Once the Viki community put subtitles in English, Spanish and other languages, we opened up the whole world to TV series and movies, increasing the content\u2019s reach by more than five times on average, and at a fraction of the cost.\u201d ~ Razmig HovaghimianBy crowdsourcing translations by up to 500 people at once, Viki can usually offer a video with subtitles in 10 languages within 24 hours. Its most popular shows regularly reach more than 50 languages. The subtitles are up-voted or down-voted and locked in by a designated moderator. Razmig says quality is so high that broadcasters are coming to Viki asking for subtitling support rather than hiring translators themselves.Viki now supports more than 200 languages, close to 20% of which are endangered. Per month, viewing time is in the billions of minutes; monthly active users surpass 40 million.Razmig says that the team started licensing content globally and learning lessons from the audience data, which sometimes revealed surprising trends: \u201cWe have North Koreans watching South Korean shows, we have Greeks watching Turkish shows, we have Egyptian films breaking first in Indonesia, we have Japanese TV series with the first language translated on it being Tagalog or Lithuanian.\u201d He refers to Viki as the \u201ctorso\u201d of the content body\u200a\u2014\u200aHollywood is the prominent head, YouTube is the long, fragmented tail, and Viki makes accessible all the shows in-between.Viki Data Visualization (wired.co.uk), Where Local TV Gets Seen Overseas | 03 SEP\u00a0\u201814The success of Viki underscored Razmig\u2019s belief in the power of media, technology and community to act as the connective tissue of society. He fondly remembers how he and his father would watch Bollywood movies together every Saturday in Cairo. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t understand it but we would be so entertained,\u201d he reminisces. \u201c[Viki is] building this cultural bridge between great entertainment and fans elsewhere. Global content is so important because it has so many stories and layers that can cut across cultures.\u201dRakuten, the Japanese e-commerce company, acquired Viki in 2013 for more than $200 million. Razmig became the company\u2019s Senior Executive Officer of Global Content and sits on the Rakuten board as an observer. But it was time for him to revive an old passion project.Returning to Ripple\u201cWe said we\u2019ll do it if it\u2019s important, before it\u2019s big. Hopefully, it\u2019s both.\u201d ~ Razmig HovaghimianTen years after he had the My Voice idea in Sudan, Razmig got together with a couple of \u201cinspiring\u201d friends to explore it anew. He slowly recruited Ripple\u2019s founding team from his various projects, as well as from YouTube News and The State, to build out the app. They started with data science, analyzing troves of data from various sources, including Twitter, to map news sources by city.In so doing, they realized that out of millions of news and local stories breaking each day, less than 5% were tagged by location coordinates. They also found that in many cities, neighborhood-level stories were missing\u200a\u2014\u200athe stories Razmig felt were critical to sparking real conversations in a community. The next step was to develop a pilot program to recruit local storytellers in San Francisco and Oakland, California, to report on the neighborhoods they live in. Recruitment later expanded to New York, London, Cairo and Bangkok.The Ripple team (left to right): Marcos Voltolini, Razmig Hovaghimian, Ryo Chikazawa, Dan Wascovich, Melissa Mazman, Jason Hwang, Wallace Harrison the 20th (lap), Otis Taylor\u00a0Jr.The lifeblood of Ripple\u2019s platform today is its city news feeds. Ripple offers video news and stories through its community of contributors, known as Ripple Correspondents, combined with curated news from local media partners. Users in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, for example, will find daily stories from Ripple Correspondents on the ground in the Mission, who live and report from there, as well as from hyper-local news partners, such as KQED (NPR), Mission Local and Hoodline. Global content partners include VICE Media, Coconuts Media, Global Voices, News Deeply (a Matter Four company) and Bustle.Each city has about ten dedicated Ripple correspondents writing fresh, hyper-local stories. In the future, about half of their stories will be video. \u201cThink about Ripple as your \u2018nearby button,\u2019\u201d says Razmig. \u201cWherever you are you can get a feed that\u2019s very specific to your location, even within a city.\u201d Users will be able to \u201cripple\u201d stories they like to a larger audience and broader radius.Razmig feels that news in its current form is still very one-directional, with journalists doling out the stories they believe people want to read or watch (a model that Matter Four portfolio company Hearken is also seeking to overturn). His mission for Ripple aligns with his early urge to create a citizen journalism app, bringing to light hidden narratives and sparking conversations around them. Now a much more seasoned entrepreneur, his approach been refined and informed by his experiences building Embrace and Viki. He\u2019s focusing first on the intersection of content and community, which he says is 80% of the product, and the part that excites him the most.\u201cI love the untold stories. We want to focus on the stories that matter. Ripple\u2019s a little bit like Viki in that it\u2019s also the torso of news and local stories. It\u2019s not the head, it\u2019s not what you\u2019re going to see on CNN or BBC, but it\u2019s not the clickbait stories either. It\u2019s that important middle, which is broken at the discovery level, is largely underreported, and it won\u2019t even index if you don\u2019t \u2018follow\u2019 the right people. We\u2019re here to unlock millions of stories around us that are waiting to be seen.\u201d ~ Razmig Hovaghimian", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "", "link": "https://medium.com/@reveal/trumps-puddle-and-ditch-order-will-have-destructive-ripple-effect-fa88d8fbb5e0?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 26, 2017", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "By Jane KayAs President Donald Trump signed one of his first executive orders, he was surrounded by smiling, clapping homebuilders, farmers and other supporters eager to see the new president rein in a 45-year-old law protecting the nation\u2019s waterways.The Environmental Protection Agency has \u201ctruly run amok\u201d by saving \u201cnearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmer\u2019s land,\u201d Trump told the gathering. Calling it a \u201cmassive power grab,\u201d he added, \u201cif you want to build a new home\u00a0\u2026 you have to worry about getting hit with a huge fine if you fill in as much as a puddle\u200a\u2014\u200ajust a puddle\u200a\u2014\u200aon your lot.\u201dBut these so-called puddles and ditches, according to scientists across the country, are fundamental to the nation\u2019s drinking water supplies and to wildlife, including many rare animals and plants.In February, Trump ordered his EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, to throw out a 2015 rule that protects seasonal streams and small isolated ponds, which would shrink the reach of the 1972 Clean Water Act by narrowing the definition of \u201cwaters of the United States.\u201dIn its place, Trump asked for a new rule that, in effect, would eliminate protection for tens of thousands of wetlands from coast to coast. What\u2019s at stake? Seasonal pools hidden in California grasslands and Maine forests, mountain streams in Arizona, freshwater marshes along the Gulf Coast, cypress swamps in Florida, glacial prairie potholes pockmarking the Midwest and more.Based on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s National Wetlands Inventory, at least 20 million acres of vernal pools, potholes, salt flats, creeks and other isolated wetlands would be put at risk if the EPA follows Trump\u2019s directions.And as many as 60 percent of U.S. streams would lose protection, according to the agency\u2019s own calculations. These headwaters and ephemeral streams and creeks contribute to the drinking water supplies of more than 117 million Americans.The changes are on a fast track: Pruitt already initiated the process to overturn the existing rule and is drafting a new one, which he has promised to unveil by year\u2019s end.Powerful interest\u00a0groupsFor decades, developers, landowners, growers, energy companies, mines and other industries have tried to limit their obligations to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act.Opposition to the Obama administration rule comes from business groups that are heavyweights in lobbying federal lawmakers and agencies on an array of issues, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which spent $104 million on all lobbyists last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The American Petroleum Institute spent $6 million in 2016, the National Association of Home Builders spent $4.4 million and the American Farm Bureau Federation, $3.8 million.Granger MacDonald, whose companies have developed multi-family apartment projects in 25 Texas cities, and Georgia third-generation farmer Zippy Duvall attended Trump\u2019s signing ceremony. MacDonald, chairman of the homebuilders association, commended Trump for taking the first step toward overturning a rule that \u201cgoes so far as to regulate manmade ditches and isolated ponds on private property.\u201dDuvall, a poultry, cattle and hay producer and president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, called the rule \u201creckless and unlawful.\u201dThe golf industry also lobbied against the water rule, which suggests that Trump, who owns 12 golf courses in the United States, could benefit financially from killing it. Golf course owners worry that their ponds and drainage areas might be subject to provisions about pesticide runoff and filling of wetlands.Trump didn\u2019t mention effects on golf courses or his other property in his remarks, but he did say it\u2019s a \u201cvery destructive and horrible rule\u201d and he\u2019s \u201cbeen hearing about it for years.\u201dNo projects have ever been affected by the 2015 rule. That\u2019s because business groups\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding the farm and homebuilder associations\u200a\u2014\u200ajoined 31 states and 91 members of Congress arguing in court that the EPA had overstepped its authority. They won a stay, so the rule has not been enforced as the legal wrangling continues.Pruitt, as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, led this multi-state lawsuit against the agency he now oversees. Under pressure, Pruitt has recused himself from the lawsuit. But he did not recuse himself from the rule revisions ordered by Trump. Pruitt\u2019s former general counsel in Oklahoma, Sarah Greenwalt, is now a top EPA official involved in rewriting the rule. Her name also is on the lawsuit against the EPA, but she has not recused herself.Paul Jones, a former EPA official who reviewed permits for filling wetlands in California, Nevada and Arizona for 27 years until he retired last year, said he was worried about the administration\u2019s quick move to weaken the Clean Water Act.\u201cThe minute we turn our backs,\u201d Jones said, \u201cthe forces of industry, agriculture and real estate destroy the waters of the United States right under our noses.\u201dA rancher\u2019s vernal\u00a0poolsHigh above California\u2019s Central Valley, winter rains and melting snow gush down the craggy face of the Sierra Nevada, turning the valley green. Rivulets trickle through creeks and pools, filling the often-dry San Joaquin River, which flows to the delta as a source of drinking and crop water before heading on to San Francisco Bay.Vernal pools mark the Sierra foothills and valley floor, where land developers dream of subdivisions and growers of orchards.Driving south on little roads east of Highway 99, orchards turn to natural grassland. From atop China Hat Ridge, the Chance Ranch encompasses 8,000 acres. Rainstorms ending the record drought inundated clusters of vernal pools here.The pools slow runoff, store water and filter sediment before spilling into narrow swales that run to unnamed creeks, connecting to the Merced River and eventually the San Joaquin. Salamanders, frogs and other creatures rush to complete their lifecycles before the water dries up. Growing in the green pools are colorful wildflowers.Rancher Jeff Chance has a fondness and appreciation for these pools that bloom in spring, saying: \u201cThe cattle can find water. They don\u2019t have to walk too far.\u201d His family keeps the pools natural in exchange for added rangeland from The Nature Conservancy, an environmental group.\u201cRanchers are the best caretakers. We don\u2019t like to mess up anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe like the horse and the gooseneck trailer. We don\u2019t like the tractor and the plow.\u201dSeasonal pools such as these are living examples of Trump\u2019s \u201cpuddles and ditches.\u201dThe revised waters definition that Trump advised Pruitt to adopt likely would eliminate protection for pools and ponds, as well as streams that don\u2019t run most of the year or are not continuously connected by surface water to navigable waters, such as bays, rivers and the Great Lakes.Scientists say this definition is not scientifically sound and would leave important natural resources unprotected from bulldozers and plows. It also would change which waters would be protected from pollution from sewage plants, industries and farms.\u201cThis new definition clearly would not be based on science,\u201d said Ralph W. Tiner, a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist and author of two textbooks and 200 scientific papers on wetlands. \u201cA change like this would put in jeopardy the quality of the nation\u2019s water and the fate of the nation\u2019s wildlife.\u201dThe EPA\u2019s website says wetlands are \u201cbiological supermarkets,\u201d among the world\u2019s most productive ecosystems, comparable to coral reefs and rainforests. More than half of the country\u2019s wetlands have been lost since 1780, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, and losses continue, with recent mapping showing about 110 million acres in the contiguous United States.Linking land and water, wetlands are essential for cleansing and recharging groundwater in underground basins, controlling flooding and providing life support for waterfowl and other wildlife.\u201cLike diamonds, they can be small, but extremely valuable,\u201d the Society of Wetland Scientists wrote in a letter to Trump in March.The Scalia definitionTrump specifically asked Pruitt for a new definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d that mimics language used by the late Justice Antonin Scalia in a Supreme Court split decision a decade ago. The EPA says that definition covers only \u201crelatively permanent waters, and wetlands with a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters.\u201dExamples of what\u2019s at risk are found throughout the country: Thousands of inland basins from New Jersey to Florida fill with rain and then evaporate. Prairie pothole wetlands in the upper Midwest mostly are connected by water underground. In the Southwest, 80 percent of streams flow only after rainfall, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\u201cIn California alone, we have lost thousands of acres in the last two decades,\u201d said Jones, the former EPA biologist, who worked on national science teams determining which wetlands should come under the Clean Water Act. \u201cTo adopt the Scalia definition would only further weaken the ability of agencies to regulate wetlands and streams.\u201dDeciding what qualifies should be a task for scientists, Tiner said, because understanding how various wetlands contribute to ecological and hydrological functions takes considerable expertise. For instance, headwaters linked to downstream waters only by seasonal flows and underground water would not meet the conditions of the Scalia definition.\u201cIt makes little sense to try to maintain biological, chemical and hydrological integrity of our nation\u2019s water and exclude the source of the streams,\u201d Tiner said.Also, potholes from North Dakota to Montana and Texas could be excluded because they are connected mainly by groundwater, not surface waters.\u201cPrairie potholes are the duck factories of the North American continent,\u201d Tiner said.During droughts, prairie potholes might be the only watery green places for wildlife, he added, including some species that are rare or endangered.\u201cThink of all the aquatic animals living in streams and adapted to the natural pulses of water,\u201d Tiner said. \u201cLet\u2019s say you filled the intermittent streams or the headwater wetlands. If you didn\u2019t have the high water flows, what would happen to the many species of fish that spawned on overflowed floodplains? They would vanish.\u201dJeanne Christie, executive director of the Association of State Wetland Managers, said many state scientists are struggling with the proposed rule changes.\u201cThe words used in the court decision are not terminology previously used by scientists,\u201d Christie said. \u201cSo in order to have a scientific basis for identifying these streams, the EPA and the (Army) Corps (of Engineers) will have to do a crosswalk between science and these new words. For instance, what did Scalia mean by \u2018relatively permanent waters?\u2019 \u201d\u2018Confusing and cumbersome\u2019 rulesUnder the Obama rule, property owners must seek federal permits if they want to dam, grade or fill vernal pools, potholes or other wetlands for construction or crops, and they must replace the lost wetlands elsewhere.California Farm Bureau Federation attorney Kari Fisher calls the rule \u201cconfusing and cumbersome for farmers and ranchers.\u201d For example, ditches are exempted under certain circumstances, \u201cbut the burden falls on the landowner, and it\u2019s difficult to prove.\u201dZippy Duvall of the American Farm Bureau Federation said last year that a Senate committee investigation found instances of farmers being told to stop plowing fields or planting trees and to preserve their own tire ruts as wetlands.The Senate and congressional Western Caucuses, predominantly made up of Republicans, have said the regulation stymies economic growth.\u201cDuring the campaign, Donald Trump showed his familiarity with the complaints from the Republican wing that accuses over-reaching environmental protection of gobbling up private property,\u201d said Reed Hopper, a senior attorney for the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation. \u201cThe rule is an abuse of regulatory power. It\u2019s a prime focus of our regulatory rollback.\u201dEnvironmental groups are concerned about the rapid pace of the rollback: Trump\u2019s executive order was issued Feb. 28. A week later, the EPA published its intent to rescind and replace the Obama rule. On April 19, Pruitt heard comments from local and state representatives. The rule to rescind was sent to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget on May 3, and the new one is expected to be proposed this fall.\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s executive order had such high priority because it has the potential to broadly undermine Clean Water Act protections in one fell swoop,\u201d said Jon Devine, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. \u201cAs a result, it is being pushed by numerous and varying sectors that discharge pollution and are regulated by the law.\u201dThe current rule was years in the making, with more than 1.1 million comments over seven months and 400 meetings with interested parties, plus a peer-reviewed EPA scientific report that prompted 130,000 comments. The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and 24 other environmental groups sent a letter to Pruitt seeking the same effort from the Trump administration. Pruitt, however, told Congress to expect a final rule early next year.\u201cWe have every expectation the matter will be fast tracked,\u201d Devine said, \u201cwith a brief comment period, to get the Obama rule off the books.\u201d", "responses": ""}, {"title": "WTF Is Ripple & Is XRP Worth $35B\u200a\u2014\u200aConference Call, Nov. 29th, 1pm-2pm\u00a0est", "author_name": "Lou Kerner", "link": "https://medium.com/crypto-oracle/wtf-is-ripple-is-xrp-worth-45b-conference-call-nov-29th-1pm-2pm-est-ea674313f902?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 15, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "585", "content": "WTF Is Ripple & Is XRP Worth $35B\u200a\u2014\u200aConference Call, Nov. 29th, 1pm-2pm\u00a0estLou KernerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 15, 2018Watch/Listen to a replay of the call below:Get a copy of the speakers slides by clicking hereOriginal Invite Below:Ripple has been one of the most widely debated crypto companies since XRP, its associated token, had an explosive three months run (up 75X+) starting in March, 2017. Ripple had another epic one month run starting in December, 2017. At it\u2019s peak, in January, 2018, Ripple was the 10th most valuable company in the United States. It was worth 15% more then Walmart.But, while almost everyone in crypto has heard of Ripple, few have even a basic understanding of what the company does, let alone appreciate its long term ambitions. What is XRP? What is it used for? Should it be classified as a security? Is it worthy of a $35 billion valuation? How much control does Ripple Labs, the team behind XRP, actually have over the world\u2019s second largest crypto asset (as of date of publication)? To answer these questions and more, we have three crypto industry experts, each with a unique perspective on crypto, to discuss the complex narratives that drive Ripple today. We\u2019ll have lots of time for questions from the audience after the panelists\u2019 remarks.Click here to register for the callOur three esteemed speakers are:Cory Johnson\u2014 Chief Marketing Strategist at Ripple.

The platform will allow for carbon credits to be traded as tokens on the public blockchain.Whilst carbon credits are themselves nothing new, a decentralised market could provide much-needed transparency to the process of offsetting carbon emissions.This announcement may be the first in series of new projects by IBM using the Stellar blockchain. In October last year, the tech giant announced it was working with a group of banks to create cross-border payment solutions using the Stellar network. Then, in April, Jesse Lund, IBM\u2019s VP of Blockchain Technologies, hinted at more announcements to come.Public, yet PermissionedThe Veridium partnership will be the first time IBM is creating a token on a public network. While the network will be public, it won\u2019t be entirely open, as there will still need to be a permissioned component. An IBM spokesperson said the model needed to be \u201cpublic / permissioned\u201d as some aspects of access to the platform would need to be restricted for regulatory reasons.The growing importance of Stellar to IBM is significant. Stellar has struggled to compete with Ethereum as a blockchain of choice for decentralised organizations. The vote of confidence from IBM may convince future projects that it is indeed a serious protocol.The IBM/Stellar combination is increasingly being seen as a potent combination that may challenge Ripple / XRP in the global payment space. In that regard, IBM appears to carry the advantage given its vast number of partnerships with major corporations operating on the international scene.According to some analysts, IBM\u2019s involvement in a public blockchain project\u200a\u2014\u200aas opposed to relying on its own private offshoot chain\u200a\u2014\u200amay also serve up a healthy dose of credibility for the wider crypto-tech experiment.Source", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "Get Ripple (XRP) in your Web Browser with\u00a0Bitcoin", "author_name": "Miko Matsumura", "link": "https://medium.com/@miko_57080/how-to-buy-ripple-xrp-from-coinbase-c769b89d9cb0?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 15, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "128", "content": "Get Ripple (XRP) in your Web Browser with\u00a0BitcoinMiko MatsumuraBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 15, 2017How to move from Coinbase to the broader crypto worldMoving past the first step in cryptoThe vast majority of cryptocurrency users get their start on Coinbase.

I\u2019ve been eyeing that guitar case where that mammal sized cockroach just went under it. But I have not seen it resurface. No shame here. We have cockroaches too in our apartment. I feel like-Aaron Lammer: There\u2019s no shame in having cockroaches in New York. You could easily get into seven figures in New York in real estate and still have cockroaches.Jay Kang: Yeah, I would actually say-Aaron Lammer: Not that I have\u00a0\u2026 This place is $350.00 a month, this basement where we tape. But I\u2019ve heard that people do.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any correlation between the price of the price of the place where you\u2019re at and the number of cockroaches.Aaron Lammer: No, I mean I kinda feel like New York City cockroaches are like this separate phenomenon that\u2019s like, \u201cHey, it\u2019s not even gross. It\u2019s a city cockroach over there. Hey, it\u2019s the pizza rat over here.\u201dJay Kang: That thing was massive though. That was actually one of the biggest cockroaches I\u2019ve seen in my life. All right. So speaking of cockroaches-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Should we just get into the news right now?Aaron Lammer: Yeah, let\u2019s get into it. People have been getting feisty on the internet. It\u2019s like NBA playoff time, everyone\u2019s a little chippy in basketball, you see a fight almost every night. I feel like the crypto world is ready to brawl.Jay Kang: Yeah, well I feel like that actually is a bullish sign for me for crypto-Aaron Lammer: Oh, yeah.Jay Kang: Because I think for a while-Aaron Lammer: Do you thrive on the conflict?Jay Kang: Well no, because I think for a while everyone was just kind of depressed and all the memes and there\u2019s not that much fighting because everyone was super poor at once.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And now like people are starting to go back to their corners.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Like the raid is over. People feel a little feisty. Spring is in the air right now and they\u2019re ready to scrap. So there is one big scrap this week.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I feel like this one hit close to my heart because we\u2019re fans of Laura Shin and the show.Jay Kang: Yeah, Coin Talk\u2019s ombudsman.Aaron Lammer: Ombudsman-Jay Kang: Laura Shin.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. She\u2019s corrected some of my numerous errors.Jay Kang: I feel like she\u2019s gotten to like 1% of our factual errors on this, but it was a very long email detailing several of our factual errors.Aaron Lammer: Side note. So when we were prepping to talk about this, we were looking at her show. Her podcast is called Unconfirmed-Jay Kang: Unchained.Aaron Lammer: Unchain\u00a0\u2026 Well she has two. She has Unchained and Unconfirmed. I think you\u2019re right, Unchained is the episode we\u2019re talking about. It has a disclosure in the description that says, \u2018I own Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u2019 And I was like man, like if we had to do that, I wouldn\u2019t even know what we would say. It\u2019s like, \u201cAaron has like tons of shit in bag. A bunch of them he got bad entries on.\u201dJay Kang: Hahahaha.Aaron Lammer: \u201cSeveral of them have been de-listed and he can\u2019t move them. Jay may or may not have some Bitcoin. If he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s [FoMO-ing 00:04:40].\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, exactly. If Jay was not too lazy to buy alt coins right now, these are the coins that he would have.Aaron Lammer: But anyway, so Laura does this show. It\u2019s a great show. She has on lots of CEOs. I mean her guest list is mostly the people behind these coins.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. She does not go our route, which is to invite on degenerate gamblers.Aaron Lammer: I feel like we like are both on the degenerate journalist and degenerate gamblers list, but we haven\u2019t had that many people who are actually like building-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: The stuff that we\u2019re talking about. So that is kinda what she normally does in the show and I\u2019m always curious \u2019cause I do listen to the show and I always sort of think about this decision to have people talk about their own work. These are people who have literally billions of dollars at stake in how the public perceives their projects.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: So it\u2019s not necessarily people that I associate with deep honesty, but it\u2019s interesting, I listen and if I have heard someone on the show it does affect whether I\u2019d want to buy that coin.Jay Kang: Yeah. Look it\u2019s the dance that all journalists have to do-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: For a certain\u00a0\u2026 especially tech journalists I think more than anybody else.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And maybe like celebrity profilers, which is is it worth having this person on in an unfiltered forum like the podcast, where I can press them on certain things or her.Aaron Lammer: Right. And Laura to her credit, she\u2019s not a no coiner who\u2019s gonna try to like poke holes in what you\u2019re doing necessarily. She-Jay Kang: And she is interested in the world.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: So she\u2019s not a troll.Aaron Lammer: Not at all.Jay Kang: I think if you and I had on her guest list, one of us-Aaron Lammer: Jay.Jay Kang: Me, would spend most of the time-Aaron Lammer: There\u2019s only one troll who\u2019s on this show.Jay Kang: Yeah, would spend most of the time trolling and asking absurd questions and trying to corner them into like stupid debate trick stuff.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: She doesn\u2019t do that-Aaron Lammer: No.Jay Kang: Because she is a curious person in real journalism. She\u2019s trying to get these things out. So-Aaron Lammer: And she\u2019s like\u00a0\u2026 generally takes the attitude of like let people like represent themselves how they wanna rep themselves.Jay Kang: Yeah. I do not take that.Aaron Lammer: So she was gonna do a show on Ripple. I guess she hadn\u2019t done the show on Ripple. I mean Ripple is this weird anomaly where it is one of the biggest coins, but it also almost exists outside of the rest of a lot of these coins, like in a different sort of business realm. And so she was trying to get on Brad Garlinghouse who runs Ripple Inc.-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: He\u2019s the CEO of Ripple Inc. and they were kinda giving here runaround on this. I had a lot of empathy for this \u2019cause I\u2019ve had the run around before by some PR apparatuses and they were like, \u201cWe\u00a0\u2026 We\u2019re not actually getting you] Brad Garlinghouse, but like we got you the next best thing, this other guy.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: And she basically negotiated with them and they kinda didn\u2019t want to budge. And so she was like, \u201cWell fine. I\u2019m gonna do it with these two other guys.\u201d, who she had booked. One of whom was Ryan Selkis who I admire. Anyway, the Ripple dudes kind of freaked out on Twitter and were kinda accusing of her of acting in bad faith-Jay Kang: Unbelievable.Aaron Lammer: And trying to argue their way on.Jay Kang: Unbelievable. Yeah, yeah. And then their like army of Ripple fans also swarmed Laura\u2019s Twitter account and were making all sorts of crazy accusations towards her, which is really the sort of sad state of discourse in America right now. Where I\u00a0\u2026 This is something I say to my wife quite a bit, which is that every time one of these things happen, which is that it seems like if you read Twitter that everybody is very obsessed with journalism. You know?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And that everyone thinks about journalism and journalist ethics all the time. And yet, you would think if that is true, that journalism business would be doing a little bit better. You know?Aaron Lammer: No.Jay Kang: Oh.Aaron Lammer: I think most people don\u2019t care, like especially in the crypto world, journalism\u2019s a pretty dirty word. Right?Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. Well that\u2019s what it is. Like essentially if you were part of the media and you say something that somebody doesn\u2019t like and this has happened to me maybe 30 times, where you get swarmed with people now who do not say, \u201cHey, you said something that I didn\u2019t like. I think you\u2019re full of shit and I hate you.\u201d They bring up these very granular and often times almost always wrong assumptions about what journalism is supposed to be and try and get you fired. Like that\u2019s the new normal.Aaron Lammer: If I sort of evaluate it, the whole exchange, I think I\u2019d call it a technical foul on both parties. I\u2019d be like-Jay Kang: Really?Aaron Lammer: Well I don\u2019t think she had to like\u00a0\u2026 totally like air the dirty laundry quite as open. Let\u2019s play a little bit of it.Jay Kang: Okay.Laura Shin: If Ripple\u2019s going to participate, I want the CEO. I always get the CEO. I got the CEO of ShapeShift, Polychain, Xapo, BitGo, MyCrypto Chain, [Bitpay Za 00:09:18], Zero X, BTCC and others. So I decided I would leverage this tweet from David to get what I have been asking for since January. \u2018Brad, I told the PR woman I was taking the option of anyone but Brad off the table.\u2019 So their two choices were either Brad or no one from Ripple. I thought there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to prefer a podcast of two non-Ripple people discussing XRP over a podcast featuring Brad talking about XRP, but the next day they refused. I asked the Ripple coms person, \u201cYou would rather have two non-Ripple people talk about XRP on my podcast than your own CEO?\u201d He wrote back, \u201cI\u2019d prefer to have two XRP experts and C-level executives from Ripple who are moving mountains to make themselves available to you, come on your podcast to answer questions.\u201d I wrote, \u201cI told you the two options were Brad or two non-Ripple people and you are choosing two non-Ripple people?\u201d He did not respond.For the record, I\u2019ve put Ripple on the Forbes Fintech 50 list for three years straight. They were the only company I cover to send me a holiday card last year, just weeks before Brad refused to come on my show. They also invited me to interview Brad at their company offsite last fall, which I couldn\u2019t make and now here we are. From invitations and holiday cards to the cold shoulder.Aaron Lammer: Okay. So you get the idea. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in the wrong, but she did dedicate like the first 10 minutes of the show to airing these like Ripple dudes out pretty hard, which I respect.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: I understand why they like are annoyed with her and she\u2019s annoyed with them. But as an impartial third party, an investor. Hey, I\u2019m just speaking as an investor here.Jay Kang: That\u2019s not an impartial third party by the way.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, totally not-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Impartial third party. The constant thin skin-ness of the people behind Ripple speaks volumes about what they\u2019re doing.Jay Kang: Yeah. It really does. I mean I\u00a0\u2026 How many Ripple fights have there been now? I mean I feel like you and I get some of it just for making fun of Ripple on our podcast-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Which I don\u2019t think anyone who listens to should take seriously as anything. Especially not like a long term referendum on whether or not this thing is an investible product or not.Aaron Lammer: Look the way we talk about Ripple and our investment track record, everyone should be happy. We\u2019ve been making fun of ripple and we\u2019ve been failing in all of our investments. So you\u2019re probably gonna do well and if you\u2019ve been honing Ripple, you are doing well. So why are you fucking complaining so much?Jay Kang: I do wonder sometimes what a portfolio would look like if they just went the opposite direction of everything that we did. So like\u00a0\u2026 You know like there are these like people who place their bets online, NFL writers.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And for times I\u2019ve just faded them because either I have a personal problem with them or I just think that they\u2019re always wrong or that I think it\u2019s funny. Sometimes it really works and I feel like if somebody just faded us consistently, that they would do pretty well.Aaron Lammer: If you\u2019ve been fading us, you\u2019d do well and if you\u2019ve been buying Ripple, you\u2019d do well and none of the arguments that I would make against Ripple or I think Laura Shin would make against Ripple necessarily mean Ripple is a bad investment.Jay Kang: No, and-Aaron Lammer: Most of these arguments are that Ripple is a bad concept that\u2019s kinda shitty for crypto and is not actually decentralized and it\u2019s controlled by company, Ripple Inc., and that\u2019s a huge problem.Jay Kang: And it is-Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s not a reason not to invest.Jay Kang: It is barely a crypto currency and that the use case is specious at best. And it\u2019s not just Laura Shin that\u2019s gotten in\u00a0\u2026 Nathaniel Poppers\u00a0\u2026 Like every journalist who has written about Ripple essentially has gotten Ripple shamed-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: In a sort of way. So I have one question for you Aaron-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Which is that you and I do track some of this stuff on Twitter. Who are these fucking Ripple fans? Our friend Joe Weisenthal got it from the Ripple fans too. Like I just\u00a0\u2026 Like I don\u2019t get who Ripple fans are.Aaron Lammer: Well I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re people who bought in when Ripple was like $3.00, most of\u00a0\u2026 Like I think they\u2019re people who really need Ripple to go back up.Jay Kang: Oh, so you think they\u2019re not people who bought in at like point seven cents-Aaron Lammer: I think they\u2019re both. I think they\u2019re both. Someone was describing to me that people who are buying Tesla, you know Tesla\u2019s getting massively-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Shorter right now. If you\u2019re betting on Teslas, you\u2019re betting on hitting the\u00a0\u2026 literally hitting the moon-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: With a rocket. It\u2019s a cult of people who like just believe in Elon Musk no matter what and they\u2019re like the Ripple fans of the stock market.Jay Kang: And you are one of these?Aaron Lammer: And I was offended because I am Tesla hodler and I do believe in Elon Musk.Jay Kang: I do not.Aaron Lammer: But I don\u2019t really know who these Ripple people are and I also don\u2019t understand why out of all of these projects\u00a0\u2026 There\u2019s crazy people in all of these projects. There\u2019s crazy Ethereum teens out there-Jay Kang: Yeah, but that makes sense.Aaron Lammer: No, but there\u2019s something dark about the Ripple fans, like there\u2019s something gamergate about them. There\u2019s something about\u00a0\u2026 and I think it comes from the top down, that it attracts people like the people who are running it, who are very weirdly thin skinned, and weirdly believe that negative press coverage is a huge threat to what they\u2019re doing.Jay Kang: Okay. I figured out who they remind me of and this is a group that I\u2019ve run across once.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Who still sometimes will tweet at me.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: They\u2019re like MLS fans to me.Aaron Lammer: That was so\u00a0\u2026 I was wondering who you were gonna offend there. Like it could\u2019ve gone so many different directions.Jay Kang: They at me a lot. They at me a lot.Aaron Lammer: MLS fans.Jay Kang: DFS, daily fantasy fans-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Gordon Peterson fans.Aaron Lammer: Wow.Jay Kang: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar fans. Yeah, there\u2019s been a lot. But-Aaron Lammer: That is the hottest take you\u2019ve ever brought to this program, that Ripple fans are the MLS fans of crypto.Jay Kang: Well let me explain which\u00a0\u2026 And it really is that they\u00a0\u2026 they sort of have this built in inferiority complex. Right? Because the thing that they support gets shit on by almost everybody who\u2019s a layperson in that field. So like if you are into sports, and maybe this has changed over the last five years or so, but it used to be\u00a0\u2026 Like if you looked five years ago, everyone just shits on MLS being like, \u201cWhy would you watch that? It\u2019s a bunch of out shape guys who went to Yukon running around. You know? And a bunch of like castoffs from Europe and Mexico.\u201d And so that builds this inferiority complex I think and that the press is generally negative towards them and so they hate the media. They have built a strange culture that to any outsider looks a little bit weird and you\u2019re like, \u201cWell why are these people into this thing?\u201dAaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Like it doesn\u2019t make any sense and that that contributes to that.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And so I think for Ripple fans\u00a0\u2026 Like the case for Ripple\u00a0\u2026 Being a fan of Ripple doesn\u2019t make any\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s not cool. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. So the future of Ripple is that bank transfers between two countries that do not do much business with one another\u00a0\u2026 So for example, trying to send money from Argentina to Sudan will be\u00a0\u2026 use the Ripple system and will use these tokens to make the transfer faster and more like seamless than it would be before.\u201d That is not a very sexy story, you know? And so that\u2019s why I think when people sort of point that out, the people who are fans, which I honestly still have no idea why they are. They get extremely defensive about it and then they congregate\u00a0\u2026 Oh! The cockroach is-Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s back. It\u2019s back.Jay Kang: Is back.Aaron Lammer: Damn, I think that cockroach is officially the mascot of Coin Talk now.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: We may have to add him to the show art.Jay Kang: I just picked up my shoe.Aaron Lammer: If you could possibly like kill him without destroying him, so I could take a photo.Jay Kang: I am wearing Yeezys right now.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, well that\u2019s a\u00a0\u2026 So you-Jay Kang: I will not be stomping on the cockroach with my Yeezys.Aaron Lammer: If I asked you, you would not kill that cockroach with those shoes?Jay Kang: No, I\u2019m not stomping on him with these fucking Yeezys.Aaron Lammer: So I think of these Ripple fans, they\u2019re people who brought like a weird beer to the party. Like they just kinda like-Jay Kang: That\u2019s the same thing.Aaron Lammer: There\u2019s this weird like level where it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, what kind of party is this?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, we\u2019re about decentralization, taking money out of the hands of the government, creating an independent transparent system that people can hold value.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cHey you guys, what if we like worked with the banks?\u201d Almost everything about what this is bringing to the table is antithetical to what most of these people came here for.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: And yet it\u2019s strangely seductive, which makes me think that there\u2019s a new generation of crypto enthusiast who is Ripple types, people who are like, \u201cI\u2019m into like bank stuff.\u201dJay Kang: Well yeah\u00a0\u2026. Here\u2019s the disconnect that I have with the Ripple fan, which is that when the super FoMO phase of around thanksgiving of last year was happening, people at my work and people in my social life were saying, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t I just buy Ripple? It\u2019s the most reasonable of all of these. Like it\u2019s the one that can exist within the world that we inhabit right now.\u201d That was their big pitch.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Right? And a lot of them bought Ripple and a lot of them did very well because they bought it at like $0.20 and they sold it at like $2.00. They did awesome. You know?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Those people are not ideologically into Ripple enough to start trolling people online. In fact, I think that they thought that Ripple was uncool, which is why they got it. You know?Aaron Lammer: Yeah, that\u2019s kinda why I bought Ripple.Jay Kang: Yeah and-Aaron Lammer: It was like go against my instinct here.Jay Kang: Yeah, but that\u2019s\u00a0\u2026 You would think that a dedicated fandom that would go around trolling people and sort of making these ugly spectacles online, that they would have some sort of ideological reasoning behind it. And that\u2019s the part I don\u2019t get with Ripple, which is why I actually think that a lot of the Ripple stuff might be bots.Aaron Lammer: Wow. I mean I will say there\u2019s some very high profile B-cash trolls out there.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: People are making B-cash rap songs. Dudes are like wigging out trying to convince you that B-cash is better. They remind me of like campus republicans at UC Berkeley on the like grange, fucking yelling at people-Jay Kang: Yeah, but those guys are idealogs.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, that\u2019s a person I recognize.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s a real person.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: I can tell there\u2019s some people who are really into B-cash.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: For real. No joke. I think that the Ripple people are bots is a provocative way to look at it.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: If not bots they\u2019re like-Jay Kang: Paid.Aaron Lammer: Or weirdly like there\u2019s some central place in all of the Ripple communications where people are getting together and it\u2019s like, \u201cAll right guys. Everyday let\u2019s go out one hour and reply to every threat about Ripple we can.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: \u201cAnd put our fucking nose in here and say\u00a0\u2026\u201d \u2019Cause it\u2019s always about you\u2019re wrong about Ripple. Like another thing that I wanted to talk about was\u00a0\u2026 and actually was trying to get him on the show, maybe he\u2019ll come on and talk about this. Jackson Palmer who created Dogecoin-Jay Kang: Dogecoin.Aaron Lammer: Dogecoin-Jay Kang: Hard G.Aaron Lammer: Adrian said it was the other way-Jay Kang: No, he said it was Dogecoin.Aaron Lammer: Oh, okay.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Jackson Palmer who created Dogecoin-Jay Kang: Thank you.Aaron Lammer: He has this website called \u2018Are we decentralized yet?\u201d, which basically shows the concentration of the coins.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Like how centralized the different currencies are. I think Bitcoin is like 35% and it\u2019s the lowest and Ethereum\u2019s next on down. Ripple is 98% centralized.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: This is not him like trying to take down the company Ripple. This is just like he has like built and wants to like show. Like you can make of it what you want.Jay Kang: It\u2019s information.Aaron Lammer: Information.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: You can say, \u201cThat information\u2019s bogus or that\u2019s a shitty way to do it.\u201d, or whatever. He\u2019s gotten ripped by so many Ripple people for this that he like\u00a0\u2026 is like taking it down or giving the project to someone else. He\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s literally just not worth it for me. Twitter\u2019s unusable because it\u2019s a 100% of these like Ripple people just like at-ting me all the time.\u201dJay Kang: I\u00a0\u2026 That\u2019s\u00a0\u2026 I just don\u2019t get it, like where did all these people come from. Like who are they?Aaron Lammer: Well let\u2019s talk about another thing-Jay Kang: Have you ever\u00a0\u2026 You and I now know a lot of people in the crypto space. Have you ever met anyone who was really, really into Ripple?Aaron Lammer: Yeah, like my brother-in-law\u2019s pretty into Ripple, I don\u2019t to mean to like air him out. I think like for certain people who like\u00a0\u2026 I kinda do my research into like a few coins, this one seems like a good bet to me, bought it and did well. They\u2019ve got more memories. You know?Jay Kang: Yeah, but they\u00a0\u2026 That doesn\u2019t mean they go brigade people online.Aaron Lammer: Well like\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s kinda like sports. Like why am I so into Monero? I don\u2019t know. I just got into Monero, I love Monero.Jay Kang: You don\u2019t brigade people, at least that I know-Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I know-Jay Kang: You don\u2019t like go troll people who slander Monero online.Aaron Lammer: It does get on my hackles a little bit when people are like, \u201cMonero\u2019s like a money laundering coin.\u201d Like a little part inside of me is like, \u201cFuck you dude.\u201dJay Kang: Yes, it is but\u00a0\u2026Aaron Lammer: Yes, and?Jay Kang: Well here\u2019s the thing.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Every subculture that\u00a0\u2026 And this is what we\u2019ve found through however many years of internet subculture, it\u2019s very hard to predict which ones will go and do these for some toxic brigading campaigns and make people\u2019s\u00a0\u2026Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Social media unusable. So for example\u00a0\u2026 And look I\u2019m not saying that this is their fault, but like Barstool Sports who\u2019s another subculture that completely-Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Another group of people who hate Jay.Jay Kang: Who hate me, yes. They have a-Aaron Lammer: Shout outs to that one guy at Barstool Sports who\u2019s a big Francis and the Lights fan though.Jay Kang: Well they also are big Bitcoin fans.Aaron Lammer: Oh, yeah.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t have a problem with Barstool honestly. But like they\u2019re-Aaron Lammer: Who\u2019s\u00a0\u2026 Do they have like a crypto person over there? We should have someone on.Jay Kang: They do. They do.Aaron Lammer: Okay. Let\u2019s have them on.Jay Kang: Yeah, their business guy. But like-Aaron Lammer: Let\u2019s have that guy on. Hey, you\u2019re invited on the show guy.Jay Kang: He\u2019s been into Bitcoin for a long time. But Barstool does have this reputation for having fans that-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: That swarm and they do. The fans do swarm. If you talk to the guys at Barstool, they don\u2019t\u00a0\u2026 they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a problem. We don\u2019t really get why it happens. But we don\u2019t encourage it.\u201d But like similar sports sites don\u2019t have that. Like so for example, we at Grantland had like a pretty big audience, but like we didn\u2019t have that type of activity happen.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And that you could argue that the people who read Grantland were different than the people who read Barstool. I don\u2019t actually think that that\u2019s necessarily true. It\u2019s just that some communities build up these types of things.Aaron Lammer: Well I think you could say that the people who are working for Ripple Inc., the guy who was tweeting at Laura like, \u201cHey, I really think I should come on the show. I like know this and that about it.\u201d I think he\u2019s like the chief scientist or whatever from there.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah.Aaron Lammer: Those people in some ways emboldening other Ripple fans to like come after people.Jay Kang: Yeah, but that\u00a0\u2026 That sort of stuff happens all the fall through doesn\u2019t always happen.Aaron Lammer: I know. It\u2019s true. Like you\u2019re always trolling Wait Wait\u2026 Don\u2019t Tell Me!, but it\u2019s not like everyone from Grantland started trolling them.Jay Kang: Yeah or like nobody else does. I\u2019ve started slowly like building my army, but like\u00a0\u2026Aaron Lammer: Jay, I think that the lesson of this is that you should stop trolling Wait Wait\u2026 Don\u2019t Tell Me!, not mimic the tactics of Ripple fans to try to take them down.Jay Kang: I would say that there is a\u00a0\u2026 with certain things you can draw a corelation between the actual culture and that behavior. For example, you could say that there is a reason why MRA, Men\u2019s Rights Activists, would swarm the accounts of women who don\u2019t like men\u2019s rights activists. Right?Aaron Lammer: Absolutely.Jay Kang: That makes sense.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: It makes no sense when you take Ripple into account. In fact, you would think that the group of people who would swarm people would be the ones who like stable like corporate coin.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, like a bunch of like bankers.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s not like you see like Wall Street guys swarming the mentions of like stocks that they\u2019re shorting or something.Jay Kang: No, no, no.Aaron Lammer: I mean but is there that kinda activist stuff in stocks, where people are like\u00a0\u2026 trying to like spread FUD?Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. For sure.Aaron Lammer: I mean they\u2019re kind of spreading the opposite of FUD. They\u2019re spreading like pro-Ripple propaganda.Jay Kang: Well I mean look if they did that, it would obviously be illegal if it was traced back to a certain source that was invested in it. The thing with Ripple is it just makes so little sense to me that I will say purely speculatively and allegedly that it does seem like\u00a0\u2026 I would not be surprised to find out if there was some sort of like social media campaigning that was going on in this sort of way.Aaron Lammer: You really gotta watch out when the Russian Ethereum stands show up. That\u2019s gonna\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s gonna all be over then-Jay Kang: It\u2019s all over.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s gonna be curtains for our Twitter accounts then.Jay Kang: All right. So let\u2019s move on to another part of media, which is television and-Aaron Lammer: Yeah. We\u2019re doing kind of an overview of like pop culture crypto right now. I guess Ripple\u2019s not really pop culture as it\u2019s\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s tech culture though.Jay Kang: Tech culture.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s troll culture.Jay Kang: Yeah. So did you watch Silicon Valley this week?Aaron Lammer: I did\u00a0\u2026 I did watch. I enjoy the program Silicon Valley and they had been teasing like Bitcoin plot a little bit earlier in the season, then it didn\u2019t seem like it was gonna happen and then it came roaring back.Jay Kang: I feel like the link between Bitcoin and Silicon Valley has been going on for a long time, because what Pied Piper is trying to build is a decentralized internet. Right?Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: And so Richard Hendricks who is the\u00a0\u2026 I don\u2019t know what the actor\u2019s name is. But the character on the show, when he does these sort of like standup speeches about what he\u2019s trying to build, it\u2019s always about decentralization.Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: And so Pied Piper this week was having trouble with its series B funding and there was some things written in it that the CEO did not like. And so instead he was\u00a0\u2026 allowed one of the engineers who\u2019s played by Martin Starr from Freaks and Geeks and Party Down, to convince him to ICO instead.Aaron Lammer: Yes, let\u2019s play it. Let\u2019s hear a little bit of that.Speaker 5: Gilfoyle, we\u2019re not gonna suddenly pivot and become a digital currency company.Speaker 6: I\u2019m not proposing a pivot. I\u2019m proposing that we sell digital currency as a way to finance our new internet company. You wanted an alternative to Laurie Bream. Well it\u2019s right here in front of you. Pied Piper Coin.Speaker 5: Okay, look, I\u2019m not gonna bet the entire future of my new internet and everything I\u2019ve worked for on becoming the next Bitcoin. You really expect me to do that?Speaker 6: There are very few things that I will defend with true passion: medical marijuana, the biblical Satan as a metaphor for rebellion against tyranny, and mother fucking Goddamn cryptocurrency.Aaron Lammer: So in some ways it\u2019s kind of inevitable to me that Silicon Valley would\u2019ve ended up here.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: When this show came out, I was like, \u201cWhere are they gonna go with this?\u201d You know? Is it gonna be like the same joke forever? Is it gonna like burn itself out over a few seasons? I think a lot of people feel like it did, but there seems like there\u2019s a new life in it, and in some ways crypto is a new cultural life in Silicon Valley. It\u2019s like a whole new world to make fun of.Jay Kang: I\u2019m surprised that it took them this long to start making fun of crypto.Aaron Lammer: I feel like people wouldn\u2019t have gotten the joke until year.Jay Kang: Maybe. Maybe that is true and they would\u2019ve had to explain too much. Now like-Aaron Lammer: And I was surprised how deep it went. Like did you hear that part where they were talking about like securities regulation?Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah.Aaron Lammer: Let\u2019s hear that.Speaker 5: Who do I hire? Someone who understands securities, right?Speaker 7: Not necessarily. I mean your coin doesn\u2019t have to be a security. You could do a utility token instead, since you provide an actual unit of compute. Although, you\u2019d have SEC. Damn it. Surge pricing.Speaker 5: Monica.Speaker 7: You might not even need to bother with a moving average pricing strategy when you launch. But you will need to keep a close eye on statements from the federal government, South Korea, and China. So, whoever you do hire should definitely know how to do all that.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s a fairly like in depth way to talk about this.Jay Kang: And very topical for right now.Aaron Lammer: Yes, very up to the news cycle.Jay Kang: Yes. The only question that I had about all of this\u00a0\u2026 I enjoyed the episode as well. The only question I had was like, has crypto reached the saturation point in culture where you can do a episode on a very popular show on HBO about an ICO and you can actually kind of represent it well without sort of having people sit down and do explainers of every single thing that\u2019s going on?Aaron Lammer: I think that there\u2019s certain pop culture that sits as sort of the bleeding edge of introducing ideas, like South Park comes to my mind.Jay Kang: Sure.Aaron Lammer: And a lot of times these are shows that are written really closely to the news cycle and we can just know that this is written closely to the news cycle because the stuff about securities has only really been in the news for about I\u2019d say what the last month-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Maybe six weeks. So South Park would do this too, where they\u2019d do the episodes in one week and often times like the stuff that\u2019s coming up in those episodes becomes like deeper in pop culture in the next wave, as like writing catches up. So I would read this as this is gonna be a year of a lot of crypto jokes.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: And I think it\u2019s probably good. It\u2019s probably a bullish signal.Jay Kang: Well look, their ICO didn\u2019t turn out so well\u00a0\u2026Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: At the episode that we\u2019re at right now, but the case for it I thought was actually quite elegant and it actually made me think that I\u00a0\u2026 more of ICOs, which was that look, if you keep relying on VCs, they\u2019re gonna keep chipping away. Right?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And that they are ruthless. Like you could get the rug pulled out from you at any time. You are going to have to do things you don\u2019t want and then this when it was that, they didn\u2019t wanna sell ads on the Pied Piper platform. Right? And she was gonna make them sell ads. And so the case they made was that the only way that we can do this the way that we want to do it is to do an ICO, which is what they did.Aaron Lammer: The thing that struck me when I was watching it is what if this was my first encounter with crypto. I mean young Aaron Lammer. I\u2019m 17 years old. I like stole my friend\u2019s parents login to HBO. I\u2019ve heard of Bitcoin. I don\u2019t really know what it is. Then you watch this and it\u2019s like the really clear message of the joke in it, is that VCs are gonna get supplanted by these initial coin offerings, and that they\u2019re like at an existential war-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: With each other. And I do think pop culture can kind of inform how the future goes with this stuff. And the fact that Silicon Valley, which I know is a show that\u2019s like written very much within that culture and sourced with people are there, makes me think that that is a joke that Silicon Valley people would recognize and in some ways describes how people are feeling about this.Jay Kang: Yeah and the rest of the episode did have like a referendum on other Bitcoin type friend things. Right?Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: So there was like the VC guy who had 300 million dollars on a thumb drive and he was looking through a dumpster for it. Right?Aaron Lammer: Tried 35 ICOs and only one of them worked.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah.Speaker 8: Listen, all the coin I had from the ICO that worked was on a USB thumb drive. And my dumb fucking housekeeper threw out my jeans, \u2019cause they were ripped, even though I paid more for the ripped ones and the thumb drive was in the pocket. So $300 million in crypto is buried out here, somewhere. But my boys will find it. If they wanna get paid, right?Aaron Lammer: This reminded also that in the overall reality bleed that\u2019s happening between fact and fiction and like real Silicon Valley and this. Alexis Ohanian, who is one of the co-founders of Reddit, was on I believe Colbert this week basically describing cryptocurrencies as the pathway towards a new internet. But I have to say I don\u2019t totally understand it. In fact, when I think of it, I just come back to Pied Piper, which is fictional and not a real technology\u00a0\u2026 or not really like something that I could see happening. So what do you think that new internet is?Jay Kang: So is Richard Hendricks just making Ethereum?Aaron Lammer: I won\u2019t try to weigh in on what he\u2019s building. But I think when people are talking in the real world about the new internet, they\u2019re imagining some kind of the frictionless Ethereum system that has something to do with micropayments and infinite storage and totally free, unfettered access to everything, everything tracked. I don\u2019t really know. I mean I feel like I\u2019ve just wrapped my head around how Bitcoin works and when people have described these Toshi Ethereum land universes, I haven\u2019t totally like wrapped my head around what this new internet is all about. I know that DApps are gonna be a big part of it, but\u00a0\u2026 Well I hope we get some people on the show who can like sell us on this vision a little more fully.Jay Kang: Yeah. Brian Armstrong please.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. I\u2019d like to talk to Brian Armstrong.Jay Kang: We\u2019ve never insulted you. All right. So let\u2019s go to my favorite story of the week, which is the\u00a0\u2026 this was in Bloomberg, their crypto vertical.Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: \u2018The Wealthy Are Hoarding 10 billion dollars of Bitcoin in Bunkers\u2019, and it is the story of Xapo, which is-Aaron Lammer: Yeah. We\u2019ve talked about Xapo on the show before. Yeah.Jay Kang: yeah, yeah. And it is the new venture of Wences Casares, who if you\u2019ve read Nathaniel Popper\u2019s book \u2018Digital Gold\u2019, he is one of the real evangelists of Bitcoin at the beginning. Like what Roger Ver was doing to people in Japan, Wences was doing sort of to Silicon Valley people, VCs, CEOs, people who were interested in other types of technology, the sort of Silicon Valley elite. Wences was the guy who was converting them all over to Bitcoin. And he comes across very sympathetically in Nathaniel\u2019s book.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, he seems like a smart, interesting person. Of all the people\u00a0\u2026 Like this venture is not like a get rich quick cash in.Jay Kang: No. It is a way to store your Bitcoin in a way that feels secure.Aaron Lammer: I mean literally-Jay Kang: Which is something you and I know nothing about.Aaron Lammer: Literally in a bunker.Jay Kang: In a bunker.Aaron Lammer: And on a spectrum from the most insecure way to store Bitcoin would be just on an exchange, then there\u2019s like jump drive like systems-Jay Kang: Ledger and-Aaron Lammer: Ledger Nano is what I have.Jay Kang: Trezor.Aaron Lammer: Trezor and then all the way at the other end of the spectrum is the Xapo. It\u2019s X-A-P-O, which is literally a concrete bunker. It\u2019s not connected to the internet with computers storing private keys for high net worth individuals I think mostly and family investment arms.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. So like Novogratz has his there. From the article, two Xapo clients said it houses roughly 10 billion dollars of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin\u2019s price after all is hardly steady. Now I did a little bit of number crunching at my desk at work today.Aaron Lammer: Calculator Kang in the house.Jay Kang: Calculator Kang is in the house. That\u2019s 7% of the Bitcoin supply right now.Aaron Lammer: I think it\u2019s probably actually more than that \u2019cause\u00a0\u2026 because so many coins probably are actually lost, that it would be even more than that. The actual-Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. So in a pure system, it is 7%.Aaron Lammer: \u2019Cause we actually know all the coins that are in Xapo are there, unlike all the other coins on earth.Jay Kang: Yeah. So let\u2019s take Saifedean Ammous\u2019 Bitcoin maximalist-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Vision to the end. Right?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And that Bitcoin is all the money in the world.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: 7% of the global money supply is 6.28 trillion dollars.Aaron Lammer: Could we pay off the federal deficit with that?Jay Kang: No. Definitely not. So that is 50 Jeff Bezozes in one vault.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I mean it\u2019s kind of incredible. In some ways in the present day, the bunker seems excessive. In the Bitcoin maximalist world view, they\u2019re gonna need a lot of guns around that bunker.Jay Kang: Yeah. Well I mean\u00a0\u2026 So here\u2019s my question to you, which is that look the idea-Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m always talking about guns on this show.Jay Kang: The idea of a small number of people holding 6.28 trillion dollars in a bunker, right now it would destroy any sort of world economy because so much wealth would be centralized in one spat, amongst a small number of people. Right?Aaron Lammer: Sure.Jay Kang: Does this actually make the case for Bitcoin itself taking over the entire world economy a little bit harder, because it\u2019s so\u00a0\u2026 Like none of these people are gonna sell their Bitcoin or distribute it. And so if Bitcoin does take over the world, it means that even just with this, you have a massive concentration of wealth.Aaron Lammer: Well-Jay Kang: Does that bother you?Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019m not sure I agree with that none of these people are ever gonna sell or move their Bitcoin.Jay Kang: If Bitcoin keeps going up and they believe in Bitcoin in the way that they do, I don\u2019t\u00a0\u2026 I think that that concentration will stay pretty constant.Aaron Lammer: I do think that that much of the Bitcoin in one place is a problem on several levels and I assume that as the price accelerated, there would be more Xapos scattered around the earth, and that we would try to spread out the Bitcoin amongst them. I just see it would make sense. You know? Bitcoin goes 10 X and there\u2019s 10 times much money there, you might wanna at least say, \u201cHey, we don\u2019t wanna keep more than like a 100 billion per bunker.\u201d Or something like that.Jay Kang: I guess my problem is more that like if we try and think of\u00a0\u2026 visualize Bitcoin as being the standard for all wealth in the world. Right? And that some of the ethos of Bitcoin is like we\u2019re gonna help bank the bankless-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And that\u2019s gonna lead to\u00a0\u2026 Like I think that what it basically has led to is that the people\u00a0\u2026 the wealth concentration that we see right now is gonna become hyper concentrated. Right? And it\u2019s going to just be the people who bought into large amounts of Bitcoin early, and that seems like it\u2019s a real problem. You have very little flexibility in that world because small amounts of people are essentially gonna be nation states upon themselves, which already is sort of happening. But it will be accelerated for no reason, for no value except for the fact that they own all this Bitcoin early. Like do you see that as a problem?Aaron Lammer: You know I don\u2019t know enough about the like current concentration of wealth in the world. Somehow it compares-Jay Kang: Well just think about 50 Jeff Bezozes in like one vault.Aaron Lammer: But I mean that\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering. Like if you took the top 100 Fiat holders in the world and concentrated their wealth in Swiss bank. Does the Swiss banking system as a whole have that much money in it?Jay Kang: Well it\u2019s not even\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s just like there aren\u2019t 50 Jeff Bezozes. Like there\u2019s one Jeff Bezoz.Aaron Lammer: Right.Jay Kang: Right?Aaron Lammer: Right.Jay Kang: And if you-Aaron Lammer: But there\u2019s the 50 richest people on earth-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Which let\u2019s say are like somewhere overall around 50 Jeff Bezozes.Jay Kang: Yeah. No, that would get nowhere close to 7% of the total net worth in the world.Aaron Lammer: Wow. Yeah, I mean look I think it\u2019s a major liability. I think these people are liabilities and Satoshi\u2019s stash is probably a liability in its own right. My guess is that the like gamblers amongst us would read that situation and say, \u201cProbably none of those coins are ever gonna move. Let\u2019s just look at it as a smaller supply.\u201d That said, if someone decides to like become like a despotic tyrant-Jay Kang: That\u2019s the problem!Aaron Lammer: With their money. I mean and like clearly the betting odds are on Peter Thiel here. Right?Jay Kang: Sure.Aaron Lammer: I mean we know that Peter Thiel\u00a0\u2026 and not just looking at Peter Thiel the individual, but his sort of network of like companies of investments. Yeah, it could be like a major holder amongst those.Jay Kang: Yeah. Do you want Peter Thiel to be richer than he already is by several, several hundreds percent?Aaron Lammer: I\u2019d be against it myself.Jay Kang: Yeah. And so that-Aaron Lammer: But I am getting rich during that scenario. Now if I go 100 X and I also know that Peter Thiel is going a hundred X, will I accept scenario? I think I probably would.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know. I would think very, very hard about it.Aaron Lammer: I think you also have to look at this a little bit like the force. There\u2019s a dark side and there\u2019s a light side and I would hope that some of the people who became powerful and insanely rich through Bitcoin, would use it to do good. And that it\u2019s not an inherent system that those people would become like despotic, tyrant nation states. That money could be used a lot of different ways.Jay Kang: I guess so, but you are still setting up a world in which there are oligarchs. You\u2019re setting up like a mass concentration of wealth-Aaron Lammer: Yeah. But we live in a world where there are oligarchs already.Jay Kang: Yeah and it\u2019s not great. It\u2019s not great.Aaron Lammer: I mean I don\u2019t see how you disrupt currency and also end oligarchy simultaneously.Jay Kang: Well look, that\u2019s the problem with things like Ripple right, where they start out so concentrated. I guess that-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: The thing that I would think\u00a0\u2026 And this is what I think actually will happen and this is like my hottest take-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Which I think that there will be a minable coin in the future that will probably be less centralized in wealth. And that because people will be more used to the idea of crypto, that it won\u2019t be as concentrated and that that feature, that it is not so concentrated that there aren\u2019t these massive dents clusters of wealth, that that will cause people to actually buy into a little bit more, because they can buy into a more democratic vision. Like-Aaron Lammer: Kang coin. It\u2019s for the people.Jay Kang: Kang coin for the people, like let\u2019s do it. But like the problem-Aaron Lammer: So part of the way Kang coin works is sort of like magnetism. If you get too much Kang coin, like it repels other Kang coin.Jay Kang: Yeah. You can only\u00a0\u2026 Your Kang coins are capped, right? Like I actually don\u2019t think I would do that. But that is\u00a0\u2026 If something spread and was mine to add paste, where it was sort of by propulsion was more evenly distributed, I actually think that that would probably be a better vision of it. And maybe that\u2019s what the people who are behind Ethereum are hoping for.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t really see how Ethereum is in improvement in this respect, other than it\u2019s a different group of people who\u2019ve become the oligarchs.Jay Kang: I personally just don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for 12 random people to have 7% of the world\u2019s wealth. That\u2019s just me. All right. So go-Aaron Lammer: I mean there\u2019s also like a timeline where like Xapo is involved in some sort of like insane like atomic accident or something that-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Like I mean the incentives-Jay Kang: EMP baby.Aaron Lammer: Destroy Xapo, if Bitcoin really was a million dollars would be intense. You know?Jay Kang: Now that would be a good movie.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Breaking into Xapo to do an EMP to like wipe out all of this wealth.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Kang coin can reconquer the world.Jay Kang: Exactly. Oh, maybe the Kang coin should just fund the Kang coin movie.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: It should be a production house where we should make all the dumb Bitcoin movies that we think of.Aaron Lammer: The Jaytoshi Saga.Jay Kang: All right. So the second part of the Xapo story is how it actually works and this is something that I think was very interesting to me at least, which is\u00a0\u2026 This is from Bloomberg\u2019s story, \u2018At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client\u2019s identity and authenticates a request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\u2019Aaron Lammer: Well for starters, that\u2019s the first scene in the movie, is it\u2019s you during those two days. You\u2019re getting verified.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: But you\u2019re really a mole who\u2019s breaking into Xapo to like destroy it from the inside-Jay Kang: Yeah. I\u2019m taking like a mental map.Aaron Lammer: But you\u2019re posing as like a wealthy Korean business man, who\u2019s like eye scan you\u2019ve stolen. You\u2019re like\u00a0\u2026 You\u2019re wearing his eye balls.Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly.Aaron Lammer: I mean that sounds like pretty good security. This is interesting to me because one of the thing we hypothesized I think during the basement tapes, was that ultimately rich people were gonna\u00a0\u2026 wanting to buy into Bitcoin through some sort of an ETF or some sort of a\u00a0\u2026 basically an abstracted way that was secure, where they basically just owned stock. And this presents a different, I think superior vision, which is if you really have that much money, just buy\u00a0\u2026 hire someone to buy a bunch of Bitcoin and go put it in this place that has a two day wait and the most insane security procedures in the world. As long as you\u2019re putting it\u00a0\u2026 making a big investment, that\u2019s probably more cost effective than using one of these GBTC like kind of investment products.Jay Kang: Yeah and I think that if you\u2019re like a Bitcoin purest, it is certainly the most pure vision of it.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: I mean it actually makes Bitcoin seem very cool.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s cool to have an internet that\u2019s not on the internet. Like they just have like\u00a0\u2026 There\u2019s just like a\u00a0\u2026 Like you know? It\u2019s like just dead inside Xapo. The computers can\u2019t talk to anyone.Jay Kang: Yeah. I\u2019m picturing like a very, very old man hunched over, walking like from vault to vault.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, with like a-Jay Kang: Writing down-Aaron Lammer: Big, big key thing with like thousands of little keys on it.Jay Kang: Yeah. Yeah. And he\u2019s like writing down the private keys on a little piece of paper and walking it over.Aaron Lammer: Mr. Kang, you can come in now.Jay Kang: Oh, thank you. Oh, hello Mr. Kang. Yeah, exactly. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhat will your withdrawal\u00a0\u2026\u201d It sounds awesome actually.Aaron Lammer: How was your stay at the Swiss town in the Alps Mr. Kang?Jay Kang: Maybe we should put our very small amount of Bitcoin into Xapo just so that we could get the service.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re allowed. I think it\u2019s like you have to like meet some sort of minimum, right?Jay Kang: Really?Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know.Jay Kang: I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m sure.Aaron Lammer: We should try and get Casares on the show. I know it\u2019s a long shot, but come on the show, man.Jay Kang: Yeah, answer all of our questions.Aaron Lammer: He\u2019s a friend of a friend to me. I\u2019m gonna try and talk him into it.Jay Kang: We\u2019ll cut you into the movie rights.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what I said. I think we should just ICO this movie about us breaking into Xapo and then we\u2019ll use that money and put it in Xapo.Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly.Aaron Lammer: And not actually make the movie.Jay Kang: We\u2019ll give him a producer credit.Aaron Lammer: All we need to do is story board this story out.Jay Kang: Yeah. Start a kick starter that only takes\u00a0\u2026 that only deals in cryptocurrency.Aaron Lammer: Well there must be competing Xapos out there or people must trying to create competition for this.Jay Kang: Yeah. Yeah. I mean look it\u2019s too good of an idea and it is one that basically takes out\u00a0\u2026 or seems to take out the biggest fear that one would have if you had a shit load of Bitcoin, which is what if someone kidnaps me, what if I get hacked, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.Aaron Lammer: Yeah and it also creates like a framework where you can imaging like hodling across hundreds of years.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: You know like post apocalyptic movie where people are like walking across the like shattered remains of Europe to try to get to Xapo to like get access to these billions of dollars.Jay Kang: Have you seen the land before time?Aaron Lammer: I have.Jay Kang: I feel like we could make a movie that was like\u00a0\u2026 where Xapo was like the oasis, you know?Aaron Lammer: Oh, yeah.Jay Kang: And that the world has become a post apocalyptic hellscape and a small group of people are trying to make it to Xapo.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Which is the only place with money in the world and it\u2019s been walled off and like\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s like Elon Musks\u2019 computer deals.Aaron Lammer: Oh, see I\u00a0\u2026 In my vision, the world was a scorched wasteland and the people were walking to Xapo so they could get the Bitcoin out to like restart the world economy-Jay Kang: Why would you need a world economy if there\u2019s no world economy left?Aaron Lammer: I mean-Jay Kang: Like what is Bitcoin worth in like a scorched earth scenario?Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s like the key to rebuilding civilization, is to get the Bitcoin network back up.Jay Kang: Explain how.Aaron Lammer: I think we have to cut this off before like we just turn this into a Bitcoin movies podcast.Jay Kang: Yeah, like the stoned Bitcoin movies podcast.Speaker 2: This episode of Coin Talk was taped Wednesday, May 9th at six PM eastern standard time. The Bitcoin price index was $9,294.00.Aaron Lammer: Thanks to everyone for listening. We are brought to you in partnership with Medium.

Monica is the driving force behind Ripple\u2019s messaging and marketing, and helps translate the technical details of how their products work into easy to understand concepts.How did you get dragged into the crazy world of Ripple all the way back in 2013? It was still a pretty obscure project at that\u00a0time.I worked with Chris Larsen (co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple) when he was the CEO of Prosper. In August 2013, I\u2019d noticed he started something new (Ripple) and I dropped him a line to catch up.From that first conversation, I knew this technology had revolutionary potential, but I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t totally understand it! It took a few conversations and a lot of deep thinking to understand how it works and how we could apply it to solve real world problems. (The truth is I keep learning every day.)From that meeting, I knew I wanted to join the team at Ripple for two reasons. Firstly\u200a\u2014\u200aChris is a true visionary. He was a pioneer in online mortgage lending with E-Loan and again in peer-to-peer lending with Prosper and was a driving force in both categories taking flight. He\u2019s a good person to follow, given his knack for finding disruptive ideas early on.Secondly\u200a\u2014\u200athe common thread to Chris\u2019 ventures has been the democratization of finance in some respect. Ripple is no different. Having a background studying third-world development, I am deeply passionate about Ripple\u2019s ability to increase access to global commerce worldwide, and the life-changing impact that will have.What did you do before you got into\u00a0this?I was at Intuit on the corporate communications team and before that at a tech PR agency.What problem is Ripple solving, and why do you feel passionate about\u00a0this?At Ripple, our mission is to remove friction from global payments. International payments have earned the reputation of being slow, unreliable and expensive. In fact, they\u2019re prohibitively expensive for entire segments of the population. If global payments are instant, reliable, easy and low-cost, they become so much more accessible to everyone\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially in underserved markets.To draw a comparison, the Internet made information exchange instant, reliable, easy and low-cost. By breaking down borders and barriers, it\u2019s connected the entire world and enabled previously impossible or unthinkable businesses and opportunities.We have the opportunity to enable a new era in commerce that holds revolutionary possibility. It\u2019s a tough problem to solve but incredibly inspiring and rewarding to work on.What\u2019s been the most inspiring experience you\u2019ve had at Ripple thus far? You\u2019ve been around to see most of the company\u2019s history.I\u2019m most inspired by big customer milestones. It was a watershed moment for us when our first institutional customers went live in production and sent their customers\u2019 payments across the network. Another big moment was when the first institutional customer went live with payments through XRP. In both cases, we had happy customers who have increased volume and usage over time.As an example, SBI Remit and Siam Commercial Bank went live in production with Ripple-powered payments last summer. SBI Remit\u2019s customers are Thai ex-patriates living and working in Japan. In many cases, they\u2019re supporting families back home in Thailand so it\u2019s important their funds arrive quickly and reliably.That real market validation of our products and value propositions is incredibly rewarding and motivates us to keep building.What are some ideas you\u2019re excited about in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, and\u00a0why?I think interoperability is a critical design principle to an Internet of Value (an Internet that allows money to move around the world like information already does), and needs greater attention from the industry.Our engineering team works a lot on the interoperability of systems\u200a\u2014\u200abe they blockchains or traditional. We\u2019re seeing scalability limitations stunt the growth and possibilities of Bitcoin and Ethereum. We developed the Interledger Protocol, which is totally open-source and free, to enable instant transactions across any number of ledgers without risk of failure.As you think about the rapid pace at which this industry moves, what do you think happens over the next few years? And what about longer\u00a0term?In the next couple of years, we\u2019ll see a culling of the herd in crypto. It\u2019s fantastic to see the whole market grow so rapidly with lots of developers getting involved. But not every new coin and new system has a well-defined and validated use case. Of the 1,500 or so cryptocurrencies in existence, I think many will go away and the strong will survive.Over a 10\u201320 year time horizon, I think blockchain and crypto will be the technology drivers of a new industrial revolution. The most obvious implication is likely greater global commerce and financial inclusion. But there\u2019ll be far-reaching progress and change we can\u2019t even imagine today. Think of how different the world is because of the cotton gin, the shipping container, the Internet. Blockchain and crypto are innovations of that significance.Thanks to Monica for participating!

SpencerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 28, 2018Ripple is really good at B2B partnerships and of all the cryptocurrencies it\u2019s been integrated with banks and financial institutions the most successfully. This gives the speculation about a partnership between Ripple (XRP) and Amazon.com (AMZN) an aura of plausibility.However, let\u2019s be clear this is a hypothetical partnership that is yet to happen, and Amazon is not likely to partner with a cryptocurrency directly, it\u2019s already offering blockchain on the cloud via AWS.Last December, the chief cryptographer for Ripple, David Schwartz, let it slip that there were two huge Ripple partnerships coming up that he wasn\u2019t able to name. Ripple is full of big partnerships though, so it\u2019s a bit of a leap to think Amazon is among them. However in recent months, Facebook has created a blockchain division meaning Google and Amazon are under pressure to adopt native cryptocurrency or blockchain solutions to keep at the forefront of innovation.If indeed Ripple is partnering with Amazon, it\u2019s been kept secret pretty well. Ripple payment settlement services and XRP (the coin) would be able to streamline operations and cross-border payments.Ripple has around 4800 times the supply of Bitcoin, this is not a scarce decentralized asset.While Ripple is a distributed, open-source payments system that\u2019s still in beta; it\u2019s highly compatible with the existing financial system and therefore it\u2019s easy to see the commercial digital web adopting it. Amazon has of late partnered with J.P. Morgan Chase and shows both ties to the Pentagon, the police and is nearly a fetish company of Wall Street investors.Ripple on the other hand is led by a private company. According to is OpenCoin, the company behind ripple, the currency addresses the need to keep money flowing freely. Amazon as an E-commerce, Cloud, Entertainment, Grocery-logistics, and AI company\u200a\u2014\u200acertainly knows something about keeping money flowing with well over 100 million Amazon Prime customers. It\u2019s also the leading smart speaker in terms of penetration into our homes.The argument goes: Amazon deals with a lot of suppliers from around the globe. These suppliers need to be paid in a fast and efficient way. Amazon is a complex B2B and B2C entity and one of the leading marketplaces of the future. As a global entity Amazon may adopt blockchain for more efficient low-cost and fast payments; Ripple would definately be someone they could look into adopting or even acquiring.Ripple\u2019s mission statement is about unifying a fragmented payment situation:Payment systems today are where email was in the early \u201980s. Every provider built their own system for their customers and if people used different systems they couldn\u2019t easily interact with each other. Ripple is designed to connect different payment systems together.In theory this is a vision that\u2019s compatible with what Amazon is doing with E-commerce around the world, with now a significant presence in India. Even as Walmart has practically acquired Flipkart, Amazon will likely be the dominant marketplace for hundreds of millions of people in India and basically become the primary shopping utility for the english speaking internet.The company building the Ripple protocol, OpenCoin, was co-founded by CEO Chris Larsen and CTO Jed McCaleb. Ripple has had success integrating with groups of Japanese banks in particular. If successful, that amounts to practically a national roll-out in Japan, where Bitcoin adoption with retail and services is commonplace.Ripple bills itself as:Better Than Any BlockchainOne Frictionless Experience To Send Money GloballyRipple connects banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges and corporates via RippleNet to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally. Would Amazon want access to such a system? How would it integrate?The rumor gathered speed in November 2017, when Ripple hosted a conference presentation and displayed a slide that appeared to show Amazon, Uber, and Seagate as prime examples of companies that could use Ripple\u2019s xVia platform. Certainly in Ripple\u2019s end-game, it\u2019s integrated with the likes of Uber and Amazon; however now with Facebook likely going after a FacebookCoin of some kind, Ripple will have to move fast to make the necessary enterprise integration; and not just be relegated for banks and the purely financial world.Ripple QR Code Mobile Payments?In theory, trading between Amazon and suppliers would be as easy as scanning a Q.R code and transferring Ripple (XRP) coins.We know with the likes of AmazonGo stores, consumers sign-in with QR codes. It\u2019s likely FacebookCoin and Amazon\u2019s brick-and-mortar tech will increasingly go the route of QR codes, which have become the dominant mobile payment gateway on the New China internet.Amazon could pilot XRP in any number of ways. XRP blockchain solutions have also been suggested as being ideal for Amazon\u2019s fleet management system on top of the revolutionary payment solutions.If we think seriously about Amazon on the blockchain, if Amazon wanted to have a crypto as the payment currency for their giant online presence, what options would they gravitate towards? They would probably build their own. However if they wanted to try an existing one, XRP would make sense.Ripple thinks its faster and more reliable than anyone else. XRP settles over 500x faster than bitcoin and any other digital asset, which allows for near instant inter-exchange transfers.Ripple positions itself as a complement to, rather than a competitor with, Bitcoin. The Ripple network is designed to allow the seamless transfer of any form of currency, which Amazon might be looking into. For transactions, Amazon could definately use Ripple.

I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a real cryptocurrency, and its business structure/model goes against the moral fabric of cryptocurrency itself.However, it\u2019s possible that XRP will surpass BTC in market cap in 2018.I don\u2019t think this would happen anytime soon, and I hope it doesn\u2019t happen at all, but I think it\u2019s possible.There has been a huge influx of retail investors, and the new folk love them some cheap coins.Just in case you\u2019re not up to speed, Ripple increased from $0.25 to hit all time highs just above $3.50 in the past 30 days.UPDATE:January 9th, 2018Since the time of posting this blog, Ripple has dropped from $2.70 to $1.90I didn\u2019t sell.This is what you get for buying Ripple!February 7th, 2018I sold.Ripple is currently sitting at around $0.70, owning a coin I didn\u2019t believe in brought me my largest loss of the past 12 months.I think XRP surpassing Bitcoin would send shockwaves through the market and change the game as we know it.Before I get into that, let me tell you why Ripple is the worst.Disclaimer: I\u2019m not one of those people who spreads FUD about a coin when they miss the boat on it. I currently hold $XRP, and have made a pretty % on it as well.I just hate myself for it.Ripple is what\u2019s known as a token. Whereas coins like bitcoin trade on their own value, tokens tend to be tied to something else.[1]Ripple is not an actual digital currency, as the quote from Mashableabove would suggest, it\u2019s simply a token.Bitcoin is the actual currency being traded and used, whereas XRP tokens are essentially backed by traditional currencies, as if they\u2019re dollars or yen in another form.[2]Most investors don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re really buying when they buy XRP.When you hear about Ripple making partnerships with Banks and large financial institutions, that doesn\u2019t really have much to do with XRP, the Ripple currency.That\u2019s a win for RippleNet, the framework created by Ripple to speed up large international financial transactions. These large financial transactions aren\u2019t going to take place in XRP, they\u2019re going to take place using whatever currency the countries choose- so more banks using RippleNet does not mean more demand of XRP from financial institutions.When most cryptocurrencies rise in price, its due to an increase in understanding or application of their utility. When Ripple rises in price, its because the company did some solid business development, not because their token is fundamentally increasing in value by virtue of its utility.The price of a cryptocurrency is a reflection of the amount of people who understand its utility.2. Ripple is as centralized as can be.Blockchain technology is a tool that will allow us to decentralize processes mediated by middle men, thereby removing those middle men and allowing peer to peer anything.Blockchain was created to be a tool to put power back in the hands of the individual.You do that by creating a trust-less system where a middleman (like a bank) isn\u2019t needed\u200a\u2014\u200athis is the beauty of the technology and at the end of the day, the reason that cryptocurrencies are seeing such a huge increase in market cap.Unlike fiat currency where the supply is controlled by a third-party (like the Federal Reserve), blockchain and the cryptocurrencies that have come from it are a completely transparent way to handle the management and creation of financial infrastructure.So with that in mind, does this raise any red flags?Since Ripple controls 61% of the world\u2019s supply of XRP coins\u200a\u2014\u200a61 billion out of 100 billion in total\u200a\u2014\u200athe gains placed Larsen\u2019s personal position in the cryptocurrency as well as his share of the XRP owned by his company at a dizzying total of $59.8 billion.\u00a0[3]Ripple controls a staggering amount of its own supply.There is no mining with Ripple.With Bitcoin (and every other cryptocurrency) you increase the supply by mining. Either through Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).With PoW, miners download a copy of the blockchain ledger and essentially perform accounting duties to ensure that transactions aren\u2019t fraudulent. They are paid for their work in whatever currency they\u2019re mining, therefore increasing the supply.With PoS, miners just have to \u201cstake\u201d their holdings in a wallet, and it earns interest. That interest they earn is new currency, that increases the supply.With Ripple, they decided how much their total supply would be and issued it, there is no mining, there is no trust-less system, there is no utility.Ripple is basically what would happen if a blockchain company said to itself, \u201cWhat if we just made a fiat currency that functions exactly the same as USD. Except we turn ourselves into the Federal Reserve for that currency so we control everything?\u201d.Hell, Ripple didn\u2019t start to climb until the company announced they\u2019d be locking 55 BN XRP in escrow so they could ensure the token holders that they wouldn\u2019t dump all their tokens as soon as the price got up.", "responses": ""}, {"title":

The overall valuation of the crypto markets has surpassed $450 billion and, according to CoinMarketCap, is currently making $457 billion.There has been a lot of buying interest growing for Bitcoin recently as the largest cryptocurrency by market-cap surged by over six percent in the last 24-hours and touched $9800. Analysts say that one of the major reasons for Bitcoin to shoot on Thursday was the announcement coming from Goldman Sachs, who is launching its first Bitcoin trading platform involving Bitcoin and its derivative products.Participation of this institutional giant from the Wall Street is certainly a big development in itself, and a sign that the digital currency markets are now seen positively in the global financial space.Michael Moro, chief executive of Genesis Global Trading said:\u201cThere\u2019s been some level of sentiment amongst institutional investors that the asset class isn\u2019t legitimate until the big banks get involved. And while they\u2019re still not trading the underlying, Goldman getting involved in the forwards is an important first step.\u201dAt the press time, Bitcoin is trading at $9703.13 with a surge of over 5.5% in the last 24-hours. In the past one month, the cryptocurrency has gained 50%. The overall market cap of Bitcoin as on date is $165 billion.On the other hand, Ethereum is seen making some phenomenal northward moves in the last four days starting May 1st, Tuesday. On May 1st, Ethereum was trading at a price of $642 and since then it has increased by nearly 25%. Today, at the press time Ethereum has surged by 10.5% and is currently trading just short of $800 ($796), according to the data on CoinMarketCap. In the past one month, Ethereum has delivered over 100% gains from its low of $368 on April 6, 2018. The overall market cap of Ethereum as on date is $78 billion.This rise of Ethereum is quite surprising considering the fact that it has been on the radar of regulatory bodies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who recently said that Ether tokens might be qualified as securities.However, Google co-founder Sergey Brin recently credited Ethereum for the boom in computing taking place currently. Sergey said:\u201cWe are truly in a technology renaissance, an exciting time where we can see applications across nearly every segment of modern society. There are several factors at play in this boom of computing. First, of course, is the steady hum of Moore\u2019s Law. The second factor is greater demand, stemming from advanced graphics in gaming and, surprisingly, from the GPU-friendly proof-of-work algorithms found in some of today\u2019s leading cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum.\u201dThe third-largest cryptocurrency\u200a\u2014\u200aRipple\u200a\u2014\u200ahas also posted significant gains in the last one month. Ripple has gained nearly 100% from its low of $0.47 on April 6.

Ripple violated state and federal laws by offering unregistered securities to retail investors, the filing said.The plaintiff, investor Ryan Coffey, is seeking unspecified damages and a declaration that Ripple Labs and Chief Executive Officer Bradley Garlinghouse sold unregistered securities. Coffey is seeking to proceed on behalf of all purchasers of Ripple tokens.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the lawyer\u2019s tweet about a recently filed lawsuit but have not been served. Like any civil proceeding, we\u2019ll assess the merit or lack of merit to the allegations at the appropriate time,\u201d Ripple spokesman Tom Channick said in an emailed statement. \u201cWhether or not XRP is a security is for the SEC to decide. We continue to believe XRP should not be classified as a security.\u201dThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in July that companies which raise money through the sale of digital assets must adhere to federal securities laws. The SEC has also subpoenaed firms and individuals behind coin offerings it believes might be breaking the law, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier this year. An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the agency\u2019s view of XRP at the time.\u201cXRP is a security,\u201d the plaintiff said. \u201cDefendants themselves have recognized that XRP investors have a reasonable expectation of profit, and publicly touted XRP\u2019s price performance on numerous occasions.\u201dCoffey purchased 650 XRP tokens for about $2.60 each, or $1,690, at the start of January and sold them a few weeks later at a loss of approximately $551, or about 32 percent of his initial investment, according to the filing.Whether Ripple and bigger rival Ether are securities has been at the center of debate within the sector since the SEC comments. Gary Gensler, the former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, saidlast month that both XRP and Ether\u200a\u2014\u200athe second most valuable digital coin\u200a\u2014\u200acould be classified as securities.The lawsuit also highlighted Ripple\u2019s attempt to persuade some of the top U.S. crypto exchanges to list XRP. Bloomberg reported in April that the startup suggested paying financial incentives to the venues, Gemini and Coinbase, citing four people with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.Source", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Ledger announces XRP support on Nano S and\u00a0Blue", "author_name": "Ledger", "link": "https://medium.com/ledger-on-security-and-blockchain/ledger-announces-xrp-support-on-nano-s-and-blue-4101eaef0a9f?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 19, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "22", "content": "Ledger announces XRP support on Nano S and\u00a0BlueLedgerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 19, 2017Celebrating the latest major price rally on XRP, and due to high demand, we are excited to announce immediate availability of XRP support of all Nano S and Blue units.If you do not have yet a Nano S or a Blue, you can order one on our online Ledger shop or through our resellers network (please note that the Blue is out of stock until end of July 2017).XRP app installation on your Nano S or\u00a0BlueTo add XRP support on your Ledger hardware wallet, you need to launch the Ledger Manager and install the XRP app on your device (as the maximum number of apps is limited by memory constrainsts, you may have to uninstall first another app).

Ripple Labs, the creators of Ripple, created the network with 100bn XRPs in it, and no new XRPs have been created since its inception. This is not an unknown practice in the crypto space\u200a\u2014\u200aa lot of networks \u2018pre-mine\u2019 their tokens.However, the network creators usually only keep a fraction of the tokens for themselves, pre-selling the rest to anyone that wishes to buy some. Ripple, however, still owns about 60% of the initially issued tokens. This raises a few issues.First, the company could try cashing out and potentially crash the market. It is very unlikely, however. Ripple has recently taken steps to promote its XRP market and put the majority of their XRPs into escrow (then again, the escrow is unlocking 1bn XRP every month for the next ~4.5 years so it could be better).Secondly, since the network fees are paid through \u2018burning\u2019 XRPs, they essentially enrich everyone in proportion to the amount of XRPs they hold (if 1% of the tokens got burned, the remaining tokens would be worth about 1% more provided the market doesn\u2019t change). This means Ripple Labs is essentially earning 60% of all network fees on the network. This probably doesn\u2019t amount to much at the current time, but it may be more important in the future.Lastly, the amount of XRPs owned by one company gives it a negative reputation. A lot of people in the crypto space dismiss Ripple outright as a \u2018pre-mined scamcoin\u2019 just because of a number of coins owned by Ripple.The founders of Ripple, Jed McCaleb, Chris Larsen and Arthur Britto, gave themselves 20bn XRPs early on. This later came to bite Ripple. McCaleb left the team to start his own version of Ripple called Stellar, and decided to sell his XRP stash, resulting in a legal kerfuffle, a settlement and a schedule for how those coins may be sold.If those numbers are correct, McCaleb is still cashing out $20,000 per week, and come ~2019, he will be able to cash out 750m XRP (worth ~$256m at today\u2019s price of $0.34 USD/XRP). Not an ideal situation if the money from your network will be going to a former employee building your direct competitor to the tune of a quarter of billion dollars. While some of those funds might go to charity, that\u2019s still not an ideal outcome.Besides these problems with Ripple (premined, centralized, etc.), there are a few more. Ripple works closely with banks, which repels all those interested in investing in and supporting technology in order to dismantle the current financial system. Ripple is very weak on anonymity (although are making efforts to change that).That\u2019s all I have about Ripple.

At this major support, Bitcoin can have a pull-back upto $8,700- $9,100 if it holds above $7,600 but Bears are holding more strength right now.Any breach of the above support which is likely will make BTC test the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement support level of $7,175 of the rally from $5,920-$11,780. If BTC is unable to maintain the second most important support of $7,175, it is likely to open up avenues for Bears ruling the market to test back it\u2019s previous low of $5,900.

We did this for a few reasons:With some projects over the summer we saw people complain that they were not able to give larger amounts of ETC, XRP or LTC because ShapeShift has limits due to liquidity and slippage. While we do have a technological partnership with ShapeShift, we wanted to enable larger donors to participate easily.The WINGS Foundation wanted to have some financial stability, and given that some of these crypto-currencies go up when bitcoin goes down, we thought they would provide a higher level of stability to treasury management rather than hoping that one coin just continues to appreciate steadily over time.It goes without saying that BTC is the king of crypto, and with our planned support for RSK, a smart contracts system for Bitcoin, it is a natural preference.We intend to support Ethereum and Ethereum Classic as they have smart contracts systems and many projects wanting to use those networks.Ripple we chose because of their work on the InterLedger Protocol and long term price stability. WINGS intends to have cross-blockchain support for project DAOs to get funded in all sorts of crypto-currencies. We recognized the good work Ripple has done on this front and wanted to ensure that WINGS Foundation has stake in this system should we receive the funding to enable cross-blockchain supportWhy did we pick Litecoin? Good question. Primarily, because it has maintained a relatively stable value over the years, and because being WINGS we like chickens (read about why Litecoin is called chicken).Litecoin gets the smallest allocation but has the most\u00a0flavor.Reaching allocation parityCurrently the backing campaign is in a status where many people have asked why their WINGS estimate is much higher for a lower BTC value of ETC, ETH, LTC and XRP. The answer is simple: the amounts for these four alt-coins collected are underweight to their respective allocation.The 75 Million WINGS allocated to donations that the WINGS Foundation is contractually obliged to put forward to the community have sub-allocations for each alt coin:BTC is 70%ETH is 15%ETC is 6%XRP is 5%LTC is 4%Chart showing the disparityThe bold red numbers show the amount of a particular alt-coin required to reach parity with the total amount of BTC donated. Thus, currently one can see a significant under-funding in ETC, XRP and LTC donations, thereby resulting in higher than anticipated estimated WINGS for the alt-coins.Making this easy to\u00a0digestThe team is investigating ways to complement the WINGS backing campaign dashboard GUI in order to make it easier to determine how much each coin is out of parity.We also are open to offering an EGGS bounty for a community member who can build an easy visual tool that would show this.

With SWIFT taking hours (or even days) to clear a transaction, Ripple clears within five seconds and can handle an equivalent throughput of the Visa network.Causing a\u00a0rippleRipple, created in 2012 by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb, has increased its value to around $12 billion.But is it different from Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is a cryptocurrency\u200a\u2014\u200aas Ripple (XRP) can also be traded as tokens. These tokens are pre-mined, so there is no need for a mining network. With an XRP token, the value is directly mapped to traditional currencies. Overall it can act as both a cryptocurrency and also as a payment network for transactions.Currently, it has the third highest market capitalisation of the cryptocurrencies:Currently, banks solve the problem of transferring money between countries with the SWIFT network, and which is often slow in its operation. Ripple, though, uses a publicly sourced consensus ledger with a distributed infrastructure of trusted gateways. This infrastructure is managed by Ripple Labs. Ripple then aims to complete a currency transaction in seconds, using tokens for transaction fees. These tokens can then be converted back into currency through a cryptocurrency exchange.So while Ethereum and Bitcoin struggle to scale, and are hitting bottlenecks with the number of transactions that they can support per second. Bitcoin, especially is slow and can take over 10 minutes to create a consensus, and also require a great deal of energy to create it. Ripple\u2019s fast consensus\u200a\u2014\u200ain less than a minute\u200a\u2014\u200acan thus be used to quickly transfer funds and compete against Paypal and Visa:How it\u00a0worksLet\u2019s look at a simple example. Say Bob wants to send $100 to Alice and who is in a different city. He gives the money to his local agent (Trent) with a password that Alice is required to provide [A]. Trent then contacts Alice\u2019s agent (Peggy) and gives Peggy the money with the password [B]. If Alice then gives Peggy the right password [C], Peggy will then provide Alice with $100 from her account [D]. Now Trent will create an IOU for Peggy for $100, which can be paid at a given time, or used within other transactions.The trust network created is between Bob and Trent, Trent and Peggy, and Peggy and Alice. These trust elements are created as a Gateway for the chain. Anyone can then register to act as a gateway and thus act as the middleman for the exchanges.Each currency uses its own gateway such as CADBluzelle (Canadian dollars\u200a\u2014\u200aCAD), BTCbitstamp (BTC), and USDsnapswap (US $), and multiple gateways can be involved in order to translate the required currencies. This interconnection of gateways creates a \u201cripple\u201d effect for the transaction.Balances are thus held at the gateway, and where there could be the risk of a gateway not honouring payments. Users will thus only communicate with gateways which they trust, and which are credit-worthy. In this way, the user will not be exposed to the risk of a transaction hack, as the trustworthy gateway will, hopefully, honour the transaction.The Ripple network thus does not need a proof-of-work system such as Bitcoin, and the transactions can be cleared within a few seconds. The consensus is then created by validating account balances and transactions by the gateways within the system. This improves on the double-spending method that Bitcoin uses.So if Eve creates a transaction of $100 and sends them to multiple gateways, all the gateways will then vote on the transaction, and all, but the first, transaction will be deleted (and where the voting system takes five seconds to achieve a majority vote). As there is no central control, the verification of the transaction is distributed.Each transaction is recorded as an IOU on the public blockchain for the currency used for a user or gateway. These transactions are not linked to an ID, and are pseudo-anonymised (but with complex analysis could be traced to individuals). Unlike the Bitcoin network, the Ripple network scales well and can handle millions of transactions at a time, and where each transaction carries a fee of 0.00001 XRP (which is significantly smaller than the SWIFT network).AdoptionMany banks including UBS, RBS, Merrill Lynch, Santander, BBVA, UniCredit, and Standard Chartered have adopted the Ripple Network and are actively using it to transfer transaction fees. With its growth in popularity, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US\u200a\u2014\u200aCoinbase\u200a\u2014\u200ais likely to add it to its currency portfolio of bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), and litecoin (\u0141TC) trading. This will make it easier for users to purchase them. The exchanges where XRP is currently traded are:CEX.IO\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is a UK-based exchange.GMOCoin\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is a Japan-based exchange.Huobi.pro\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is a Singapore-based exchange.The limit applied for ripple is $100 billion. With every payment a small amount of ripple is intentionally lost, and which reduces the total supply over time. This act as an inflationary control and reduces its supply over time. In order to address worries about the supply of XRP, Ripple Labs have placed 55 billion XRP in escrow. This includes 55 contracts of one billion XRP tokens and which will release one billion XRP tokens into the market each month. This provides for a well-defined release of the tokens.The Ripple network can handle up to 1,000 transactions per second, which is the throughput that Visa handles. Presently, Ethereum can only cope with 15 transactions per second, and where Bitcoin only supports up to six transactions per second.Risks?As with many cryptocurrencies, there are associated risks. In 2015, Peter Todd analysed Ripple and found a number of potential attacks, and rated them in terms of cost, scope, duration, and probability:Consensus Split. This uses different versions of the protocol to confuse the network, and where it is unable to create a consensus.Transaction Flood. This is where a large number of transactions are generated, and the network is unable to process the valid ones within a given time constraint.Coercion of Validators. This is an attack on specific nodes, in order for them to fail to process their transactions.Software Backdoor. This is where a trusted user adds a backdoor in the software distribution.Theft of Validator Secret Keys. This is where the secret keys for the infrastructure are leaked.Simulated Ledger. This is where nodes can simulate the required signature and create a fake ledger.The major finding was that the end result of applying Ripple would not be that much different from the current centralised approach, and that if more than 20% of Ripple\u2019s network nodes did not agree, there would be a fork in the ledger. At the present time XRP doesn\u2019t actually have to be used, and can be seen as a \u201csettlement currency\u201d, but most of the coins are currently controlled by Ripple.ConclusionXRP focuses on translating currencies and overcomes the complexity of the SWIFT network. The creation of the trust network, and in the connection to trusted gateways, increases the overall trust in the network, as the trusted gateway are likely to honour transactions which are incorrectly handled.And for Ripple, with a clearing time of five seconds, we can see that traditional methods of translating currencies will have some serious competition on their hands. Its method of consensus also does not consume the electricity demand of a medium-sized country, and has a track record of five years of successful operation.The whole network, too, is not dependent on any one company enacting or securing the transaction, and thus bottlenecks are kept to a minimum. Overall the future of XRP is whether it will be accepted as a settlement current.So not all cryptocurrencies are the same! Bitcoin seems to get all the attention, but it has so many problems, especially that it will be difficult to sustain its current operation.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "Comparison with current Blockchain systems: Part 5. #MetaHash vs\u00a0Ripple", "author_name": "#MetaHash", "link": "https://medium.com/metahash/comparison-with-current-blockchain-systems-part-5-metahash-vs-ripple-e3326c8f1d3d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 6, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "148", "content": "Comparison with current Blockchain systems: Part 5. #MetaHash vs\u00a0Ripple#MetaHashBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 6, 2018Dear Community! Today we are going to continue talking about the advantages of our network in comparison with other current blockchain systems. Some of you mentioned Ripple in discussions, so we decided to analyze our similarities and differences with XRP!First of all, it\u2019s hard to compare #MetaHash with Ripple due to a number of reasons. Most importantly, their objectives are different\u200a\u2014\u200awhile #MetaHash aims to create a network for the people and implement full decentralization, XRP is built for enterprise use and offers banks/payment providers an on-demand option to source liquidity for cross-border payments.#MetaHash overperforms Ripple in several significant aspects. XRP is one of the top projects with a very high TPS rate\u200a\u2014\u200a1500. This result is considered as very good and much better than Ethereum or Bitcoin, at the same time, #MetaHash transactions per second rate is more than 60,000. Ripple is phenomenally fast in handling payment\u200a\u2014\u200ait can do it in 4 seconds, however, #MetaHash needs less than 3 seconds for transaction approval.We have already mentioned decentralization, nonetheless, the fundamental difference between 2 projects is hidden here. Ripple is a central digital currency controlled by one company, it is fully centralized, while #MetaHash offers the highest level of decentralization on the crypto market. Ripple is not even attacked or criticized by banks and the global financial system because they do not see a competitor in XRP. Ripple Investors are betting on the tendency of banks/financial institutions to buy huge amounts of XRP in order to improve their services, not to sell them and provide them to their customers.Ripple also can\u2019t be mined and it is probably the only similarity of XRP with #MetaHashCoin but the reasons are different. Ripple can only be bought on trading platforms, there is no other way to get these coins. At the same time, #MetaHash can be bought and also forged, which is much better than mining for plenty of reasons that we have already addressed in a number of articles.It is hard to compare #MetaHash with Ripple due to the vast difference in goals and objectives. XRP is not even a proper cryptocurrency, unlike #MetaHashCoin, Ethereum or Bitcoin. Ripple is set to benefit banks and financial corporations, while #MetaHash is aiming to benefit ordinary people and solve current issues in the blockchain tech.Our website#MetaGateTelegram\u00a0Twitter", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Terijo", "link": "https://medium.com/@TeriJo/every-thought-idea-action-or-inaction-makes-a-ripple-in-the-pond-amber-lisa-john-8dcfdfafe253?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 27, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "64", "content": "TerijoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 27, 2017PexabayEvery thought, idea, action or inaction makes a ripple in the pond.

It\u2019s what I was taught. And one I fought, even tho I wasn\u2019t sure how.Until I finally was confronted with a bigot in my own home. In my kitchen. And he was talking shit about people of color in a home I shared with a black woman who\u2019d lived through the burning cross on her childhood home, the racist comments on the darkness of her skin, on her invisibility if she didn\u2019t smile, swallow their shit, and generally pretend she didn\u2019t exist except at their demand.

Nevermind her intelligence, compassion, humanity. Nevermind she is the best human I\u2019ve ever known.This POS thought he could lump her into a bucket of his choosing and fill it with hate. In HER home. All while claiming to be a friend.Not on my watch..! No fuckin\u2019 way.And so, I told him to leave, never come back, and never contact us again in any way.His response was along the lines of \u201cWhy do you care? You\u2019re white, just like me!

Its success caused a country-wide frenzy\u200a\u2014\u200aherd behavior as all types of people, from peasants to lords, developed a feverish interest in investing: in South Seas primarily, but in stocks generally. Among the many companies to go public in 1720 is\u200a\u2014\u200afamously\u200a\u2014\u200aone that advertised itself as \u201ca company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\u201dWhich doesn\u2019t sound all the different from what we see with Crypto Currencies, where all sorts of people are getting involved with speculation, not always having much idea of how the underlying technology works.This is what I want to do in this article. Explain how the technology of different crypto currencies affect its value.Intrinsic ValueIt is often leveled against crypto currencies like Bitcoin that it has not intrinsic value, as opposed to say gold. Gold has industrial and medical uses. People also appreciate gold jewelry. So clearly it has some value, but whether the present value of gold is a reflection of its intrinsic value is debatable. As Warren Buffett said:Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.Still, gold is a not a fair comparison to crypto currency. Fiat currency like dollars, rubles or pounds don\u2019t have any intrinsic value either. They are not worth the paper they are printed on.So why would anybody want fiat currency, or why is there a market or demand for fiat currency?By law people have to accept payment in the national currency.The government demands that you pay your taxes in the currency they issue from their central bank.Of course if anybody could print or copy the money it would be worthless, which is why fiat currencies have artificial scarcity and can\u2019t be easily copied. This is very similar to crypto currencies.A bank note is printed in a complicated manner which makes it difficult to replicate, while a Bitcoin is secured against copy by the use of cryptography.Then central bank limits the supply of fiat currency, while the Bitcoin mining process limits the supply of Bitcoins.Intrinsic Value of\u00a0BitcoinOf course Bitcoin is not a mandated currency for payment or taxes anywhere, so that is no way of securing a market for Bitcoins.On the other hand, lots of things have value without being mandated by government. A soccer card with the signature of a famous player, is just a cheap piece of paper with some ink on it. Yet many people will place a high value on it.A lot of art is the same. The value of the paint is limited and so is the utility of the painting. It does of course have a certain value with respect to pleasure people take in looking at it and having it on their wall to decorate a room.However most of the value of an art piece derives from its exclusivity. A perfect copy of a master piece, would only be worth a fraction of the value of the original despite giving the viewer the paining the exact same experience.Hence there is no objective way of assigning value. Things are worth whatever people think they are worth. So the question is why might people assign value to e.g. Bitcoin?Bitcoin UtilityOne reason is the utility of Bitcoin. There will always be a desire for anonymous or pseudo anonymous payments. Cash of course offers this, but not in a convenient manner online. People might want to purchase something only anonymously, which is not possible with a credit card. This could either be buying something they find embarrassing or it could be something illegal. E.g. the online service Silk Road was famous for selling drugs online taking payments in Bitcoins. Another dark side of Bitcoin is its usage for Ransomeware payments.As long as people want to buy drugs online or extort each other there will be a demand for Bitcoins, which means it will have some value. What value is almost impossible to define. There is however a lower limit, define by the electricity cost for computer mining new bitcoins.But of course most of the value of Bitcoin today, is derived from speculation. People buying it in the hope that its value will increase.Speculation is of course not entirely useless as it creates liquidity for those who desire to use Bitcoin for payments.But why does Bitcoin have value over any other crypto currency. Anybody could in principle duplicate the Bitcoin source code and make their own crypto currency, which is in fact what people do.The advantage of Bitcoin is in first mover status and the network effect. Bitcoin is already established, the competition is not. There are already a huge number of companies and services involved with Bitcoins. You can get a whole host of applications for Bitcoins, there are many currency exchanges which allows you to buy Bitcoins, and many companies have built money transfer services around Bitcoin such as Azimo and Currencyfair. These offer much faster and cheaper international money transfer, especially for remittance than traditional banking or established players such as Western Union.To the user of these services the usage of bitcoins is transparent. Customers just transfer money from to the service provider, which uses that money to buy bitcoins. These bitcoins are in turn sold in the target country for local currency which is transferred to the recipients bank account. Hence a slow and expensive cross border bank transaction using say SWIFT never happens. It is all local cheap bank transactions. The cross border movement of funds is facilitated with bitcoins.Centralized money transfer services like Paypal could in principle do this as well, but this is quite expensive.International Personal Payments:If you send or receive an international personal payment using your PayPal balance or bank account, you\u2019re charged a cross border fee, which can range from 0.5% to 2% of the payment amount.For purchase payments it is even more expensive. The problem with centralized payment schemes as Paypal is that they are built on top of old and expensive bank infrastructure and they hold a monopoly positioned when buying and selling currency. If you hold dollars in your Paypal account and want Euros, then Paypal has a monopoly on making that transaction. Hence they give a poor exchange rate.If you hold Bitcoins on the other hand, nobody has a monopoly on exchanging those for a different currency.So as long as there are many companies using Bitcoins as a bridge currency for money transfer, as well as people needing it for anonymous transactions it will have some value.RippleRipple or Ethereum are the names really of whole systems and not a crypto currency. Ripple does however come with a crypto currency called XRP and Ethereum uses a crypto currency called Ether.A problem both Ripple and Ethereum solves is that there is originally not particular reasons to buy a crypto currency. New crypto currencies tend to be bought exclusively because people are making a speculative bet that they would be worth something in the future.Ripple and Ethereum on the other hand has made their crypto currency a necessity for the services they offer. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t really offer any services beyond a system of transferring ownership of Bitcoins.Ripple in contrast is a money transfer or payment system similar to SWIFT presently used by bank to transfer money internationally. In fact Ripple is working closely with banks to integrate Ripple as a way for the bank to transfer money cheaply and quickly to other banks. For instance SWIFT can require days to perform a money transfer while a Ripple payment is done in a mere second.A Guaranteed Need For\u00a0XRPRipple was made to transfer fiat currency, and even ownership of assets like gold. But here is the kicker. Every transaction in Ripple requires XRP. So even if you want to just transfer dollars to another person, you still need to acquire XRP to perform that transaction. This serves several purposes:It avoids the public ledger of transactions being spammed with lots of pointless transactions. Hackers can\u2019t overload the system with millions of frivolous transactions because they would have to buy a lot of XRP to do so.It gives a way for the Ripple company, to charge for the service they offer. Ripple is open source and anybody can run a ripple node, so it is not through hosting an online service in the traditional sense that they get paid.Ripple held all the initial created XRP coins, and have been gradually selling and giving them away. This serves as an alternative to funding through selling stocks. Ripple sell XRPs to fund their operation. As more financial institutions start using Ripple to perform transactions between each other, the higher the demand for XRPs will become and hence the price and their ability to capitalize on it.So far Ripple has signed up something like 60 banks and financial institutions to their network. In this sense it is a more centralized system than Bitcoin. The Ripple company function in many ways as a regular central bank. If the currency sees too sharp value swings, they dump XRPs on the market to stabilize the price. Ripple wants a stable value on XRP as that facilitates trade more easily. Bitcoin in contrast is based on decentralized mining. Bitcoins can spring into existence on any computer. Hence there is no central control of the money supply. This also means higher volatility of the Bitcoin price.However Ripple is not a centralized system when compared to e.g. PayPal. The Ripple company is not a central authority on money transactions. There is no single Ripple database of account balances that they update. Rather there are distributed servers each keeping a copy of the Ripple public ledger. Transactions are verified by cryptography just like with Bitcoin. It means government couldn\u2019t just suddenly shut down Ripple as there would always be Ripple nodes in other countries maintaining the public ledger which does not depend on the existence of the Ripple company. As they software is open source, anybody could continue its development.XRP as a Bridge\u00a0CurrencyBecause there is a guaranteed need for XRP since it is required to perform transactions, It can serve a second purpose which is acting as a bridge currency. As mentioned with Bitcoin money transactions, a crypto currency can be used as an intermediate to perform a transaction between two banks. If the banks don\u2019t have an established relationship, they could still perform transactions with each other and avoid counterparty risk by using XRP as a middleman.These factors contribute to creating a demand for XRP. As long as people value the transaction services offered by Ripple, XRP will have a value.Ethereum, a Further AbstractionBitcoin could be used to perform transactions of just one currency. Ripple could perform transactions of any currency. Ethereum takes a big step forward and allows performing almost any financial transaction or contract. You could use it to handle ownership transfer of a house, selling movie tickets, escrow services, Kickstarter style funding of projects where people pledge money to a project, but it only gets transferred if the project raise the target amount.To accomplish this Ethereum is essentially generic platform for running software, referred to as smart contracts.Understanding how this works and understanding the full implications is not something I found easy initially, so I\u2019ll try to explain it in terms of my misunderstandings, hopefully to avoid giving you the same misunderstandings.Ethereum has its own sort of virtual machine, which runs a particular kind of byte code. Although you can program in higher level languages which compile down to this bytecode.My first critical thought when looking at this, was that they language looked too loosely typed and dangerous. It will be too easy to write a faulty program, which has a bug was my thought. You really want to avoid that when dealing with money or financial assets. So I thought it was weird they did not use a sort of strict language like Haskell.The thing to realize is that there are many ways of creating safety other than through language design. First of all, it is a completely sandboxed environment they run in.Also remember how Ripple prevents people from going crazy with transactions by requiring some XRP for each of them?Well, Ethereum is similar. Running a program is going to cost Ether, which is the Ethereum crypto currency. But how do you calculate how much? With e.g. Bitcoin the cost of a transaction is sort of market driven. People assign higher fees to get their transactions through if it goes slowly.Likewise if your Ethereum programs aren\u2019t running you will pay more Ether to get them to run. So there is a price controller by supply and demand which prevents the Ethereum nodes from getting overloaded. However since with Ethereum each program run will require different amounts of resources unlike a Bitcoin or Ripple transaction, they can\u2019t be priced the same. Instead Ethereum solves this by assigning a cost of each operation in a quantity called gas. Hence running a program will consume a certain amount of gas. Ether is used to pay for this gas, but you can\u2019t hold a balance of gas. Instead you pay for gas with Ether as you go.Which brings up the next question, who exactly pays Ether to run a program (or smart contract) on the Ethereum platform? Is it the creator/owner of the smart contract or the users of it?Smart contracts are not like something like Google App Engine apps running continuously. They are more like hooks which run for just a short amount of time in response to events. One of those events would be sending a transaction to a smart contract. In your transaction you specify an operation you want to perform with the smart contract. A smart contract is essentially an API with a set of supported operations. Alternatively you can look at it in an object oriented fashion. They are objects with state and a set of methods which can alter that state.If you as an external entity want to alter a smart contract state, then you have to invoke one if its methods by specifying which one, and give arguments in a transaction. In this transaction you also provide Ether to pay for the gas, which will be consumed when invoking this Smart Contract method. You specify how much you are willing to pay for each unit of gas, and how much gas you are willing to pay for. This sets and upper limit for how much Ether will be consumed.If you specify too low price for gas, then the Ethereum node, might not want to include your transaction and run it, similar to how Bitcoin transactions with a too low fee will not get included, or might have to wait a long time to be included.Once the contract method is run, you will get back any unspent Ether. However if you provided too little Ether to run the contract method, then you will not get anything back. It will be lost. So there is an incentive to provide enough. This also means that buggy contracts with things like never ending loops won\u2019t run indefinitely as they will run out of gas. It also means the operations in the contract will not get performed.Smart contracts can be used together with regular software to create dapps (distributed apps). A bitcoin client is an example of a dapp. You got a client running on say a smart phone interacting with bitcoin software running on a Bitcoin node, performing transactions you put together in the Bitcoin client. Likewise developers can create any number of mobile phone apps or web clients which create particular Ethereum transactions to interact with particular kinds of Ethereum smart contracts. This could be a client for buying movie tickets, sell and buy a house or pledge money to a project.Of course these sorts of applications or services already exists, so what is the new thing now? At the moment all of these applications require building your own infrastructure or paying to host such a service on e.g. Google App Engine. It also requires trusting a multitude of companies. E.g. trusting that if you pledge money to a project, the company running the pledge service isn\u2019t going to run away with your money. With Ethereum you know that no single company owns the Ethereum network.The Huge Need for\u00a0EtherThis is what is going to drive a large demand for Ether. As companies build a multitude of dapps for trading stocks, buy and sell houses, place bets on horse races, pledge funding to projects, buy subway fares etc, the need for Ether will rise as all of these apps will require Ether to run. The more people who use these apps the more Ether will be required.This makes the future for Ethereum possibly brighter than Bitcoin, because there is nothing you have to have Bitcoins for, but you will have to have Ether to run the services on the Ethereum platform.But to raise one important point of contention. Ethereum is still dog slow, just like Bitcoin. It is fine now, but if volumes should grow, the present solution won\u2019t scale. This is an advantage for Ripple, which although less flexible than Ethereum has lightening fast transaction processing, because it is based on a consensus protocol rather than proof of work (mining) as used by Bitcoin and Ethereum.Part of the advantage here is gained from Ripple working with the established players like banks to build their network. This also makes idealists suspicious of Ripple.Ethereum creators have claimed however that they plan on transitioning to a proof of stake protocol which will give much faster transaction and smart contract processing. It remains to be seen how this will work out.ConclusionI think Ethereum has the biggest potential, however it is more risky because we don\u2019t know how well they will implement proof of work and with the flexibility of smart contracts, it is hard to foresee potential problems.Ripple seems like a solution with great potential but with much less risk. It has already successfully signed up many banks and is essentially a proven solution.While Bitcoin has less technical advantage it has a huge advantage at the moment in terms of first mover status, momentum and much larger mindshare. Almost everybody has heard about Bitcoin and it is easy to get started trading it. Many companies build services on top of Bitcoin which kind of offsets its limitations.This is why I think all of three of these cryptocurrency systems have the most potential for long term investment.From a technical standpoint there are of course many other interesting solutions such as ZCash and Monroe exists. In particular these aim to provide absolute anonymity which neither of the solutions I\u2019ve described in this article do. However my speculation is that pseudo anonymity provided by Bitcoin will be more acceptable to most users seeking some level of anonymity.What will drive adoption by users will most likely be what you can do with the solution and how easily accessible it is.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "Ripple & these coins are going to make you rich in\u00a02018", "author_name": "Crypto Reviewer", "link": "https://medium.com/@reviewcryptos/ripple-these-coins-are-going-to-make-you-rich-in-2018-37c6c179212a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 19, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "112", "content": "Ripple & these coins are going to make you rich in\u00a02018Crypto ReviewerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 19, 2018As I had predicted earlier, and many of you thanked me for that, Ripple (XRP) was on fire & will stay so. I see a target of 8\u201310 USD in the next 2\u20133 months. I am still holding it strong & did not sell when it went down to 75 cents because I believe in the technology.The reason for recent dump was caused by top Korean gamblers, who conspired with some government officials to spread FUD about cryptocurrency. Eventually they were caught manipulating the market & buying Bitcoin & other crypto currencies for cheap. This is the reason why we need some regulations. Crypto newbies don\u2019t understand all this & they put their life savings in to it & end up losing half of it.Ripple is the only company working with the government & the banks. So, your money will be safe with it, if tomorrow Trump or Putin decides to ban all cryptocurrencies. As we start 2018 there will be a few bumps caused on the way but expect the market to stabilise in February after Chinese New Year. Ripple should reach at least 20\u201330$ by end of the year.My other recommendations for 2018 to\u00a0invest:1. Ethereum: Price Target: 2000 $ by\u00a0March.Ethereum is working with some big banks like UBS & it would be interesting to see new DApps being launched on the Network. Would definitely put the price up. Besides Bitcoin, Ethereum & Ripple dominate the market and any new investor would invest in to these currencies than any other. Whether ETH can reach 10K? No one knows but it is quite possible.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/2. EOS: Price Target: 20 $ by\u00a0AprilEOS testnet is already launched & expect some new Dapps to be deployed soon. The team is solid & the product launch should get new customers & investors. They have been also very good with their marketing efforts & the token is listed on many exchanges already.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/3. Global Jobcoin (GJC): Price Target: 8\u201310 $ by\u00a0AprilYesterday it was trading at 23 Cents & already up 84% on some decentralized exchanges. They have not been able to list on bigger exchanges as yet but that might change soon. This token has great value & the team is launching their global Job platform in January, already ahead of time. They also destroyed the unsold tokens so total supply is only 15 Million.

The bigger the success\u2026the bigger and faster come the opportunities.\u00a0If there\u2019s one thing you can do to dramatically impact the trajectory of your life, it\u2019s to make something big happen\u2026 achieve an impossible goal\u2026to take on a beast of a challenge and crush it.Allow me to unpack this idea by helping you to understand the power of a transformative goal.Side effects. Delayed effects. After\u00a0effects.A side effect is usually regarded as an undesirable, uncomfortable secondary effect which occurs when taking a drug or stimulus.\u00a0A delayed effect is an unexpected, unwelcome reaction occurring hours to days after exposure to a drug or stimulus.\u00a0An after effect is an unforeseen, unamusing physical, psychological, or emotional effect that continues after the removal of a drug or stimulus.\u00a0But what about the other kinds of side effects, delayed effects and after effects?\u00a0What about the positive side effects of success?\u00a0The desirable, comfortable secondary effects which occur when crushing a goal, winning a contest or achieving a desired outcome.\u00a0What about the delayed effects of gratification, self-discipline and other acts of self-control?\u00a0The expected, highly welcomed outcomes which arrive hours, days, weeks, months or even years after their enforcement.\u00a0What about the after effects of securing a big win, of overcoming a seemingly impossible obstacle through the deployment of persistence, character and an unbreakable will?\u00a0The foreseen, highly enjoyable physical, psychological, or emotional effects that continue long after the win was secured and which inspire you to take on even bigger challenges.\u00a0While you may be tempted to chalk up any newfound opportunities as lucky breaks or as the unintended consequences of being successful\u2026the truth is they should be viewed as the intended consequences of success\u2026the domino effect of winning big, the chain reaction or ongoing ripple effect of one big success leading to a self-perpetuating cycle of good luck.\u00a0Things leads to things and big successful wins leads to a number of intrinsic and extrinsic benefits.\u00a0For our purposes, we\u2019ll focus on the intrinsic benefits as there is no purer form of success, no more exact and demanding test of what you are capable of, than to take on and achieve a seemingly impossible goal or challenge and find joy in the capacity to meet it.\u00a0Why? Because, the ultimate reason for stepping up your game and achieving a moon shot is to entice and empower you to become the person it takes to achieve such a transformative goal.\u00a0As you are about to find out\u2026who you become, as well as the character traits, skill sets and newfound opportunities you create in rising to meet a big challenging goal are the real benefits.\u00a0They are the things which inspire and allow you to play at the top of your game, and they are profoundly more important than the nature of the goal itself.In effect, the side effects, delayed effects and after effects of achieving a big challenging goal rightfully become the main effects.The main effects of the ripple\u00a0effectWhat follows are the ripple effects, the top nine rewards and primary intrinsic benefits for achieving a big challenging goal. Each of these benefits sends a powerful psychological message which work to transform your mind and future in a meaningful way.\u00a01. You Develop an Indomitable Spirit\u00a0In your efforts to achieve your goals, you will always struggle with unexpected, unwanted, and uncontrollable aspects of your environment, but your ability to overcome these seemingly indomitable obstacles reward you with an indomitable spirit as well as recognition, respect, resolve and results.\u00a02. You Overcome Fear\u00a0Fear is only an excuse for those unwilling to face their doubts, insecurities, and mental boogie man. Your capacity to confront and overcome any fear or resistance force rewards you with confidence, conviction and a powerful sense of destiny.\u00a03. You Become Courageous\u00a0According to Aristotle\u2026 \u201dThe ultimate aim of human life and activity is the development of character.\u201dThe most important goal you could hope to accomplish in the course of your life is to become an excellent person in every respect\u2026one who has the courage to pursue their dreams. Becoming courageous is one of those priceless rewards\u2026a gift you give to yourself, and a gift that keeps on giving.\u00a04. You Find Out What You Are Made Of\u00a0When you take on a big challenging goal and shoot for the moon, you will never be the same again. You either cope or crumble. You become better or bitter. You emerge stronger or weaker.\u00a0It must be this way, as a big challenging goal exists to tests your limits, to push you beyond the breaking point, to separate you from the crowded field of mediocrity. Your reward is finding out how far you can go and learning what you are really made of.\u00a05. You Intensify Your Focus\u00a0A great challenge demands great focus, and by staying the course you give your life the moment it deserves.\u00a0Focus is best seen as a preemptive strike against mediocrity. The moment you focus on a challenging goal, your goal becomes a magnet that pulls you and your resources toward it. The more focused your energies, the more power you generate, the faster will be your rewards.\u00a06. You Build Extraordinary Self-Confidence\u00a0No mountains can be climbed, no hearts won, no opportunities seized, no books written, and no victories enjoyed without self-confidence.\u00a0The inspired ability to rise to meet the physical rigors and mental demands of a big challenging goal is directly attributable to your self-confidence. As your challenges build, as you find the strength to face your fears and overcome obstacles\u2026you are rewarded with ever increasing levels of self-confidence.\u00a07. You Become Fully Formed\u00a0Few things demonstrate that you are ready to become the great man or woman that you are meant to be\u2026than the ability to set and achieve a big challenging goal.\u00a0By doing so you are demonstrating all the behaviors of a mature, responsible adult\u2026focus, discipline, commitment, perseverance, integrity and follow through. These are powerful intrinsic benefits that will pay off handsomely throughout the remainder of your life.\u00a0\u00a08. You Become Your Own Hero\u00a0Your greatest asset and primary sense of security and freedom extends from your ability to produce results and that\u2019s what self-reliance is all about.\u00a0By taking control and responsibility for your own life and delivering on what you set out to do\u2026you are rewarded with a powerful set of execution skills and a mindset that says you can, will and must provide for yourself.\u00a09. You Expand Your Freedoms\u00a0Freedom isn\u2019t free. It requires blood, sweat, and tears. But freedom is the ultimate prize\u2026the highest reward for rising to meet the rigorous demands of a big challenging goal.\u00a0In virtually every case, the decision to rise to meet a big challenging goal boils down to the desire for greater freedom in one\u2019s life. This includes freedom\u2026from the monkey on your back\u2026from self-imposed limitations\u2026from the comfort zone\u2026and freedom from fear.\u00a0It also includes freedom\u2026to focus on projects you find important\u2026to succeed or fail on your own terms\u2026to follow your passions\u2026as well as the freedom to say no without feeling guilty.\u00a0To trigger a massive ripple effect\u2026and to enjoy these freedoms, rewards and benefits requires that you rise to the challenges life presents and pay the required price in full, in advance, and without complaint.Achieving a big, challenging goal and triggering a massive ripple effect succeeds in dividing your life neatly into two parts\u2026before the big goal and after.I promise you that after is better\u200a\u2014\u200amuch better as nothing succeeds quite like success.What to do now?Focus on your moonshot\u2026that big game changing goal and consider all the intended consequences, the positive repercussions\u2026the side effects, delayed effects and the after effects which will take effect in your life as they will most definitely provide you with the extra fuel you need to take on this beast of a goal and crush it.Gary Ryan Blair is creator of the 100 Day Challenge\u2026a radical approach to goal achievement that shows people how to accelerate their results, achieve 10X size goals and transform every area of their life and career\u200a\u2014\u200aFAST.Thanks for reading The Marketing & Growth Hacking PublicationJoin our Facebook Group.

If you\u2019re a longer term trader/hodler then Ripple looks like all signs point higher longer term.#BTCSTRStellarAfter a monster run by #BTCSTR, it appears it is losing some steam here. It is incredibly overbought but is also likely putting in a \u201cspinning top\u201d on the daily chart today, April 19th 2018. This is typically the sign of a reversal in trend.What\u2019s a \u201cspinning top\u201d? Go here.#BTCLTCLitecoin#BTCLTC finally catching a bid here as it has moved above its 20 day moving average and has a well defined ascending triangle on its RSI.

Thankfully none of them were killed, but several were seriously injured. Many will inevitably endure the lasting effects of trauma. My heart goes out to them all and I hope they can find the strength to move forward without persistent fear impacting their daily lives. My heart is with you guys.I was hesitant to write this post because I did not want to make this about me. After all, I was not attacked or injured. I did not fear for my life this week. I am still alive and healthy.I realized that this is the third mass shooting I am closely connected to, despite not being physically present or shot at myself.The first was in 1993 at a \u201cChuck E. Cheese\u201d restaurant, just a few blocks from my childhood home in Aurora, CO. I was 14 years old. Four people were murdered that night and a fifth was seriously injured. I was skateboarding across the way when police stormed the building. A family friend was supposed to work a shift that night but unknowingly swapped it with someone else who ended up getting murdered. This incident rattled my school and our neighborhood. An unfamiliar feeling of deep sadness set in.The second time was in 2012, again in Aurora, at our local movie theater where 12 people were senselessly murdered and 70 were seriously injured during a screening of Batman. Remember that one? Once again, lives were forever changed and the city grieved. Some people felt scared to sit in a movie theater afterwards. By this time mass shootings had become more commonplace in America, but their impact still cut deep emotionally.And now the shooting at YouTube where I used to work, think and build five days a week. A familiar feeling by this point. The unfathomable is now totally fathomable.I\u2019m sure there are many stories like mine. The emotional impact of these tragedies is far reaching. It ripples outwards from the crime scene, creating a lasting sense of sadness and fear. Some people grow numb over time. Others, like myself, start to feel an empathetic connection to each new incident. Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Pulse, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Parkland, and far too many others. It is painful every time.My dad is a gifted pianist who excels in classical, jazz and improvisation, but he doesn\u2019t compose a lot of his own music. The night of the San Bernardino shooting, he recorded an original song titled \u201cSan Bernardino\u201d and emailed it to me. Thinking of the innocent victims, I cried when I played it back, just sitting there in the sadness as the notes reverberated. I could feel his pain as a father in the music.I was chatting about Parkland recently with my dear uncle who has different views on guns than me. He pointed out that Parkland is a complex basket of issues\u200a\u2014\u200afrom police and FBI failures to mental health, our violent culture and everything in between\u200a\u2014\u200athat must be sorted through one at a time. Don\u2019t be so quick to blame guns, he implied. Perhaps he is right, but guns are one of the issues. It is statistically undeniable. And we need to sort this one out.Common sense gun safety legislation will not change everything, but every indication shows that it will make a significant difference. We have to take action.I believe in the power of speaking out and I am encouraged by the young Parkland activists. Unfortunately I was unable to attend the March For Our Lives in Washington DC on March 24th, which I see as a vital youth movement. In our absence, my wife and I sent 5 students and a teacher from my old high school in Aurora, a city that has seen its share of gun violence. We feel fortunate that we could help these young people participate and be heard. They will drive the change we so desperately need to see.I am not a gun owner today but I will probably purchase one some day. If and when this day comes, I hope I am subject to a rigorous background check, mandatory training, a licensing process and an insurance requirement. That\u2019s not because I hate guns. It\u2019s because I respect them.I feel neither cursed nor unique for my own personal connection to these tragic incidents. Again, I am alive and healthy. I grieve for the true victims and their families. I am sad that these shootings have the power to destroy lives; creating a ripple effect that makes us feel numb\u2026 or scared. But I refuse to go numb. I feel angry that the system continues to fail us. And I feel hopeful that change will come.Change has to come.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "The disastrous ripple effects of Trump\u2019s executive action on refugee resettlement", "author_name": "The Brookings Institution", "link": "https://medium.com/@Brookings/the-disastrous-ripple-effects-of-trumps-executive-action-on-refugee-resettlement-f20c195a28f5?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 26, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "60", "content": "REUTERS/Muhammad HamedThe disastrous ripple effects of Trump\u2019s executive action on refugee resettlementThe Brookings InstitutionBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 26, 2017By: Elizabeth FerrisThis post was published on January 26, 2017.The international refugee system, constructed in the aftermath of World War II, has enabled millions of refugees in every region to find safety in other countries. President Trump\u2019s action to suspend all refugee resettlement to the United States and to impose additional restrictions on refugees from largely Muslim countries is a sad day for refugees and for cherished American values.But these actions also threaten a carefully-constructed international system for responding to people fleeing persecution and conflict. This system was intended not only to protect the rights of those forced to flee violence but also to prevent refugees from threatening international peace and security. Today\u2019s actions by President Trump, in the name of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, threaten that system.Beautiful despite blemishesThe system, grounded in the 1951 Refugee Convention and guided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has proven remarkably adaptable over the past six decades. Originally intended to assist those displaced by World War II, it has saved the lives of millions of women, children, and men fleeing communist countries, persecution by repressive governments, civil wars, ethnic cleansing, genocide, and criminal gangs.But somehow, frayed at the edges as it is, the system has continued to meet the needs of both refugees and the international community.It has never functioned perfectly. Some countries never signed the Refugee Convention; some governments refused to allow refugees to enter their countries or forcibly returned refugees to countries where their lives were in danger; some have adopted increasingly restrictive definitions of refugees. Financial support to countries hosting refugees was never sufficient to cover their costs.But somehow, frayed at the edges as it is, the system has continued to meet the needs of both refugees and the international community. The system was based on the concept of responsibility-sharing, reaffirmed in the New York Declaration less than six months ago. Responsibility-sharing means that the international community\u200a\u2014\u200aand not just the countries where refugees happen to go\u200a\u2014\u200awill step up. Countries experiencing a sudden influx of refugees have been reassured by this international commitment that they will not have to bear the burdens alone. It is in our national and our collective interest to make sure that refugees are cared for and that massive arrivals of refugees do not threaten peace and security.Dominoes falling?America has always played a king-sized role in the international refugee system. It has resettled millions of refugees from regions in turmoil, not only providing a benefit to individual refugees but also expressing a concrete commitment to responsibility-sharing. American leadership has led other governments to make commitments to refugees, most recently in the September 2016 Leaders\u2019 Summit. In recent years, the United States has been in the forefront of efforts to address issues such as sexual and gender-based violence and the rights of LGBTI refugees. And over the years, the United States has expressed its commitment to humanitarian principles by assisting refugees on the basis of need and not because of their religious affiliation. Lives have been saved and the international system has been supported because of U.S. leadership.If the United States slams the door, why should other countries keep theirs open, and what would that mean around the\u00a0world?The actions by the Trump administration will close doors to refugees\u200a\u2014\u200awhom federal law already requires undergo thorough vetting. This is a major problem, both for its direct effects and for possible ripples internationally. The move denies refugees the chance to start new lives in the United States and to enrich our communities. More broadly, it is another blow to an already fragile international system. If U.S. refugee policy excludes those fleeing violence in Muslim majority countries, why shouldn\u2019t other countries impose similar exclusions? If future U.S. refugee policy is based on a narrow implementation of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d why should Lebanon or Tanzania or a hundred other countries continue to receive refugees? After all, over 85 percent of the world\u2019s refugees are hosted by developing countries with far fewer resources than the United States. If the United States slams the door, why should other countries keep theirs open, and what would that mean around the world? If countries neighboring Syria, for instance, were to close their borders or to return Syrian refugees to a bloodbath, the results would be unconscionable from a humanitarian perspective, disastrous from a regional stability one, and deeply detrimental to U.S. and international interests.This post originally appeared on www.brookings.edu.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "The Ripple (XRP) Forecast 2019: Is $500 Possible?", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "link": "https://cryptocurrencyhub.io/the-ripple-xrp-forecast-2019-is-500-possible-ba6c3c3fe5ec?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 30, 2018", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "196", "content": "The Ripple (XRP) Forecast 2019: Is $500 Possible?Marko VidrihBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 30, 2018This year, the company Ripple and its cryptocurrency XRP had a lot going on: The heavy crash in 2018 caused worried lines to become troubled by supporters and investors. By now, more than three dollars per coin went down to below 0.30 USD by December.However, the cryptocurrency recovered in December 2018 and many new partnerships and projects were completed. Where is the journey going in 2019? The Ripple forecast looks promising. But are actually $500 per coin possible?Ripple Status\u00a0QuoBank cryptocurrency\u200a\u2014\u200aso-called because it works with many international banks and payment service providers to build a global payment network\u200a\u2014\u200ais often decrypted in the crypto scene. Many followers of other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Monero, Dash or Ethereum do not like the cryptocurrency around CEO Brad Garlinghouse, because it relies on the banks.Many other cryptos want to make exactly these banks superfluous and create a decentralization. CEO Brad Garlinghouse\u2019s company, on the other hand, uses its technology to provide payment services that can be used to transfer money to other countries within seconds. And that at 40 to 70 percent less cost.Trending Cryptocurrency Hub Articles:1. The Bitcoin Bubble Post\u00a0Mortem2. Ethereum and Blockchain Technology3. The CryptoKitties Economy4. The Crypto\u00a0gameIt has often been written that XRP developed significantly worse than all other top currencies in 2018. But that\u2019s not true. If you look at the charts, you can see that the XRP behaved exactly like the market capitalization of the entire market.That\u2019s not very good, but not bad either. So you can not say that the bank cryptocurrency performed worse than the competition. But what are the forecasts for the coming year?Currently, Ripple's price is in a range of 0.30 USD and 0.40 USD. Only when it breaks out there, it can move back towards the $1 mark. Anyway, if you go to the chart technique. In doing so, you look at the chart\u200a\u2014\u200athe development of the price of the last months and years\u200a\u2014\u200aand get an important brand through an analysis. Especially for Ripple trading, such a chart analysis is important.But long-term investors who are interested in the Ripple price can also benefit from it. However, the bank cryptocurrency should no longer fall below the $0.36 to $0.38 mark. That would trigger new sell signals. Important is the recapture of the hurdle at $0.43 to $0.44 and then the limit at $0.52.That was pure charting, but what do experts and ripple news say about a ripple forecast?Marko Vidrih is creating content about blockchain/crypto/tech/finance/economy/business... | PatreonMarko Vidrih was born in Slovenia and has always been fascinated by the worldwide economy and evolving technologies\u2026www.patreon.comThe forecast for the coming\u00a0yearsThere are numerous pages that have predicted potential future price targets. The truth is, no one really knows. You can only approach one goal with good arguments and numbers. For example, the Price Forecasting.com page predicts a price of $0.10 for the XRP for December 2019.This means that throughout the next year the price will only slide down. Is this realistic? Eventually, such an event would go hand in hand with a near-bankruptcy of the entire cryptosystem. That seems unlikely.Investinghaven.com experts, however, expect the coin to rise to $20 within a year. That sounds better. But: what arguments can you put forward?Thus, the authors say that the XRP is gaining value because it can handle worldwide payments in the future. Each year, about $30 billion would only be spent on international money transfers and currency exchanges. The system of Ripple could save about $16.5 billion every year.In addition, the company is planning another application called Xpring. This should make more people work on the blockchain and use the coin. So also goods on the blockchain are to be developed and acted. The authors attach great importance to this and think that the Ripple, like the big platform companies Facebook, Amazon, and Google, is number one in their field.And this platform or network effect is likely to push forecasts for cryptocurrency further up. These platforms work on one principle: The winner takes it all.So the experts come to a forecast of 20USD. In support of this, they take the long-term chart. Writing this into the future, an XRP coin could actually cost $20 next year.Other reasons for a positive prognosisThe company has managed to break into the Chinese market with its partner American Express. American Express is allowed to settle in the Chinese currency Yuan and thus the XRP is expected to be used in the currency exchange. This step was very important because China is a gigantic market and is already being paid electronically today.CEO Brad Garlinghouse and his product manager Craig DeWitt were delighted with this step and their entry into the Chinese market. In China, about 10 billion credit cards are expected to be in circulation in 2020. This ensures an enormous payment and thus a positive forecast.Another reason is that there is no Ripple mining. All about 100 billion XRPs that will ever exist are already created. This narrows the supply and sooner or later causes rising prices.In addition, payments have to be paid with 0.00001 XRP fees, so the amount of circulating coins is slowly but surely falling. That does not make a huge impact for the next few years, but in the long term, these circumstances should not be ignored.Also important are the partnerships with the banks Santander and UBS, as well as the credit card provider American Express. As a result of these existing cooperations, further companies are likely to become aware of the bank cryptocurrency, which will lead to a further positive Ripple prognosis.For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation already uses the company\u2019s blockchain technology. So it should be possible for millions of people in the third world to have a bank account on the smartphone and digitally come to a loan. The companies Visa, Amazon and especially Google might also be interested in working together.Because these companies spend billions of dollars worldwide, but sometimes take up to five days to make it to the right account. With blockchain technology and XRP, this should be much faster and cheaper.Ripple 2020 can rise that\u00a0highLet\u2019s take another one year and dare to make a prognosis for the future. After Ripple did not run very well in 2018 and ended the year with a minus of about 60 percent, the question arises what will happen in the coming years. There should not be another Ripple crash. But what seems realistic now?We have already seen some forecasts and also reasons for a positive outlook. In 2020, the value of XRP is likely to continue to rise significantly, as many experts see 2019 as a fateful year for most cryptocurrencies. Only those who have an application case in the real world are likely to survive in the long term.After all, many coins only exist because someone wanted to take money through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)\u200a\u2014\u200asomething like an ICO of a cryptocurrency\u200a\u2014\u200aor because the coin should be a store of value like the Bitcoin. But it does not take 2000 stores of value. So now should be sorted out, which means that there will be only a few hundred cryptocurrencies.These should then increase in price because they have shown that you need them and their blockchain. These include the XRP, which is why the Ripple forecast looks good for 2020 as well. Although there are no concrete price targets here. But if it does well in the coming year, the XRP coin should be forecasted over $20 the following year.Should you buy\u00a0now?The simple answer is yes. The best thing you can do right now is to buy Ripple. The course is already very low. That it falls much further is not very likely. But even if: Get in first with a small installment. Do not take more than 20 or 30 percent of the amount you want to invest in Ripple.Buy some coins on an exchange and put them in your Ripple wallet. When the price goes down, you buy 20\u201330% again. Sell them if the price rises sharply. Then buy again. So you benefit from any price movement and improve your position. In the long term, of course, it should go up, but for several reasons that should succeed.There is an important question: In which currency do you want to look at and buy the XRP? The Ripple in euro currently costs 0.33 euros and the Ripple in USD cost 0.37. This has simply to do with the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar. Mostly, the cryptocurrencies are displayed in dollars and bought because it is easier and more understandable worldwide.But if you buy your coins in different currencies, you always have currency risk. If the currency loses value, you will get less money, even though the price of the coin does not move at all. Mostly you can not do much here, but you should be aware of the risk.What does the final forecast look\u00a0like?Basically, nobody can tell exactly where the coin is going. But it seems that there are many more positive opinions than negative ones. The coin has many applications and is used by many international companies.These partnerships are likely to become even more numerous in the future, making the XRP even more circulating. Due to the platform and network effects, the price should be forecasted higher than today. Forecasts are always difficult, but technically possible.For the coming years, there are forecasts to over $20 and even $500 are now and then proclaimed. That seems to be a bit too high, but the XRP should grow up to $100. Then it would have a similarly high market capitalization as gold. Why should not that be possible?Author: Marko Vidrih @cryptomarksMarko Vidrih is creating content about blockchain/crypto/tech/finance/economy/business... | PatreonMarko Vidrih was born in Slovenia and has always been fascinated by the worldwide economy and evolving technologies\u2026www.patreon.com@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

Every day new financial institutions are joining the network to test what the blockchain can do for the industry of transaction processing.Ripple Transaction Protocol is built upon a distributed open source Internet protocol, consensus ledger and native currency called XRP. It does not only support cryptocurrencies, but can be used for fiat currency or any other asset, commodity to be sent through the protocol. The basis of the protocol is a public ledger with a consensus process that allows for transactions in a distributed process.The advantages that the protocol brings, are mostly focused on speed and cost per settlement, while also enabling security of a traditional financial payment protocols.Average daily payment volume of XRP ledger is already around 500 mio USD, and the market is growing rapidly. Imagine that Ripple could some day become the new foreign exchange market, which today amounts to $ 5.3 trillion of daily volume.The number of gateways in RTXP is increasing rapidly. Gateways enable users to put money into and take money out of Ripple\u2019s liquidity pool, and with growing number of gateways, there is a growing need for connectivity of those numerous entry and exit points.There is a real need for a market maker between those points and that is where we as a market maker come in play.Bellow you will see the example of only two gateways (Bitstamp\u200a\u2014\u200aGatehub), where, at its peaks, the users had to take 15% and even 25% haircut for USD dollar to USD dollar transaction.By positioning ourselves on different gateways we can create liquidity for the users and earn a fraction on every settled transaction. Of course, the total market consists of many more gateways and 15+ crypto and fiat currencies.

Personally, I\u2019m a big fan of Changelly.Another method is to use an exchange like Poloneix & buy XRP using Bitcoin or USD.You can also buy XRP from Bitstamp.Other exchanges which support buying Ripple are Kraken, Coinone (Korean), Bitso, and Coincheck.Once you have finalized the way you want to get XRP, the next thing to figure out is where to store them.Also see: Monero Wallet: How to Create & Use Monero Wallet Address OnlineXRP Wallets: Best Wallet For Ripple CryptocurrencyBefore I share about top wallets for XRP, you need to know one important thing:Unlike Bitcoin wallets which are free, Ripple wallets require you to have 20XRP to book your wallet address.So if you add 1000 XRP to your Ripple wallet, 20XRP will be used to book the wallet address. This is one reason you don\u2019t want to use multiple wallets for XRP (unless required).Pick the right wallet from day one so that you don\u2019t end up losing 20XRP on various wallet addresses.Do remember, there are various kinds of cryptocurrency wallets & you can read more about them here.Ledger Nano S:Ledger Nano S is a hardware wallet that has recently added support for XRP.Being a hardware wallet, it is one of the best ways to store your cryptocurrency as it offers great security, ease of use, and you can carry it with you anywhere.I recommend Ledger Nano S as it supports many popular cryptocurrencies including:Dash, BTC, ETH/ETC, Stratis, Zcash, and now it supports XRP.You should order it from the official site here & it will take 4\u20137 days to have it delivered to your doorstep.Once you have it, you can check out our Ledger Nano S video library to learn how to start using the Ledger Nano S.Coinpayments:CoinPayments is recommended by CoinSutra reader \u201cDipen\u201d and this one is a solid multi crypto currency wallet. With one account you will be able to store XRP along with many popular Cryptocurrencies & upcoming altcoins.Unlike other XRP wallet mentioned in this resource, for receiving XRP on coinpayments wallet you need to add the destination tag.CoinPayments is more than just XRP Wallet as it offers payment gateways for merchants to accept payments in cryptocurrencies. Right now I\u2019m trying their EDD integration & would let you know how it goes. For short term parking, this one is a solid solution for storing XRP coins.Join CoinPaymentsPoloniex:If you want to get XRP right now, you can use Poloniex to get an XRP wallet.However, you should store your XRP for more than 1\u20132 days on an exchange (any exchange) as exchanges can shut down or go into issues at any time and put you at risk of losing your stored coins.When I needed to get ahold of XRP urgently, I used Changelly to convert my bitcoins into XRP & stored them on my Poloniex wallet.You can, later on, transfer these XRP to the Ledger Nano S (or any other hardware wallet that supports XRP).Here is the statement from Poloniex about 20XRP for holding your Ripple deposit address.IMPORTANT: The first time you deposit to a Ripple deposit address, 20 XRP will be held there to reserve the address. This is because the Ripple network requires a minimum of 20 XRP to be in any active address. The money does not go to anyone, and the difference will be credited to your account if the minimum requirement is ever lowered. Once you have funded your deposit address with 20 XRP, you will be able to deposit any amount and receive your full deposit. Please note that if you generate a new deposit address, you will have to fund that one with 20 XRP as well.With time, I expect more popular wallets to integrate XRP & make it easier for us to store Ripple.However, for now, these are the top Ripple wallets that you can start using right away.If you are someone who is investing in cryptocurrencies, I would recommend you to just order Ledger Nano S hardware wallet which ensures that you remain in total control of all of your coins.Have a question about storing XRP?

Nevertheless, Ripple kept growing through five major leaps where its price multiplied over a short period of time. Although Ripple has its inherent value, some other conditions benefited its development and growth as well. Ripple happened at a good time and the price of Ripple rose with alternative cryptocurrencies in general. Since Bitcoin broke the 10k barrier, a great number of new users turned to alternative cryptocurrencies. That led to the rise in the global cryptocurrency market cap. Newbies mostly invested in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, but there was space left for other cryptocurrencies, especially for Ripple. Simply, value flooded the market and caused the general rise in prices.Further, Ripple created a buzz through numerous commercially beneficial partnerships. Media hype led to the rise of adoption rates, which subsequently caused higher demand and a price increase. The Ripple peaked in Asia through partnerships in China, Japan, Taiwan and several other countries. In the last few years, Asia became a key player in the acceptance of the cryptocurrencies. Ripple used that opportunity well, which gave them the strong foundation on which to build.An essential for every well-established cryptocurrency is the functionality and the service they provide to their users. The Ripple covered that part well, which gives them an opportunity to grow a lot more. The Ripple positioned themselves in the market well, based on the fact that it is multi-functional and very useful service for financial institutions. Yes, the Ripple will grow, probably over $100, even only based on the day-traders because of the steady and finite supply. When it comes to acceptance toward fiat currencies, it is difficult to determine whether there is any real use in it for the concept of Ripple.Subscribe for New Krown\u00a0Content!", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "A Data-Driven Perspective Why Ripple (XRP) is the Digital Asset to Invest\u00a0Today", "author_name": "Marcos Ortiz", "link": "https://medium.com/a-data-driven-guy/why-ripple-xrp-digital-asset-investing-today-7b4abdec6b08?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 22, 2017", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "90", "content": "A Data-Driven Perspective Why Ripple (XRP) is the Digital Asset to Invest\u00a0TodayMarcos OrtizBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 22, 2017The last week (December 10th\u200a\u2014\u200aDecember 17th, 2017), Jeff Kinney requested my answer at Quora about this interesting question:Which Crypto currency is the best to invest now $2500 (long-term investment)?Then, Jeff Kinney sent me a different question about Ripple (XRP):Is Ripple a good investment? How I do buy Ripple?This was my answer:But, as a personal finance geek who loves numbers and facts so much, I felt that there was an opportunity to bring more light to my answers about Ripple (the company) and $XRP (the digital asset).What is\u00a0Ripple?The first time I heard about Ripple was in 2016 when I found a very interesting whitepaper written for the specialists of the company called \u201cA Protocol For Interledger Payments\u201d, which explains in great detail how this protocol works, the technical background behind it and why it\u2019s relevant today a solution like that.So, what is Ripple (the company)?I will use its own words here:Ripple provides global financial settlement solutions to ultimately enable the world to exchange value like it already exchanges information\u200a\u2014\u200agiving rise to an Internet of Value (IoV). Ripple solutions lower the total cost of settlement by enabling banks to transact directly, without correspondent banks, and with real-time certainty of settlement. Banks around the world are partnering with Ripple to improve their cross-border payment offerings, and to join the growing, global network of financial institutions and market makers laying the foundation for the Internet of Value.Ripple is a venture-backed startup with offices in San Francisco, New York and Sydney. As an industry advocate for the Internet of Value, Ripple sits on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee and co-chairs the W3C\u2019s Web Payments Working Group.As a fan of simplicity, I knew that there had to be a simpler answer to the question about what is Ripple and what it does? And I found it in a live interview made by Martin Arnold (The Financial Times) to Daniel Aranda, Managing Director For Europe at Ripple:In the interview, Daniel said:Ripple is a cross-border payments network, and the members of the network are financial institutions. We work with banks as well as non-bank financial institutions, and they use Ripple as a way to move funds around the world to other financial institutions. And where the blockchain portion comes in is in really helping to coordinate things like settlement, so when a debit occurs to the account of the sender, is coordinated and synchronized with the credit accuracy account of the receiver.And we are also deploying digital assets cryptocurrencies, tokens of equity management as well. So, we are really trying to build a next generation network in terms of people how can move funds around to service new kinds of demands we are seeing on the\u00a0market.I encourage you to watch the entire discussion. Believe me, it worth of your time.Then, I began to search more information about the protocol and the company behind it: Ripple. In the middle of my search, I found another interesting whitepaper called \u201cThe Cost-Cutting Case for Banks: The ROI of Using Ripple and XRP for Global Interbank Settlements\u201d, and I realized that this could be huge in the next 5 to 10 years.Inside the whitepaper, I found two particular parts which made me to jump of my chair:This model includes a conservative assumption of hedging costs with initially high volatility of XRP. However, institutional holdings and active trading of XRP can greatly reduce the volatility of XRP, significantly lowering the hedging costs. In a low volatility state, assuming the volatility of XRP is the same as that of a basket of liquid global currencies, costs can decrease an additional 3.8 bps ($10 billion system-wide) or 60 percent compared to the current system, translating to\u00a0total system-wide cost savings of over $33 billion annually with lower volatility of XRP.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Data Shows Ripple and Litecoin might be Worthless", "author_name": "Dave Kajpust", "link": "https://medium.com/@davekaj/data-shows-ripple-and-litecoin-might-be-worthless-99c6572d7d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 8", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "88", "content": "Data Shows Ripple and Litecoin might be WorthlessData analysis of Github development for top blockchains shows very little coding\u00a0activityDave KajpustBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 8Some of the blockchains that are in the top 20 do not belong there. After analyzing the Github repositories for developmental output in 16 of the top blockchains, it has become clear that some haven\u2019t been working too hard over the last few years.There is very little time for anyone to do in depth analysis on many of the current blockchain protocols. Most of us just skim our information from the easiest sources, such as Twitter\u200a\u2014\u200awhere it takes all of 5 seconds to blast off a tweet for all to indulge.This post involved a little bit of data aggregation and data analysis, but that goes a long way in our fast paced world. The following three pieces of information are gathered from public repositories:Commits (weighted as the most important value)Pull Requests (weighted as the 2nd most important value)Issues (weighted as the 3rd most important value)This data was collected by querying the Github GraphQL API, which exposes all the commit, pull request, and issue data.What you\u2019ll learn from this\u00a0postThe following will be explained:Which blockchains have a robust, upward trend in development\u200a\u2014\u200aa very good signal!The long term commit history of 16 of the top blockchains.Data showing multiple projects that have significantly dropped off in development, and are beginning to look like dead projects (Ripple and Litecoin among them)Unique contributors to each projects code, another indicator of good health for an open source project.Unique Contributions\u200a\u2014\u200aAll\u00a0TimeThe chart below considers unique contributions since the inception of each blockchain. A unique contribution is a single Github user interacting with the code repository in an Issue, Pull Request, or Commit. These scores are combined in all three categories, and their points are weighted and tallied.Note these values are weighted. The actual number of people who have contributed are less than what is\u00a0shown.For unique contributions, obviously Bitcoin is at the top, since it has been around the longest. But it is important to see where some of these projects land. We see some weak looking projects at the right side. These blockchains have had very few individuals interact with the code, and some of been around for many years\u2026. Not a good sign.Another interesting point is how strong Bitcoin and Ethereum (go-ethereum and parity-ethereum) are compared to the rest of the pack. They each have the most unique contributors, with the longest history. The momentum they have will be very hard to knock off.Let\u2019s now focus on recent data.Unique Contributions\u200a\u2014\u200aJan 2018- Late Feb\u00a02019This is the same data as above, but we are focusing on the last 14 months.Note these values are weighted. The actual number of people who have contributed are less than what is\u00a0shown.A surprising fact was how many unique Github accounts have contributed to EOS. I have to admit I\u2019ve been out of the loop on EOS. I thought their $4 billion dollar ICO was ridiculous, so I didn\u2019t pay too much attention. I don\u2019t know too much about the development community, but I expected it to be much more centralized in development. Similar to where Tron is on the chart. Both projects have similar amounts of commits, and were started at roughly the same time, but Tron has had way fewer unique developers contribute to its source code. Maybe EOS hired a ton of people with the $4 billion dollars they raised, or maybe there is real open source contributions happening here. More in depth analysis would need to be done.Cosmos and Polkadot get more representation in this chart, which makes sense since they are both launching this year, and will be pushing many commits before going live\u200a\u2014\u200aa common pattern among launching blockchains, which we will see below.We see again that Iota, Litecoin, Ripple, Stellar, Dash, and Neo are not really doing that much development work.Total Contributions\u200a\u2014\u200aJan 2018 Late Feb\u00a02019This is a combination of Issues, Pull Requests, and Commits, over the last 14 months.Note these values are weighted. The actual number of people who have contributed are less than what is\u00a0shown.Of the mature projects, Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum all show that that they are still consistently pushing code.We see EOS, Cosmos, and Tron having large pushes over the last 14 months. Cardano is up there too. It might seem surprising to many in the Ethereum community that Tron and EOS have this much development work, but it is true. Their repositories had heavy development before launch.This isn\u2019t the whole story though, as we will see in the next section.Commit History\u200a\u2014\u200aAll\u00a0TimeBelow is a chart of commit history in each repository. Each months commits are summed together, giving 12 data points per year. The chart is very hard to read within Medium, it is highly recommended to click through and go to the interactive chart, and click on \u201cFull Window\u201d mode.While interacting with the chart on Plotly, I recommend keeping Bitcoin and go-ethereum highlighted, while turning on and off every other blockchain project to see how the commits compare. This will allow you to compare the development of all the other projects to the top two blockchains.Click this link to see an interactive chart (highly recommended!)We get some really good information from this chart:Bitcoin\u2019s trend of commits is consistently upward and to the right. This shows how reliable the continuous development of the protocol is, and it is one of the main reasons it is the most relied upon blockchain in the world.Go-ethereum had a massive spike before launch and has since dropped off. There is also a huge spike for parity-ethereum right after the go-ethereum spike, which is a nice sign, since both clients are important to the protocol. But this goes to show, big spikes, with big drop offs, are expected after a network launches, and can still lead to a successful blockchain.EOS, Cardano, and Tron have all fallen off massively since their initial pushes for their launch. However, since Ethereum had this exact same situation, this isn\u2019t enough to criticize them. A much better way to compare these projects would be by how many smart contracts are being built on each of them.Monero is also up and to the right, more so that any project except Bitcoin. This is a good indicator for Monero. Comparing privacy coins, Zcash has less overall development work and less unique contributors. I would take Monero over Zcash.Polkadot is coming up this year for a launch. It would be expected that they have a big code push in 2019. Cosmos had a big push the last few months of 2018, and it has fallen off in early 2019 as they are currently in audit mode. Both of these projects have a lot of promise, but it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise when we see them drop off as well.Iota, Dash, Stellar, and Ripple have poor development over the last few years. They also have very low unique contributors. This points out that they aren\u2019t doing much development themselves, and they aren\u2019t doing a good job at building a decentralized community of developers. It is not so clear why these are valued so highly.Ripple isn\u2019t a real blockchain, but still, the Github commit trend line is the worst of them all, a complete and total disaster!I never looked into Litecoin much before this. For development, it seems almost non-existent. It followed Bitcoin almost exactly, up until mid 2017. Since they broke from following Bitcoin, the commits have fallen off extensively. It isn\u2019t clear why this coin is worth anything. I even doubled checked all their branches, and all of the people in the organization\u200a\u2014\u200ano one has written any code since October 2018\u2026. Is it possible to short Litecoin? (Seriously, let me know in comments).Neo is the saddest project of them all. The commits are so few. And there are very few people who have ever contributed to this repo. I have to admit, I fell for \u201cChina\u2019s Ethereum\u201d a few years ago and I thought this was a serious project. What a great framing that was! However it is clear as daylight that not a lot of work has been done here, and that this project was never serious from the start. You can now call Tron \u201cChina\u2019s Ethereum\u201d.How many contributors make up 90% of the\u00a0commitsLastly, a simple table that looks at how many unique contributors make up 90% of the commits. You want to see a high number here, as it means more people have put in real work into developing the blockchain core software.Note Dash, Zcash, and Litecoin were left out because so many of the commits mixed and matched with Bitcoin core contributors, since they were all forks of\u00a0Bitcoin.However, many of these blockchains have employees as contributors, rather than open source developers, which could represent the bulk of commits, which is not as robust as open source development. Once again Bitcoin takes the cake here, with the most contributors, and the least employees.ConcludingThe big points to take away from this post:Bitcoin is robust as hell, and I would not bet against it. The \u201cBitcoin is old technology\u201d narrative will rear its ugly face again in the next bull run of Alt Coins. Remember how consistent Bitcoin has been over the last 10 years, as this will remind you how hard it will be to dethrone Bitcoin.There are some really crap blockchains that have big market caps (Litecoin, Neo, Iota, Dash, Stellar, and Ripple).EOS, Tron, and Cardano have had a lot of development over the last two years. It is now time for their platforms to prove themselves.Monero has good, consistent development.Remember, this is just high level analysis of data points on Github. No in depth analysis of the code has been done. Having lots of commits does not mean the code quality is good!What\u2019s Next?The next blog post I am going to do will focus on smart contracts being developed on blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, Tron, etc.It is expected that Ethereum will have the most here, but I am very interested to see how some of these other projects are doing. Most of my information end up coming from the Ethereum community, so this data should be very eye opening to myself, and many in the Ethereum community.Follow me on medium for more posts on blockchain data\u200a\u2014\u200a@davekajFollow me on Twitter if you like reading tweets that take 5 seconds to write or if you want to talk about blockchain data analysis\u200a\u2014\u200a@davekajpustAppendix\u200a\u2014\u200aBrief notes on the\u00a0dataAny project that was a fork of Bitcoin (Zcash, Dash, Litecoin) has had their commit history altered to start from the point at which their commits started to diverge from Bitcoins significantly.Cosmos and Tendermint have been combined as one project, even though they are two seperate repositories. So has Substrate and Polkadot. Both repositories are core to each blockchain, which is why they were combined.Parity-ethereum and go-ethereum clients have both been included in the data. Ethereum is the only blockchain with two clients that both have wide usage, which is why they were both included.EOS, Tron, Dash, and Cardano have a lot of commits on their \u201cdevelop\u201d branches, so these were used, rather than \u201cmaster.\u201d (Recently on Twitter it was being passed around that EOS\u2019s development has completely fallen off.

This is one of several new banking partnerships that Ripple revealed in 2019. At this point, it is working with over 200 banks and financial organizations.xRapid Blockchain Offers Fast and Transparent TransactionsRipple\u2019s blockchain software is like other blockchain platforms in that it can provide transparent and real-time visibility of transactions to all stakeholders. For those with access to the blockchain ledger, there is no need to email queries or check confirmations. Stakeholders can simply check a link to the transaction which is immutably recorded on a blockchain network.Euro Exim Bank plans to use both xRapid and Ripple for transactions in the first quarter of 2019, according to American Banker. Doing so would make the bank the first to use both Ripple software and the XRP cryptocurrency.Marcus Treacher, global head of strategic accounts at Ripple explains why financial institutions are drawn to Ripple\u2019s services:\u201cWhen you use XRP, instead of having to pre-park all your money in foreign accounts around the world, you hold your funds locally, under your control, your stability, your creditworthiness. It\u2019s a much better position structurally.\u201dAccording to Treacher, XRP reduces the time it takes to move funds from one account to another in a different currency. The current system, SWIFT, can take up to three days whereas Ripple can execute the same transaction in two minutes.Ripple has capitalized on the weaknesses of the existing SWIFT system. Graham Bright, head of compliance and operations for Euro Exim Bank explained that XRP eliminates the need to establish pre-existing bilateral relationships with foreign banks to hold reserves of foreign currency and process local fiat payments: \u201cwe saw the technology would let us easily and quickly originate payments without having bilateral relationships.\u201d Bright happens to have worked at SWIFT for 20 years.Ripple Has 200 CustomersRipple confirmed it now has signed 200 banking and financial customer partnerships. In addition to Euro Exim Bank, it announced partnerships with SendFriend, JNFX, FTCS, Ahli Bank of Kuwait, Transpaygo, BFC Bahrain, ConnectPay, GMT, WorldCom Finance, Olympia Trust Company, Pontual/USEND, and Rendimento. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple said:\u201cWe\u2019re now signing two\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes three\u200a\u2014\u200anew customers per week. We also saw a 350 percent increase last year in customers sending live payments, and we\u2019re beginning to see more customers flip the switch and leverage XRP for on-demand liquidity.\u201dOf the new partnerships, Ripple has said that JNFX, SendFriend, Transpaygo, FTCS and Euro Exim Bank, will use XRP for settlement as well as Ripple\u2019s blockchain products.

We started two weeks ago with a new strategy on EOS, and we are happy to publish our long overdue strategies on XRP and LTC cryptocurrencies. Even though it may be too early to start thinking about launching DAFs outside BTC and ETH, we believe it is interesting to provide trading signals on other large cryptos so that you would have more tools to invest in a more diversified way.New XRP.USD\u00a0strategyThe strategy is the aggregation of two primary strategies, similar to the old BTC.USD pair. As a reminder, this was made up of one strategy that takes positions on a weekly basis with a long-only trend following approach and one \u201cbuy the dip\u201d daily strategy. This has been designed to allow trading on all platform as no short positions are included at this stage. This may come in an updated version later this year.Source: Napoleon\u00a0GroupAs you can see, we are essentially capturing the moment where the uptrend is the most ferocious and being neutral when the trend is absent.New LTC.USD\u00a0strategyThis is basically a copy and paste of the a.m. strategy. We usually like to test a strategy on different assets and find out that it is still working. That reinforces the statistical value of our methodology, and in the case of cryptos, it is quite useful as there is not much historical data.Source: Napoleon\u00a0groupIn this strategy, that we have not overfitted, it is at the beginning that we lag somewhat the underlying. After that, the strategy is working nicely to capture uptrends, with at the end a much-reduced volatility.Upcoming eToro\u00a0strategyWe are in the final stage of onboarding a Napoleon product on the eToro platform. The rationale behind this launch is to get some visibility amongst eToro community, which is a large retail community of traders that could be interested in our project and in the bots that will be launch in the next few weeks. We will communicate separately on this topic quite soon. So stay tuned.ConclusionAs always, we are coming with new ideas and new features for you. It is important that you are rewarded as you supported us in the first place. You will also be our best ambassadors in the future when people become aware of our project and will join our Telegram and our platform.

Stellar is targeting a massive addressable market, the technology has proven use cases, companies are starting to use XLM as a base pair, and stablecoins are being launched on Stellar.

Here we briefly go over some vital differences between Ripple and the other, more prevalent digital currencies BTC (bitcoin) and ETH (ether).So why do the banks love XRP so much?1) Ripple is CENTRALIZEDRipple Consensus Ledger (RCL) is a centralized \u201crecord book\u201d that keep tabs on Trustlines and IOUs (and more). Here\u2019s some important tidbits about Ripple Labs\u2019 currency XRP:XRP is Ripple Consensus Ledger\u2019s (RCL) native tokenHas a finite quantity of 100 billion; no more XRPs will ever be created again. The number of XRPs will decrease over time as it is consumed for every single transaction that is made80% of the XRP supply has been kept away from public, locked up i EscrowRipple is a system made for the banks based on a trustline consensus. A trustline is simply the amount in which you are willing to trust another party for. E.g. The amount in your bank account can be seen as IOU tokens, and what you have is basically a \u201ctrustline\u201d of at least that amount extended to the bank. If you only dare trust your bank for a maximum of 10,000 USD. Then your trustline can be said to be 10,000 USD extended to your bank. And you would never hold more than that in your account.Ripple has been likened to an alternative to SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication2) Using XRP for International Bank Transfers in lieu of wiring will save Banks BILLIONS of dollars per yearAs the Ripple team reports, \u201cInstead of holding local currency in nostro accounts around the world, banks (or third-party market makers on their behalf) can consolidate their liquidity for global payments into one XRP account, held on their own balance sheets. This singular XRP pool then allows respondent banks to allocate less total liquidity to service the same volume of international payments in three ways:They only have to hold domestic currency and maintain one account with XRP versus many, expensive nostro accounts around the world.They only need enough XRP on hand to service their largest expected payment obligations, freeing previously trapped liquidity idling in nostro accounts around the world. XRP allows banks to access liquidity on demand.By making markets directly between their domestic currencies and XRP, banks minimize the number of intermediaries involved and their markup on spreads.As a result, respondent banks that use Ripple with XRP as a bridge currency can save up to 42 percent on costs today and up to 60 percent as XRP gains usage and volatility decreases. To accelerate market thickness and reduce volatility for XRP, Ripple will soon introduce an XRP incentive program to algorithmically rebate market makers who provide liquidity through XRP.\u201d3) Ripple\u2019s Market Cap is FALSEBecause Ripple is withholding a large percentage of its XRP token, limited supply is inauthentic\u200a\u2014\u200ait is completely fabricated.

Then Bitcoin and Litecoin might be right for you. Do you hope for big profits in the long-term? Then Bitcoin and Ethereum should be considered first, despite some believing that Bitcoin reached its oversaturation. Do you want something accessible and cheap? Ripple is here. Do you want something functional and profitable at the same time? Bitcoin is by fire the best choice. Do you want them all together? Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200ait can safely play different roles.Litecoin is for those who look for stability, but don\u2019t expect it to grow at a high pace like Ethereum or Bitcoin. You can\u2019t invest in it expecting it to increase by ten times. It may happen in theory, but it\u2019s not that probable. Litecoin doesn\u2019t get the media attention, and the latter is important, believe me. Litecoin is more accessible for miners, so it can be a good approach for you.Ripple looks attractive because it\u2019s cheap. If you don\u2019t know where to throw a few hundred bucks, you can buy Ripple and leave for the long-term. There is much potential for growth since Ripple works with reputable banks, including Abu Dhabi Bank, UniCredit, ReiseBank, and more.Ethereum was very promising\u2026until the crash from June. A problem occurred at the GDAX exchange, and Ethereum lost 99.99% for a few minutes.Since then, it cannot update its record. But experts say its market cap should exceed the Bitcoin one since Ehtereum is more functional than Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200ait has the smart contracts and all the innovative stuff.Bitcoin is the best investment from my point of view, at least today. It has the most media coverage, it is functional, it is active, it makes the headlines, you can buy with it in different shops\u200a\u2014\u200ain short, it is by far the most popular cryptocurrency. And most importantly, it has much room for growth. Some experts say it can grow to $50,000 and even $100,000.

Whenever a person says in a conversation that he/she is hodling or suggests to hodl, it means that they believe their coin will be profitable one day, if not today.==============================Number 3:\u00a0FOMOFear of missing out.If you didn\u2019t buy Bitcoin on the dip at $4.5k because it was too expensive, and you didn\u2019t buy at $8.5k because it was too expensive, does it really make sense to buy at $12k after the run up we\u2019ve seen in the past two weeks?!you might want to buy Bitcoin at any price and put the idea that a given price is too expensive or you sold too soon aside, but you should not make those choices emotionally based on a Fear of Missing Out (FOMO).Number 4: BEAR /\u00a0BULLThis is a term borrowed from the Wall Street people. This means a trader/investor who believes the prices of a particular cryptocurrency or market will fall and wants to profit from that fall.What is a Bull\u00a0Market?Bull markets are defined by the market going up aggressively over a period of time.

It means a trader with a fat account, usually one who is bullish (one who thinks the market will rise) on the price of any specific cryptocurrency. These people are also referred to as bullish whales.Number 6: BAGHODLERThe expression \u201cleft holding the bag\u201d originated in eighteenth century Britain and spread throughout the English-speaking world. In this context, a person left holding the bag is stuck with the stolen goods, taking the blame from the police while the rest of a criminal gang escapes.This is an investor or a trader who has been holding (or hodling\u200a\u2014\u200ayou get the joke\u00a0? check number 1 if not) for too long on a particular cryptocurrency and now has to face the consequences of that decision.Number 7:\u00a0ADDYPublic address or keyNumber 8:\u00a0FUDFear, uncertainty, and doubt.

Also, when it comes to the Ripple price, the numbers are all rather positive so far, which is great.First, there are the huge gains. The price jumped nearly 4000% in the first half of 2017. Sure, the price fell after the bubble burst, but this growth is a helpful indicator where is Ripple headed. Also, Ripple is (at the moment) listed on 30+ trading platforms. Plus, it has some unique features such as a high number of transactions per minute (70,000) and the fact that is premined. The majority of Ripple is owned by the company that created it, which brings stability and lowers the risk for investors, as no one can easily manipulate the market at the expense of other participants.Another important thing\u200a\u2014\u200alast year, Ripple announced the setup of its first interbank global payments group, which included big banks like Bank of America Corp, the Royal Bank of Canada and Westpac Banking Corp. And that\u2019s its main move\u200a\u2014\u200abig banks are starting to use it for transfers in their internal network as well as for transaction to other banks. And since big banks work with billions\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s likely that the price will move upwards in long-term.That\u2019s why I would recommend buy-and-hold strategy, which is the best way to invest in Ripple.After all, remember that Ripple has about $7.4 billion in terms of market cap but is still valued at far less than a dollar. One Ripple coin is far cheaper than one Ethereum or one Bitcoin coin, and it has a long road ahead of it.I don\u2019t expect the price of Ripple ever to reach the price of Ethereum or Bitcoin, simply because the total coin supply for Ripple is too high. Ripple currently has 38,3 billion coins in circulation compared to 94.8 million for Ethereum and 16.5 million for Bitcoin.When we talk about success\u200a\u2014\u200aI think that Ripple could reach the success achieved by Bitcoin and Ethereum, and maybe even sooner than we think. If the big banks start using it for their transactions and the company which owns the majority of Ripple starts selling it, I think that Ripple could see mass adoption and implementation in many different markets, as it offers cheap, fast and easy money transactions.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Ripple Might Surpass Bitcoin in\u00a0Return", "author_name": "Unocoin", "link": "https://blog.unocoin.com/ripple-might-surpass-bitcoin-in-return-8dca9e214369?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 6, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "111", "content": "Ripple Might Surpass Bitcoin in\u00a0ReturnUnocoinBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 6, 2018Ripple Might Surpass Bitcoin in\u00a0ReturnBitcoin is the most widely known cryptoasset around the globe. But there\u2019s an entire world out there in the cryptoasset you may not be aware of. These cryptoassets are called \u201cAltcoins\u201d and include massively popular names like Ripple and Litecoin.Bitcoins are not the only go-to option if you are looking to trade online. Some altcoins are also giving huge returns as well. Bitcoin has peaked at a value of around $20,000 and currently trades for less than that. With beginner investors facing shaky confidence with such volatility, many have turned to Ripple. We even featured it in our list of \u2018coins to watch out for\u2019 recently.RippleRipple became quite popular when Uphold, a platform which lets the customers purchase XRP without any transaction fees made around $3 billion worth of transactions. Ripple has also partnered with Santander, SBI Holdings and LianLian International which makes it easily available to average citizens. Ripple\u2019s Rapid product is also being tested by MoneyGram, Mercure FX, IDT Corporation, and Cuallix Mercadotecnia.Where is Ripple being\u00a0used?Ripple has a huge market in the blockchain with clients including banks and well-known payment providers. It is hugely popular among bank as it makes huge money transactions between nations a lot easier, and accounts for billions of dollars being transferred every day. Ripple believes that XRP can be used as fiat currency between nations which means that a person says, in the USA converts US dollars to XRP and sends them to India where the receiver converts the XRP into rupeesShould you buy\u00a0Ripple?Ripple has been gaining a lot of popularity in 2018. But if it fails in gaining further acceptance in the cryptoasset industry, it would severely impact ripple\u2019s reputation in the crypto market.Cryptoassets are already changing the world, helping the entrepreneurs create disruptive products, and raising funds from them via ICOs.As the crypto market becomes more popular, the value of Ripple will also balloon. Apart from being cheaper (and therefore gaining a psychological advantage), it also has chances to provide a higher return (nearly 5.5 times) compared to the bitcoins (1.5 times), according to analysts.As the cryptoasset market grows, investors may want to focus on XRP and other such options. The huge size of Ripple\u2019s market (and its institutional backing) is a clear sign of the potential of it has of becoming one of the most valuable cryptoassets in the future. Its partnerships with the industry leaders not only establishes the legitimacy but also help in its wide acceptance as well.Many cryptoasset watchers have become obsessed market capitalization which refers to the amount of virtual currency going around. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a particular asset with the number of units.Bitcoin which is arguably the biggest player in the market, that resulted in the popularity of other cryptoassets as well and the investors, are looking forward to these alternative options.Currently, the two popular assets\u200a\u2014\u200aEthereum and Ripple are fighting for the second spot and it seems like Ripple will gain the upper hand with the popularity and wide appeal, although it won\u2019t be a surprise if it surpasses bitcoin in the future.Also Read:Unodax introduces Crypto to Crypto trading pairsUnodax, India\u2019s leading blockchain and cryptoasset company is introducing 17 crypto-to-crypto trading pairs.

In fact, the attack as I see it is well underway.And it began with the attack on the credibility of Bitcoin Cash and it\u2019s continuing with the insane pump of Ripple and any coin which has direct ties to old money. What I want to posit today is how the next crash in the cryptocurrency markets can, and likely will, play out.To lay this out you have to believe a few things are true.The major money center banks have all been trading Bitcoin and other alt-coins for a long time. They have substantial books to push and pull the price.The futures market is used to control the price during daytime hours in the U.S. and Europe.Bitcoin\u2019s failure to implement \u2018Segwit 2x\u2019 and its current dysfunction was intentional in order for Blockstream to offer a \u2018solution\u2019 to a \u2018problem\u2019 that needn\u2019t have existed.Lightning Network is simply a backup control plan in case Ripple isn\u2019t adopted by the marketplace as the crypto-settlement and exchange layer. It creates a second layer of centralization off-chain.Legislation and regulation to date has been designed to allow money to flow into the crypto-markets but not back out again.Ripple, otherwise known as \u2018BanksterCoin\u2019 among we crypto-enthusiasts is the stalking horse of the cryptocurrency industry. It\u2019s meteoric rise in price coincides with Bitcoin\u2019s peak and subsequent meandering. It was done, timing-wise, to see articles like these (here, here and here) written as we ring in the new year.The Bitcoin\u00a0TrapLook at the situation in Bitcoin. After the failure to implement the New York Agreement, something that didn\u2019t have to be an all-or-nothing proposition, Bitcoin spiked from $5000 to a high near $20,000 in less than a month. Transaction fees soared, exchanges became illiquid, getting alt-coins off some exchanges was difficult as many were revealed (at least in the short term) to not have supply of the underlying assets people were \u2018trading\u2019 in their pools.Services like Changelly and Shapeshift have much smaller lists of coins available for easy exchange than they did a month ago. Try buying tokens like WAVES, STEEM, Golem, NEO or Komodo on these services. You can\u2019t. They can\u2019t source actual tokens or the gateways to exchange them are down.The best way to kill a market is to get retail investors buying the peak and selling into it. Such is the stuff bear markets are made of. It\u2019s imperative to break retail investor sentiment down. That\u2019s how markets are brought to heel. Then rotating out of that market into the next market you want to promote. This is what the banking industry does with its sell-side \u2018analysis\u2019 all the time.I have a rule, when Goldman-Sachs says \u201cBuy\u201d I sell and vice versa. In my Universe, rightly or wrongly, Goldman and their ilk are still trading against its recommendations and its clients. And if it\u2019s not allowed to do so anymore *wink* *wink* because of Dodd-Frank then in the unregulated crypto-markets you should bet that they, J.P. Morgan and the rest of them are.So, it\u2019s easy to believe in an irrational pump of Bitcoin to $20,000 and the subsequent rotation out and into Ripple, boosting its price and profile, while leaving \u2018teh newbz\u2019 hanging at the top. Add in Bitcoin futures trading to help the tail wag the dog, insane transaction fees that have everyone wondering what\u2019s so great about this Bitcoin if it costs $30 to move $100 and you have a set-up for carnage.The spike to $20,000, in my opinion, was created by the very hinckey roll-out of rival Bitcoin Cash by Coinbase last month. The goal there was to sow confusion and undermine Bitcoin Cash as an alternative to Bitcoin. Again, if you want control over the entire market, you do so by killing off real competition.See, folks, all of this confusion and carnage comes from not having any kind of centralized control. But, hey, there\u2019s this new cool thing called Ripple which solves all of that and the price is going bonkers!Trap Set.To Ethereum and\u00a0BeyondThat\u2019s the past. That\u2019s where we are as we enter 2018. Now what?In response to this, Ethereum begins another push towards $1000. Now, Ethereum has its own problems that are technology-based. Ultimately, its blockchain is only as secure as the code of the tokens issued on it.We\u2019ve seen this in reality a couple of times, including the hack because of bad code that forced a fork of the Etherum blockchain which created Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Ethereum (ETH).While I fully believe that one (or many) of these Ethereum-based projects is likely to create another event like that one, the pure cynic in me says, \u201cWhy wait?\u201dIf you were the bad guys wouldn\u2019t that be your plan in the first place? Create a crypto-project using ERC-20 tokens that resolve and clear on the Ethereum blockchain with the intention of breaking it. Invite investor money in, say fifty million dollars. A reasonable, but not insane amount of money.Then let the code run until such time that it will cause maximal damage to Ethereum and the whole crypto-community. The token goes up four or five times because that\u2019s simply what is happening across the space.At that point you\u2019ve created a $200+ million meltdown and negative headlines galore.At this point Bitcoin is neutralized and controlled, Ethereum is discredited and something like that would cause a major panic which is exploited by the same prop trading desks that blew the bubble up in the first place.If you time that with a spike in Ripple, the banker-acceptable coin, and crash it too, you\u2019ll take down most of the industry in almost no time. The psychological damage from a scenario like this will create bear market not unlike the one created post Dot-Com bubble.And like that bust, only those companies that are willing to play ball with Wall St. and Washington D.C. will be promoted and allowed to thrive.Trap Sprung.If you don\u2019t think Wall St. isn\u2019t thinking in these terms then you aren\u2019t a serious crypto-investor. This is the nightmare scenario, or one like it.The Slipstream SolutionThis is why I continue to bang on about the need for decentralized exchanges where the kind of manipulation described above is harder, if not impossible, to pull off. I fundamentally do not believe most of the \u2018liquidity\u2019 that exists on exchanges like HitBTC, Bittrex, GDAX, etc. exists.Between the false liquidity created by Tether and the potential for running fractional reserves it\u2019s not hard to posit. It doesn\u2019t take the weight of the entire Bitcoin market to raise the price. It just takes one guy willing to buy the ask. Once sellers lift their offers in response to a wave of buying things go up quick, especially with programmatic, algo-driven trading.These exchanges who are not holding all deposits as smart contracts off-exchange with 100%+ reserves like BitShares are vulnerable to major price rises creating liquidity problems, which only adds to the perception that the industry is amateur-hour.Another solution aside from Bitshares is Komodo\u2019s BarterDEX, which exclusively trades through cross-chain atomic swaps and has no need for a third party intermediary. Both of these, to me, represent where the industry needs to go to avoid us ending up with Ripple and Goldman still running the show.Remember, no one is operating BitShares\u2019 exchange. It\u2019s completely blockchain-based. It has a fully-tradeable profit-token, OBITS, which distributes monthly profits from the exchange back to the token holders (current yield is around 4%). There is no central pool of liquidity that requires ever-growing ties to credit-providers. The network only manages assets that have been deposited onto it.Projects like AriseBank (full disclosure I bought into its ICO), I think, deserve a look. AriseBank partnered with BitShares to provide the back-end technology to facilitate currency-swaps and brokerage services. This is billing itself as the world\u2019s first truly decentralized bank, designed to compete directly with the major banks and provide a new business model for banking altogether.So, as 2018 plays out we as traders and investors need to be aware of the dangers of centralized liquidity and move our liquidity off of them, supporting projects that will build the kind of infrastructure Bitcoin\u2019s initial design was supposed to support.So many people who have gotten into cryptocurrencies in 2017 will not have an exit strategy in 2018 when the fan gets hit. As we saw in the peak in December getting your money into or off of Coinbase was a nightmare.Viewing the market structure through this lens provides a way to siphon off some of the energy the banks are propelling cryptos with to not only fatten your wallets but bring validity and stability to the markets and businesses that will carry on the fight before it\u2019s yet another case of \u201cMeet the new boss, same as the old boss.\u201dFor more background look at these articles:https://tomluongo.me/2017/12/23/was-coinbases-bitcoin-cash-rollout-a-designed-hit/https://tomluongo.me/2017/12/04/bitcoin-futures-and-the-need-for-control/https://tomluongo.me/2017/11/16/the-foundation-of-the-next-cryptocurrency-bull-market/and my archive at Crypto News:\u00a0https://www.crypto-news.net/author/tom-luongo/", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Ripple\u2019s $XRP is a Steward for Real\u00a0Change", "author_name": "George Dy, Jr.", "link": "https://medium.com/@georgedyjr/ripples-xrp-is-a-steward-for-real-change-3e6c7e8d16f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 22, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "40", "content": "Photo by Max Ostrozhinskiy on\u00a0UnsplashRipple\u2019s $XRP is a Steward for Real\u00a0ChangeThe Behavioral Studies Case for $XRP, Why Partially-Centralized Protocols Are\u00a0HelpingGeorge Dy, Jr.BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 22, 2018I feel dirty just writing about Ripple. It\u2019s a symptom of how the crypto-community can make you feel\u200a\u2014\u200aforced to take a binary stance on a topic that is so new to the world that it seems impossible to take a side. Just jump on Twitter these days and you can feel the uncomfortable hum of so-called cryptocurrency experts and decentralization evangelists arguing an opinion as fact, more often diminishing projects than supporting one.Deconstructing the centralized \u2018shitcoin\u2019Dubbed \u2018a centralized shitcoin\u2019 by many in the crypto-community, the popular opinion is rather one-sided in opposition to Ripple\u2019s XRP. However, regardless what any pundit may say, XRP still holds the 3rd largest market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies for a reason. People tend to fixate on its lack of decentralization. They point to its marked decision to pick a trust algorithm that puts major decisions into the hands of its creators, not solely the technology and the holders.XRP is built on a trust algorithm that hand selects nodes in a rather centralized process, allowing it to control the speed and cost of transactions on their blockchain to the benefit of their end customers\u200a\u2014\u200afinancial institutions. This technological decision is not only a strategic advantage, but a necessity when working with big banks and financial services. These organizations are notably averse to volatility, especially when it impacts their core responsibilities.It is this centralization and cooperation with big banks that earn XRP the \u2018shitcoin\u2019 misnomer. But I believe their decision to centralize the stack will allow XRP to succeed in converting a growing audience of cryptocurrency Early Adopters and Early Majority.XRP is a mental bridge for the masses, marketed by traditional financeRipple\u2019s technology addresses and solves an immediate problem in financial technology today. Their technology is a proven means to transfer funds quickly, efficiently, and securely. As a side effect, its position builds mental parallels between traditional financial institutions and \u201cfuturistic\u201d cryptocurrencies\u200a\u2014\u200aimproving sentiment and increasing visibility of a decentralized digital future.Ripple\u2019s continued expansion into partnerships with central banks and major financial institutions like Moneygram and Western Union works to placate the fears of people that are wary of digital currencies as a whole. Partnerships with central banks further make the case for widespread adoption among banks. Deeper integration presents potentially-marketable service offerings, perhaps even the ability to convert fiat for crypto at physical locations. These partnerships act as a litmus test for the masses, enabling mainstream consumers to approach cryptocurrencies with less hesitation.Simply put, Cryptocurrency (with a capital \u2018C\u2019) stands a better chance to create supporters by providing comfort in something familiar. So, the greater the brand of the financial partner, the stronger the impact on consumers. With steady growth and usage by trusted financial organizations, we may be best served in the long run by accepting Ripple\u2019s ties as a necessary sacrifice for rapid mainstream consumer adoption of digital currencies as a whole.Unified by a shared goal, a future secured by the blockchainI\u2019m not ignoring the fact that this sounds like an endorsement for banks to take advantage of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain to their financial advantage. But the truth is, if a bank decided it wanted to build its own blockchain, there\u2019s nothing stopping it from doing so. In fact, I would be surprised if forward-thinking banks like Capital One weren\u2019t already developing one.If we of the Early Adopter crypto demographic truly believe that blockchain is the evolution of money, then our future will greatly benefit from any thoughtful development in the space. We should have faith in the foundations of decentralization baked into the technology and encourage mass adoption and experimentation.Adoption is gradual. It doesn\u2019t happen in the revolutionary style most crypto-purists portray. Alas, Twitter will be Twitter and forums will be forums. Crypto communities will continue to exist, endorsing some coins, and diminishing others. But chatter, too, is productive.To be better stewards of the blockchain revolution, people need to unify behind strong, meaningful blockchain technologies. It brings us leaps and bounds closer to a future where cryptocurrencies and blockchains are embedded in our daily transactions and interactions.Closing NoteAlthough I hold a position in XRP (as I do with many other alternative coins), I\u2019m a proponent of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain as a whole. I believe that the growth and success of projects like Ripple create a meaningful and positive impact on the progression of decentralized technologies.As with any new technology, people are resistive. But, with time, familiarity breeds comfortability. And while it may be difficult to equally appease all parties in the ecosystem, every ounce of work\u200a\u2014\u200awhether technical, regulatory, financial, or otherwise\u200a\u2014\u200ahelps to move the needle toward mainstream adoption and a more secure financial future backed by trust-less technologies.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Poorly executed innovations have ripple effects throughout an\u00a0industry", "author_name": "Jay Parkinson, MD, MPH", "link": "https://medium.com/@jayparkinson/poorly-executed-innovations-have-ripple-effects-throughout-an-industry-bf01e7092280?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 15, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "65", "content": "Poorly executed innovations have ripple effects throughout an\u00a0industryJay Parkinson, MD, MPHBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 15, 2017If someone has a terrible experience with something new, they\u2019ll be an outspoken hater.

Ripple (XRP) is distinguished from other things which share the same name by a qualifier such as \u201cRipple platform\u201d or \u201cRipple company\u201d. Ledger refers to the overall state of the system which is typically computed from but does not include the transaction history, analogous to Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO set.IntroductionHere I analyze how fit the Ripple (XRP) is to serve as a supranational electronic currency on the Ripple platform. This is assuming that the SEC does not declare Ripple (XRP) a security, banks actually use Ripple (XRP) on the Ripple platform, people actually also use Ripple (XRP) as an electronic currency, and Ripple (XRP) captures most of the economic value on the Ripple platform. The conclusion is that the Ripple platform is peacetime, low-stakes financial software not fit to serve as critical infrastructure of any kind. The issue at hand is that the Ripple platform works poorly in adversarial environments, and preventing a major attack vector compromises the benefits of decentralization entirely.Why the focus on Ripple (XRP) as a supranational currency?It\u2019s pretty widely acknowledged that Ripple\u2019s official strategy is adoption in the banking sector as a bridge asset. For banks to actually use Ripple, it needs a huge amount of liquidity, and that liquidity can\u2019t come from the banks.Need for constant liquidity: This is because slippage makes the price of traded assets (such as the bridge asset) extremely volatile at the moment of exchange especially if fulfilling multiple orders. Liquidity decreases slippage, and it also decreases price volatility when holding.This liquidity cannot come from banks: If it did, banks would be better off with a token they created, which would allow them to own 100% of the supply as well.So who supports Ripple\u2019s price, thereby creating that liquidity? The only way forward that I can see is if Ripple works as a general purpose cryptocurrency. This is not a particularly bad direction given that Ripple\u2019s market cap is currently about $19B, which is to say there is probably some real liquidity. For reasons that may or may not have to do with classification as a security, this happens to be how Ripple (XRP) is marketed now. And since we\u2019re talking about liquidity that can support the bulk of the world\u2019s banking, it needs to be a really, really successful cryptocurrency. With that in mind, the focus is on Ripple as a supranational currency.Some requirements for a global electronic currencyThis list is not exhaustive but we will find that these aspects are relevant to the discussion.FungibleThis means that units of money are indistinguishable. Fungability allows anyone to receive a payment and not concern themselves with whether others will discriminate against those tokens. If the true value of cash is not its nominal value, it increases mental transaction costs, adds considerable friction to end-users, and is ultimately less useful as a currency.Trust-minimizationTwo people who distrust each other must be able to engage in commerce.Censorship-resistantThis means that it is difficult to any entity to exclude transactions from being confirmed. This is analogous to freezing funds or preventing those funds from being used in certain ways.Resistant to theft or\u00a0burningUser balances should be treated like property rights since tokens are a bearer asset. The owner(s) alone should have control over their funds.Difficult to counterfeitCounterfeit money dilutes the relative purchasing power of everyone else who has stake in this system. For cryptocurrencies, creating tokens outside of the protocol is considered counterfeiting.One set of account\u00a0balancesThere must be one set of account balances that is shared by everyone. People who are mutually distrustful must be able to engage in commerce on the same ledger.ScalableAs the number of users grow and the value of the tokens appreciate, the system must be able to retain its core properties and function.Graceful failure\u00a0modesIf the security assumptions for consensus are no longer true, what happens? When an attack becomes possible, how expensive is it to make arbitrary changes?Ripple platform\u2019s failure\u00a0modesHow the Ripple ledger or consensus can be disrupted largely comes down to the behavior of trusted peers. As the Ripple company mentions, the system depends on these validators not colluding.During consensus, each node evaluates proposals from a specific set of peers, called chosen validators 6. Chosen validators represent a subset of the network which, when taken collectively, is \u201ctrusted\u201d not to collude in an attempt to defraud the node evaluating the proposals. [source]Denial of service\u00a0(DOS)With >20% of trusted validators disagree, service can be halted. Consensus requires that at least 80% of trusted validators agree. From the Ripple company whitepaper:Thus for a UNL of n nodes in the network, the consensus protocol will maintain correctness so long as: f \u2264 (n\u22121)/5 (1) where f is the number Byzantine failures. In fact, even in the face of (n\u22121)/5+1 Byzantine failures, correctness is still technically maintained. The consensus process will fail\u2026\u00a0[source]Consensus failing means that no transactions can be confirmed, making the system unusable. This does actually require that validators collude, as an attacker can knock validators offline with the same effect (unresponsiveness is considered a Byzantine failure).Rewriting state permanently\u200a\u2014\u200aexcluding or reordering historical transactionsNodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a supermajority of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash 8. Going forward, transactions are applied to this updated and now validated ledger with sequence number\u00a0N+1.In cases where a node is in the minority, having computed a ledger that differs from its peers, the node disregards the ledger it computed 9. It recomputes the correct ledger, or retrieves the correct ledger as\u00a0needed.If >80% of trusted validators collude, transaction history can be permanently reordered without violating consensus rules. With the Ripple platform, transaction history is relative. It\u2019s whatever your peers say it is. Much like Ethereum technically didn\u2019t violate consensus rules from the DAO incident, nobody is violating the Ripple platform\u2019s protocol by re-constructing a new ledger from existing transactions. And fully validating the ledger against all transaction history will not protect you.Rewriting state arbitrarily\u2014 violating consensus rulesIf >80% of trusted validators collude, they can break consensus rules, and these changes will be accepted by anyone who does not validate their history against this new ledger. This means they can mint funds, burn funds, and steal funds without any transactions needing to take place. This attack is only made possible against those who don\u2019t fully validate transaction history, which makes it extremely important that you only trust validators on the Ripple network who do full validation.Scaling implications\u200a\u2014\u200acritical infrastructureHere we assume that the Ripple platform is too big to fail, meaning preventing Ripple platform\u2019s failure modes is a top national priority. The primary threat model are foreign, coordinating countries disrupting consensus.Trust concentration\u200a\u2014\u200aDOS protectionRealistically the only ledger state that matters is among the people you do business with. There is no benefit to trusting people who are not within your economic confines because in the event of a dispute, only the ledger of your economy matters (not somebody halfway across the world). That is to say, trusting too many other validators could cause you to be forked out of your own economy. The larger the Ripple platform\u2019s contribution to the economy, the riskier a denial of service (DOS) attack becomes.At the right scale the security of the Ripple platform within national infrastructure come into question as an issue of national security. Trusting a node is not just a statement about their ledger but also about their ability to resist distributed denial of service attacks which could take them offline. Government efforts would be directed towards mitigating these failure modes. We can expect that government will run their own secure validators in their country, which would be considered authoritative for the uses of domestic banking. Governments would almost certainly mandate that no more than 20% of trust for domestic banks be directed towards validators not under government control to prevent this attack vector.Since validators can sometimes be offline for reasons unrelated to an attack, in practice banks might weight 85+% of their trust domestically.Trust concentration to comply with\u00a0lawRunning a validating node may expose the operator to legal risk. During consensus, nodes vote on which transactions they wish to confirm, and we can expect there to be restrictions on this vote can be exercised if this ledger controls the flow of serious money. It is entirely possible that validators which participate in consensus must register as financial service providers and comply with applicable regulation, regardless of who trusts them or not.At the right scale, the Ripple platform has geopolitical implications. We can reasonably expect the US government to require that validators contributing to consensus within their jurisdictions comply with international sanctions or law enforcement requests. The same holds true for every other jurisdiction. I see a few paths here:Delegate the entirety of your trust to domestic banks or government validators, which will only propagate legal transactions. This is fairly low maintenance.Use software which acts as a filter for transactions which may not be legal. This is higher maintenance as the determination of legal and suspicious transactions may be complex and constantly changing. I see this as out-of-reach for individuals who do not have a business reason for this.Do not participate in consensus, which means your validator is a tracking node.It would be trivial for law enforcement to enforce any policies that relate to consensus as they can connect to validators and view this data in real time. While the way I described how this could play out isn\u2019t guaranteed, it is clearly within the reach of government to do things this way as the actual number of validators is fairly small, within 200 as of recently. For comparison, Bitcoin has about 10,000 listening nodes as of now which support the network.Governments can alter domestic\u00a0ledgersEarlier I discussed how <20% of trust will be weighted to validators outside of government control to prevent DOS attacks on domestic infrastructure. As it were, this means that government can control >80% of the weighted trust which is the necessary minimum to rewrite state and even violate consensus rules.Government and law enforcement will have an interest in censoring transactions, freezing accounts, and possibly even inflating the supply as a source of revenue. This would be true even if they didn\u2019t control a supermajority of trust domestically, but in this case they happen to. Governments will change the ledger as much as they can get away with, and that state will propagate to all ledgers who transitively trust them.Ledger fragmentationWhile many people may not directly trust government validators, they have no choice but to trust those they do business with. For most people they will trust businesses, retail banks, and friends. Businesses will trust major business partners, and their banks. Banks will trust their government. Government trusts themselves.Due to the pattern of trust concentration, changes to the ledger within a jurisdiction\u2019s nodes will propagate locally but won\u2019t propagate to other hubs of trust (e.g. other jurisdictions). So each country will have their own separate ledger, and the differences between ledgers will increase over time.This presents a large problem for anyone who must do international business in this low-trust environment. Ironically, Ripple (XRP) was meant for international settlements, but as we can see this does not work well across separate hubs of trust and what separates those hubs are national borders.No such thing as a global\u00a0ledgerProvided that national infrastructure protects against DOS attacks, any kind of transaction censorship within a hub will fragment the ledger permanently.It\u2019s possible that we can get around this by partitioning the address space into separate countries, each of which make the determination of which transactions are permissible, but this incompatible with the protocol as it exists. It\u2019s possible we can get around this by having each country issue their own tokens, but countries will still want to censor Ripple (XRP) as it pertains to sanctions or criminal investigations, so we are back to our original problem.Practically speaking, there is no way we can get around this as it\u2019s not what the Ripple platform was designed to handle. Ripple platform was meant to work only within hubs of trust, not across separate, mutually distrustful hubs.Once a ledger fragments, there is no general way to reconcile it without dropping the transaction history altogether. We can expect that the Ripple ledger and assets would be an asset denoted by its national confines. Such as XRP-US, XRP-China, XRP-Russia. The same private key would have different economic values in different jurisdictions due to inflation of the supply, government stability, etc. Cross-border exchange would be difficult.No use for a counterparty-less assetThe token Ripple (XRP) draws its main benefit from being an asset without a counterparty. With a fragmented ledger, each fork controlled by some government, there is no additional benefit of XRP over fiat.Scaling implications\u200a\u2014\u200anon-critical infrastructureWhile not the focus of this article, I think it\u2019s helpful to go over how the Ripple platform would function as non-critical infrastructure, because it still has some pretty significant limitations. Here we assume the Ripple platform is not related to national security, so the threat model becomes any single jurisdiction disrupting consensus, including friendly ones. Domestic banking would not take place on the Ripple ledger.Trust dissipation\u200a\u2014\u200aDOS protectionMaintaining a single global ledger requires that we not delegate trust at more than 20% to any single group which might be likely to collude. Since collusion is most likely within national borders we must be sure not to not trust any single nation at more than 20%. This means that >80% of our trust must be to jurisdictions outside of our own.Coordinating governments can censor transactions, freeze accounts, or stop the\u00a0networkGovernments are known to coordinate with each other for political purposes. Crossing the 20% line for global trust will come down to at most 39 countries (which would be an equal allocation of trust to each jurisdiction). Taking a look at intergovernmental organizations is pretty clear evidence that this level of cooperation is possible. While you may not assign trust to a government, everyone is beholden to their governments and must follow their laws. This is to say that governments ultimately have control over how their validators will behave.Intergovernmental cooperation is common. For example, NATO has 29 member states. The United Nations has 193 member states. The European Union has 28 member states. The International Monetary Fund has 189 members. The European Central Bank has 19 EU member states. Interpol has 192 member countries. The World Trade Organization has 164 member states. Only one or two large intergovernmental organizations need to cooperate to halt consensus.To be realistic, sovereignty isn\u2019t distributed equally among the 193 countries in existence. Some countries have extensive ability to exert influence or project power on global scale, and they are referred to as potential superpowers. The most commonly mentioned ones are United States, European Union, China, India, Russia, and Brazil. This is to say there is not a whole lot of benefit to delegating trust outside of these potential superpowers, as they ultimately will have power over the smaller, less powerful countries. One or two of these major powers coordinating could halt consensus.Coordinating governments could counterfeit Ripple at the right\u00a0priceIf the Ripple markets were large and robust enough, it would be within the interests of all governments to come together and mint Ripple. In this way they would treat the Ripple network as their own central bank at the right price. While governments can easily print more fiat, inflating the supply of Ripple could give them an easy way of generating money without it affecting the exchange rate of their fiat.Since each country must balance minting money and destabilizing their local currency, minting Ripple would be a much more attractive proposition because they are unlikely to face the negative externalities in the same way. I am guessing the motive would be there when the average nation would stand to gain $100 million, which be about $20 billion inflation worldwide.A low-trust environment can cause ledger fragmentationIf there is an international incident, such as a cold or hot war, we can expect that the highly connected web of trust globally will partition. The cold war was a 45 year period of geopolitical tension between at least two world superpowers. Trust must be distributed widely for there to be a single ledger, and low-trust environment can encourage people to delegate trust in such a way that prioritizes the security of their local network. This creates hubs of trust which won\u2019t allow fragmented ledgers to reconcile across the hubs.Less overall demand for Ripple\u00a0assetsThere is little reason to hold assets on a platform outside of what is necessary to fulfill a task. Keeping more money than necessary on the platform is, if anything, a decision of convenience regarding the expected near-term future use of the platform\u2019s services. Since we\u2019re assuming the Ripple platform does not facilitate much of the world\u2019s commerce, we can expect less demand for Ripple assets.Returning to those requirements for global electronic currencyThere are two scenarios to consider: Ripple platform as critical and non-critical infrastructure.Fungible1/5\u200a\u2014\u200aCritical infrastructure: The ledger will fragment as governments have the interest and ability to make arbitrary changes to the ledger which will propagate within national borders according to the protocol. Ripple assets are not guaranteed to have the same nominal value or even relative purchasing power across borders. That government can easily freeze or confiscate funds makes dirty coins or coins without a provably clean history even more risky to accept.3/5\u200a\u2014\u200aNon-critical infrastructure: Provided there are no periods of international tension, there will likely be a single ledger that won\u2019t be tampered. This is to say that the tokens will have the same nominal value and relative purchasing power across jurisdictions.Trust-minimizationTwo people who don\u2019t trust each other can engage in commerce only when they share the same hub of trust. Specifically, 80% of each person\u2019s trusted validator set must overlap if they wish to engage in commerce without service interruptions and >50% overlap is required to ensure they are guaranteed to use the same ledger. There is no way to verify that your trusted validator set overlaps with someone you are engaging in commerce with as UNLs are private.1/5\u200a\u2014\u200aCritical infrastructure: Same level of trust as fiat (everyone trusts their govt).2/5\u200a\u2014\u200aNon-critical infrastructure: Less trust required than fiat but two mutually distrustful people trust the same collection of entities, akin to a consortium. There is no good way to verify that there is sufficient trust overlap.Censorship-resistant1/5\u200a\u2014\u200aCritical infrastructure: Since >20% of trust is given to government either directly or transitively so transactions can be prevented and funds effectively frozen. Governments can also require all other domestic validators to adhere to blacklists or whitelists.1/5\u200a\u2014\u200aNon-critical infrastructure: Cooperating governments can easily halt consensus and prevent the movement of funds.Resistant to theft or\u00a0burning1/5\u200a\u2014\u200aCritical infrastructure: Governments will have >80% of weighted trust which allows them to make arbitrary ledger changes including inflating the overall supply.3/5\u200a\u2014\u200aNon-critical infrastructure: Funds are unlikely to be stolen since it requires large-scale intergovernmental cooperation. However, the indefinite freezing of funds is logically equivalent to funds being burned, and this requires a level of cooperation within reach (>20% of weighted trust).Difficult to counterfeit1/5\u200a\u2014\u200aCritical infrastructure: Governments will have >80% of weighted trust which allows them to make arbitrary ledger changes including inflating the overall supply.2/5\u200a\u2014\u200aNon-critical infrastructure: If the Ripple markets were large and robust enough, governments could easily come together to counterfeit Ripple as they control validators within their jurisdictions. Such an act would be mutually beneficial to all governments and could occur if the markets could support $20 billion inflation.One set of account\u00a0balances1/5\u200a\u2014\u200aCritical infrastructure: The ledger is very likely to fragment across mutually distrustful hubs of trust. The level of fragmentation is likely to be somewhere between the number of global superpowers to the number of separate countries. Mutually distrustful people who don\u2019t share the same hub of trust cannot engage in commerce on the same ledger.3/5\u200a\u2014\u200aNon-critical infrastructure: One ledger, provided no periods of international tension. If there is a cold or hot war, the ledger is likely to fragment.ScalableThe Ripple platform scales extremely poorly when it comes to censorship-resistance. Regarding counterfeiting, the platform scales well up until the point where it\u2019s worth the cooperation of governments to treat the platform as a central bank. Regarding fragmentation, the platform only works in peacetime environments, but scales well until the point where it becomes too big to fail.Graceful failure\u00a0modesThe failure modes are extremely bad and once those security assumptions are no longer true, attacks are free beyond this point. With full validation, the transaction history can be re-ordered in any way, causing transactions to disappear or appear in an inconsistent order. Without validation, the ledger can be changed in arbitrary ways that violate the protocol such as inflating the supply, altering balances, and burning money.ConclusionRipple platform is peacetime, low-stakes financial software for groups who trust the same entities. There is no way to fully protect against denial of service attacks without giving some group the power to make arbitrary changes to the ledger at no cost. As a global currency, Ripple would not survive a cold war without severe fragmentation. During a hot war, Ripple would fail entirely.As a supranational currency, Ripple (XRP) provides no advantages over fiat. If Ripple platform becomes too big to fail then DOS attacks would be prevented by delegating >80% of trust to government, which gives them complete control of the ledger within their borders. This means Ripple assets fragment for each national government. Since governments have the desire and opportunity to freeze funds, censor transactions, and inflate the supply, we can expect them to do just that. Cross border, Ripple is not guaranteed to have the same nominal value or relative purchasing power.As a supranational currency it\u2019s important to have a single set of account balances, something strongly resistant to government control, and something which can survive adversarial environments.

To be noted, that each Ripple transaction has a fee, which is eventually being destroyed. This implies that the fee is not paid to anyone. Bitcoin(BTC) transaction fees, on the other hand, are paid as a reward to the miner to include a transaction in a block formation.Ripple has solidified its position in the top 5 cryptocurrency list and is almost as well known as Bitcoin. Regardless if Ripple becomes the number one blockchain-for-banks or not, there are plenty of other applications for its technology. Unlike Bitcoin, it is business friendly as it complies with regulation. While Bitcoin relies on user adoption, Ripple is aiming for more widespread adoption in daily commerce. This makes it more attractive to investors that view cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as vulnerable to future regulatory battles and therefore not likely to be adopted for general commerce.#3As with all altcoins, Ripple still resides under the shadow of Bitcoin in terms of daily trading volume. That\u2019s because Bitcoin is the most exchanged and offered cryptocurrency in the world. Where Bitcoin is offered on local exchanges, in persons and in ATMs, Ripple exchanges are limited to the following reputable sources: Poloniex, Bittrex, Kraken, Jubi, Bter, Anxpro and some other lesser know exchanges.#4Acceptance Ratio is high for Bitcoin as compared to Ripple. Inspite of Ripple falling under the list of decentralized cryptocurrency, we find that cryptocurrency debit cards don\u2019t accept Ripple as readily as Bitcoin. All in all, Ripple is great for banking infrastructures to connect worldwide, whereas Bitcoin is suitable for all sorts of different use cases.#5Bitcoin has an unparalleled amount of different wallet options. However, you\u2019ll find that Ripple has a few different wallet types to use as well. Rippex, for example, is a well respected desktop wallet.Last, but not the least, Ripple value in USD is far less than bitcoin. As of now, Ripple token(XRP) price is $0.5244 & Bitcoin (BTC) price is $ 6655.44.Which is good for long term investment?Ripple has certainly gained a lot of momentum and the list of organizations which are using it indicates that the tokens themselves will become valued commodities in their own right. In fact, last year, the increase in value of one XRP token outperformed Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.At the start of 2017 one XRP was valued $0.006. They peaked, at the start of this year, at $3.87, before quickly crashing down to their current value of around $1 per XRPXRP are traded on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Poloniex. Usually, it isn\u2019t possible to buy them with existing government-issued (fiat) currencies\u200a\u2014\u200ayou will have to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first, then transfer them to an exchange to trade them for XRP.The Bitcoin price changes a lot every day and has seen many highs and lows over the last few years. The price of 1 Bitcoin has gone from around $76 (07.09.13) to as high as $20,000 in December 2017. But then after Bitcoin reached its highest point in December, the price of Bitcoin dropped to around $6000 in February 2018.It\u2019s revolving around the $6000 mark.It\u2019s crazy!Considering that Ripple is largely governed by a central body, it is hard to argue that it is more secure than the most mined cryptocurrency in the world- Bitcoin.In cryptographic terms, its centralized nature makes transaction reversals far more likely than in the case of Bitcoin.Bitcoin, with it\u2019s current +2000$ USD price, has a massive lead over Ripple, which still trades well under the 1$ mark. So the winner here really is a no-brainer.The Bitcoin Bridge is a link between the Ripple and Bitcoin networks. The bridge makes it possible to pay any Bitcoin user directly from a Ripple account without ever needing to hold any bitcoin.Any merchant accepting bitcoin has the potential to accept any currency in the world. If a Ripple user prefers to keep money in USD and not own bitcoins, a merchant however, may desire payment in bitcoin. The Bitcoin Bridge allows any Ripple user to send bitcoins without having to use a central exchange.Hence, Bitcoin after such fluctuations also is a warrior and no other currency can match with its upheaval.In the long run, Bitcoin is going to prove beneficial as per sources.

Our firm has been studying and analyzing Ripple for the better part of its lifespan. In this piece, I will examine some of the challenges facing Ripple, its potential for future expansion and try to sieve out the wheat from the chaff when it comes to the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.Every day, companies and consumers send over US$76 billion in payments through a dizzying array of banks and financial intermediaries. From correspondent banks to issuing banks, the financial services which support payment flows are a vast web of nodes and networks, each demanding their own slice of the action as money flows through the veins of global commerce. Without this flow, dockworkers don\u2019t get paid and cargoes don\u2019t get loaded\u200a\u2014\u200athe letters of credit (instrumental to global commerce\u200a\u2014\u200abecause nobody trusts anyone) which are key to trade flows have ensured that our modern way of life as we know it gets done. Yet for the better part of a decade, Ripple, a San Francisco-based company claimed to one-up this inefficient and sometimes archaic system by leveraging the blockchain technology underpinning Bitcoin to create what it called the \u201cinternet of value.\u201d Ripple, in the cryptosphere is a veritable institution in that sense. It has survived numerous cryptocurrency routs and is just slightly younger than Bitcoin itself and far older than Ethereum. From late Fall last year to early January this year, Ripple saw an eye-watering 1,300% jump in the value of its digital token, with many hopping aboard the Ripple train on the basis that unlike other cryptocurrencies, Ripple had a narrowly defined purpose and a clear utility\u200a\u2014\u200ato help banks move cash from one point to another faster and more cheaply\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly across borders.But as anyone who has worked with banks will attest, the pace of change within these institutional behemoths is glacial (in fact thanks to climate change glaciers are likely to change faster these days). According to one senior executive at a large multinational bank who declined to be named,\u201cRepresentatives from the company (Ripple) came by earlier in the year and while their technology and value proposition was good, we did not get the go ahead for adoption from legal. We did agree to a trial.\u201dBut that detail didn\u2019t stop Ripple from subsequently announcing a partnership with the said bank at the time, one which they had to step back from subsequently. Part of the reason for the reluctance for banks to accept Ripple is ironically trust. The blockchain was meant to create a \u201ctrustless\u201d ecosystem that would negate the requirement for trusted intermediaries to facilitate transactions. But current and former executives at several global banks, some of which agreed to partner with Ripple to trial the cryptocurrency say that there is little chance they would ever entrust their corporate clients\u2019 payments to a privately-held cryptocurrency. According to Ripple\u2019s website, in January this year, the company held 61 billion of 100 billion available Ripple tokens, with most held in escrow so as not to be sold in excessively large amounts which would tank the value of Ripple. If one of the main arguments against fiat currencies is central bank manipulation, the same argument can be used against Ripple as well. Quite apart from creating a \u201ctrustless\u201d ecosystem\u200a\u2014\u200athe raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aRipple merely substitutes several trusted intermediaries with a single one\u200a\u2014\u200aitself.Ripple founder and man who\u2019s wondering if you put mayo in his sandwich, Brad Garlinghouse.Then there\u2019s RippleNet, which is targeted at the Brussels-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication\u200a\u2014\u200abetter known as SWIFT\u200a\u2014\u200aa messaging system used for the control of money flows across the planet. SWIFT was famously hacked (several times) and today connects around 11,000 financial companies. RippleNet doesn\u2019t need Ripple\u2019s digital token XRP to work, but it was hoped that XRP would become a key ingredient in the mix. For instance as an intermediary currency akin to the dollar. Today if you want to convert Afghan afghanis to South Korean won, you\u2019d first need to swap out to dollars\u200a\u2014\u200athe idea being that XRP could serve as that bridge. The value proposition was that instead of tying up money in various different currencies in accounts at other banks, with the attendant hassles and expense, XRP could do the job. But that sort of also misses the point. Now instead of a disparate bunch of currencies (which may or may not have value), banks would essentially be centralizing their currency risk by holding deposits of XRP. But at least the technology underpinning RippleNet seems to be sound (for now). More than a handful of banks have signed up to the network and Ripple has even managed to sell equity stakes in itself to Standard Chartered and Banco Santander. But of the over 100 banks which have signed up, only Swedish bank Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken is moving commercial payments over to RippleNet. Over a year ago, Standard Chartered started a program to allow payments between Singapore (a fintech hub) and India using RippleNet for its corporate clients and Banco Santander\u2019s U.K. division tested an international payment using Ripple\u2019s technology which allowed an international money transfer to be executed in mere seconds. Although neither bank has indicated they will use XRP anytime soon, they remain optimistic about Ripple\u2019s technology and understandably so as they have directly invested in it as well.But Ripple is far from alone in its innovation. Other companies such as TransferWise are also tackling the issue of global payment networks as is SWIFT itself, which despite the hackings, released its own major upgrade called Global Payments Innovation or GPI which allows corporate clients to make payments in hours as opposed to days and to track the money flows the same way DHL would track a parcel. Add to that SWIFT is already a trusted network used by banks and approved by compliance departments and Ripple has its work cut out for it. GPI already has 36 banks using it to make over US$1 billion in cross-border payments and while Ripple may argue that SWIFT is merely trying to speed up an already slow system, at the very minimum, hours versus minutes starts to matter very little when a ship travels less than 50 miles an hour anyway. Efficiency arguments work\u200a\u2014\u200ato a point. The reality is that while it may be preferable to have instant cross-border money transfers, there are plenty of counter-examples when you may either not require that level of urgency or perhaps not desire that level of efficiency.\u201cWait you mean this isn\u2019t the line for Hamilton tickets?\u201dAnd even if plucky bankers were willing to roll the dice on Ripple, their compliance departments were there to stop the roll. Because Ripple has yet to be approved by regulators (who move at an even more glacial pace) bank compliance departments could never allow them to risk cross-border payments using the digital stuff. And approval is unlikely to be forthcoming for a variety of reasons, chief among which is that approval would be a tacit endorsement of Ripple\u2019s business model and could potentially be perceived as as government-sanctioned currency\u200a\u2014\u200asomething a central bank or regulator would be hard put to do\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially for a private company. Though that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not been done before. During the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the government stood behind private companies and stumped up for their debts to preserve the integrity of the entire financial system. But those were dire circumstances, Ripple\u2019s argument is far weaker in comparison. Efficiency is hardly a pressing need.Finally, there is the age-old (or at least as old as the cryptocurrency industry) problem with the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. In January this year, Ripple\u2019s XRP was worth about US$2.92, today it\u2019s worth US$0.35\u200a\u2014\u200ahardly the stuff of stability and a far cry from its intended use as a replacement for the dollar for facilitating transactions. And it adds an unnecessary layer of headaches for both compliance departments as well as bankers. That Ripple is the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency today by market cap is more a testament to its value as a speculative investment tool, rather than as a serious contender to existing global money network solutions.And it is in trying to be all things to all people that perhaps is where Ripple\u2019s greatest challenge lies. It is at once both payment network and cryptocurrency, regardless of the internal divorce, the two will be closely associated from an external optics perspective and depending on the state of cryptocurrencies and their legal status, will no doubt weigh on potential adopters considerations. In terms of technology, banks and other financial institutions are already exploring blockchain-driven solutions which do not require a native cryptocurrency. Countries from China to Uruguay are toying with the idea of central bank-issued digital currencies, which would effectively negate the value of a privately held cryptocurrency to facilitate transfers. And finally, Ripple misses the point of decentralization. With its outsize holding of its own digital token, XRP, banks would be derelict in their duty of care to their clients to concentrate risk within a single point of failure. Decentralization itself is a benefit, not a feature. And if the only value to be had from adopting Ripple is re-centralization and efficiency, then the efficiency benefits pale in comparison to the increased risks undertaken.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Stefan Thomas", "link": "https://medium.com/@justmoon/yes-xrp-is-cheaper-faster-and-more-liquid-than-other-currencies-so-in-the-kind-of-interoperable-3534dd3f3fb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 6, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "15", "content": "Stefan ThomasBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 6, 2018Yes, XRP is cheaper, faster, and more liquid than other currencies, so in the kind of interoperable world that we\u2019re trying to create with Interledger and Codius, I expect a lot more people would use it.Interoperability also paves the way for blockchain to go mainstream.

There has been a lot of buzz about the future of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and all the potential these new paradigms have to change the world. From changing how the world does business, to changing the way individuals handle their money and investments, cryptocurrency has already had a big effect on modern-day society and had even more impact on the developing nations.Not everyone shares the excitement and optimism about cryptocurrency, though. Some are concerned about dangers of fraud and what decentralized, digital currencies could mean. Others aren\u2019t as worried about the cryptocurrency itself, but are more concerned with the saturation of the market, the ability of certain cryptocurrencies to withstand crashes, and the effect that crashes will have on some economies. Others have even warned about crashes, but believe that it will actually be a good thing in the long-run and will have a positive impact on the economy in the end.In early January, a number of cryptocurrencies experienced a downturn, including Ripple. While it\u2019s still yet to be determined whether cryptocurrencies will continue to fall, what effect this crash will have on our economy, there is no shortage of concerns and opinions being shared across the Internet. With so much information out there and so many people discussing the subject, we decided to narrow it down to the top three most engaging, liked, and disliked articles, and the top three most liked and disliked comments on the subject. With articles and pieces from before the crash and through now, we were able to get a better idea of what it was that people were excited about, what it is that they agree with, and more.To get this information, we used SolidOpinion\u2019s Comment 1000 technology to mine reader commentary on sites across the web from January 5th through January 12th 2018. Here\u2019s what the comment technology gleaned:Top Three Most Engaging\u00a0PiecesThe top three most engaging pieces were all threads on Reddit, under the Daily Ripple/XRP Discussion Thread. They were always posted by an AutoModerator, and covered the topics of Questions and Price Predictions.Daily Ripple/XRP Discussion Thread 01/03/18 [Questions and Price Predictions]. This Reddit Discussion Thread received 128 upvotes and 1,670 comments, with a count of 1,300.Daily Ripple/XRP Discussion Thread 01/04/18 [Questions and Price Predictions].

This Reddit Discussion Thread received 96 upvotes and 1,431 comments, with a count of 1,138.Top Three Most Liked\u00a0PiecesThe top three most liked pieces were all threads on Reddit, all started before the Ripple crash. One shows the support for a Reddit user when they shared the news that they became a Ripple millionaire (which has since been removed) while another simply discusses Ripple\u2019s standing, and the last demands an explanation to chatter they\u2019ve been hearing (which has also been removed).I just became a Ripple millionaire.

This thread received 540 dislikes.Top Engaging\u00a0DomainsDespite widespread media coverage of Ripple and cryptocurrencies, Reddit, YouTube, and news.bitcoin.com all secured more engagement than other prominent sites like TechCrunch and Marketwatch. Reddit threads pertaining to Ripple secured over 50,000 engagements, followed by YouTube with 2,900 engagements. Reddits dominance in sparking conversation on Ripple and cryptocurrency is fitting. Reddit contributors respond to one another, rather than the singular voice of an outlet or editor, thus creating a massive conversation.Consumers are still trying to make sense of how cryptocurrency fits into their lives and it makes sense that consumer-driven threads are fueling global discussion.Additionally, the most engaging articles also belong to Reddit. For a form of currency built on a decentralized ledger system, the conversation that is following is also taking place on forums and sites that are not driven by singular owners. These websites empower individuals to step forward and offer their own contributions.As cryptocurrencies grow increasingly prolific, it will be interesting to track whether these conversations remain on websites that are designed to encourage individual content creators to share their voices, or if audiences will begin to engage more with mainstream media coverage of cryptocurrency.SentimentIn addition to tracking individual comments and engagements, SolidOpinion\u2019s technology can also determine sentiment across the web. From January 4th-January 11th, as coverage of Ripple rolled out, consumer response to these stories remained largely positive at 58.6%. While positive sentiment does not necessarily indicate consumer trust in Ripple or even the coin\u2019s future success, it may however reveal that despite the dramatic drop of this coin, consumer interest level in cryptocurrency is still piqued.What\u2019s so interesting about the Internet\u2019s reaction to Ripple\u2019s unsteady valuation is, that even though rates have plummeted, and although the long-term effects of Ripple\u2019s market crash and the future of cryptocurrency may not be entirely certain, it\u2019s clear that in spite of unsteady valuation and murky future, consumers across the web are still displaying interests regarding the potential of cryptocurrencies\u200a\u2014\u200awhether they are Ripple, Bitcoin, or other emerging Coins\u200a\u2014\u200ato transform how we create and distribute money.No one can predict how the next few months will turn out for Bitcoin and other decentralized tokens, but we do know that consumers increasingly invested in tracking the viabilities of established and emerging coins. As a democratized form of currency, the future success of digital coins hinges on consumer awareness, and ultimately trust, which can only be cultivated through ongoing conversation.What do you think will happen with cryptocurrency going forward? How do you think it will affect the economy?", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "In response to an article about\u00a0Ripple.", "author_name": "Tiffany Hayden", "link": "https://medium.com/@haydentiff/in-response-to-an-article-about-ripple-f986627b96fa?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 9, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "8", "content": "In response to an article about\u00a0Ripple.Tiffany HaydenBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 9, 2017The entire article was inaccurate. I took a few notes.\u201cRipple is not an Open Blockchain. Individuals can\u2019t get full access to the Ripple Network.\u201dNot being able to figure out how to use the network isn\u2019t the same as not having full access. Sorry.Ripple is an open source protocol. Anyone can access it and everyone has an equal right to use it. Ripple, the company, does not control the network, collect fees, or limit access.\u201cThrough some effort, users can go download a wallet and transfer Ripple to it, but you have to create trust lines with other organizations in order to get access. In this way, you can\u2019t just send money to whomever you want, they have to accept you as trustworthy before allowing transactions.\u201dXRP doesn\u2019t require trust. It exists natively on the Ripple network as a counter-free currency, similar to Bitcoin. You can send XRP to anyone with a ripple account.IOUs are another component of the Ripple network. IOUs imply trust. Users decide who to trust, if they decide to accept IOUs. Trust lines must be created in order to accept an IOU. You can only be owed money from someone who you have agreed to let hold money for you.In Ripple, not all IOUs are equal. There could be many issuers offering $USD. One issuer could be the Bank of America and another could be a guy named Bob. It\u2019s up to the user to decide who to trust. Will it be easier/safer to redeem an IOU through the Bank of America, or a guy named Bob? Nobody can be forced to trust anybody else or forced to accept an IOU. Sorry Bob.\u201cXRP is not a cryptocurrency in the Traditional Sense.When Bitcoin and Ethereum were originally created, their cryptocurrencies, BTC and ETH, were designed to be stores of value.\u201dBitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP form a core part of their blockchains and each are a part of an incentive scheme. Bitcoin incentivizes miners to validate transactions and create blocks. XRP creates a small cost per transaction which acts as an anti-spam mechanism. It prevents ledger spam and transaction spam, which help make the network less vulnerable to attacks.\u201cXRP was mined all at once\u201dThere are no mined coins in Ripple. There is no mining system of any kind.\u201cAll XRP was created to be destroyed and if the network lives long enough, will be destroyed.\u201dThe transaction fee is\u00a0.00001 XRP and there are 100 billion XRP in existence. If the Ripple network takes over the world and it starts to look like minuscule transaction fees could cause XRP to completely vanish, another decimal could be added so that the fee is less.\u201cXRP has unique properties and a special use case that does not fit into the traditional cryptocurrency paradigm.\u201dXRP is a cryptographically secured digital asset with verifiable mathematical properties, similar to how we can reliably verify gold as a substance made of atoms with 79 protons.Ripple transactions typically settle in three to five seconds and the network is able to sustain nearly 1000 transactions per second. (An XRP Payment Channel allows transaction throughput to increase to tens of thousands of transactions per second, bringing scalability to the same level as Visa.)\u201cThe majority of the currency is controlled by the Ripple Foundation.\u201dThat\u2019s not a thing.\u201cThe Founders of Ripple Recommend Not Investing in Their Currency\u201dXRP is a digital asset that is independent of the company, Ripple, and existed before the company was created. The company is a holder of XRP and, like all rational XRP holders, the company has a strong interest in fostering a healthy ecosystem and a robust liquid market for XRP.Additional information regarding XRP and the Ripple protocol can be found here.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Exchange issues with Destination tags, Memos and\u00a0Messages", "author_name": "Changelly Team", "link": "https://medium.com/@Changelly/issues-xrp-xem-steem-dct-xlm-1d0a1c4d5114?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 24, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "11", "content": "Exchange issues with Destination tags, Memos and\u00a0MessagesChangelly TeamBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 24, 2018The crypto industry as a whole is full of techy and complicated things that may confuse you. Some of 90+ currencies we support require different measures to take before exchanging them. Over 70% stuck transactions happen due to negligence of these measures. We will take a closer look at common mistakes happening during the exchange process and sort out the possible aftermath. Let\u2019s look into issues occurring with Ripple\u2019s destination tags, NEM\u2019s messages and memos in Steem, Stellar and Decent.Destination tags, Memos and\u00a0MessagesIf you\u2019ve ever sent Ripple, Steem, Stellar, Decent or XEM to Changelly, you are likely to know about Destination tags, Memos and Messages. These are short combinations of digits and letters that help us determine your payment and send exchanged money to a \u2018recipient\u2019s address\u2019 you put in when creating a transaction. If they are specified incorrectly, your transaction may get stuck in Limbo or go to another Changelly user.Destination tagDestination tag is used in Ripple transactions. It is the most tricky thing you should be extremely careful with. If you send Ripple to Changelly, you should specify a destination tag when sending. The generated tag is tied to the recipient\u2019s address, so that Changelly automatically sends money to that address, once it gets confirmation from the blockchain. If you mix up digits in the tag or put in a random combination, you may encounter quite frustrating issues. Your money will be sent to Changelly, but your transaction won\u2019t go through due to the error, and you will have to contact our support team and ask them to process your transaction manually. Another, and the worst, scenario is that you may occasionally send your Ripples to an unknown person whose recipient\u2019s address is already tied to the tag you specified. In this case, we can\u2019t help you out.ExampleJohn is about to exchange Ripple to Bitcoin. Let\u2019s say his transaction is already created and he should send us Ripples to exchange them. He sees a screen below:John opens his wallet app, puts in our wallet address. And then, when putting in the destination tag, John is like: \u201dAh, whatever, I\u2019ll put 12345 instead! Anyway, it\u2019s still Changelly\u2019s address. The tag is unnecessary stuff.\u201dThis is the very moment John makes a terrible mistake, because 12345 is the tag tied to a wallet address of another Changelly user who is obviously not John! Once XRP is sent it will go to the wallet address provided by that user, and John will lose his money forever! The worst thing is that we can\u2019t help John in this case, since we don\u2019t control funds sent to our customers.Poor John. Don\u2019t be like him and always send Ripples with a correct destination tag. Only in this case your transaction will pass through in the right way.MessageThe NEM\u2019s message as such is quite confusing. While sending XEM to Changelly, some of users omit it or take too literally sending something like \u2018I love Changelly\u2019, \u2018Greetings from Germany\u2019 or \u2018This is my first salary\u2019. Instead, the NEM\u2019s message represents a combination of letters and digits shorter than a wallet and works the same way as Ripple\u2019s destination tag. If you omit it or specify incorrectly, your transaction will not pass through. You will have to send to our support team a request, so that we can process your stuck transaction manually.This is how the message looks like.Don\u2019t omit it, don\u2019t confuse it, and you\u2019ll always get your transaction done.MemoMemo is unique supplementary information used in transactions with a range of cryptos listed on Changelly, such as Steem, Stellar and Decent. Although Memo works similarly in all these platforms, it is important to mention that they utilize different algorithms. For all of them, entering Memo is a mandatory measure. When sending either, you must indicate your memo, so that our machine will know that the transaction comes from you. If the memo is omitted or incorrect\u2026 well, now you know the outcome. Changelly will have to process your transaction in a correct way. It requires you to report us about the issue.Steem\u2019s memos look like the combination below. So do memos of Stellar and Decent.Please bear in mind that the screenshots above are just an example. All Destination tags, Messages and Memos are unique for each our user. Never use the given examples for your own transactions.Recipient\u2019s addresses of Ripple, NEM and\u00a0SteemSimilarly, when buying Ripple, NEM, Steem or Decent on Changelly, make sure if you need to input either a Destination tag, Memo or Message to receive your coins to a recepient\u2019s wallet. Always provide this information, if required. Otherwise your money will be sent as an unassigned transaction to your wallet provider, and you will have to contact their support team trying hard to prove that the transaction belongs to you.Have any questions?

Fugger was obsessed with the idea of creating a decentralised payment system that would provide people with a secure way of transferring payments all over the world.In only a few years, with Christian Larsen joining the team, the project has grown to become a reliable service designed specifically for banks and payment providers and has received mass adoption at the bank level in many countries all over the world. UniCredit, UBS and Santander are just a few big names that are associated with Ripple.Now that cryptocurrencies are on the rise, XRP has gained much popularity along with others. However, many people still have no idea what makes Ripple different from other cryptocurrency-related projects and how it can be applicable in daily life. Let\u2019s find out the answers to these questions.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, April\u00a016", "author_name": "P2P Solutions Foundation", "link": "https://medium.com/@p2ps/bitcoin-ethereum-bitcoin-cash-ripple-stellar-litecoin-cardano-neo-eos-price-analysis-fc8fb00868a1?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 16, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "1", "content": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, April\u00a016P2P Solutions FoundationBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 16, 2018PRICE ANALYSISThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Have the cryptocurrencies bottomed out or will they fall again after a short pullback? That is the question troubling most of the market participants currently sitting on the fence.A bottom can be confirmed only in hindsight but the analysts try to call it in advance, using various tools.One such prediction is from the virtual currency focused hedge fund, Pantera Capital Management. Its CEO, Dan Morehead believes that Bitcoin\u2019s low of $6,500 is probably the bottom. But, why should we take this prediction seriously?Because, in December of last year, Morehead had forecast that Bitcoin might fall 50 percent, and that is exactly what happened. Also, he is not known to make too many predictions. Morehead expects Bitcoin to rally above $20,000 by the end of the year.He is not alone in forecasting a recovery for the leading virtual currency. Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee has called a target of $25,000 on Bitcoin for this year.Business magnate Tim Draper has projected a target of $250,000 for Bitcoin by 2022. Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on digital currencies has seconded Draper\u2019s forecast.BTC/USDWe had mentioned in our previous analysis that Bitcoin will face resistance at the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and that is what happened. For the past two days, the virtual currency has been struggling to cross the 50-day SMA. Today, the price has turned down.We expect the 20-day EMA to act as a strong support on any decline. Both moving averages have turned flat, which points to a range formation in the short term, instead of a trending move.The support of the range is likely to be $6,757.26. The resistance of the range is still not final because if the bulls break above the 50-day SMA, the next move will carry the BTC/USD pair to $9,400 levels.Our view will be invalidated if the lows of $6700 break. Under that condition, a retest of the February 06 lows of $6075.04 will be on the cards.Traders can continue to hold their long positions with the stop loss at $6700.ETH/USDWe had expected Ethereum to rally to the 50-day SMA, but it turned down from $537.56. It can now correct to the 20-day EMA and below that to the $418.79 levels.If either of the levels hold, the bulls will again try to push the ETH/USD pair towards the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can go long on dips with a stop loss below $355.The 20-day EMA is turning up, which shows the possibility of either a range bound action or the start of a new uptrend. We shall get more clarity in a couple of days.BCH/USDWe had recommended a long position on Bitcoin Cash in our previous analysisat $779. For the past four days, the digital currency has entered into a tight range. If the bears manage to sustain prices below $778.2021 levels, we may see a range bound action.If the BCH/USD pair bounces off the 20-day EMA at $765, a rally to the 50-day SMA at $945 is possible.The 50-day SMA has not acted as a major resistance previously, hence, we expect a rally to $1114 levels.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the lows of $619.7510 are broken. Hence, we have propose a stop loss at $610.XRP/USDRipple is finding it difficult to break out of the 50-day SMA. The bears should now attempt to sink the digital currency below $0.56270 levels once again. If successful, a retest of the April 01 lows of $0.45351 will be on the cards.On the other hand, if the bulls defend the $0.56270 levels, traders can initiate long positions on the XRP/USD pair with a stop loss at $0.45.On the upside, the first target should be $0.7 and above it $0.83.XLM/USDStellar broke out and closed above the descending channel on April 15, triggering our recommended buy levels. The trade is live.The XLM/USD pair has risen above the channel for the first time this year and has broken out of the 50-day SMA after early-February. Both these show that the bulls are accumulating at the lower levels.The moving averages are close to a bullish crossover, which is an added positive.The digital currency can retest the breakout levels of the channel. If the level holds, we should see a rally towards its first target objective of $0.36 and to $0.47 after that.If price enters the channel once again, it will be a bearish move. We shall cover the position if price closes (UTC time frame) below $0.18.LTC/USDThough Litecoin has broken out of the downtrend line 1, it is struggling to scale above the horizontal resistance at $141.026.For the past four days, the LTC/USD pair has been consolidating in a tight range near the overhead resistance.Even if the price breaks out of $141.026, it will again face resistance at the downtrend line 2. If price turns down from the current levels, we may expect a range bound trading action for a few days.As we don\u2019t find any buy setup with a good risk to reward ratio, we remain neutral on Litecoin. We shall change our view once it starts trading above the downtrend line 2.ADA/BTCOur recommended long position on Cardano is moving towards its first target objective of 0.0000323, where partial profits can be booked. The remaining positions can be held with a trailing stop loss, for a higher target of 0.000035.The successful retest of the breakout levels at 0.00002460 on April 14 and the subsequent bounce is a positive sign. The 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA have also completed a bullish crossover.Therefore, we suggest trailing the stops on the ADA/BTC pair to 0.000023 from 0.000021.NEO/USDOur suggested long position on NEO is live from the levels of $64 that triggered on April 12. We had expected a quick move to $88 but for the past four days, the digital currency has been struggling to stay above the $64 mark.On the upside, the 50-day SMA is acting as a resistance. Once this is crossed, the NEO/USD pair should rally to the downtrend line of the descending triangle.On the downside, the 20-day EMA will act as a strong support. If the bulls fail to defend this level, a retest of the lows at $44.16 is possible.Traders should hold the position with the stop loss at $44. We shall close the position earlier if the critical levels break down.EOS/USDTraders who follow us are likely long on EOS at $7.5. We had suggested to book profits on partial positions at $9.5, but the digital currency did not reach those levels. Currently, a retest of the breakout levels of $7.28 is on the cards.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, which is a positive development. The 20-day EMA is just below the critical horizontal support of $7.28.We anticipate a strong bounce from these levels, which should again propel the EOS/USD pair towards its target objective of $11.If the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA supports break down, we might close the positions without waiting for the stops to be hit. Meanwhile, traders should continue to hold with the stop loss at $5.5.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Also called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol, it is built upon a distributed open source Internet protocol, consensus ledger and native currency called XRP (ripples). Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable \u201csecure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.\u201d It supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. At its core, Ripple is based around a shared, public database or ledger, which uses a consensus process that allows for payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.The network is decentralized and can operate without Ripple (enterprise), it cannot be shut down. Among validators are companies, internet service providers, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Used by companies such as UniCredit, UBS and Santander, Ripple has been increasingly adopted by banks and payment networks as settlement infrastructure technology, with American Banker explaining that \u201cfrom banks\u2019 perspective, distributed ledgers like the Ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like bitcoin,\u201d including price and security.Official Website: https://ripple.com/Block Explorer: https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/graph/Risk Reminder:Investing in digital assets comes with high risks due to huge price fluctuations.

The currency with the abbreviation XRP is a token of the company Ripple Labs. Anyone who bought ripple for 100 euros on 1 January last year was able to withdraw 36,000 euros on January 1, 2018. The sum of all ripple tokens has a market capitalization of $ 89 billion. The founder was at the top of the list of the richest people at the beginning of this year. Are these tokens worth 89 billion? Certainly not. But what real value do they have? I think: 0. Here is my reasoning.What Ripple is designed to\u00a0doWhen banks transfer money across borders, they use Swift\u2019s service (and technology). It is a protocol from the early 1970s. It enables digital transfer of money between banks without having to send real banknotes back and forth. Swift is one of the cornerstones that has made our current, globalized monetary economy possible. Swift is expensive, slow and awkward. On the other hand, it has been functioning for four decades with a permanent increase in money transfers.Ripple Labs has now invented a blockchain-based protocol to replace Swift. If it is introduced nationwide, it will replace Swift and all its disadvantages. The need and interest of the banks is there and it\u2019s significant. If money transfer costs almost nothing, the institutes will save billions. If Ripple Labs prevails on the market, the company will also be worth billions of dollars.XRP is not Ripple\u00a0LabsIf you own Apple shares, you own a part of the business. You are (sometimes) entitled to a share of the profits in the form of dividends. Or even a vote on the fundamental direction of the company. Similar to all forms of investment, he value of the stock is based on the belief in the future profitability of the company. However, this is supported by the ownership and related rights.The Ripple XRP token, like virtually every other crypto token, is not tied to company capital. Anyone who owns XRP, owns\u2026 nothing except the token. No property, no dividend, hardly any rights. The price of XRP hardly correlates with the company Ripple Labs, but only with the expectation of buyers for a higher sales price in the future. That may bring the price up, but not the value.Utility by itself is not\u00a0valuableCrypto tokens can be divided into three groups: currencies (such as Bitcoin, Dash, Monero), investments (such as stocks or notes), and utility tokens. The latter are used to pay for a service. In the casino euros will buy you a few chips that you can then use to play. In the crypto world, you buy Ether to pay for the operation of the Ethereum supercomputer. Or just XRP to pay for the money transfer. Utility tokens are a currency used to pay fees.XRP has no\u00a0valueIn the crypto scene, Ripple is accused of not being a real blockchain. The reasons are that it is centrally controlled, intransparent, isn\u2019t mined and is controlled by a company. However, for Ripple\u2019s purpose, those are not bad things. After all, for 45 years banks have been doing very well with a centralized Swift. But the problem lies elsewhere: XRP is only used by banks. But the token is tradable on public exchanges. This is pointless, because I personally have no need for ripple, except for speculative purposes. Speculation means price fluctuations and that\u2019s a horror for banks. Just imagine, a transfer from Vienna to Timbuktu costs 3 cents today and 25 euros tomorrow. In order for XRP to be used as a utility token, it must disappear from the public market. And so the price drops to its actual value.No utility token is an investmentAt least since the industrialization of 200 years ago, our economic system is based on this principle: the more of a product is produced, the cheaper the unit price. The more a service is used, the cheaper the individual use.But how do crypto tokens work? The more they are used, the greater the demand. The greater the demand, the more expensive the price. The token principle is at odds with our economy.The bottom\u00a0lineIn order for the token to not get caught up in this contradiction, it may not be used for the service. There are already many blockchain projects that have two tokens. One to collect money (speculative) and a second, stable one to use the respective platform.With such a solution, the token XRP would be detached from its original use. It would only be the company value. But wait: it does not exist. And in terms of value, things get even more uncomfortable. If a listed company wants to issue new shares, then the current stockholders must vote on it. Because with new shares, the value of each individual share is diluted. Not only is XRP the sole decision of the company, but they haven\u2019t put more than half of all XRPs on the market. The value of XRP is therefore not in the hands of the market, but can be (and is) manipulated by Ripple Labs.All of this happens while Ripple Labs owns the company. They can now go to a conventional exchange at any time and issue real shares with ownership. So they can raise capital a second time and only hand out shares once. Then XRP owners clearly look will be left behind.This does not just apply to ripple labs, but to any crypto token that does not serve as a currency.That\u2019s why I think that XRP has no value. And neither do most other tokens. However, I am open for discussion.Update from August 2018: Please bear in mind that the article was published in Februar 2018. While many disputed some of the facts back then, they didn\u2019t get any fresher in the past six months. Although the price proves my polemic right.

It\u2019s A Life-Saving Movement.Chris HadleyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 1, 2018Almost 1 million people worldwide have died as a result of suicide, with over 40,000 of those fatalities counted in the United States. In 2000, Kevin Hines nearly became the latest addition to those statistics. Only 19 years old and diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Hines tried to take his own life by jumping off San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge. Were it not for the alert actions of now-retired U.S. Coast Guard officer Marcus Butler and trauma nurse Christy Frecceri, Hines\u2019 story would have died with him.After that incident, Hines would recount his experiences to millions of people whose lives have been altered by suicide through public speeches, one-on-one meetings with families and suicide survivors, TV talk show appearances, and a best-selling autobiography, Cracked, Not Broken: Surviving and Thriving After A Suicide Attempt. Hines\u2019 story also reached over 110 million viewers on Buzzfeed Video.In January of 2018, Hines appeared alongside infamous Youtube vlogger Logan Paul to discuss suicide prevention in a video called \u201cSuicide: Be Here Tomorrow\u201d. That video has racked up over 28 million views since its debut. At the 2018 Grammy Awards, Hines took the stage with several suicide survivors as acclaimed rap artist Logic performed his hit song \u201c1\u2013800\u2013273\u20138255\u201d (also the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline).Now, Hines tells his story\u200a\u2014\u200aand the stories of others touched by suicide\u200a\u2014\u200ain the full-length documentary Suicide: The Ripple Effect, co-directed by Hines and Baton Rouge-based filmmaker Greg Dicharry.In addition to numerous showings throughout the United States and overseas, Suicide: The Ripple Effect recently played at the Louisiana International Film Festival in Baton Rouge. Its web site offers a complete list of upcoming public screenings, plus valuable information on suicide prevention, and details on how people can organize screenings of Suicide: The Ripple Effect in their hometowns.Hines tells his story on-camera in SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE\u00a0EFFECT.Most people associate the tragedy of suicide with celebrities\u200a\u2014\u200aPrince, Kurt Cobain, Robin Williams, Amy Winehouse, among others. However, suicide also affects everyday people who\u2019ve felt like there is no way for them to overcome the difficulties of life. The impact it has on their families and friends is devastating. Equally devastating are their shared feelings of not having done enough to save their loved ones.While those effects have been examined in sobering detail across several documentaries and fiction-based films, Suicide: The Ripple Effect shows how it\u2019s possible for something good to come out of the traumatic experience of suicide.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make a sad and somber film. That\u2019s not who Kevin is. Kevin\u2019s story is really hopeful in its message,\u201d Dicharry responds. \u201cWe feel that people who\u2019ve been touched by suicide needed to be uplifted and to not have a downer thing. You don\u2019t reach as many people because they don\u2019t want to watch a downer film.\u201dThe stories that DiCharry and Hines\u2019 documentary capture are examples of that axiom, as is the very name of their project. \u201cOne of the things with the title of the movie early on was that it was natural to see the negative ripple effects that happen with suicide,\u201d says Dicharry. \u201cThere are studies out there that say after with every death by suicide, 115 people are directly affected. That\u2019s huge, but we wanted to focus more on the positive ripple effects of hope that come out of that.\u201dAmong those impacted by Hines\u2019 story are the people who worked to save his life. \u201cOne of the people we interviewed for the film was a trauma nurse (Frecceri), who was the nurse when Kevin came into the hospital,\u201d says Dicharry. \u201cWe interviewed her, and we learned the impact that he\u2019s had on her and his story, and how she uses that story to train other nurses. There\u2019s the Coast Guard guy, Marcus Butler, who helped rescue Kevin, and the impact he\u2019s had. Then, there are just people who meet him. It\u2019s pretty remarkable.\u201dHines (left) with former Coast Guard officer Marcus Butler (right), one of several first responders who helped to save Hines\u2019 life. His story is among many told in SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE\u00a0EFFECT.Inspired by Hines\u2019 story and his work, people throughout the world have followed in his footsteps. Hines and Dicharry met some of them in their trip to the Land Down Under, which is presented in their film. \u201cThere\u2019s a young guy in the film from Australia, Sam Webb, who\u2019s an actor. He lost his best friend to suicide. He and his buddy started up a charity called LIVIN to draw attention to the issue,\u201d Dicharry remembers.\u201c\u2026There was the brother and the mother of someone who died by suicide. He\u2019s a speaker, like Kevin, and the mother wrote a book. Another girl who works with us now lost her brother to suicide. She\u2019s determined. Another guy, Joe Williams, was a former rugby player and boxer. He attempted suicide, and now he\u2019s using his experience to help others.\u201dFor families who\u2019ve lost a loved one due to suicide, coping with the devastation of that loss is made harder by their inevitable feelings of guilt. Hines\u2019 efforts to help those families are seen up-close in Suicide: The Ripple Effect.\u201c(It\u2019s great) to see the kind of impact that he has in helping families understand a little bit better or get a little bit more peace,\u201d Dicharry adds. \u201cHe can give them a little bit better understanding that it really wasn\u2019t their fault. He gives them a little more understanding of the reasoning or circumstances behind it.\u201dDicharry also describes how even the short trailer for Suicide: The Ripple Effect has already helped to save lives. \u201cA kid wrote in from Australia. He said he was standing on top of a bridge and was just waiting for that right moment to jump. He scrolled through his phone and he saw the video. He watched it, and when it was over, he called his parents and his friend and got help. Those kinds of things happened repeatedly, numerous times. That\u2019s the really cool thing.\u201dSocial media, particularly the film\u2019s Facebook page, is a significant extension of Dicharry and Hines\u2019 outreach. \u201cWhen we first started, we started what was called the \u2018Suicide: The Ripple Effect Challenge\u2019,\u201d Dicharry explains. \u201cWe had a number of people doing it early on. We\u2019ve had a few lately, but we\u2019ve encouraged people to share their stories of how they were personally impacted by suicide in a short video. We\u2019d post it on our page. There\u2019s a few of those that were submissions that were actually in the film. We\u2019re hoping that when the film starts, people will do more of those. If they\u2019re not comfortable doing a video, they can write something, do a picture, a poem or things like that.\u201dGreg Dicharry, co-director of SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE\u00a0EFFECT.Like that of Hines, Dicharry\u2019s story of survival is especially remarkable. A graduate of Arizona State University, Dicharry started his filmmaking career in the glamorous yet tempting atmosphere of Los Angeles. Beginning in the mid \u201990s, he worked on several music video and TV commercials, plus a low-budget feature film. However, Dicharry struggled to cope with the constant uncertainty of when his next job would come along. For him, drugs were the only way to deal with the difficulties of that situation.After taking an additional job as a part-time nanny, Dicharry\u2019s work in the film and TV production industry would increase. Having begun collecting stories for the pilot episode of a youth-oriented 60 Minutes-style newsmagazine called Generation Y, Dicharry spent considerable time with the youth of a Venice Beach-based ministry, Set Free. Meanwhile, Dicharry also worked on the crew of MTV\u2019s celebrity-filled Rock & Jock Softball game.While the work picked up for Dicharry, so did the long hours he spent on both projects. Worse, so did his substance abuse. Boosted by the exciting nature of his work, and by the dangerous power of the drugs he consumed, Dicharry rarely slept. He practically neglected his then-girlfriend. Following a heated argument between them, Dicharry had an experience that initially seemed like a profound epiphany.\u201cWe had a little balcony off our kitchen, and another balcony off our living room. I was tired and pretty buzzed, but I got locked out off the smaller balcony off our kitchen,\u201d he recalls. \u201cRather than bang on the door and wake up my girlfriend, I just laid down on the ground and went to sleep. At some point later, I was startled awake. I don\u2019t know how to completely describe it, but it was like a voice or vision came to me. \u2018If you give it all away, it\u2019ll come back to you a million fold\u2019.\u201dL-R: SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT co-directors Dicharry and\u00a0Hines.The next morning, Dicharry began to do just that. \u201cI started giving away more and more. it was kind of like, \u2018you\u2019ve given me everything. I\u2019ve given you your clothes.\u2019 I took off all my clothes. I wasn\u2019t on any drugs, but it was like I was. I ended up getting in the middle of the street. It was rush hour traffic. People were honking their horns, but it sounded like music. I was dancing. I came around the corner.\u201dBelieving that he was somehow under the influence of a higher power, Dicharry had no idea he was in danger. The policemen who saw him prancing amid Venice Beach\u2019s traffic, however, had a hunch that he was. \u201cThere was this group of cops,\u201d Dicharry says. \u201cThey were laughing at me. I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to see the Lord.\u2019 They said, \u2018where\u2019s the Lord?\u2019 I said, \u2018in Long Beach.\u2019 They took me to jail where I stayed for a day, and they ended up letting me go.\u201dFor three weeks, Dicharry would be committed to the psychiatric ward at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. During that time, he found out the real reason behind his supposedly spiritual behavior: \u201cThey told me that I was bipolar and needed to take these meds and that if I didn\u2019t quit doing drugs and alcohol, I\u2019d keep ending up in places like that,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThat was kind of the start of it. Smoking a lot of marijuana definitely had a factor in it.\u201dDicharry\u2019s first manic episode would only be the beginning of several incidents induced by work and insomnia. \u201cA number of my episodes after that revolved around working on film projects. It would be kind of the same scenario. I\u2019d be really jazzed up and excited,\u201d he explains. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t sleep and wouldn\u2019t sleep less, and would start getting delusional. When you\u2019re sleep deprived and you start getting a little loopy, it\u2019s kind of like that. It took me quite a while to accept that.\u201dGreg Dicharry takes audience questions after SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT\u2019s recent screening at the Louisiana International Film Festival in Baton Rouge,\u00a0La.Those mood swings persisted, as did Dicharry\u2019s reluctance to come to terms with his mental illness. \u201dWhat I had experienced with the mental health stuff was that I knew it sounded crazy to people, but nonetheless it was very real to me. It was difficult for people to tell me that it was a disorder because it was so real to me.\u201dEqually strong was Dicharry\u2019s misguided belief that he could keep smoking marijuana. \u201cI had done a variety of drugs, like a lot of cocaine over the years, but the marijuana was the one thing I thought I could never quit.\u201dMore episodes would follow, as would more stays in psychiatric hospitals (over 12, according to Dicharry). After moving to Arizona, Dicharry thought that his life was getting back on track. He had a new job, and a new apartment. Yet, he still had his demons. Having suffered another breakdown, Dicharry returned from his latest involuntary hospital stay in desperate shape. Soon, he pleaded for a sign from above.\u201cThey\u2019re about to evict me. My apartment\u2019s psychotically painted. I lost my job. I fell to my knees, saying \u2018God, please help me.\u2019 What became crystal clear was that similar kind of voice, very real-sounding or just that whole feeling was \u2018help yourself\u2019,\u201d describes Dicharry. \u201cAt that time, I just chuckled. It showed me that something was there, but it also just registered because I had not been willing to help myself on a consistent basis for so long.\u201dWith his filmmaking career postponed, Dicharry focused on rebuilding his life through a special peer support program designed to help those suffering from mental illness transition into the work force.\u201cYou could go through this training and maybe get a job,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just going to think it was to do a part time job to supplement my social security. I went through this training program, and I ended up being hired to this agency to do a training program help people get jobs and keep jobs.\u201dSUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT co-director Greg Dicharry, in front of the U.S.\u00a0Capitol.After overseeing that program for several years, Dicharry would later join health care firm Magellan Health in a newly created position: that of its national youth empowerment director. Dicharry saw it as the perfect opportunity to blend his personal work experience with the mentally ill with his skills in filmmaking.\u201cAround that time, I got a video camera again and I started filming a lot of things with the youth. They did a lot of presentations and events,\u201d Dicharry replies. \u201cIn 2010, I was able to edit together this short 5-minute video of the youth program. Then, I was able to do some PSA\u2019s for work. Things kind of started melding a little bit. I did little projects over the years.\u201dDicharry would soon meet Hines, who was actively working on a project of his own. \u201cIt was Kevin\u2019s idea to do a documentary, and to do (Suicide: The Ripple Effect). He had been working with another guy for a little while. Initially, it was us three. The guy had sort of fallen off, and together we crafted the different story, elements and ideas. It was amazing working with him, and seeing the kind of impact he has on people.\u201dHines would, in turn, have a significant impact on Dicharry; something he experienced first-hand while working alongside Hines on the film. \u201cHe\u2019s on the road constantly giving speeches, and on top of that, he\u2019s out there helping people one-on-one who get connected with him, call him, and reach out to him,\u201d Dicharry notes. \u201cIt definitely was inspiring and really cool to meet the people that were involved in the scenario, and seeing how much they\u2019ve been impacted by his story, and where he\u2019s at now.\u201dKevin Hines tells his powerful story of surviving a suicide attempt in the acclaimed documentary SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT, co-directed by Hines and Baton Rouge filmmaker Greg Dicharry.Working with Hines on Suicide: The Ripple Effect hasn\u2019t just been a mere collaboration for Dicharry. He feels that it\u2019s just one more step in his own life-changing journey.\u201cMy film career was something I had always dreamed of since I was a little kid. I was very confident that I would be successful at it,\u201d explains DiCharry. \u201cIt (filmmaking) was ripped from me, not that I was super successful or anything, but that whole field was pulled from me largely by my own doing. Nonetheless, that loss was a grieving process. Getting back to doing an actual full feature film that\u2019s going to be seen by people is pretty cool.\u201dSome people say that movies have changed their lives. Others say that movies have saved their lives. As Dicharry and Hines see it, Suicide: The Ripple Effect is the rare film that does both. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to reach as many people as possible, and to help build a movement of hope and healing. It\u2019s not just a film. It\u2019s a film and a movement. That\u2019s really the thing,\u201d Dicharry says, adding that Suicide: The Ripple Effect is only the beginning of that movement.\u201cWe (Dicharry, Hines and the filmmakers) are reaching the people who are in need, or who might be in crisis, or who might be on the verge of suicide. We also want to reach the family members and loved ones, so that parents, teachers and people know what signs to look out for, what questions to ask, and how to help people get help. If we can tell a story and have it be entertaining, but also have it save lives, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201dThe official trailer for Suicide: The Ripple Effect can be seen here:Suicide: The Ripple Effect\u2019s web site offers important contact information for worldwide organizations dedicated to preventing suicide, including for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

This was enough to disappoint many investors and cause a decline in the XRP price.Many Ripple investors replied with comments like \u201cwe want Ripple,\u201d \u201cPlease add Ripple!\u201d However, naturally, there were Ripple haters who commented that they don\u2019t want to see Ripple.

Because of this, the foundation set aside 20 billion STR to periodically give away to BTC/XRP holders. Comments from Stellar.org on the program details:\u201cDecentralized payment network Stellar has announced the final round of its Bitcoin-Lumen Program, where Bitcoin holders can claim its lumen token for free.The program, which began in April 2016, features 19 percent of the total lumen supply, which developers reserved at launch exclusively for Bitcoin users.Of the 19 bln lumens on offer, only 3 bln formed the first round of the giveaway, that was concluded in October 2016. with release details of the remaining 16 bln to be officially announced on March 28.The value of the remaining tokens is approximately $16 mln.\u201dThe STR claim for XRP/BTC holders will end two-months after it begins:\u201cOn June 27th, 2017, we will make available these lumens to any bitcoin holder who wants them, including those that received lumens during the first giveaway round\u201d, says the company in its circular.Seems pretty altruistic and cool, but as you can see in the picture above there is a major increase in the STR volume and price. Cryptocurrency \u2018pump and dumps\u2019 seem to be occurring far too often and those that get sucked into them without knowing how to hedge from the risk can get harmed badly. Here is the original post I found about the giveaway:\u201cBitcoin Holders Can Claim Free 16 Bln Stellar Lumen Tokens\u201dThe Stellar.org link to claim your STRSo, STR has clearly seen a bump up in price the last week per the picture above. It may be a speculation, but there is a major pump going on across Bitcoin (BTC), Stellar (STR), and Ripple (XRP) right now and XRP just passed up Ethereum (ETH) in market capitalization\u2026what\u2019s going to happen here? Looks like a potential mess waiting to happen if you\u2019re not aware of what may be some of the major driving factors.Has anyone participated in a giveaway like this before?In order to protect ourselves as cryptocurrency holders and members of the Steem community, will a 19 billion STR giveaway affect other cryptocurrencies?How might this affect STEEM?Currently, there are only 9 billion STR in circulation.Will this cause massive decreases in STR/BTC/XRP prices once the STR is distributed to BTC/XRP holders?Will STR prices see a decrease in price considering the inflow of coins? Or will we see an opportunistic pumper come in and manipulate?What will happen with other currencies that are dependent on BTC/ETH?I enjoy writing about current and thought provoking happenings along with spreading awareness for specific events like this. Steemit is an awesome community to be a part of so far and I\u2019m excited to connect with more Steemians!!

Major investors and crypto enthusiasts were a bit optimistic after the reversal of cryptocurrency ban by the tech giant Facebook. But unfortunately, nothing positive happened, other cryptocurrencies are following the same downfall as the \u201cPied Piper was being followed by the rat\u201d.Let\u2019s point out the major reasons for the plague in the cryptocurrency.#1BTC has almost had a massive downfall and reached below $6000 mark. As of now Bitcoin is trading at $5895.13. Bitcoin price nearly fell by 0.11% after the South Korean Exchange attack. Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin cash had fallen by 0.5% or more. The historical data from the coinmarketcap shows that there had been decline of nearly $3,00,000,000 in market cap from 8th to 11th of June, 2018.#2The cryptocurrency price fluctuations are to be expected with such a nascent market, according to Matthew Newton, an analyst at the trading platform eToro.The reality is that emerging technologies carrying radically new ideas will always see swings in their value,\u201d Mr Newton told The Independent.\u201cMarket adjustments as we have seen over the past months can help to stabilise prices and move the industry towards a more robust, sophisticated regime. This is good for the long-term future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, giving the industry time to develop.\u201d#3Other factors which might have contributed to the sudden downfall of the crypto market might be the regulatory measures introduced in Japan. Bitflyer, the local exchange aggregator announced that they wouldn\u2019t accept new customers due to the regulations imposed by the Financial Services Agency in Japan.#4Even Ripple suffered heavy loses, major reason being the South korean hack, trading at $0.431157 as of now, wherein the percentage decrease in the last one hour is 0.10%. Ethereum suffered a more tremendous fall, trading now at $411.43, with the percentage decrease in 0.25% in the last hour.Cryptocurrencies can\u2019t catch a break this week as more negative news continues to crowd the market.Traders woke up to the news that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has seized more than $20 million in bitcoin from illicit weapons and narcotics traders on the Darknet, shrouding the cryptocurrency market in a negative light again.#5One more reason is AliBaba\u2019s chairman Jack Ma\u2019s statement where he advises traders against Bitcoin saying that \u201cthe digital coin is a bubble will burst.\u201dSpeaking at a launch event for a new online-payment service for real-time cash transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines, he said: \u201cTechnology itself isn\u2019t the bubble, but bitcoin likely is.About CoinSwitchCoinSwitch is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange aggregator.

This fund was established to support companies that want to pioneer with blockchain. Xpring has announced this week that it wants to invest no less than $100 million in blockchain gaming.Making the game economy more realisticRipple guarantees this amount but it is managed by Forte. This company has only been in existence for a month and is developing blockchain products and platforms for the gaming industry. Forte\u2019s CEO, Kevin Chou, founded the mobile gaming company Kabam, and Forte\u2019s co-founder, Brett Seyler, worked for GarageGames, Unity and Beyond Games.The ultimate goal of the partnership between Ripple and Forte is to make in-game economies more realistic. Games must closely reflect the real world by using blockchain technology.Ripple invests in gaming for a reason. The idea is that XRP will be used in all these in-game economies. Allegedly even that $100 million is paid in XRP.Use between different blockchainsIn order for such an in-game economy to succeed, a few important conditions must be met. It is extremely important that gamers actually own their assets. Blockchain can facilitate this with non-fungible tokens. This is a difficult word for non-exchangeable tokens, each token is unique and can be linked to ownership. These one-of-a-kind tokens can then be processed into smart contracts for buying, selling or trading.Forte wants to build a protocol together with Xpring that makes it possible to send coins between different blockchains. Suppose Fifa has its own blockchain and so does Tetris, you should be able to spend the same coin in both games. Ultimately, that must take the form of a wallet that is integrated into old and new games.\u201cBlockchain technology has the potential to improve games and help developers run better and more successful game economies, but for many developers, it is difficult to develop and implement,\u201d the accompanying press release says.\u201cThe Forte platform makes it easy for developers to apply blockchain technology to their games, increasing engagement and revenue generation with their players.\u201dAuthor: Marko Vidrih@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

We have got\u2026 over 100 financial institutions using our software right now\u2026 we have moved over a billion dollars across the Ripple network.\u201d\u201cOur competition is this banking consortium that came together in 1973\u2026 It\u2019s called SWIFT\u2026 You know what it isn\u2019t? It is not \u2018swift\u2019! It takes 3\u20135 days to move money\u2026 It\u2019s one-dimensional messaging\u2026 It has about a 4% error rate\u2026 You send a message to move money, and then you wait, and maybe you get something back\u2026 It\u2019s more akin to a homing pigeon than a text message or email.\u201d\u201cThe results we hear back are enormously positive.\u201dWhy Does the Ripple Ecosystem Excite the XRP HODLers So\u00a0Much?\u201cI think that XRP is, in some ways, Crypto 2.0.\u201d\u201cBitcoin may be the Napster of this technology, where it opened our eyes to what is possible, but the failings of the technology also became apparent.\u201d\u201cThe creators of XRP looked at the possibilities of Bitcoin, and said \u2018Wow, this could be awesome, but this could fall on its face. And so they created something that was a 2.0, a solution to a lot f the problems for Bitcoin. And they did that before they had the imagination of a use case.\u201dWhy There Is So Much FUD Around\u00a0XRP\u201cBecause people who understand it and who have made a bet somewhere, want to see the other things fail.\u201d\u201cI think there are Bitcoin maximalists who hate XRP because it is not Bitcoin.\u201d\u201cI there are ether holders who hate XRP because hold ether.\u201d\u201cI think there are bloggers and wanna-be journalists\u2026 [who are] biased because they are holding some of these assets and not the others, and by definition, that puts them in a place where they can\u2019t honestly divorce themselves from hoping something is successful and something else isn\u2019t.\u201dBanks Adoption of xCurrent and\u00a0xRapid\u201cOne of clever things that Ripple did long before I arrived was to create some software that instead of espousing the virtues of anarchy, said that we are creating software for banks that sits behind the bank\u2019s firewalls\u2026 it\u2019s just that the software sits underneath their system, and moves things faster, and that starts to get banks comfortable with our xCurrent product. It\u2019s simply a messaging product, doesn\u2019t use XRP or crypto at all, and I think that the banks can then start to get comfortable with \u2018Oh wow, how can we take this to the next level\u2019, and then maybe they start to use our xRapid product and that will engage them in the world of XRP.\u201dSource", "responses": ""}, {"title": "An Overview About\u00a0RIPPLE", "author_name": "The Blockchain 999", "link": "https://medium.com/@theblockchain999/an-overview-about-ripple-d3869d5d28cd?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 8, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "199", "content": "An Overview About\u00a0RIPPLEThe Blockchain 999BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 8, 2018Let\u2019s find out what Ripple\u00a0isRipple coin (XRP) is a real-time payment system (RTGS) or Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple Protocol. It\u2019s an open source distribution system that is in the beta stage. Many people still think that ripple is the generic name of a digital electronic money. The ripple network was launched in 2012 with the goal of making it easy for people to use banking, paypal, credit cards or financial institutions at an extremely low cost with a fast speed. Ripple uses blockchain chaining technology similar to the Bitcoin virtual currency, which helps accelerate the pace of financial transactions between banks.Ripple development teamRipple coin / protocol was developed and developed by OpenCoin, which\u00a0: Chris Larsen is chief executive officer and chief technology officer Jed McCaleb. Larsen is the co-founder and also the chief financial officer of E-LOAN and finally, McCaleb is from Mt. Gox. Plus, many other members of the Ripple are experts in virtual currency research, especially they are very knowledgeable about the Bitcoin platform.Is Ripple a replicate of Bitcoin\u00a0?It\u2019s a sure thing that while learning about Ripple, many people will wonder is Ripple the same with Bitcoin virtual currency? The answer is \u201cthey have some mutual points \u201c. For example, the XRP unit of the Ripple is a digital based pre-type that works on mathematical formulas and limited release quantities. Both Bitcoin and Ripple use peer-to-peer P2P networks, which means that transactions do not require third party interference. Along with that, the anti-counterfeiting or inflation of these two currencies is similar.However, the reason of Ripple being created was to support Bitcoin, not to become a competitor. The Ripple network is designed to serve currency transfers seamlessly, whether it\u2019s any of the national currencies: USD, British Pound, Euro or even Bitcoin.XRP is a distributed network so it does not depend on any company or organization to manage, so the data and transaction information are guaranteed to be safe, without waiting for confirmation that can go over the network quickly.Ripple\u2019s ratingAccording to the developers of Ripple, there will be about 100 billion XRPs released, half will be held by the company, the other half will be circulated in the market. When KriptoA were writing this article, the price of the Ripple is $ 0.167788 and has a total market capitalization of more than $ 6 billion, which is more than 3 million BTC.The Price Of RippleIf you are interested in this type of currency, you can monitor the rate of Ripple in every single day to understand the price fluctuation of it. Keeping update the latest news about ripple or Bitcoin, as the ripple price will be directly affected by such market information as well as Bitcoin pricing.The attraction of Ripple to large banks all around the\u00a0worldTalking about partners of Ripple, we can give you some big names such as Google, IDG Capital Partners, Anderssen or AME Cloud Ventures. Ripple has so far reached $ 93 million- an extremely impressive number for a start-up company set up in 2012. According to the Coindesk site, the amount of money Ripple is ranked 4th in the segment of the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Services. The value of the Ripple has increased by more than 25% after announcing that it had raised $ 55 million- Forrtune magazine\u00a0.Ripple\u2019s global\u00a0high-flyRipple\u2019s Ceo- Mr. Chris Larsen, said that RIpple is rapidly allocating funds to global stature plans.Here\u2019s a his answer in the interview with CNBC:\u201cWe are expanding the areas where we have offices. Ripple wants to expand further and develop capabilities for new groups. We are rushing to recruit more, and increase the number of programmers to work directly with partner banks in their own country. Only then can we offer the best solutions to our partners. \u201cFollowing the newly established office in Luxemburg, the next destination that Ripple is targeting is Frankfurt (Germany) and Singapore and many other destinations. We have chosen these two sayings from Chris Larsen in order to help you understand more about his ambition\u00a0:Luxembourg Prime Minister Mr.Xavier Bettel (left side) visits Ripple\u2019s newly opened office\u201cOnce networked devices are on the increase period, in the internet age, small payments across borders will increase\u201d \u201c Banks will need Ripples to solve their problems \u201c\u00a0.He also said that they are starting to implement a plan to help smaller startup groups in the same field with the goal of global development.After reading this, we hope you will understand more about Ripple, hope you have a good day\u00a0!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "The Tumultuous Rise of Ripple\u2019s\u00a0XRP", "author_name": "MEDICI", "link": "https://medium.com/@gomedici/the-tumultuous-rise-of-ripples-xrp-b663d59ad67e?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 27, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "2", "content": "The Tumultuous Rise of Ripple\u2019s\u00a0XRPMEDICIBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 27, 2017Read the full story here.Ripple, the global settlement network operator for banks, recently released the XRP Markets report for Q1 2017 which analyzes the market activity in XRP, an independent digital asset native to the Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL).Like many other non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies, often referred to as altcoins, XRP enjoyed considerable gains since January 2017. Like many other cryptocurrencies, there was an inflow of funds from bitcoin, and incidentally, like many other cryptocurrencies, XRP witnessed the quintessential crypto pump and dump on April 2 when the prices skyrocketed to as high as $0.069, almost thrice the price it traded a day before.Source: CoinmarketcapIn order to better understand XRP Market dynamics and Ripple\u2019s perspective on XRP pricing, we had a brief conversation with Mr. Miguel Vias, Ripple\u2019s Head of XRP Markets, who is probably best positioned to comment on the fluctuations in XRP over last quarter.LTP: As per the report, BTC funds saw an inflow into XRP. Can\u2019t it be seen as a dependency on bitcoin, a highly volatile market? Does Ripple have any plans to de-couple XRP prices with BTC?Find out more\u00a0here.Miguel: Interestingly, the correlation between XRP and BTC is quite low, so I think about the relationship less like a dependency on BTC price action, and more as the most direct path for money to flow into XRP markets. Because XRP has relatively fewer fiat listings, the entry at the moment is BTC, regardless of what its price does. So when there is positive XRP news, the market is likely to move into XRP from BTC. As more XRP fiat pairs are listed, and more payments transfer through XRP, there will be an increase in fiat liquidity and we should see the BTC flows relatively decrease.LTP: As per the report, off-ledger activity for XRP has increased in 2017. Does Ripple have a plan to shield XRP from any \u201cpump and dump\u201d activities rampant on cryptocurrency exchanges?Miguel: Erratic price activity is often a symptom of less than optimal liquidity. As markets mature, volume increases and volatility decreases as a direct result of that volume. So while we have no plans to actively dampen price movements, a direct consequence of our strategy to increase liquidity should be more stable markets.LTP: Can you briefly elaborate on the aforementioned systematic markets operation program? Would love to understand how it works.Miguel: Unfortunately, besides what I shared in the report, I can\u2019t give too many details on that program at the moment.LTP: Can you briefly elaborate on Ripple\u2019s future plans towards providing a viable alternative to SWIFT?Miguel: I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as \u201cfuture\u201d plans, as we currently provide a viable, and superior, alternative to SWIFT. Using Ripple\u2019s solution, financial institutions can coordinate funds movement across multiple ledgers to remove all settlement risk and minimize delays in the payment process. Additionally, with Ripple\u2019s bi-directional messaging, they can validate transactions before funds are transferred and confirm delivery of funds, ensuring straight through processing and negligible tracking and reconciliation effort. Lastly, as XRP liquidity grows, and Ripple fully integrates XRP support into its solution, financial institutions will be able to access on-demand liquidity, thus mitigating the dependency on nostro/vostro accounts.Continue reading here.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Florian Glatz", "link": "https://medium.com/@heckerhut/the-quiet-death-of-ripple-s-codiu-project-782c11a17c02?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 13, 2015", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "7", "content": "The Quiet Death of Ripple\u2019s Codiu\u00a7\u00a0ProjectFlorian GlatzBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 13, 2015Why decentralized infrastructure has still a long way to\u00a0go", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Weekly (02/09\u201308/09) News (Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, Ripple, Stellar, Monero, Bitshares, NEM, Byteball)", "author_name": "Satoshi", "link": "https://blog.cyber.fund/weekly-02-09-08-09-news-bitcoin-dash-ethereum-ripple-stellar-monero-bitshares-nem-44a10d00749b?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 13, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "8", "content": "Weekly (02/09\u201308/09) News (Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, Ripple, Stellar, Monero, Bitshares, NEM, Byteball)SatoshiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 13, 2017Bitcoin &\u00a0DashIn the news and blogsOne Week Into SegWit, Hardware Wallets Lead the Pack in Slow-But-Sure Roll Out by Aaron van WirdumBitcoin Cash: Who Supports the Fork And Who Doesn\u2019t by Alyssa HertigDash News Weekly Recap by Dash Force NewsThe 3 Amigos Podcast Episode 15 by Mark MasonCryptocurrency Dash Team Schedules Free Conferences in Venezuelaby Joshua AlthauserCoinDesk released its Q2 2017 State of Blockchain reportEthereum*In the news and blogsSeeing Ghosts: Vitalik Is Finally Formalizing Ethereum\u2019s Casper Upgrade by Alyssa HertigChina has banned ICOs by Jon RussellBrief Analysis of China\u2019s Ban on ICOs by Lindsay X.

[1]If all goes well, Ripple\u2019s blockchain payments system could carry its first real funds between Japan and South Korea as early as spring 2018. Eventually, the banks aim to send money by using Ripple\u2019s virtual currency, known as XRP, cutting costs an estimated 60% compared with conventional methods.Japanese banks already have developed the systems needed to commercialize blockchain-based transfers. The cross-border trials are set to run through Jan. 31.[2]Tests will conclude on the 31st of January, so you still have some time to make a decision, but if you think the tests will end favorably for Ripple, it might be a good idea to hold.This is HUGE news for Ripple. Japan is the largest consumer of cryptocurrency in the world[3], and South Korea might have the highest % of adoption when it comes to people actually investing in crypto.Banks in these countries picking up Ripple to improve their financial infrastructure could do great things for the coin.The RumorsThere have been rumors floating around the internet that Ripple is going to be added to Coinbase.This image started floating around in the Bitcoin Talk forums a couple days ago.[4]This image supposedly depicts a Coinbase employee\u2019s management dashboard announcing XRP to be added as long as DASH and\u00a0XMR.It hasn\u2019t been confirmed, and it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone released fake images to try and sway markets if that is the case.However it is interesting nonetheless.If Ripple were added to Coinbase, that could mean huge gains for the coin, especially given its current price point of about $0.73.The cheapest cryptocurrency on Coinbase at the moment is Litecoin, and that\u2019s a little over $300.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Ripple effect v React\u00a0Native", "author_name": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Ot\u00e1hal", "link": "https://medium.com/@xotahal/ripple-effect-v-react-native-1e0abdc2cc9c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 13, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "3", "content": "Ripple effect v React\u00a0NativeJi\u0159\u00ed Ot\u00e1halBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 13, 2017Na konci tohoto tutori\u00e1lu budeme m\u00edt p\u0159esn\u011b takov\u00fdto\u00a0v\u00fdsledekV tomto prvn\u00edm \u010dl\u00e1nku se pokus\u00edm vysv\u011btlit, jak doc\u00edlit ripple efektu nad icon tla\u010d\u00edtkem, kter\u00fd zn\u00e1me z Material Design od Google.To v\u0161e pomoc\u00ed Animated API, kter\u00e9 n\u00e1m React Native nab\u00edz\u00ed.Uk\u00e1zka je p\u0159evzata z open source knihovny react-native-material-ui, kterou vyv\u00edj\u00edm spolu s rezerva\u010dn\u00edm syst\u00e9mem Reservio.My\u0161lenka\u00a0\u2026Vytvo\u0159\u00edme si t\u0159i View.

InteroperabilityThe Bitfury GroupBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 17, 2017SAN FRANCISCO\u200a\u2014\u200aAugust 15, 2017\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Bitfury Group, the world\u2019s leading full service Blockchain technology company, and Ripple, the commercial blockchain payments network, announced today that they have together added Lightning Network compatibility to the open-source Interledger project.Interledger is a protocol for interoperability\u200a\u2014\u200aconnecting payment networks or ledgers, enabling frictionless payments between them. The Bitfury Group and Ripple collaborated to make the Lightning Network compatible with the seven other networks currently connected via the Interledger protocol. The integration and demo code are available on GitHub.Now, those networks which are interoperable with the Interledger protocol will be able to connect across the Litecoin Lightning Network and Bitcoin Lightning Network. This makes the Lightning network more effective for cryptocurrency users because it allows payments to be made to individuals who are not actually on the Lightning network.\u201cThis news is a major step for interoperability of Blockchain and worldwide adoption of the Lightning Network,\u201d said Valery Vavilov, CEO of The Bitfury Group. \u201cBy making the Lightning Network compatible with the innovative Interledger protocol, we have ensured that it will be easier than ever for blockchain and cryptocurrency users to use their assets across different blockchains. This will allow for cross-blockchain, global transactions.\u201dStefan Thomas, CTO at Ripple, said: \u201cThe lack of interoperability across blockchains is preventing cryptocurrencies from becoming mainstream. This latest innovation adds Lightning to a growing list of networks that are interoperable with the Interledger protocol. Now, users of Litecoin Lightning Network can transact across the Bitcoin Lightening Network, and vice versa, instantly and easily, when they couldn\u2019t before. The ability to transact seamlessly this way is essential given the increasingly fragmented, diverse nature of payment systems worldwide.\u201dThe code for the demo and the Interledger protocol plugin for the Lightning network were released on August 15, 2017.ABOUT THE LIGHTNING NETWORKThe Lightning Network is a promising overlay solution that enables micropayments and increased transaction processing on the Bitcoin Blockchain and other blockchains. The Lightning Network operates as a network of bidirectional payment channels that transfer value off-blockchain. The network is also designed to be decentralized, eliminating the need for custodial trust. The security of the network is enforced by smart contracts using blockchain\u2019s built-in scripting capabilities. Increased capacity is achieved by the following principle\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead of creating on-blockchain transactions for individual payments, the broadcasting of the net result of these transactions is deferred. The Lightning Network can also be deployed on other blockchains, or between blockchains with Interledger transactions.ABOUT INTERLEDGERInterledger is an open suite of protocols for connecting ledgers of all types: from digital wallets and national payment systems to blockchains and beyond. The protocols enable instant, atomic settlement across any number of ledgers, geographies, stores of value and entities. They are the foundation of the Internet of Value, which will allow the world to exchange value as easily as it already exchanges information. Interledger uses connectors to route payments across different ledgers. Conditional transfers\u200a\u2014\u200ausing Hash-Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), as they are known in the blockchain space\u200a\u2014\u200aare used to secure multi-hop payments so funds cannot be lost or stolen in flight. On top of this security primitive, Interledger provides a packet and address format, heavily inspired by the Internet Protocol (IP), to instruct connectors where to forward payments.ABOUT THE BITFURY GROUP:The Bitfury Group is the leading full service Blockchain technology company and one of the largest private infrastructure providers in the Blockchain ecosystem.

If you are afraid of tech talk, read the short, less-techie version here (soon). It may also be very helpful to have a basic understanding about what Ripple is. Here is a primer.One of the turning points in a protocol\u2019s life cycle is when an alternative, from-scratch implementation appears. That is the initial proof that an actual protocol also exists as opposed to a closed ecosystem supported by a single isolated application. The Ripple software itself is open source, but no comprehensive specification exists and fighting through hundreds of files and hundreds of thousands of lines is not a task one would do usually on a lazy afternoon.There are many good reasons to have an alternative implementation for a protocol:find design issuesenable new platforms/products to use the protocolimprove or optimize the protocoland find more design issues, again\u200a\u2014\u200athe most important one in my opinion", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "Let\u2019s Trade\u00a0Ripple", "author_name": "Michael Harris", "link": "https://medium.com/@mikeharrisNY/lets-trade-ripple-f4c948e071f2?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 30, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "12", "content": "Let\u2019s Trade\u00a0RippleMichael HarrisBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 30, 2018Ripple (XRP) has gained about 120% in the last two weeks due to announcements that the company will be launching soon their settlement system, called XRapid.Actually, let\u2019s not trade XRP, I was kidding. I will explain why below. But first this is the weekly chart:The cryptocurrency has gained nearly 120% in the last two weeks according to ROC(2). This looks like a trader\u2019s dream. But it could turn into a nightmare.A few weeks ago when I first saw the announcements about XRapid I knew this one will spike higher. I was tempted to join the game. I had to fight hard to overcome FOMO.I have been in the trading business for a while. I know how easy it is to get in the market and how hard it is at times to get out. Trading a security after a 90% drawdown, as shown in the daily chart below, can get very risky.As you can see from the above chart, XRP fell more than 90% from its highs reached earlier this year. This means that a bubble formed and subsequently burst.\u201cSo what is wrong with risking a \u201clittle money\u201d on a trade?\u201dI see this argument made even by some people who promote themselves as experts and it is maybe the worst advice one could give, especially to new traders and the public because:small losses accumulate to generate large lossestrades must be the result of a disciplined approach, not of wishful thinkingI want to make this clear: traders who risk \u201clittle money\u201d on random trades jeopardize their trading discipline. It\u2019s not a question of money; trading success depends on discipline. If a trader loses their discipline by doing \u201clittle money\u201d trades here and there, this usually leads to large losses with high probability.Rule 1 is never lose money. Rule 2 is: never forget Rule 1 (W. Buffett)The above rule goes against the intuition of most traders but staying profitable reinforces psychology of a winner. The idea that one can lose five times in a row and make it up in the sixth may be mathematically correct but from a psychology point of view it can be a disaster and later lead to compulsive actions.Back to XRP: It\u2019s hard to trade anything that has the following volatility profile:The 365-day annualized volatility (365 days) is at 183%. The 14-day ATR as a percentage of closing price is around 11%. By comparison, annualized 252-day volatility (252 days) of SPY is 12.5% and 14-day ATR as a percentage of closing price is only 0.63%.If a trader thinks they can make money trading XRP, must first try to make money trading SPY. Still, one is free to do whatever they want but trading XRP, or any other cryptocurrency, is more like gambling and I understand for some people this is what they want but they should also accept that they are not trading; they are gambling. This is true especially when classical technical analysis is used. Nothing wrong with gambling\u200a\u2014\u200aand I don\u2019t use the term here in a negative sense. I only try to make the following point: there are differences between gambling and trading and the most significant one is that usually gamblers have no idea of what they are doing.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Altcoin News: Sharia-Certified Crypto Exchange Lists\u00a0XRP", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-news-sharia-certified-crypto-exchange-lists-xrp-6ec4932a93a6?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 21", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "9", "content": "Altcoin News: Sharia-Certified Crypto Exchange Lists\u00a0XRPMarch 21, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN\u00a0MAGAZINEMarko VidrihBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 21Cryptocurrency Exchange Rain from Bahrain, certified under Sharia law, announced the launch of trade XRP token.

Why? It attracted many new investors because it is easy to invest and it provides better returns than most of the hedge funds.Cryptocurrency trading is like a roller coaster ride that many are unable to digest. However, if they can be offered a less volatile option with comparable returns, most would probably jump into the fray.To cater to this requirement, scores of cryptocurrency index funds are cropping up. These are advertised to be less volatile, providing commensurate returns. If they can prove themselves over a bull and bear cycle, a bunch of new investors should flock to cryptocurrencies.As it is, the large investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Barclays are rumored to be laying the groundwork to start cryptocurrency trading desks. Their entry will increase the volume and deepen the markets.Finally, the traditional banking community is recognizing the importance of digital currencies. The latest boost was provided by a blog post by Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) where she outlined potential benefits of the cryptocurrencies.Many recent prices developments are giving us a feeling that the worst might be behind us and most of the virtual currencies will enter a bottom forming process.BTC/USDBitcoin has hardly gained any ground after breaking out of the descending channel on April 12. It is stuck between both moving averages. The bears are defending the 50-day SMA, whereas, the bulls are buying at the 20-day EMA.If the BTC/USD pair doesn\u2019t break out of the 50-day SMA within a couple of days, traders can raise their stops to breakeven or can close their positions. A failure to cross the overhead resistance will attract selling, which can sink the digital currency back towards the $6,757 levels.If the price breaks out of the 50-day SMA, a rally to $9,400 followed by a move to $10,000 is possible.ETH/USDFor the past four days, Ethereum has been taking support close to the $500 levels. Though the downtrend has ended, we are yet to see buying conviction return.The 20-day EMA has flattened out, while the 50-day SMA is still falling. The ETH/USD pair is stuck between these two moving averages.A breakout above the 50-day SMA can push prices towards $600 and then to $730 levels. On the other hand, a breakdown below the 20-day EMA can sink the cryptocurrency to $418 levels.We don\u2019t find a high conviction setup; hence, we are not suggesting a trade on it.BCH/USDAfter finding support at the 20-day EMA, Bitcoin Cash is moving towards the 50-day SMA. Previously, it has not faced any selling at this moving average. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t expect any major resistance at the 50-day SMA at the moment.Our target objective remains a rally to $1,114 levels where traders can book partial profits. The BCH/USD pair has a history of vertical rallies when it starts a new trend. Therefore, we suggest holding some position with a trailing stop loss.In case vertical rally does take place, traders can expect levels to see the price reaching $1,300 and $1,600 levels. The stops can be raised to $700 levels. We don\u2019t want to stick with the trade if it breaks below the 20-day EMA again.XRP/USDRipple did not correct to the support levels of $0.56270, as we had expected. It has been trading in a tight range of $0.613-$0.70789.The 20-day EMA is turning up and the 50-day SMA is flattening out. Chances of a bullish crossover have increased. If the bulls break out of this range, a rally to $0.83296 will be on the cards.Therefore, aggressive traders can initiate long positions on the XRP/USD pair at $0.71 with a stop loss of $0.61. Partial profits can be booked close to $0.83, and the remaining positions can be held with a trailing stop because a move above $0.83 can push the digital currency to $1 levels.If the price breaks down below $0.61, a decline to $0.56 is likely.XLM/USDStellar is moving towards our first target objective of $0.36, where it can face some resistance. Therefore, traders can book partial profits at this level and hold the rest for higher levels of about $0.47.The RSI has reached close to overbought levels; hence, a few days of consolidation can\u2019t be ruled out.The XLM/USD pair has broken out of a long downtrend. It can now either become range bound and build a base or start a new uptrend. The next dip will give us a better idea of the probable trend.LTC/USDWe have been neutral on Litecoin because we believe that it will face considerable resistance at the $141 mark. On April 17, prices broke out of this level but could not sustain it.The LTC/USD pair is again trying to break out of the range. A breakout will give it a pattern target of $168, but we anticipate another round of selling at the downtrend line.We shall turn positive if the virtual currency breaks out and sustains above the downtrend line. At the current levels, we don\u2019t find a buy setup with a good risk to reward ratio.ADA/BTCCardano reached very close to our target objective of 0.000035 on April 17 when it reached an intraday high of 0.00003405. In our previous analysis, we had recommended booking partial profits at 0.0000323 and trailing the stops higher.The RSI is close to the overbought levels, that\u2019s why a couple of days of consolidation is likely. On the downside, the 20-day EMA will act as strong support.The ADA/BTC pair will pick up momentum if it breaks out and sustains above 0.000035 levels. Therefore, traders can leave a small portion of their position open with the stop loss at breakeven.NEO/USDNEO is currently stuck between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA. It has been trading close to the $64 levels\u200a\u2014\u200aour recommended buy level\u200a\u2014\u200afor the past five days.A breakout of the 50-day SMA can carry the NEO/USD pair to the $80 levels where it will face considerable resistance from the downtrend line of the descending triangle.Therefore, we have revised our target down to $80 from $88. On the downside, strong support exists at the $64 levels. Any break of this will sink the cryptocurrency back towards the April 06 lows of $44.16. Therefore, we suggest reducing the risk by raising the stops to $54 levels.EOS/USDEOS is trying to start a new uptrend. It successfully completed a retest of the breakout levels and found support at $7.8 on April 15 and April 16.The EOS/USD pair is currently trading inside an ascending channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate bullishness.The current up move can face some resistance in the $9.5 to $10 zone. Therefore, we recommend booking partial profits around the $9.5 mark and holding the rest for a target objective of $11.The stop loss can be trailed higher to breakeven on half of the position, and the remaining half can be kept at $6, just below the support line of the ascending channel.Source", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Altcoin Analysis: ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency Review", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-analysis-eth-xrp-eos-ltc-cryptocurrency-review-77ab31ad0502?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 3", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "49", "content": "Altcoin Analysis: ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency ReviewMay 3, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN\u00a0MAGAZINEMarko VidrihBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 3The cryptocurrency market on the background of neutral news again added to capitalization, however, this time mainly due to the growth of BTC.Image credit: CoinMarketCapThe main indicator of the market grew to $186 billion, and we believe that if other coins are connected to growth in the near future, then the chances of getting out of a long consolidation of 169- $185 billion and a quick update of the current year highs will increase.EthereumIn ETH, a small position is maintained, although the coin, unlike BTC, does not yet show a clear dynamic. Now the price is in the local maximum of May 30 and we believe that if the bulls can stand up and move the char at least 1% higher in the coming hours, the likelihood of a quick impulse will sharply increase, which will allow us to increase our position with the ability to place a short stop-loss order. While at this stage we remain in position and carefully observe the dynamics of cryptocurrency. Stop below the blue trend line.RippleFor XRP chart can be said that it stuck to the red line and cannot decide on the direction of further movement. In our opinion, in the current situation, it is more correct to wait for any hints and tips from the market, and only after that to make decisions on whether or not to include this asset in the portfolio. While the technical image looks in such a way that in order to be able to speak with confidence about the beginning of the growth phase, the chart needs to pass the level of $0.31.EOSThe price of EOS came close to the red resistance line, the breakdown of which would open up opportunities for the formation of a long position. While it cannot be noted that there are any signs of individuality in the coin. The dynamics of the market, and on the face of a clear lag behind the market indicators of BTC in the last week. However, trading this asset, it is necessary to execute all the signals of the trading approach, otherwise, you can noticeably lose in efficiency. If in the coming hours' chart remain above $4.85, a signal will appear to buy for the first part of the limit.LitecoinThe price of LTC has reached the key level of $75 for the second time in the last week, but so far the bullish trend, apparently, is not ready at current prices. We believe that we just need to wait for a while for the market itself to tell us the most likely direction of movement. While the trading plan is such that in the event of a breakdown of the green line, we will include a coin in the portfolio, not forgetting about placing a stop-loss order.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

With an expected surge of jobs in tech, particularly, this puts women at a serious earning disadvantage.While a gender skills gap certainly exists, let\u2019s not ignore the elephant in the room\u200a\u2014\u200athere are several other reasons why women might be hesitant to pursue a career in tech. Last week\u2019s nauseating report on UploadVR\u2019s treatment of female employees is enough to put anyone off, regardless of a higher pay package.Sadly, these reports aren\u2019t anomalous. A recent US study found that one in ten women working in tech experience unwanted sexual attention, and nearly one in four people of colour face stereotyping. So, you can hardly blame women, and women in colour in particular, for believing that tech might not be the best sector for them.The lack of gender diversity in tech presents three big issues: discrimination, unappealing workplaces and a lack of safe learning environments.At Chayn, we believe in equal opportunities and ending workplace discrimination. This is where Ammal, a digital skills sharing network, providing free classes for self-identifying women, was born. Launched with the following plan, Ammal promised to: \u201ccreate an open and collaborative network of women who support and empower each other by passing on the skills they have and the skills they\u2019ve learned to other women.\u201dChayn is a D-I-Y, tech for good charity, formed by founder Hera Hussain when she realised the lack of resources available to women in abusive relationships. Ammal came from a similar attitude of \u2018if it\u2019s not yet available, create it\u2019. Meaning action and hope in Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, Ammal hopes to incite these very values and emotions in its attendees, encouraging attendees to pass skills gained onto other women in their life, upskilling via a ripple effect.Talking about how she first got the idea to set up Ammal, Chayn volunteer, Jessica Morley shared: \u201cWe set up Ammal because we noticed that there was a real need to increase the representation of women in tech, but very often women lacked confidence in their tech skills or didn\u2019t know how to access relevant education.\u201dShe added, \u201cThis was particularly true of women who wouldn\u2019t necessarily have access to formal education routes. Ammal was set up to fill these gaps.\u201dWith courses covering topics like logo design, personal branding, the freelance hustle and careers sessions on improving employability, Ammal was launched in 2015.The pilot was funded by UnLtd, providing sessions to 16\u201330 year olds in Tower Hamlets, London. Following the first session on \u201cHow to get Hired\u201d, the feedback received was extremely positive. While 100% of attendees said that they will pass on skills gained to other women they know, a staggering 92% said that they would recommended Ammal to a friend.The ripple effect had\u00a0begun.Garance Mourgaud, who attended the \u2018How to get Hired\u2019 workshop and thereafter became a Chayn volunteer herself, found in Ammal, a safe and supportive environment she hadn\u2019t previously experienced:\u201cSome young women can have a tendency to compete and fight each other instead of supporting one another. Ammal aims to empower young women through knowledge sharing and network support.\u201d Garance shared \u201cThis workshop gave me basic yet strong skills and tools to keep teaching myself, and above all, gave me the confidence to keep trying.\u201dPicture courtesy: Catherine BridgemanAmmal organiser, Afsa Akbar agreed that it\u2019s this supportive environment that makes Ammal unique:\u201cOne of our attendees on a recent Wordpress for beginners course had been wanting to learn how to use Wordpress for a while but had found the online courses unhelpful. She wasn\u2019t confident in learning digital skills and wanted someone to show her how to use it, face to face. Attending Ammal and having female organisers take her through it, step-by-step, gave her the confidence to be able to build her own website and apply this valuable skill in her own work.\u201dIn November 2016, following the success of the U.K. branch, the next chapter of Ammal was born, with a bootcamp of four workshops held in Lahore, Pakistan. Female attendees were provided with a crash course on career planning, professional development, CV writing, interview training, and basic digital skills that improve employability.Following the Lahore workshop, many of the attendees volunteered to speak at future bootcamps. However, like the London chapter, Ammal is now working to set these offers in stone, working with MakeSense to figure out how to incentivise attendees to continue passing on their skills gained, with the aim of scaling the initiatives so that they can be replicated nationally, and globally.Ammal is certainly living out its name and we at Chayn are very hopeful that we will be able to deliver workshops through this project in order to upskill women globally.With women supporting one another, Ammal founder Jessica believes these bold plans are certainly possible:\u201cThe main lesson I\u2019ve learned from Ammal is how important it is for women to support women. It\u2019s incredibly important and incredibly powerful.\u201d", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Future of Food Vol 6: Ripple\u00a0Foods", "author_name": "Taylor Bauldwin", "link": "https://medium.com/land-and-ladle/future-of-food-vol-6-ripple-foods-541734451f3d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 30, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "14", "content": "Future of Food Vol 6: Ripple\u00a0FoodsTaylor BauldwinBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 30, 2017Milk has become somewhat of a talking point recently.

He added:\u201cWe can comfortably say that we expect to release the world\u2019s first XRP ETP within the next two months.\u201dAmun has also received permission to issue ETP, associated with four more cryptocurrency assets, including BCH, LTC, XLM, and EOS. Although the exact time to launch these products has not yet been determined and will depend on customer interest, he said that the company plans to add to the listing all approved cryptocurrency ETP on SIX by the end of this year.SIX Exchange agreed to launch ETP, which tracks the basket of the largest cryptocurrencies, in November 2018. This product was released by Amun for retail and institutional investors under the ticker HODL. In the past few weeks, Amun has also released Bitcoin and ether based ETP. Rashwan added that today most buyers of cryptocurrency ETP are located in Switzerland, while foreign investors also get access to Swiss markets in accordance with the laws on securities of their countries.Currently, SIX is creating its own crypto-asset exchange, seeking to use distributed registry technology to speed up calculations and trade in tokenized assets. Recently, the R3 Corda Enterprise platform was selected for this purpose. SIX Digital Exchange is scheduled to launch in the second half of 2019. In this regard, Rashvan said:\u201cI don\u2019t think we will have a real licensed and regulated securities token exchange with a professional partner in a reputable country until late this year or early next year\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s my guess.

Since Friday, the growth rate of capitalization amounted to 2.1% to a value of $145 billion.The news background is now more neutral or weakly positive, there is an increase in volumes in a number of liquid instruments.BitcoinAt BTC, the bulls were able to overcome the $4,050 mark, which had been acting as resistance for the past two weeks. It is best to place a stop in an open position in the area of \u200b\u200blocal minima within the emerging trend continuation formation ($4,070- $4,080), while it is necessary to take into account the possible increase in volatility at this point. At the moment, the price is attempting another update of the highs, and in the case of a successful price fixing above $4,140, \u200b\u200bit will be possible to increase the share of the coin in the portfolio with the transfer of the protective order.EthereumAt ETH, short-term traders using the impulse approach witnessed a false breakdown of the level of resistance that occurred at higher volumes. In our case, the purchase orders worked, however, upon the return of quotations back to the trading range, the entire position, taking into account the one bought earlier, was eliminated. Over the past two weeks, the market has twice seen a false breakdown in this coin, in connection with which the conclusion about the adjustment of the current strategy, taking into account the amplitude-frequency characteristics of price movements. It is possible that the next update of the highs makes sense to skip in order to confirm or refute the assumption of changes in market characteristics. We remain out of position for this instrument until the situation is clarified.RippleIn the XRP breakdown of local resistance happened and the position has been increased. Now the share of the coin in the portfolio is held. Currently, the chart is moving within an uptrend, and the blue line can be used as a level for placing a protective order. Immediate goals are $0.32 and $0.342.EOSAt EOS, it was not possible to pass resistance at the level of monthly highs from the first time; as a result, the market forced us to take profit on the breakdown of a protective stop order. We still note that there are buyers in the instrument, so after some consolidation, we do not rule out another attempt to move above $4.40. At the same time, we believe that much will depend on the overall market dynamics, therefore, in the event of a decline in the entire market, we consider the scenario of chart movement to the level of $4 per 1 EOS coin, as quite probable.LitecoinIn LTC, the situation has not changed significantly. The chart is still in the range of $58- $62. It is worth noting that in recent days there has been a narrowing of the trading range and consolidation near the upper border. In our opinion, in case of a breakdown of the $62 mark, one can open long positions. We believe that long-term consolidation could benefit the bulls, as it allowed the coin to clear itself of impatient speculators, and for large participants to form the necessary positions in terms of volume.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Because of this, the foundation set aside 20 billion STR to periodically give away to BTC/XRP holders. Comments from Stellar.org on the program details:\u201cDecentralized payment network Stellar has announced the final round of its Bitcoin-Lumen Program, where Bitcoin holders can claim its lumen token for free. The program, which began in April 2016, features 19 percent of the total lumen supply, which developers reserved at launch exclusively for Bitcoin users. Of the 19 bln lumens on offer, only 3 bln formed the first round of the giveaway, that was concluded in October 2016. with release details of the remaining 16 bln to be officially announced on March 28.The value of the remaining tokens is approximately $16 mln.\u201dThe STR claim for XRP/BTC holders will end two-months after it begins:\u201cOn June 27th, 2017, we will make available these lumens to any bitcoin holder who wants them, including those that received lumens during the first giveaway round\u201d, says the company in its circular.Seems pretty altruistic and cool, but as you can see in the picture above there is a major increase in the STR volume and price. Cryptocurrency \u2018pump and dumps\u2019 seem to be occurring far too often and those that get sucked into them without knowing how to hedge from the risk can get harmed badly. Here is the original post I found about the giveaway:So, STR has clearly seen a bump up in price the last week per the picture above. It may be a speculation, but there is a major pump going on across Bitcoin (BTC), Stellar (STR), and Ripple (XRP) right now and XRP just passed up Ethereum (ETH) in market capitalization\u2026what\u2019s going to happen here? Looks like a potential mess waiting to happen if you\u2019re not aware of what may be some of the major driving factors.Has anyone participated in a giveaway like this before?In order to protect ourselves as cryptocurrency holders and members of the Steem community, will a 19 billion STR giveaway affect other cryptocurrencies?How might this affect STEEM?\u00a0Currently, there are only 9 billion STR in circulation.Will this cause massive decreases in STR/BTC/XRP prices once the STR is distributed to BTC/XRP holders?Will STR prices see a decrease in price considering the inflow of coins? Or will we see an opportunistic pumper come in and manipulate?What will happen with other currencies that are dependent on BTC/ETH?I enjoy writing about current and thought provoking happenings along with spreading awareness for specific events like this. Steemit is an awesome community to be a part of so far and I\u2019m excited to connect with more Steemians!!

This fantastic organization helps veterans prepare for careers outside the military. Their focus is to help provide training, mentorship and job placement for Salesforce Cloudsource technology careers.The men and women that I\u2019ve met through this great organization never cease to amaze me. Their grit and determination coupled with their willingness to embrace new challenges and conquer new skills is so inspiring.I was blessed to share some thoughts about the importance of connecting and building one\u2019s network the right way with Mervis\u2019 latest class. We talked about networking opportunities, interview strategies and ultimately how to relate some of their military experience to the benefit of their potential employer.To say this was an engaged audience would be an understatement.In speaking with this organization, as well as others that support our transitioning military, it amazes me how nervous many of these incredibly talented men and women are to make the transition to civilian life. I feel like the military could do way more to help these American heroes be better prepared for a life and career outside of the service.That\u2019s why the work that organizations like the Mervis Foundation doare so important.In my time presenting to these transitioning military audiences, it surprises me how difficult it is for many of these folks to get jobs out in the civilian sector. If you ask me, there is a large talent pool that often many employers and certainly recruiters miss when seeking candidates. These men and women show a level of dedication, commitment and a willingness to learn like no others.They just need a chance.The transition from their military career into a civilian job doesn\u2019t always translate directly into a potential job opportunity. Often times this undermines a candidate\u2019s confidence in what positions they even apply for. Many of the conversations I have with these men and women revolve around helping them associate their experience from their military service by expanding upon what they\u2019ve learned through their last career\u200a\u2014\u200aproblem solving, teamwork, asset management and leadership are all relevant experiences that can and will benefit a potential employer.These skills are an asset to a company of any size yet, hard to quantify and truly explain in a resume. Unfortunately these potential super stars of tomorrow are often overlooked because the resume doesn\u2019t quite tell the story of their experience and how it might benefit an organization.That\u2019s why they need our help.I implore anyone in hiring capacity to look closely into any candidate with military experience that applies for a position with your organization.The resume may not quite tell you why you need to spend some time with the candidate but trust me you do! If you will just take a chance and sit down with them, ask them about some of their experiences in the military and what they\u2019ve learned because of it and just allow a conversation to happen, you will be impressed. I have no doubt you will discover someone you might have otherwise overlooked. Someone willing to give it their all not because they have to but because they want to. It\u2019s ingrained in their DNA.They\u2019ll put in the time to learn whatever you put in front of them. They\u2019ll work harder, smarter and get more done than you could possibly imagine. They\u2019ll prove to you and to themselves what an incredible asset they can be to your company.They just need a chance.This isn\u2019t hyperbole, I actual proved this out in my former company and continue to do some with one of my software companies today. My very best hires all have military experience. In every single circumstance on paper they weren\u2019t necessarily a match for the job I was seeking to fill at the time but I took a chance. I believed they could learn. I believed they could adapt. I believe that they could be a valuable asset to my companies and treated them as such from day one.To say they all surpassed my expectations would be an understatement.I can honestly say I will continue to build my companies around more of these ex-military heroes. Not because they need the charity of a job but because they are likely some of the most loyal and result-focused employees I could possibly hire. I can grow a company with people like that. People who genuinely care as much as I do about the mission and will be there in a pinch to provide cover and support for \u201ctheir\u201d team.And when you invest a little in someone who is hungry, focused and committed to the mission ahead, well my friend you have just created the ultimate Ripple for them, for you and for your company.Get out of the way, these heroes are ready to work.Ripple On!!!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Ripple, xRapid, XRP\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Game Changer of Transfering Value?", "author_name": "John Saddington", "link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/ripple-xrapid-xrp-the-game-changer-of-transfering-value-7febc737ef8b?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 18, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "52", "content": "Ripple, xRapid, XRP\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Game Changer of Transfering Value?John SaddingtonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 18, 2018Ripple, xRapid, and XRP are trying to convince people it\u2019s a game-changer.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "3 Big Problems Ripple Investors Cannot Ignore\u200a\u2014\u200a#OPINION", "author_name": "John Saddington", "link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/3-big-problems-ripple-investors-cannot-ignore-opinion-bdf067c02ab4?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 29, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "4", "content": "3 Big Problems Ripple Investors Cannot Ignore\u200a\u2014\u200a#OPINIONJohn SaddingtonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 29, 2018Here are a few things that Ripple Investor should know about\u2026", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How and Where to Buy\u00a0Ripple", "author_name": "\u017diga P. \u0160kraba", "link": "https://medium.com/kriptomat-blog/how-and-where-to-buy-ripple-99a763ac41b1?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 22", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "12", "content": "How and Where to Buy\u00a0Ripple\u017diga P. \u0160krabaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 22Ripple has been getting more and more attention in the last couple of years.

Each time you sign in to the Kriptomat, you receive an SMS with a unique code that you must enter into the appropriate dialog box.Two-factor (2FA) is an additional security layer for our clients\u200a\u2014\u200ahelping to address the vulnerabilities of a standard password-only approach. In today\u2019s online environment, the rudimentary \u201cusername and password\u201d approach to security is easy prey for cybercriminals especially in cases where money is involved. Many log-ins can be compromised in minutes, and private data (such as personal and financial details) is under increasing threat.The cryptocurrency environment is constantly attracting malicious actors to cause tons of digital funds are on the table. 2FA adds another layer of security, supplementing the username and password model with a code that only a specific user has access to (typically sent to something they have immediately to hand). This authentication method can be easily summed up as a combination of \u201csomething you have and something you know\u201d.How to enable Google AuthenticatorWhen logging into a site supporting Authenticator (including Google services) or using Authenticator-supporting third-party applications such as password managers or file hosting services, Authenticator generates a six- to an eight-digit one-time password which users must enter in addition to their usual login details.

A cryptocurrency wallet is a secure digital wallet used to store, send and receive digital currency like Bitcoin. Most coins have an official wallet built by the coin\u2019s team. In order to use cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll need to use a cryptocurrency wallet.At this point in time, there are wallets which can handle more than one cryptocurrency. Of course there are ones that are built specifically for one coin too. Every wallet has two important features. A public address, which you can share with other people so that they can send you funds. You can think of this as you IBAN number.The second feature is your private key. This is a secret code that you should never share with anyone. Anyone with access to your private key can remove all your funds from your wallet. Think of the private key as your bank account password. It is used for proving an address is owned by you.A wallet is essentially like your online bank account, and your address is like your account number. The blockchain is like the bank\u2019s ledger, and your private key is like your password.

It\u2019s an open source distribution system that is in the beta stage. Many people still think that ripple is the generic name of a digital electronic money. The ripple network was launched in 2012 with the goal of making it easy for people to use banking, paypal, credit cards or financial institutions at an extremely low cost with a fast speed. Ripple uses blockchain chaining technology similar to the Bitcoin virtual currency, which helps accelerate the pace of financial transactions between banks.Ripple development teamRipple coin / protocol was developed and developed by OpenCoin, which\u00a0: Chris Larsen is chief executive officer and chief technology officer Jed McCaleb. Larsen is the co-founder and also the chief financial officer of E-LOAN and finally, McCaleb is from Mt. Gox. Plus, many other members of the Ripple are experts in virtual currency research, especially they are very knowledgeable about the Bitcoin platform.Is Ripple a replicate of Bitcoin\u00a0?It\u2019s a sure thing that while learning about Ripple, many people will wonder is Ripple the same with Bitcoin virtual currency? The answer is \u201cthey have some mutual points \u201c. For example, the XRP unit of the Ripple is a digital based pre-type that works on mathematical formulas and limited release quantities. Both Bitcoin and Ripple use peer-to-peer P2P networks, which means that transactions do not require third party interference. Along with that, the anti-counterfeiting or inflation of these two currencies is similar.However, the reason of Ripple being created was to support Bitcoin, not to become a competitor. The Ripple network is designed to serve currency transfers seamlessly, whether it\u2019s any of the national currencies: USD, British Pound, Euro or even Bitcoin.XRP is a distributed network so it does not depend on any company or organization to manage, so the data and transaction information are guaranteed to be safe, without waiting for confirmation that can go over the network quickly.Ripple\u2019s ratingAccording to the developers of Ripple, there will be about 100 billion XRPs released, half will be held by the company, the other half will be circulated in the market. When KriptoA were writing this article, the price of the Ripple is $ 0.167788 and has a total market capitalization of more than $ 6 billion, which is more than 3 million BTC.The Price Of RippleIf you are interested in this type of currency, you can monitor the rate of Ripple in every single day to understand the price fluctuation of it.

Ripple has so far reached $ 93 million- an extremely impressive number for a start-up company set up in 2012. According to the Coindesk site, the amount of money Ripple is ranked 4th in the segment of the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Services.

Ripple wants to expand further and develop capabilities for new groups. We are rushing to recruit more, and increase the number of programmers to work directly with partner banks in their own country. Only then can we offer the best solutions to our partners. \u201cFollowing the newly established office in Luxemburg, the next destination that Ripple is targeting is Frankfurt (Germany) and Singapore and many other destinations.

It is a common metaphor in social science literature, however it has never been properly defined and expounded as a useful concept beyond the turn of phrase. I believe it can be studied successfully using systems, cybernetic, and network theories and models of the globalized world.Moreover, simply as a literary metaphor, it has underutilized potential in the public \u2018global village\u2019 discourse. The mere suggestion of it as a measurable concept may turn off scholars as it implies a sheer incalculability of effects. We are, after all, talking about actual multi-dimensional ripple effects in social systems, not a tranquil pond.Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t make contemplating our own actions any less important or constructive, especially in the context of the continuing collapse of the global and local into one another. Given the poignancy, utility, and currency of other related concepts such as the \u2018ecological footprint\u2019, \u2018carbon footprint\u2019, and \u2018water footprint\u2019, the \u2018ripple effect\u2019 should be considered for empirical development as a metric for one\u2019s social impact on the world.Sometimes there are directly observable consequences to our actions, but for the most part the effects of our daily routines are unseen in any intelligible way. We see global environmental devastation and social strife on the news but we remain completely dumbfounded as to our contribution to these effects, and we\u2019re at just as much of a loss to know how make a difference for the better.While the risks we face are systemic and seemingly beyond our control, on some level one must reduce society to its individual unit: You. To this effect, risk theorist Ulrich Beck writes,\u201cWhatever propels risk and makes it incalculable, whatever provokes the institutional crisis at the level of the governing regime and the markets, shifts the ultimate decision-making responsibility onto the individuals, who are ultimately left to their own devices with their partial and biased knowledge, with undecidability and multiple layers of uncertainty.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aUlrich BeckHere it would seem that our ripple effects are so incalculable that it would be an encumbrance to stop and consider them. Decision makers are expected to do their job with incomplete information. Consequently, they aren\u2019t held accountable when shit hits the fan. This leads us to make decisions and take actions with a sort of indifference or amoral conscience. More specifically, the complexity of it all engenders a sort of wilful ignorance. Along these lines, the famed sociologist Max Weber wrote,\u201cIn the great majority of cases actual action goes on in a state of inarticulate half-consciousness or actual unconsciousness of its subjective meaning. The actor is more likely to \u201cbe aware\u201d of it in a vague sense than he is to \u201cknow\u201d what he is doing or be explicitly self-conscious about it. In most cases his action is governed by impulse or habit.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMax WeberThus, the maxim knowledge is power is largely incomplete. First of all, it is more accurate to say that knowledge is power when applied, but highest formulation and most noble would be to say true knowledge applied correctly is conducive to power that is constructive, and thus, more good.Finally, it is not complete unless we reflexively understand the positive or negative effects of our individual power and reform our action accordingly. Thus, Weber\u2019s point highlights the importance of individual reflexivity. By that I mean, we need to continually learn how we create ripple effects are, and what the outcomes they produce.In the global village in which we now live, we must appreciate the effects of our actions on both the micro and macro scales. Our mere participation in society has consequences across the globe. Sociologist Norman Long writes,\u201cparticular social interactions and decisions have a ripple effect on more distant social arenas, or over time create emergent sets of relations that form larger-scale systems or fields of action.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aNormal LongThis is only becoming truer as global integration increase and technology shrinks temporal and spatial aspects of the globe. Every individual shares culpable for problems we co-create and the burden of living together. We need to take responsibility for ripple effects we send out, causing the current crises, even though its difficult to see how. As Ulrich Beck writes,\u201cwho in a legally relevant sense \u2018causes\u2019 pollution, or a financial crises, is difficult to determine, since these events are the result of interactions among many individuals.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aUlrich BeckTaking responsibility begins with a sociological imagination, and continues with expanding ones awareness from their physical reach to the entire earth. It is virtually impossible to disassociate ourselves from the negative effects and byproducts of our levels of consumption and destruction, but this abstract metaphor takes us a long way to becoming aware and finding ways to critique our own relationship to the world.It\u2019s worth mentioning too that we can\u2019t talk about ripple effects without also talking about the butterfly effect, tipping points, and negative externalities.The ripple effect should be distinguished from the \u2018butterfly effect\u2019, a term from chaos theory, which stipulates that a small action in a complex system can be amplified and produce large effects elsewhere in the system. The ripple effect may have more relative application in considering the aggregate effect of individual actions.Therefore, global problems such as pollution, poverty, corruption, systemic ignorance, which are caused by no primary actor, can be explained by the ripple effect, as based on the aggregate empowerment of individuals. Another related term is the \u2018domino effect\u2019 which implies Newtonian transference of energy in a linear system.A tipping point is also different in that it can refer to crossing thresholds, achieving critical mass, or virality. When something reaches a tipping point, the returns on the action can be unexpectedly and unpredictably large, as other facts in the system catalyze and react with the input(s). In the context of sociology, a tipping point indicates a rapid change in behaviour of a group, be it positive or negative. Might I say that we need to reach a tipping point in how we consider our ripple effects.In economics, a negative externality is a cost incurred against a person who had nothing to do with the transaction that created it. (Air) pollution is the typical example. There are direct individual consequences to this (people die from exposure), but more important is the abstract aggregate effect. Anthropogenic climate change is the ultimate catastrophic result of the billions of little acts of pollution.Civilization is deeply interconnected, and all our actions send ripple effects into the world which produce aggregate devastation. Inequality, climate change, racism, war, poverty, terrorism, collapse. For all of these things the complexity outdoes us, and we can\u2019t allow it any longer.

Well, considering that today Ripple has a 17% share, then $1 trillion is the least possible figure. Ripple has involved too many giant companies to make simply go out of the radar.Now, if we check the current market cap which is $120 billion at the moment,and set a target of $1 trillion, which is backed by analysts\u2019 opinions about the whole crypto market, then we may expect Ripple to grow by 9 times.Thus, Ripple\u2019s price can go well above $20.

Ripple was created to connect digital asset exchanges, payment providers and banks via RippleNet for frictionless money transfers globally.

Ripple will be the first of these new digital assets to be listed on the exchange.The recent approval from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) for the GBX to be awarded a full DLT licence, coupled with our new insurance policy, has certified our institutional-grade status. The GBX is the first fully regulated digital asset exchange to be owned by a traditional stock exchange; the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX). Our good governance, transparency, and best practices have been brought over from the team\u2019s experience within the global capital markets.Nick Cowan, CEO of the GSX Group, commented on onboarding Ripple, stating:\u201cRipple needs no introduction; it is one of the top contenders within the growing blockchain industry. Ripple aims to re-shape the old methods of finance and banking, in many ways similar to our work at the GSX Group, transforming the capital markets through blockchain technology. XRP is traded across exchanges globally, and it is only fitting that the GBX-DAX extends that liquidity and connection.

The CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) is a ballot measure set for November 2018, backed by a small team, including a local real estate developer, a former financial executive, and a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst. While several major major tech companies initially opposed the measure, Facebook recently withdrew from the fight. Recent Cambridge Analytica data leaks have added a poignancy to Facebook\u2019s role in protecting user data.\u201cSeveral countries and states in the U.S. have followed GDPR with similar privacy initiatives. Use public support for the initiative to your advantage.\u201dTWEET THISThe CCPA has strong momentum to pass. If it does not, swelling popularity for the legislation is still a call for California companies to clean up their data policies and protect their customers.CCPA: Major Points to\u00a0KnowThe CCPA would give consumers three major rights:Ask companies to disclose what consumer data they have collected.Demand that companies not sell the data or share with third parties for business purposes.Sue or fine companies that violate the law.Broken down further, the CCPA asks that businesses that collect personal data disclose the categories of information they are obtaining. If a business opts to sell this information, they must explain to individuals what categories of data they are selling and to whom. If an individual does not want their information sold, the CCPA gives them the right to maintain a consistent level of service and steady costs (i.e., not be discriminated against for not consenting). Under the act, companies are required to clearly display a link that says \u201cdo not sell my data\u201d at the bottom of any page that collects personal information. The CCPA also increases fines and penalties for companies that do not take reasonable measures to secure consumer data (as California law already requires).The act applies only to businesses that earn $50,000,000 a year in revenue, sell 100,000 consumers\u2019 records each year, or derive 50% of their annual revenue by selling personal information. Similar to the GDPR, all businesses that sell or collect personal information from Californians, even if they are located outside of California (i.e., Seattle-based Amazon), must comply with the CCPA.The measure\u2019s backers currently have >600,000 signatures, nearly 2X the 366,000 minimum requirement. Present private and public sector coalition backers include the Consumer Federation of California, DuckDuckGo, Consumer Reports, BLUR, DeleteMe, Catalina\u2019s List, the Center for Public Interest Law, the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, and the Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine.Read the full initiative here.The Bad\u00a0NewsThe practice of collecting consumer data has expanded without regulation for years. Many companies have rapidly built themselves on this information, which underpins their marketing, product development, industry research, and corporate strategy. Now, they must make major operational changes, such as:Tighten and clearly communicate the process whereby customers can request access to their data, have it erased, or transfer it to another data controller.Create new systems with better user management and/or potentially hire more IT staff.Consider outsourcing core services to a managed services provider.Work with pared-down data sets in the event that consumers withdraw their information.California companies that process the data of EU residents are also subject to the same noncompliance fine that EU companies are (the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of the global annual revenue) as the GDPR deadline approaches on May 25.Figuring out what to do to bring your company into compliance has never been more important.The Good\u00a0NewsSince California is a hotbed of startups, many young and medium-sized teams are flexible by nature. In contrast to industries like insurance, where many teams have processes set in stone over decades, many tech companies are more nimble and willing to adapt to changing circumstances. Already, companies are sending out updated privacy-policy emails to their customers:With the push to comply with the GDPR, and in anticipation of similar regulations like the CCPA, teams are quickly taking action. In addition to email, some best practices are arising on the back end, including identity and access tools, specialized managed service providers, and enhanced anomaly protections for suspicious user behavior.\u201cAuth0 has anomaly detection to protect consumer information.\u201dTWEET THISAnomaly DetectionMany companies are taking advantage of anomaly detection tools to ensure that the users accessing consumer information are (1) who they say they are and (2) behaving appropriately. With large companies giving access to a wide swath of users both internally (IT staff, marketers, managers) and externally (third-party contractors or consultants), it can be difficult to figure out who is logging in when and from where, and who is using what device(s). Implementing identity access and management tools that incorporate anomaly detection can be essential for avoiding fraudulent practices.With Auth0, anomaly detection is customizable. Once enabled, you can set rules that alert administrators to any suspicious activity and block login attempts by specific users if, say, they are working with data they do not have authorization to use or they fail to enter the system with the correct password.Teams have been testing and finding early successes with these and other new features, like user dashboard views. Even if you\u2019re not a hot tech startup, you still have the advantage of proximity to some of the most cutting-edge technologies and resources in the world.Seize the opportunityInstead of facing the CCPA with anxiety or opposition, use the public support for such a measure to your advantage. Get ahead of the curve in rolling out privacy features to your users on the front end, improve your back-end policies with better identity and access management software to protect your customers, and build a reputable brand in difficult times.About Auth0Auth0, a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), provides thousands of enterprise customers with a Universal Identity Platform for their web, mobile, IoT, and internal applications.

The news background is neutral.BitcoinBTC still maintains the status of the most technical coin we are considering. After working out the correction in the area of \u200b\u200bthe blue trend line and providing a number of good opportunities for the consistent formation of a long position, the price of a cryptocurrency pair moved higher.

Stop loss at $7800.EthereumETH chart did not come close to the blue trend line to give an opportunity to acquire a significant share in the portfolio.

At the same time, a small local trend is forming, and this may eventually turn out to be a turning point for this correction, so after buying the first part of the limit, if the red line is broken, you can already look for an opportunity to increase the size of the position.

Stop loss below the blue trend line.EOSIn EOS, the price movement is also very similar in shape to the ETH and XRP charts, with the exception that the chart is currently below the blue trend line, which, from the point of view of trading practice, presumes some time pause until more certainty. At the same time, it is worth noting that the formation of a local uptrend also takes place, so if the entire market moves, the coin will not stand aside and if the maximum of 15 May is updated, there will be a good opportunity to include EOS in the portfolio.LitecoinIn LTC, after correction, the local trend also forms above the support line, so we believe that it is already possible to gradually form a long position, while not forgetting that until recently LTC had a noticeable weakness relative to other liquid coins on the cryptocurrency market.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Trading volumes in most cryptocurrencies fell. The market capitalization rate added 2.3% from Wednesday and is now at $175 billion.Now, when interest in cryptocurrency has sharply increased again, when a large number of participants joined the growth, stayed long and waiting for another growth wave, the market needs a pause, to digest what happened. Profitable trades often become profitable, because buying decisions were made long before the revaluation took place, so from the point of view of trading practices, it is not always rational to increase their trading activity in the circumstances that have already happened.BitcoinThe price of BTC at the next update of the maximum did not reach the level of $5300, after which it was corrected. Volumes at the same time significantly decreased. Current movements occur at heightened volatility, which is the natural behavior of most market instruments after rapid changes in price levels. There is no reason to say that the correction is over and soon we will see a new wave of growth.On the contrary, we believe that participants will need more time to get used to new levels, so now we are watching the dynamics from the outside. In the case of the emergence of a new local uptrend, it is possible that points with an acceptable profit/risk ratio will appear on the chart, and then it will be possible to look for a moment to open a new long position.EthereumIn the ETH, the price, after updating the maximum, rolled back down by 12% and is currently making recovery attempts against the background of high volatility. In order to make any predictions, first of all, you need to wait for the volatility to decrease, after which, depending on the patterns, it will be possible to evaluate the technical picture and, possibly, make new rates. In the current situation, we estimate the likelihood of movement both up and down, approximately 50/50, so we stand aside until the moment when the passions in the market finally subside and the emotions of the participants return to a calm state.RippleXRP is in the area of \u200b\u200bhighs, however, looking at the chart, it should be noted that on the background of high volatility, speculators\u2019 emotions are going wild, which makes it impossible to open a new long position with little risk. In the current situation, the decision to stand aside so as not to cut all the profits earned will probably be correct. It is important to take a pause and look at everything that happens with a sober mind. As a rule, the statistics of successful trading indicates that all quality transactions are made until the moment when excessive emotions are present on the market. It is possible that the formation of a new local trend, where there will be points for opening a position with little risk, will give the opportunity for the emergence of new trading ideas.EOSIn EOS, after updating the highs, the price went upwards to about 8% and then corrected. As in the other instruments we are considering, we consider it important, first of all, to wait for the volatility indicators to decline to normal levels before making any trading decisions. In this case, it is difficult to predict the depth and duration of the correction with a high degree of accuracy; moreover, the current formations do not imply a low risk, and therefore, even in the case of long opening, its size will be quite small. In this connection, we are waiting for the formation of a new local trend and reduction of volatility, after which we will look for new entry points.LitecoinLTC is the only coin in which we considered the possibility of re-opening a position by a small volume in the case of updating highs. Expectations were met, and all positions were covered by a sliding foot. Now we consider it important for some time to observe the current dynamics from the outside in order to feel the pulse of the market and, by the nature of the transactions concluded by other participants, to assess the current, and possibly future, moods.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

The market capitalization is $184 billion, which is 5% higher than Friday, but in most cryptocurrency pairs prices are locked inside trading ranges, although they are close to their upper boundaries.When calculating the size of the position being opened, it should be borne in mind that despite the fact that the volatility indicators have fallen, they are still at values \u200b\u200bsignificantly higher than those before growth on April 2, which reflects some uncertainty and nervousness in the actions of traders.BitcoinCharts of BTC for several days at relatively low volumes smoothly approached the level of the previous maximum of April 3, where they stopped. Volatility has decreased and now from a technical point of view, it is important whether the price will be able to consolidate above the resistance level and whether bulls are ready to buy at prices higher than the current ones. We believe that it will be difficult to do it the first time, however, in the case of a breakdown, we see the possibility of forming a new long position with an acceptable profit/risk ratio.EthereumETH was able to break through the highs, but at the breakdown point the charts strongly deviated from the uptrend line, and therefore the opening of the position would be associated with an increased risk. In our opinion, it makes sense to wait for the price to return to the blue line, and local overbought in the instrument will go away, after which, depending on market conditions, a good entry point may appear.RippleXRP has already tried to break through resistance at $0.37 three times in recent days. Now, when volatility has decreased, possible points for opening a new position have become more clearly visible on the chart. This can be done either in case of breakdown of resistance, or when approaching the blue trend line. In both cases, the stop will be short and the risks are low. The emerging triangle increases the chances that after some time we will see another wave of the upward movement.EOSAt EOS, nothing interesting happens so far, the price moves in a wide range and trading from purchases within this range will only be possible if the quotes approach the lower limit. We are watching how the events will develop in the market as a whole, and if there is a confident breakdown of the upper boundary, we will also consider this coin for inclusion in the speculative portfolio.LitecoinLTC looks more technical. A local trend has formed and the probability of a breakdown of the upper boundary of the triangle increases. Now charts are in the area of \u200b\u200bthe trend line, and we are making a small test purchase. The stop is short, below the green line, and if the quotes are fixed above the resistance, a window will appear to increase the proportion of the coin in the portfolio with the transfer of the protective order.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

It has taken a beating this year and is down 43.1 percent year to date.However, funds that are market makers and who trade in arbitrage strategies are having a field day, as some have gained 30 percent in the first quarter.This shows that whatever the market condition, the traders can always develop a strategy to profit from it.The miners are not that lucky. According to Morgan Stanley, the miners of Bitcoin will remain unprofitable if prices remain below $8,600.The big problem is that no one knows how to evaluate the leading cryptocurrency. The targets range from $100 to $100,000 and higher, but when prices don\u2019t fall even during bad news, it is usually a sign that the bottom is around the corner. We believe that most digital currencies have bottomed out, at least in the short-term.BTC/USDBitcoin has finally broken out of the 50-day SMA after remaining range-bound for seven days. Though this is a bullish sign, we still don\u2019t see a strong buying conviction, as the up move is lacking momentum. This shows that the market participants are cautious of this rally.The next target on the upside is $9,400, where we suggest booking partial profits. Once this level is crossed, a move to $10,000 is possible.If prices fail to hold above the 50-day SMA, it will be a bearish sign and prices can fall back to the first support level of $7,900. Therefore, we suggest the traders should keep the stops on the BTC/USD pair at breakeven.ETH/USDEthereum convincingly broke out of the 50-day SMA on April 19, which is a bullish sign. It has become positive and should continue to rally towards $730 levels.Though the 50-day SMA is still falling, the 20-day EMA has turned up. A bullish crossover will provide further strength to the ETH/USD pair.Though we are bullish, we have not suggested any trade on Ethereum. We will wait for a dip or a consolidation to enter fresh long positions.BCH/USDIn our previous analysis, we had noticed that Bitcoin Cash doesn\u2019t face resistance at the 50-day SMA and that is what happened. The price zoomed past the moving average on April 19 and touched our first target objective of $1,114.Traders can book partial profits at the current levels and keep a trailing stop on the remaining position. If the bullish sentiment continues, the BCH/USD pair can rally to $1,300 and then to $1,600.However, we need to caution the traders that the cryptocurrency has a history of vertical falls, so it\u2019s better to protect the paper profits with a close stop loss.We should never allow a profitable position to turn into a loss.XRP/USDWe had recommended long positions in Ripple in our previous analysis. The digital currency easily crossed above our first target objective of $0.83 where we had proposed to book partial profits.There is a minor resistance at $0.9, above which, the XRP/USD pair can rally to $1.08 levels. We like the way it has rallied over the past three days, which shows that the buyers are back. The moving averages are also close to a bullish crossover, which is another positive.Traders can hold the remaining positions with a close stop loss.XLM/USDStellar has broken out of our first target objective of $0.36, where we had proposed traders to book partial profits.The break out can carry the XLM/USD pair towards its next target objective of $0.47. That\u2019s why we had recommended trailing the stops higher on the remaining position.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, which is a bullish sign but it is unlikely to be a one-way move to the highs. Hence, the stops should always be trailed higher.As prices near $0.47, please keep tighter stops.LTC/USDAfter remaining range bound for a few days, Litecoin has found buying support. It is currently attempting to break out of the critical overhead resistance from the downtrend line and the 50-day SMA.If successful, the LTC/USD pair will become positive and rally to $178 levels.The logical stop loss for the trade is at $127, which doesn\u2019t offer us a good risk to reward ratio. Thus, we shall wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending any trade on it.If prices turn down from the resistance, it should find support at $141.ADA/BTCCardano is again moving closer to our target objective of 0.000035. If this level is crossed, then the digital currency will pick up momentum and rally to 0.000045 levels.We suggest trailing stops higher on their remaining position, instead of booking profits at 0.000035.The ADA/BTC pair has started a new uptrend, after being in a downtrend for months. During the start of a new uptrend, the RSI can remain in the overbought territory for some time. Hence, traders should not get perturbed with the overbought levels on the RSI. Keep trailing the stops higher to lock in the paper profits. As prices move up, please tighten the stops further.NEO/USDNEO has finally broken out of the 50-day SMA, but it will face stiff resistance at the $80 mark, from the downtrend line of the descending triangle and the horizontal line.We suggest booking partial profits at this level and raising the stops on the rest to breakeven.If the NEO/USD pair breaks out of $80, it will become very bullish because the failure of a bearish pattern is a positive sign. After breaking out of the downtrend line, there is minor resistance at $92-$94. If this level is crossed, the digital currency should pick up momentum and aim to hit $140.Hence, we are proposing to keep a part of the position open to benefit from the probable rise.EOS/USDEOS has broken out of the ascending channel and the horizontal resistance at $10.0650, which shows bullishness.We had anticipated resistance in the $9.5 to $10 zone, hence had recommended traders to book partial profits around the $9.5 mark.We had initially purchased with a target objective of $11, but looking at the bullishness, we believe that the EOS/USD pair can now rally to $12, which will also coincide with the resistance line of the ascending channel 2.The remaining positions can be held with a trailing stop loss, which can be kept just below the support line of the ascending channel 2.The digital currency will lose momentum if prices again fall into ascending channel 1.Source", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Alex Kleydints", "link": "https://medium.com/@kleydints/ripple-doesnt-address-the-kyc-aml-compliance-issues-of-crypto-transactions-9c996e828548?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 19, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "51", "content": "Alex KleydintsBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 19, 2018Ripple doesn\u2019t address the KYC & AML compliance issues of crypto-transactions.I assume that Wirex, similar to Revolut, allows you to buy Crypto on their system and use it to pay.

Since it launched its XRP token in 2013 it has made its way into the top five cryptocurrencies along with Bitcoin and Ethereum. The 2017 crypto market run-up left the company flush with cash. The only problem they seem to be having is no one is using XRP for the right reasons.Ripple Giving Away\u00a0XRPXRP was created to bridge the gap between banking and decentralized technology, that is as a way to move money faster and cheaper. The problem is very few people are using it this way according to an article in the New York Times. As utility becomes the watchword for cryptocurrencies success in the future, Ripple has been putting quite a lot of XRP into the world for free.When late night talk show host Stephen Colbert generously announced a donation of $29 million worth of XRP to American teachers it wasn\u2019t coming from his personal account. Nor, when Ashton Kushner presented the equivalent of $4 million of the digital coins to The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund did that come from his pocket. Ripple put up all that XRP as an initiative to get more of their cryptocurrency out into the working world.The company can be so easy with its XRP coins because, unlike Bitcoin which limits the number of its coins entering the world with a transactional formula (more transactions = more mining = more bitcoins), all of the XRP that will ever be was created in 2013.Priming the Pump to Increase\u00a0UtilityRipple created 100 billion XRP, setting aside 55 billion in escrow which has led to allegations that the company can and has manipulated the price of the token. It also allows them to use their estimated $30 billion in assets to set up programs like Xpring, which pays developers to build XRP focused software. Asheesh Birla, the head of product at Ripple, was quoted by the Times saying:\u201cIt\u2019s still really, really early days, but we are seeing the vision come to life. I need to make sure it\u2019s in the hands of the right folks.\u201dRipple has suffered some bad press recently while also being named in a class action lawsuit in the US to do with securities regulations. As the company works towards achieving clarity with the SEC and convincing the public that using its products to move money around is a safe and reliable alternative to the international banking systems gaining publicity through donations and free Snoop Dogg concerts at least keeps Ripple visible in a very crowded crypto space.Source: https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/03/ripple-pushes-towards-utility-by-giving-away-xrp/", "responses": ""}, {"title": "What\u2019s the Ripple Guy doing for the Construction Industry?", "author_name": "Steve Harper", "link": "https://medium.com/@rippleon/whats-the-ripple-guy-doing-for-the-construction-industry-84e17cd55a0f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 12, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "23", "content": "What\u2019s the Ripple Guy doing for the Construction Industry?Steve HarperBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 12, 2018Some people that know me are confused.

They know me as a published author, speaker and trainer on topics of leadership, customer service, business development and of course, building better relationships.They seemed shocked to hear I also own a software company focused on the construction industry. In fact I own two companies, but I\u2019ll save the other for another time.I am the proud owner and CEO of Owner Insite (OI), a web-based project management software for the construction industry. Our focus is to help the \u201cowner\u201d of a construction project insure they have a formal process and straight-forward approach to insuring the entire team (we call them stakeholders) on their project properly document, track and manage all elements of the project. OI brings a very unique level of transparency and accountability to projects of all sizes.Our company serves a wide variety of owners including real estate developers, health care providers, municipalities and of course education. Our favorite market is the K-12 and higher education space but keep that between us will ya?When people ask what attracted me to this space, it\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s a distinctly different entrepreneurial focus and something that seems far removed from the work I do with The Ripple. Unless you look a bit deeper.Most of my work around the Ripple involves helping people and companies understand the importance of connection; making sure all the kids play nice in the sandbox. A lot of the time I am helping people understand how their communication style and approach to interacting with others is worth exploring. Much of one\u2019s success, including a company\u2019s, is wrapped up in how people interact and communicate with one another.Or another way to put it: No connection. No loyalty. No future.So when I was first approached to become involved in Owner Insite, I immediately saw a problem that permeates many project teams. Egos and poor communication often leads to misunderstanding, missed deadlines, and mistakes. Information silos are prevalent in the construction industry and therefore a unifying platform like what we\u2019ve built helps eliminate many of the barriers project teams face.I\u2019ve seen firsthand how important the Ripple approach can be in getting teams on the same page and focused on the same results. Without a streamlined process and an organized way of communicating, it\u2019s no wonder so many projects run over schedule and over budget.I knew right away that my work through The Ripple could bring a unique perspective to helping construction teams work smarter, communicate better and deliver better results for the owner\u2019s they ultimately serve.By streamlining the process and making it easier for everyone to communicate through our unifying software, we\u2019re proud at OI to have affected the construction industry for the better and have incredible clients who are some of our biggest believers (if you\u2019d like to read some client testimonials, please visit here).So my full title is Steve, The Ripple Guy, also known as Owner Insite Guy.

But sometimes you have to try.Just as Taproot was getting started, one of our members posed such a question: \u201cHow can we (i.e. non-Indigenous Edmontonians) better connect with our aboriginal neighbours to learn more about their local stories?\u201dThis seemed like a difficult question. But when we put it to the members in the summer, many were curious, too. Anna Holtby was interested in pursuing an answer. So off she went. Here\u2019s what she brought back:And here\u2019s the story behind that answer, along with some suggestions for how you can make your ripple.Search engine open, my blinking cursor dared me to start on this big question. Thankfully, my typing fingers quickly took over, and almost instinctively tapped out two very familiar words: truth and reconciliation. I figured they had to fit into this conversation somehow.I soon realized that \u201clearning local Indigenous stories\u201d is inseparable from, and in fact almost synonymous with, the process of truth and reconciliation. How do we hear local stories if we don\u2019t first face the truth of history and Canada\u2019s treatment of Indigenous peoples? How do we build genuine connection without reconciliation?The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established by the federal government in 2008, with a mandate to research and gather testimonies on Indian Residential Schools. From the 1870s through to the 1990s, over 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their parents and communities and placed in these government-funded, church-run schools, where speaking their languages and practicing their cultures were often forbidden. The final report of the TRC, released in 2015, documented both the history and ongoing impact of these experiences for both survivors and following generations.Miranda Jimmy, a Cree Edmontonian, is an intergenerational survivor of residential schools. She shared her story publicly for the first time in March of 2014, when the TRC held its final national event here in Edmonton, where we live on Treaty 6 territory.A year later, Jimmy, who is now running for city council, founded Reconciliation in Solidarity Edmonton, or RISE, to continue the conversations started at the TRC event.When I went to Jimmy, curiosity and questions in hand, the words truth and reconciliation still sounded comforting to me\u200a\u2014\u200alike we were finally doing something to seek peace for the past and present, armed with honesty and best intentions. But as we spoke, words like discomfort, awkwardness, and guilt kept coming up. These words rolled into conversations about colonialism and assimilation.It began to click. There is not a lack of accessibility to Indigenous stories, but rather, non-Indigenous people are often missing the necessary attitudes to pursue and invest in truth and reconciliation.This journey is not about going through the motions or attending the right events. Truth and reconciliation requires internal questioning of our own identity, stereotypes, and histories, and developing the right attitudes to process those. Many lack the perseverance to blunder through the discomfort of this self-reflective process. In Jimmy\u2019s words, \u201creconciliation is not about doing something. It\u2019s about doing something differently.\u201dListen again to Jimmy\u2019s words. She does not speak for all Indigenous Edmontonians, and would never claim to. But it felt like her eloquent, honest words made a good frame for the challenge.Here are some practical ways to take that opportunity to make a ripple towards real truth and reconciliation, or at least equip yourself to make a ripple. This list is not exhaustive, and these are not boxes to check. But it is a place to start searching, asking questions, listening, and thinking. As Jimmy said, \u201cthe real work of reconciliation is internal, it\u2019s not external.\u201dMiranda JimmyEventsOct. 14, 2016\u200a\u2014\u200aConversation@Noon: After the TRC: Writers from the

early from the world in 1968, was in South Africa and gave a speech recognized ever since as the Ripple of Hope speech.Here\u2019s the passage where the phrase is born:Each time a man stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope; and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.At the time, Bobby Kennedy was a Senator. Not a political figure in South Africa, but a US Senator. He was also a rich, famous, successful, white man.He had no business being in South Africa, except that he cared. He cared about ushering forth the end of apartheid. He cared because he knew people were being treated unjustly and brutalized simply because of the color of their skin.He had every reason to not get involved, to sit back and enjoy his own privileged part in society.But he believed in finding ways to create ripples of hope. And he believed that not getting involved is akin to support. And he believed his privilege gave him a responsibility to act for those without.Fast forward to today. We could use more people willing to create their own ripples of hope in the world.The United States currently has a president that is a rich,\u00a0famous,\u00a0successful, white man. Only this one doesn\u2019t care about the plight of others, and basks in his privilege the way so many do.Please be a Ripple of Hope in the world. Please realize that you can make a difference.

What I am referring to here is how quickly, who we align ourselves with, what we do, how we think, can effect the group mentality, and this can produce effects that are often devastating.This is why we need to take responsibility for our actions.Recently, I have been hearing people say that they haven\u2019t been given enough information with regards the Referendum remain or leave situation. This has dropped my jaw somewhat.Why do people wait to be spoon fed?Google the information. You can download information about the EU, and so on.But people are lazy.Googling stuff requires reading\u200a\u2014\u200aand a lot of it too. Most people can\u2019t be bothered. They prefer to just moan or accuse people of waffling when the issues suddenly become a bit more complex.I am seeing a kind of apathy towards learning and knowledge. It\u2019s like people are trying to by-pass the lessons\u200a\u2014\u200anot realising that this could lead to an intellectual stagnation and indeed a backward development within society.But most importantly, how many times have you heard the term, \u201cLest we forget\u201d? And yet we are unable to apply the full meaning of this term, to the present.I refer to the brewing hatred toward people that are different, the emerging racism as well as the fear and worry about immigration\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is beginning to lead us down a path that is not too different than before WW2.You see\u200a\u2014\u200awe are forgetting. We are forgetting that human beings are capable of the most horrific deeds.We are forgetting that our personal decisions can be part of a collective and that that same collective may be leading us down a very dangerous path.I know that it\u2019s easier to look the other way, but if we do\u200a\u2014\u200awe may just land ourselves in some serious hot soup.Actions have ripple effects, ripple effects that often bite you on the bottom just when you\u2019re not looking.And yesterday\u2019s event was a reminder of this.I urge you therefore, to remember that your actions can add to society\u2019s destructive or negative ideologies because what you sow you will reap and what you give you will receive.Instead\u200a\u2014\u200alet\u2019s all make sure that we are not in any way, adding to create a society that is closed and destructive.\u00a9 2016 Deidr\u00e9 Wallace All rights reserved.You can learn more about yourself and relationships at: http://relationshipknowledge.com/About The AuthorI am a fully UK qualified Psychodynamic Relationship Therapist, Life Coach and Teacher.I am not offering relationship advice, I am offering relationship knowledge.I encourage people to think differently and I help people understand how and why we choose our personal and business relationships.Want to find out more?

The same will apply to all Ethereum focused pairs.You will notice that this is considerably cheaper as compared to what other exchanges are currently offering. Which is a win. For reference purposes, Bitfinex has fees as high as 0.2%\u200a\u2014\u200awhich doesn\u2019t sound as much until you realize you\u2019d have to pay as much as $10,000 USD in trading fees if your monthly trade volume is $5 million or more.Sweepstake program.BitMax also made public their sweepstake program, which is purposed to allow the platform\u2019s users to earn points by conducting different activities on the platform, activities such as registering, logging in, depositing at least 0.5ETH, maintaining a minimum account balance, transacting and referring a friend. Points earned will vary based on activities with transaction and referral activities earning the most points. The highest-ranking user currently has over 500,000 points.I\u2019m the biggest fun of competition, which explains my #fortnite addiction, so i can tell you this, this sweepstake program is the best thing you could join today. The grand prize of 10 Bitcoins is still up for the taking, who knows they could be yours. Here\u2019s a link if you\u2019re interested in checking that out\u200a\u2014\u200aSweepstake ProgramIntroduction of\u00a0XRP.But my favorite announcement of late has been the introduction of #Ripple XRP as a new \u2018tradeable\u2019 currency.Currently at position 3 as the most popular cryptocurrency according to market cap, integrating this awesome coin into the fold could be what converts many users into cryptocurrency trading and give the decentralized economy the boost it so rightly deserves.We\u2019ve seen in recent stories how banks are now turning to #XRP as a faster, more costly way to transfer money and with the introduction of xRapid a product that allows for international transactions within minutes. Therefore, giving users the option to trade in this token could have all the right outcomes both for BitMax and all the potential traders living inside the platform.When South Korean based exchange platform bitthumb was hacked in this year and over $30 million dollars\u2019 worth of cryptocurrency including XRP stolen. The platform decided to disable all deposits on the platform and transfer all the coins to offline wallets to fix the vulnerabilities their security protocols had.BitMax is doing its best to prevent such an occurrence from ever happening to its customers, it has done this by setting up multi-level firewalls to examine the system and control the traffic that\u2019s coming into the network\u2019s devices with the aim of blocking any suspicious activity and unauthorised access.BitMax has also implemented multi-signature requirements to help bolster the platform\u2019s security, this technology will require that users sign off on a transaction before it can be pushed on the blockchain. BitMax also understands that in order to build a secure platform, it can\u2019t just depend on its own in-house security team this is why it has partnered with an experienced security firm who will monitor and perform important checks all with the goal of safeguarding the customer\u2019s financial and personal information from hackers and considering people are using mobile more and more, which tend to be much riskier because of their newness and potential for attracting malware, this security firm will protect BitMax\u2019s users from breaches of privacy and financial losses.So, with great security in place, all the groundwork is already laid out for brilliant trading.\u00a0Here\u2019s the thing though, decentralized exchanges like BitMax have long been associated with being difficult, difficult to trade with and basically difficult to understand, but BitMax is the exception, with BitMax you can start trading in less than three steps and with their real-time settlements functionalities. Users have no reason not to trade.BitMax will be initiating a margin trading feature by the end of 2018, this feature is important because it allows any trader to borrow money against any funds they must trade in cryptocurrency. This is great for boosting buying power.Conclusion.XRP will feel right at home at BitMax and considering all the partners, BitMax has willing to participate in the platform to enhance liquidity, not investing your crypto in BitMax is not wise.Try this links for information about BitMax and BTMX, the company\u2019s main token.Bitmax Website\u00a0Bitmax Whitepaper\u00a0Bitmax on Twitter\u00a0Bitmax Official TelegramThis Blog by:Rhinoboy11\u00a0Steemit\u00a0Medium\u00a0Facebook\u00a0BitcoinTalk\u00a0Bitcoin Username: @SammygyeIf you like my blogs and would like to see others like this one.

Do you keep telling them over and over and hope they will eventually believe it?Do you? Do you believe that you are enough? That nothing you do to the outside could begin to compare to who you are? Do you dress up the outside so that it reflects what is on the inside or is it to try and compensate what you falsely think you are missing on the inside? Do you think your outside is lacking and therefore the inside doesn\u2019t matter?How do we get young women and even young men to understand that they are unique, wonderful, and beautiful beings with great potential when the world is full of messages otherwise?Perhaps it is following the advice I read many years ago in a written article discussing the self-image problems of adolescent girls. I remember one simple thing from that article and it is that we need to compliment them and show interest in them for things other than the clothes they wear or their looks. We need to skip over saying \u201cYou are pretty\u201d or \u201cThat dress is so pretty on you\u201d and instead seek to say things like \u201cYou are so kind\u201d or \u201cYou are so clever and smart in being patient and figuring that out\u201d and other things that build self-confidence that sticks.I forget that sometimes even when talking with friends or family, which should make it easier to dig deep into saying what should be said. I\u2019ll compliment someone and say \u201cWow, you look so pretty today\u201d when what I really meant was \u201cYou are glowing and your smile always lights up a room and makes me feel good to be around you.\u201dMaybe the reason people are so insecure is that no one is taking the time to really say what needs to be said. Maybe the self-worth and self-comparison lifestyle present in the world has come about not because we are trying to cover up what we really believe, but we haven\u2019t taken the time to discover who we are and to appreciate others in our lives.I do know this to be true, self-confidence is the best accessory if it is real. It can make a woman or man the most attractive, dynamic, and interesting person in the room. Not arrogance, but true self-confidence. They are the kind of person that doesn\u2019t need to draw attention to themselves because they know who they are and they don\u2019t need to get the world to validate them for they know their self-worth. Instead, they make people around them feel important and special. Those types of people start a ripple that can carry on from person to person.Tomorrow compliment someone on who they are and not just on how they appear and start a ripple. Dig deep and take the time to say what needs to be said to let that person know that you really see them. Tomorrow know and wear your self-worth of being irreplaceable, unique, and beautiful within every cell in your body and start a ripple for someone else. Seek to start a ripple and keep other ripples going on and on. Let\u2019s take the time to tell people that they are important. Celebrate them.

I stress another because 2016 was only the latest round of ongoing water quality issues facing the region and state.As I write this, more than 80 percent of the Caloosahatchee River is experiencing the presence of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), which have tested positive for microcystin toxins\u200a\u2014\u200atoxins with serious human and wildlife health impacts. At the same time, satellite imagery of Lake Okeechobee highlights that more than 90 percent of the entire lake is impacted by the same algae.Rob MoherRecent action by Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s administration, advocated by the Conservancy of Southwest Florida, local governments and environmental partners to bolster monitoring of the Caloosahatchee basin, is a much-needed positive development. Without timely and comprehensive data on pollution and water flow, there is little chance of making good decisions for our water quality.I wrote back in 2016 that we needed a three-pronged approach to address the quality, quantity and distribution of water if we hoped to truly solve our water quality crisis.

The attempt to exit from consolidation once again failed.BitcoinOn BTC chart, the bulls increased activity, and on increased volumes, on Friday the pair, BTC/USD was able to break through the level of $5,600. This opened up the possibility for new purchases with an acceptable profit/risk ratio. However, above the price of $5800, purchases ceased, volumes fell and the price, after the third attempt to move above $5850, swept below the trend line, which was a signal to liquidate a long position.

Now the position is covered, the price has returned to the area of \u200b\u200bthe red line, and so far, despite the entry point that is attractive from the point of view of technical analysis, we consider it important to take a pause and watch for some time the dynamics from the outside. Some weakness is noticeable in the coin, so, for now, we consider it right to refrain from being active in it.RippleXRP chart also tried to catch up with the leader and at the moment punched an important level of $0.31, creating the illusion of the beginning of a powerful movement. However, returning back was as fast as the impulse itself, and the long position that began to form was eliminated at the moment the protective order triggered. The dynamics of XRP chart confirms everything we have said regarding the mood of participants in BTC and ETH, with the only exception that the situation is even more unfavorable for investors \u2014XRP shows a lagging behind for a long time and clearly looks weaker than most other TOP-10 coins.

Chart reaching a psychological mark of $200, rolled back to the level of support. This pattern can be used when opening a speculative position with a short stop, but due to the fact that we have chosen to redistribute capital in favor of coins with brighter dynamics, we are temporarily out of position.

Such decisions are usually emotional and in most cases lead to the opposite of expected results. The coin shows weakness for a very long time. On higher time frames, this is clearly visible. Internal corporate events are already in the price, but there are no new drivers. Due to the fact that currently there are coins with less risk and a more understandable technical picture, we believe that the activity in XRP can be temporarily reduced as much as possible.EOSThe exit from the triangle to the top nevertheless took place, which, against the background of a general wave of positive, allowed the coin over the weekend to show good forward dynamics compared to most other liquid coins. The breakdown was confirmed by volumes and a large green candle, which allowed speculators using the pulse approach to jump into the departing train, although at that point the risk did not allow taking a decent amount at the entry point. Position size is small. We are waiting for new features. Stop below $5.20.LitecoinLTC chart reached $92 during the impulse. However, now, after the formation of the double-top figure, some doubts arise in the continuation of growth in the near future. It is necessary to wait for the resolution of the situation.

I think that Ripple is just a stable cryptocurrency. Yes\u200a\u2014\u200astable is the right word, at least for now.However, you should understand that Ripple is not like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Ripple is an international settlement system that lets banks transfer funds and settle payments in various currencies. The whole system is based on Ripple Transaction Protocol, which is a different concept from XRP, the latter being the token inside the protocol, which protects it from DDOS attacks. So, if more banks deal with Ripple, it doesn\u2019t mean they invest in XRP and boost its price by doing this\u200a\u2014\u200abanks actually deal with Ripple protocol.As a global settlement network for banks, Ripple blockchain is not as decentralized as Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchain. Its system is based on DLT, but it has a kind of control anyway since there is an authority above that, such as Ripple founders. Ripple was created for banks as a tool, not as a speculative instrument. In fact, Ripple founders themselves do not recommend investing in XRP because it is not a speculative asset!Average persons don\u2019t have easy access to Ripple blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s for banks.You should also consider the following:\u2013 Unlike ETH or BTC, XRP was not intended as means to store value but to digitalize bank\u2019s transactions.

As soon as their tokens reach the system, the price can drop.People say there will be scarcity in Ripple because all the transaction fees within the system are completely destroyed. However, it doesn\u2019t mean that Ripple will disappear in 10 years because of it. The pace of XRP destruction is so slow that Ripple can stay well for 1000 years.Considering all the conditions as of today, it can\u2019t make you reach soon. Even if it will double or triple, I guess it won\u2019t make you rich because of growing from $1000 to $3000.However, conditions may change, as Ripple may introduce new unpredictable approaches.

Since Monday, the capitalization index has grown by another 15.5% and is currently at $245 billion.As we wrote in the last review, the accumulated pent-up demand entered the market and so far it looks like the rising wave is probably still that time will go on.BitcoinThe breakdown of a maximum of $7,500 took place, after which the upward movement in BTC continued and yesterday the coin was able to test $8,400, which is the maximum value since July last year. As we wrote earlier, in this case, it is advisable to use a portfolio of strategies. This approach improves trade performance and allows for a smoother movement of the capital growth curve. We continue to trade in the direction of the trend, using partial unloading of the position and its restoration, depending on the removal or approach of the chart to the trend line. Stop below the blue line.EthereumThe dynamics of ETH have changed noticeably, more and more participants are joining the upward movement. The movement goes with some acceleration. Technically, it was possible to buy at breakdowns of the highs with the transfer of the foot. Due to the fact that the market periodically there is a need for the redistribution of capital in the direction of stronger tools, in connection with which we temporarily reduced the size of the limit in ETH in favor of BTC. Now the situation has changed and the technical picture in ETH indicates that a certain personality appears in the coin, which should be used to extract maximum profit. We look forward to the formation of a new key point of continued growth and the subsequent breakdown or reduction of the chart on the blue line, which in both cases will give us the opportunity to open a new position with a small risk.RippleAt XRP happened exactly what usually happens in situations where the coin has long lagged behind the leaders. We wrote about this in one of the past reviews that asset revaluation can be very fast. Being under pressure from buyers for a long time, XRP for two days, breaking through a maximum of 11 numbers, grew by 30% and continues its upward movement at high volatility and large volumes. In such a situation, if the positions are open, it makes sense to hold them as long as possible with a trailing stop, since the movement can continue and be very strong for a while, and show a sharp reversal.EOSEOS was again among our leaders in terms of participation in this wave of growth and allowed us to pull out the portfolio for profitability, at which it can be said that the opportunity was not missed. Throughout the movement, we left a long position and the market made it possible for several hikes to increase the share in the portfolio to the maximum possible. Now all that is required is to control the size of the position. Stop below the blue line\u200a\u2014\u200apartial unloading on a moving foot or take profit.LitecoinIn LTC, the chart cannot yet move significantly above the red resistance line. However, the situation when a coin lagging behind leaders for a long time catches up with them in a few hours, as we see from the situation in XRP, it is quite likely on the cryptocurrency market. In the event that the pair can consolidate above the red line in the coming hours, we will try to open a long position on the first part of the limit with a stop in case of return of chart below the red line.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

It solves the problem where an app business needs to pay people in every country small amounts.I\u2019m thinking about IndaHash as another perfect example. By moving to Ethereum they instantly removed the need to even consider which country they were sending payment to.To them they are all just Ethereum addresses, end of story.So this very same use case is going to be tempting for all other sharing apps.What we really need now is an Uber, Lyft or AirBNB to announce that their drivers or hosts can now get paid in crypto.

You can look at their news section to see how they take a much more professional approach.That to me betrays the different audiences they are each appealing to.Justin Sun\u2019s teaser is an appeal to a less sophisticated audience while Block.One appeal to to corporate leaders.IMF: Rapid Growth of Bitcoin and Crypto Will Impact Global Financial Systemhttps://www.ccn.com/imf-rapid-growth-of-bitcoin-and-crypto-will-impact-global-financial-system/If there is one thing I hate in the crypto space it\u2019s when people who still live in the old system state the friggin obvious.You\u2019re damn right it will impact the global financial system.I\u2019d say replacing it can be considered as making an impact.It says:\u201cContinued rapid growth of crypto assets could create new vulnerabilities in the international financial system.\u201d\u2026 they mean expose vulnerabilities not create them, they are already there.The valid point they made is with regards to security. The main reason people keep losing money in crypto is more to do with their poor security practices than anything.I have noticed this myself so I\u2019ve started working on a new course dedicated entirely to secure best practices.Battle Of The DEX: One EOS Decentralized Exchange Records More Volume Than All ETH Exchangeshttps://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2018/10/battle-of-the-dex-one-eos-decentralized-exchange-records-more-volume-than-all-eth-exchanges/There\u2019s no need to belabor this one.You can look on DappRadar and do this calculation yourself any time you want.https://dappradar.com/dappsYes EOS is transacting more monetary value on it\u2019s decentralised exchanges, but to be fair Ethereum is doing a greater number of transactions.For example in the last 24 hours IDEX on Ethereum has recorded 11,687 transactions while NewDex on EOS has recorded 3,996.One thing that is worth highlighting from the article is the difference in the amount of funding that has been put behind decentralised exchanges on each platform.Ethereum has Bancor, which raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Then there is the 0x protocol on Ethereum.So not only are they very well funded they have also had a significant head start in terms of time. Both of those projects have been around for at least a year.Newdex is just some EOS based app that was launched shortly after the EOS network went live and is already 30% of the way to matching IDEX in terms of number of transactions.From a business point of view, it\u2019s much easier from a technical standpoint to build an app on EOS than Ethereum.I think that fact alone gives EOS a huge edge since it will simply attract more apps.Then by the law of averages EOS is more likely to have a handful of apps that go viral, just going by the numbers alone.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Altcoin News: Bitstamp Receives Bitlicense\u200a\u2014\u200aPositive Signal for XRP &\u00a0xRapid?", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-news-bitstamp-receives-bitlicense-positive-signal-for-xrp-xrapid-27369d5721e0?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 15", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "2", "content": "Altcoin News: Bitstamp Receives Bitlicense\u200a\u2014\u200aPositive Signal for XRP &\u00a0xRapid?April 15, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN\u00a0MAGAZINEMarko VidrihBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 15The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has granted a license to the cryptocurrency exchange and Ripple partner Bitstamp.Luxembourg-based Bitstamp may now officially offer its services in New York, giving it the ability to use the Ripple suite for cross-border payment solutions.DFS has engaged Bitstamp USA to provide services that enable its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and selected other cryptocurrencies for USD and vice versa. Bitstamp USA also has the right to transfer funds via the Ripple Network by issuing Ripple balances in USD, other cryptocurrencies and selected Fiat currencies including Australian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed the company\u2019s partnership with Bitstamp back in December and made Bitstamp the fourth crypto exchange to support Ripple\u2019s xRapid software solution, which uses the XRP token.The New York Financial Supervisor is known for the rigor of \u201cBitlicense\u201d and the difficulty of preserving it. XRP enthusiasts are hoping the license will drive the use of xRapid through Bitstamp, which in turn would increase demand for XRP and boost the XRP course.The other three crypto exchanges aboard the payment platform are the US-based companies Bittrex, Bitso, based in Mexico and Coins.php in the Philippines. The exchanges are an integral part of xRapid, accepting Fiat payments from banks and financial institutions, converting it into XRP and sending XRP overseas, where it is immediately converted back to Fiat.Ripple has already released xRapid for commercial use in October. So far, a total of 13 companies have announced to use the technology. The global forex provider Mercury FX is the most open regarding the active use of the technology. Last month, the company announced its first xRapid transfer from the UK to the Philippines on behalf of a customer who sent overseas money to pay for his honeymoon. The company has also sent a number of xRapid payments from the UK to Mexico.Mercury FX says it has set itself the goal of operating about 10 payment routes by the middle of the year, including corridors to Canada and the Middle East.Author: Marko Vidrih@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

From the highs reached on Wednesday, the prices of the most liquid instruments fell within 5\u201310%. Capitalization currently in the region of $170 billion, which corresponds to a decrease of this indicator by 6.5% compared with the values \u200b\u200bof the environment.Volumes are average, volatility indicators are gradually decreasing.BitcoinBTC was able to overcome the $5300 mark on Wednesday, but immediately after that, a correction followed. The false breakdown of the triangle provoked the closing of positions by short-term holders, as a result of which the cryptocurrency tested the price of $4,900. Now the trades are held on average volumes and it is likely that the participants will need some more time to get used to the new price levels after a sharp rise at the beginning of the month. In the case of approaching quotations to the level of $4,800 for 1 coin, you need to carefully look at the dynamics, since it is possible that there will be a moment to open a small long.EthereumETH price could not repeat the maximum of this year (April 3) and also corrected, breaking the blue uptrend line, where our protective stop order was triggered. Now, amid a renewal of local minima, it is highly likely that prices will drop to the support area ($153), where, depending on the behavior of the coin, it will be possible to build one or another trading strategy.RippleXRP, as is often the case lately, showed a markedly greater sensitivity to the corrective movement of the market, with the result that prices quietly overcame the $0.34 level and are even below $0.32 at the moment, which had long acted as an important resistance level. In the event that the chart returns above $0.325 and can consolidate there in the coming hours, you can try to open a small long with a short stop. If this does not happen, then it is quite possible that after some time we will see a price movement in the region of $0.30. Much now in the dynamics of this particular coin depends on the general market sentiment.EOSAt EOS, traders also faced a false breakdown, forcing short-term participants to eliminate all positions. The main thing in such cases is a short stop, which allows you to protect the capital, step aside and calmly without emotion, from the side to look at everything that happens. We believe that the current correction may lead to the fact that prices will fall to the area of \u200b\u200bthe green line, after which, perhaps, there will be good moments for purchases. We remain out of position in this instrument, although it is worth noting the fact that EOS was still able to update the maximum, which indicates the relative strength of the coin and good prospects.LitecoinThe LTC position was also eliminated by a stop in the region of $84.5. On the market saw, a trader is always saved by a short stop and the small size of the position being opened. While in this coin we do not have any clearly expressed expectations. Support is low, so now we can talk about moving towards it, and significant local levels are no longer observed. Therefore, we are waiting for a reversal and in the case of the emergence of a new local trend, we will make decisions.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

More broadly, no sectors is immune to major overhauls. Today, we\u2019ll have a look at the impact of Disruptors.Nested in Paris\u2019 Le Marais neighborhood, a clever incubator/think-thank called TheFamily, made its mission to chronicle the digital transformation of our society. Largely inspired by the iconic Ycombinator incubator, TheFamily funds and provides all sorts of services to a hundred plus startups. But it also wants to rattle the establishment with an activist posture. Paraphrasing the \u201cBarbarians at the Gate\u201d book title, the incubator hosts a conference series titled Les Barbares Attaquent (Barbarians On The Attack) that examines all the sectors to be impacted by the digital tidal wave.The latest event (#18) featured the book industry. Prior to that, human resources, retail, luxury, housing & construction, health, transportation, education, garment industry, consulting, insurance, finance and other sectors were dissected by TheFamily partners and guest speakers. Each time with a larger attendance.One of the founders, Nicolas Colin, recently made headlines when his blog post (fr) denounced the notoriously archaic parisian taxi lobby (see previous Monday Note), triggering a lawsuit from Nicolas Rousselet, the owner of the main French taxi company G7. (Nicolas is the son of Andr\u00e9 Rousselet, himself one of former president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s favorite oligarchs, anointed TV mogul in the late Eighties). By suing the blogger, Rousselet Jr. wanted to shut down any criticism of his company\u2019s unrelenting conservatism. In fact, he completely underestimated the reaction of the French digital multitude that rallied en masse to support the blogger (and the media La Tribune, that republished the infamous post.)This little Gallic tale illustrates the split between the old and the new economy. It could have happened in Brussels, Berlin or San Francisco where lobbies furiously oppose the rise of Disruptors that threaten transportation or short-term rental housing\u200a\u2014\u200aamong other things.Before we go further, let\u2019s look at the engine of the Disruptors\u2019 phenomenal growth. It can be summed up to one phrase: unprecedented access to capital.When it comes to technology, Uber or Airbnb are not rocket science. The platform and the algorithm needed to efficiently match supply & demand have been indeed brilliantly implemented, but there is no need beyond off-the-shelf technologies to set up the whole thing. By contrast, when Google started in 1998, it did stretch the limits of the technology of the day (networking and computing power); as for Facebook, despite the relative crudeness of the original concept, it had to deal very early with scalability issues. Actually on its very first day, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s hottest girl matching system (how nice) crashed Harvard\u2019s network. No such headache for Uber or Airbnb who rely on proven technologies: cellular network, mapping, databases, LAMP-based softwares. As shown in the following three graphs, funding has been equally abundant for these areas:Not only have investors poured big money in Uber and Airbnb but they did so extremely fast, boosting the valuation of these two companies to staggering levels. Since there is very little technology involved, where did the money go? Mostly to market share acquisitions, the only way to leave the competition in the dust for good. Take Airbnb: in just one year, its number of listed spaces grew more than doubled to 500,000 listings in 33,000 cities and 192 countries. Its $10bn valuation puts it head-to-head with the giant group Accor that operates 3500 brick-and-mortar hotels and 450,000 rooms.In these new models, the American venture capital ecosystem is acting as a weapon of mass domination. When Uber collects more than $300 million in VC money to expand in 100 cities worldwide, its London-based competitor HailO got \u201conly\u201d $77m and when it comes to the French LeCab, it only raised \u20ac11m ($15m). It shows how anemic the French system is when it comes to funding its startups; instead of patting the registered cabs sector in the back with demagogic promises, the successive digital economy ministers would have been better advised to act decisively to stimulate access to capital.Still, the European way of resisting these new models won\u2019t last for long. To be sure, in Brussels, the ill-named \u201cministry of mobility\u201d decided to simply forbid Uber-like system; in France, the resistance is more messy when hundreds of yelling taxi divers blocked main streets and airport accesses. But grass-root movements are likely to morph into a more anglo-saxon-like lobbying, with highly paid professional hired to defend special interests.Consider this: between 1998 and 2013, the amount spent in Washington DC alone by various lobbies has grown x16 in constant dollars to a staggering $3.23bn. Today, tech firms are the fourth contributor after pharmaceuticals, insurance and oil & gas: when a big pharma spend $1.00 to influence lawmakers, tech companies now spend $0.63 and the gap is closing.Why am I mentioning this? It\u2019s because the capital raised by Disruptors will inevitably find its way to effective lobbyism in Brussels (at the European Commission), and eventually in Paris or Berlin.Disruptors\u2019 lobbyists will argue that new urban transportations system and peer-to-peer housing rental do more good than harm in the community. And for the most part, they might be right. Sharing cars in congested cities via system such as RelayRides definitely makes sense from a environment standpoint when any individual car stays idle 95% of the time. A survey conducted by UC Berkeley (pdf here) on a 6,000 San Francisco residents participating on car-sharing system revealed a drop of 50% in the personal car ownership (the auto industry might not like it, but our lungs will.)On the economic side, there is no shortage or arguments either. Terminating the paid-for license system (the so-called Medallion) would free \u20ac3 billion in Paris, and $10 billion in New York, sums now immobilized and promised to an inexorable deflation. In times of raising inequality, maybe it is not such a bad idea to let people make extra money by renting their apartment or their car\u200a\u2014\u200awith limitations, of course. To put some figures on the idea: an Airbnb host in San Francisco is making $9,300 per year on average by renting his/er property 58 nights. As for those who makes their personal car available for sharing though RelayRides, they make on average $250 a month.As for the hotel industry, evidence shows Airbnb\u2019s growth to have very little impact. According to the Boston University School of Management, in the state of Texas, a growth of 1% in Airbnb supply translated into only a 0,05% decrease in the revenue of 4,000 hotels surveyed, while a single percentage point of increase in the supply of regular hotels rooms translated into a 0.29% decrease\u200a\u2014\u200a20 times more\u200a\u2014\u200ain Texas hotel revenues.

On the long run, that\u2019s obviously a mistake as politicians will seize on the opportunity to further single out these new models.

It\u2019s On Whether Ripple Likes It or\u00a0NotW12BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 6, 2018It turns out, you can launch crypto tokens on Ripple\u2019s XRP Ledger, and a small group of coders are seeking to be among the first to do it.Stepping back, that might seem strange on multiple levels. For one, there\u2019s XRP Ledger\u2019s association with Ripple, the San Francisco startup that has largely tried to distance itself from cryptocurrency, mostly focusing on offering distributed ledger tech to some of the world\u2019s largest financial firms. Second, there\u2019s the fact that XRP Ledger, while open-source, isn\u2019t exactly known as a platform.But while ethereum has been the go-to blockchain for entrepreneurs that want to launch cryptocurrencies, it turns out that lately, a significant number of token issuers have been looking for alternatives. And for Allvor, a small Brazil-based company focused on streamlining digital payments, the XRP Ledger is proving an attractive option for running what it hopes will be a significant token-based business.And they couldn\u2019t be more excited.\u201cThe XRP Ledger, which is developed by Ripple Company, is the best and most efficient distributed database technology ever made,\u201d according to Allvor\u2019s white paper, which reads more like a fanzine for the technology.According to the company, XRP Ledger\u2019s main selling point is its speed, but there are several other reasons why they think Ripple\u2019s distributed ledger is the perfect place for crypto tokens.Still, Ripple seems less thrilled about the idea. In statements, the company sought to emphasize that by nature it can\u2019t prevent even exotic uses of its technology due to its open, public codebase.According to a Ripple spokesperson:\u201cXRP Ledger is open-source and a decentralized platform, so people can build whatever they want, but Ripple isn\u2019t interested in promoting or supporting ICOs on the ledger.\u201dAnd that unenthused response might lead to issues down the line.An opt-in\u00a0airdropFor one, Allvor understands that to succeed in its mission of streamlining e-commerce it needs a system that does more than just settle transactions.It\u2019ll need a system that integrates with merchant\u2019s logistics, customer management and marketing software. As such, it\u2019s launching a token called \u201cALV\u201d and building a platform that the token interacts with.\u201cThe ideal would be if a merchant of any size could install the software or plugin that makes the ALV payment feasible within 10 minutes,\u201d said Cleyton Domingues, the co-founder of Allvor and a longtime staffer in Brazil\u2019s economy ministry. \u201cOur challenge will be to develop the software that makes the integration possible.\u201dYet, the company, which doesn\u2019t have investors but instead has bootstrapped the project itself, remains unfazed, primarily because its executive believes XRP Ledger already offers a variety of benefits.For example, Allvor\u2019s white paper says that the ledger\u2019s \u201chybrid payment gateways\u201d technology will allow them to more easily set up a truly global system.And since users of the ledger have to set up \u201ctrust channels\u201d with people they\u2019d like to transact with, users will feel like they have more control over what crypto tokens they receive. This is particularly important since recently both retail and institutional investors have lamented the spammy nature of token airdrops, whereby issuers seed users with tokens merely based on the amount of another token\u200a\u2014\u200alike ether\u200a\u2014\u200athey have.But Ripple\u2019s system means that users will have to opt-in to receive tokens.Allvor is creating 100 billion ALV tokens\u200a\u2014\u200awith 5 percent being sent to current XRP holders (if they opt-in) based on the amount they held as of March 27.Not the\u00a0firstStill, investors may be wary of entering a market that\u2019s challenging to exit.Despite XRP\u2019s recent surge in popularity (it\u2019s now the third largest by market cap), Ripple executives have struggled to entice major U.S. exchanges, like Coinbase and Gemini, to list its native cryptocurrency, according to Bloomberg.Yet, Jon Holmquist, an industry entrepreneur and founder of the Bitcoin Black Friday movement, said that might not matter since Ripple\u2019s protocol is designed to work as a decentralized exchange of sorts, capable of representing all kinds of assets.And Holmquist should know\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was actually the first to launch a token on Ripple in June 2017.Through the ICO, Holmquist earned $1,500 in XRP, but after about a month, he decided to refundinvestor\u2019s money to steer clear of the regulatory hammer, following guidance put out by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on The DAO.\u201cI think a lot of ICOs are hesitant to be the first ones,\u201d Holmquist told CoinDesk.That said, he expects more entrepreneurs to see the benefits of the XRP Ledger for token issuance even despite the lukewarm reception the concept has received.And there\u2019s plenty of untapped potential, he said, adding:\u201cI think the Ripple community is very strong.

Spouses, children, and extended family often try to look the other way when someone they love first develops a problem with drugs or alcohol. They assume that heavy drinking or occasional drug use may be an excusable part of the job or a signifier of a tough day and nothing more.Unfortunately, when chronic alcohol abuse or drug use turns into addiction, it\u2019s a problem that cannot be ignored. Medical and therapeutic intervention and treatment are needed\u200a\u2014\u200aand often not just for the person struggling with addiction but for loved ones as well.If you are living with addiction on the job, here\u2019s what you can do for yourself and your family.Get Right with YourselfBefore you can attend to the needs of your family, you must first take care of yourself. Taking a good hard look at how much you are drinking or using drugs, when you are using, and how it impacts your ability to function at work as well as at home with your family can help you to identify the areas that will need attention first. When you begin the process of getting treatment for drug and alcohol addiction, you can then be available to reconnect with your family.Strengthen the MarriageYou and your spouse are the foundation of your family. In relationships where one party is struggling with addiction, the sober spouse is left to manage the house, the kids, and all the responsibilities. Often, the supporting spouse\u2019s own mental and emotional wellbeing is what falls through the cracks. There may be untreated physical health issues, difficulties with depression and/or anxiety, financial difficulty, career roadblocks, and more\u200a\u2014\u200aall of which the sober spouse is contending with alone. In addition to all this, spouses of first responders in this situation must also deal with concerns about addiction and the hardships their spouses face on the job every day.There are various ways to begin to strengthen and rebuild a primary relationship after addiction. You can:Attend couples therapy sessionsEncourage your spouse to attend 12-Step meetings for family members of people living with addictionEncourage your spouse to get treatment for any personal addiction or substance abuse issuesEncourage your spouse to enroll in private therapy sessionsAllow your spouse to take part in other parts of addiction treatment to increase understanding of the addiction disorder and how treatment worksConnecting with the KidsIn some ways, reconnecting with your children after addiction is far more difficult than attempting to rebuild any other relationship after addiction\u200a\u2014\u200aand in other ways, it is far easier. The guilt you feel over mistakes you made while under the influence or while prioritizing your addiction can be formidable when it comes to your kids. But remember, they are resilient and forgiving, and they love you unconditionally. Consistency in your effort to spend time with them, listen to them, and be there for them now won\u2019t erase the past, but it will demonstrate how much you love them and the kind of adult they can grow up to be.Making a Commitment to RecoveryThe road to recovery is long, and it can take work to rebuild your relationships with your family members as you work on yourself. But it\u2019s work that is worth it and that can pay off for a lifetime.

She wanted to avoid talking to people. Over time, she got more comfortable and learned to network, communicate and grow her leadership skills from fellow AMA members. Everyone is a leader, she says, but they must learn to see themselves a leader and realize that most career success and opportunity comes from well-developed people skills.Dahl says AMA events have also helped her keep current with industry innovation. Early in her career, an AMA member explained how to craft her first e-newsletter. She has never forgotten that help.Once people know how to communicate and innovate, Dahl says they must make themselves stand out among peers. Many people have the job title \u201cmarketing manager,\u201d but few marketing managers share the same skills. \u201cPeople differentiate themselves through the AMA,\u201d Dahl says. \u201cThey create viability for themselves and opportunity through other members.\u00a0\u2026 You make a difference.

People read her column and reached out to her, including an AMA board member who wanted her to speak.

This creates \u201chow people talk about you when you\u2019re not in the room.\u201dAfter Dahl started writing and speaking, she networked and learned more from other AMA members at events. \u201cI get emotional thinking about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI work hard for the AMA.

I\u2019ve been more and more conscious of this social change which is emphasized by commentators pondering the consequences as entire cities are becoming completely cashless; like Seoul or Sweden. The most obvious impact is that it exacerbates inequality even further. Cash is something that can be used by anyone no matter how rich or poor, technology, on the other hand, excludes. Clearly, the implications of a digital economy vary but its effects on cybercrime, the change in criminal behaviour and therefore the new types of perpetrators are alarming. Our guest author Richard has written about such implications. These to are inextricably linked to the growing class divide and I can see exaggerating it even more. What does this mean for the digital economy and digital companies? It\u2019s likely to pave the way for an alternative to the traditional banking systems, we might see more companies using alternative currencies and technologies in cashless transactions, and as such, I can see blockchain eliminating some of these issues but not all. We still have to find a way to include those less fortunate (providing access to necessary technology) but we will also need to be more creative in protecting all in society from those criminals taking advantage of this shift.\u2019The use of cash has been declining for decades. Increasingly, it\u2019s being replaced by a wide variety of digital payment platforms, everything from debit and credit cards to smartphones and cryptocurrencies. As these payment platforms continue to acquire more market share it\u2019s not far-fetched to imagine a world with no cash whatsoever. Because digitized platforms are secure, traceable, and more efficient, some countries have decided to make a cashless shift the centerpiece of their economic policy, including Sweden and Israel. On the other end of the development spectrum, in countries such as Somaliland, India, and Uruguay, the traditional consumer-based brick and mortar banking system is being supplanted by digital platforms to afford citizens greater access to local and global trade markets ill-served by cash.These changes have had consequences beyond personal finance and commerce. It turns out the transition from cash to digital transactions has played a major\u200a\u2014\u200aif perhaps unanticipated\u200a\u2014\u200arole in helping to reduce street crime. A significant source of cash in poor, high-crime neighbourhoods traditionally took the form of welfare cheques. The poor, lacking access to banks accounts, had to cash these cheques and carry physical money with them or keep it in their homes. This made them vulnerable to predatory crimes, such as theft and robbery. In a recent study, we found that when the U.S. government decided to replace welfare cheques with debit cards, this led to a 10 percent reduction in street crimes like burglary, theft, and assault. Our hypothesis is that the introduction of debit card systems to disburse benefits decreased the amount of cash available for crime.No one fears the demise of cash more than street criminals. For obvious reasons, they want to avoid electronic payments, which are traceable. Cash, on the other hand, is uniquely liquid, anonymous, and untraceable. In other words, perfect for crime. As one street criminal explained to us: \u201cIf they get rid of cash, there won\u2019t be no way for the non-working man to make a living.\u201dOver the past two decades, much of the world has experienced an unprecedented drop in street crime. Many factors contributed to that drop, but certainly among them was the declining use of cash and the rise of the digital economy. By replacing cash, digital payments reduced opportunities for street crime.All law-abiding citizens, especially those in high-crime areas, would agree that this is a welcome development. The evidence suggests, however, that the decreased use of cash and increased reliance on digital payments has been a double-edged sword. It has served to cut street crime, even as it has helped to make cybercrime possible. In that sense, the rise of the digital economy is changing the nature of crime itself, shifting the balance of criminal opportunities from the street to cyberspace. We see this not only in news reports of ever more spectacular hacks of global corporations, but also in the massive increase in identity theft and online credit card fraud.But the movement away from cash in favour of digital transactions is not only changing the nature of crime. It\u2019s also changing the nature of its victims and offenders. We doubt, for example, that many of those reading this column have been robbed at gun or knifepoint, whereas many of you have had your credit card information stolen.Put differently, the real beneficiaries of the almost universal drop in street crime aren\u2019t you and me, at least not mostly. They\u2019re the residents of the world\u2019s toughest and most tragic neighbourhoods. That\u2019s where most street crime happens. Now, with the increasing dominance of the digital economy, crime victims are starting to look a lot more like us\u200a\u2014\u200aand so are the offenders.What is happening to offenders in the face of a rapidly digitizing economy? Street criminals haven\u2019t abandoned robbery, burglary, and theft to take up cybercrime. This is where we see the criminological impact of the so-called digital divide; street criminals are being left behind because they lack the technological skills and access to keep up.As the gap widens between the digital haves and have-nots, we\u2019re creating a modern form of feudalism, where the poor are locked into place not just by a lack of money, but by a lack of access to a new world of technological and financial criminal opportunities. A new breed of cybercriminals is taking their place, and they\u2019re much better off, both financially and technologically. Essentially, crime is a resource, and the rich are in the process of stealing it from the poor.Few will lament the fact that the rise of the digital economy offers few opportunities for street criminals to ply their trade. It is worth pondering, however, what will become of these individuals as cash disappears altogether. A glimpse into that future might be provided by the homeless populations of the world\u2019s urban centres, whose plight can only be exacerbated by the march of technology.The new challenge will be figuring out how to protect ourselves against the emergent threat of cybercrime, where the losses are potentially much greater, more widespread, and perhaps perpetrated by an offender living on another continent. It certainly will require new forms of cooperation between governments and industry, but what those might look like remains very much in flux.One thing is clear. Much like the street criminals they were established to control, local law enforcement agencies too are in danger of being left behind by rise of the digital economy, and the new breed of cybercriminals it has spawned.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "MercuryFX Confirms xRapid Trials Successful\u200a\u2014\u200aRipple for President 2018?", "author_name": "John Saddington", "link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/mercuryfx-confirms-xrapid-trials-successful-ripple-for-president-2018-f515f6566b58?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 2, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "MercuryFX Confirms xRapid Trials Successful\u200a\u2014\u200aRipple for President 2018?John SaddingtonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 2, 2018What exactly is MercuryFX and will this be huge?", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Coinbase\u200a\u2014\u200aCan Now List Security Tokens\u200a\u2014\u200aXRP Next?

It feels like the collective is either screaming with rage, weighed down in despair, or checked out. I stare at my screen and wonder, \u201cWhat should I share? What is truly needed?\u201dI can\u2019t tell you the number of people I\u2019ve talked to recently who have said, \u201cI don\u2019t go on Facebook anymore,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m spending as little time online as possible.\u201d If I didn\u2019t do most of my work online, I\u2019d probably log off too. The collective roar of virtual anger, sadness and despair can feel overwhelming.I think we\u2019re going to see a rise in live events to counter online fatigue, but the web isn\u2019t going anywhere. Whether you share your thoughts online personally, or professionally, I think it\u2019s important for all of us to think about how each word, image, and video we share online has a ripple effect.In my opinion, there are four qualities we need to cultivate in our online communication during these stressful times:Truth. The web has made communication and sharing so easy that many of the rules of good journalism have been thrown out the window (e.g. fact-checking, researching the validity of sources, giving credit to work that is not your own). As we enter into a time when the term \u201calternative facts\u201d has become part of our lexicon, it\u2019s more important than ever to share the truth online. That means everything from making sure quotes are attributed to the right person (even inspiring ones), to not assuming everything you read online is true, to researching and crediting sources, to not painting our lives as being full of unicorns and rainbows.2. Grounded. Information overload + emotional overload = overwhelm and shut down. People need concrete, relevant, accessible, timely information right now (e.g how to cook dinner for your family after working all day, how to manage post-election anxiety, how to start journaling, how to contact your Congressperson, how to cultivate a daily exercise routine, how to be an intersectional activist). So many people are asking, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Help them channel their fear and anxiety into practical actions that will help them feel calm and empowered.3. Uplifting. Just like when you\u2019re carrying a heavy box for a long time, you have to stop and rest once in a while, we need to have breaks from the unrelenting bad news, or we\u2019ll shut down. Reading something funny, hopeful, inspiring, or entertaining can re-energize us. There\u2019s a reason that comedic takes on the news (e.g. The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Full Frontal with Sam Bee, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, SNL\u2019s Weekend Update) are so popular. They allow us to laugh at horrible things. Give your people a reason to feel hope and joy again.4. Safety. There\u2019s sooooooooo much that we need to talk about right now, but we can\u2019t do it if we feel like we\u2019re going to be virtually screamed at when we share our opinion. One of the beauties of social media is that it is social. It can facilitate conversation and sharing. Unfortunately, it can also encourage trolling and verbal abuse. In order to foster online discussions, we need to create safe spaces where people feel comfortable voicing their opinion and sharing their story. One way to do that is to create very clear commenting and discussion guidelines, and to jump in quickly if they aren\u2019t being followed.What do you think of the state of our online conversation at the moment?How has it changed what, or how you communicate online?Photos by me.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Invest in Ripple or XRP?\u200a\u2014\u200aFleetcor Pilots XRP\u200a\u2014\u200a#EXPANSION", "author_name": "John Saddington", "link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/invest-in-ripple-or-xrp-fleetcor-pilots-xrp-expansion-3a2c9e7d3272?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 9, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "Invest in Ripple or XRP?\u200a\u2014\u200aFleetcor Pilots XRP\u200a\u2014\u200a#EXPANSIONJohn SaddingtonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 9, 2018Wait\u2026 should you be investing in Ripple or XRP (or both)?!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Bitcoin No Longer Relevant\u200a\u2014\u200aBetter Choice is RIPPLE?\u200a\u2014\u200aTODAYS\u00a0FUD!", "author_name": "John Saddington", "link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/bitcoin-no-longer-relevant-better-choice-is-ripple-todays-fud-8c57b63a4152?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 4, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "Bitcoin No Longer Relevant\u200a\u2014\u200aBetter Choice is RIPPLE?\u200a\u2014\u200aTODAYS\u00a0FUD!John SaddingtonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 4, 2018It\u2019s really hard to ignore Ripple at this point in time guys!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "The Ripple Effect: Creating Successful Startups", "author_name": "StartUp Health", "link": "https://healthtransformer.co/the-ripple-effect-creating-successful-startups-ed08e3b487ed?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 6, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "51", "content": "The Ripple Effect: Creating Successful StartupsDoug Galen of RippleWorks on connecting fledgling startups with accomplished entrepreneursStartUp HealthBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 6, 2017\u201cRippleWorks is my fifth startup,\u201d said Doug Galen, CEO & Co-founder, RippleWorks. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve learned in all five is if we\u2019re lucky enough to get the product market fit to scaling stage, the number of people that have actually sat in our seat and experienced scaling is [small].In this episode of StartUp Health NOW, Doug Galen chats with Unity Stoakes, president of StartUp Health, at the Health 2.0 2017 Conference in Santa Clara, California.

One could venture that popular categories like comedy, fashion/beauty/lifestyle and pop culture could be among the first verticals launched given how successful they have been categorically across media formats, and in digital.Gilman and Ziemianski are no strangers to the strategy. With a background in traditional entertainment, Gilman was brought on to run digital video for Fremantle Media North America and set up its digital studio, TinyRiot!. Under her tenure, TinyRiot! built and ran food-centric property \u201cMunchies\u201d in partnership with Vice. She also, with Ziemanski, ran and relaunched The Pet Collective, which recently merged with Jukin Media.At Big Frame, Ziemianski led the teams that stood up three vertical brands\u200a\u2014\u200aForefront, an urban brand, Wonderly, targeted at the geeky girls, and Polished, a beauty and fashion brand.\u201cAfter working together at Tiny Riot, we realized that, although we came to the online video business from different disciplines, we shared many of the same creative sensibilities. That struck us as an opportunity to forge a great partnership,\u201d said Gilman.Ripple\u2019s parent company, Red Arrow, has built a solid international business from owning specialized entertainment production companies equipped to produce and distribute linear programming. It currently operates a stable of entertainment production companies in Europe and the US including Mark Burnett\u2019s United Artists Media Groups, but as the market has started leaning more in favor of digital, the company saw a clear need to expand the skillset and expertise there.According to Red Arrow CEO Jan Frouman, the decision to launch Ripple Entertainment is an undertaking with the highest level of internal corporate endorsement. \u201c[Ripple] has been a topic discussed to the highlest levels, even at Prosieben with a real commitment to build this over next few years including investment ambition and investment requirements.\u201dIndustry sources familiar with building and launching standalone brands like this indicate that a single brand launch is roughly a $2\u20135 million commitment over three years, minimum. Realistically, Ripple Entertainment is an endeavor banking in the tens of millions.On the financials, Frouman added: \u201cIt\u2019s a multiyear plan with a significant investment commitment.\u201d This is a startup and a startup has estimated capital that needs to be deployed.

According to CNBC (and ostensibly confirmed by Kevin himself) the banking institutions include: Standard Chartered, Accenture Ventures, SCB Digital Ventures, the venture arm of Siam Commercial Bank, and Japan\u2019s SBI Holdings.That Ripple is raising is not unheard of\u200a\u2014\u200ato date, they\u2019ve raised around $93 million, and continue to try to journey towards profitability. This recent fundraising round is undoubtedly pushed forward on the recent news of the consortium of banks creating their own protocol based on Ripple (which I talked about a couple of weeks ago).UBS, the Swiss bank, pioneered the \u201cutility settlement coin\u201d and has now joined forces with Deutsche Bank,Santander and BNY Mellon\u200a\u2014\u200aas well as the broker ICAP\u200a\u2014\u200ato pitch the idea to central banks, aiming for its first commercial launch by early 2018.Ripple does contain some interesting properties presently unique to it\u2019s protocol, which are nicely explained on WhatIsRipple.info. The first two things listed there are pretty common to any blockchain-based currency.One of the more interesting principles, though, is the decentralized exchange/transaction facilitation.There are many other payment providers on the Ripple network.Brent is a customer of Justcoin, and his Justcoin balance is stored on the Ripple network alongside the Bitstamp balances of Alice and Bob.Brent also wants to buy from Alice. However, Alice does not accept his Justcoin balance. She does not want to sign up with Justcoin to withdraw her money.Bob does a lot of business with other Justcoin customers, and so he wouldn\u2019t mind a Justcoin balance. Because Bob agreed to this, the network will automatically transfer some of Bob\u2019s Bitstamp balance to Alice, in exchange for an equivalent Justcoin balance from Brent.Bob acted as an intermediary and facilitated a payment between Brent and Alice, and two different payment providers. He can choose to charge a small fee for this service.Because customers from different providers constantly want to send money between each other, there are many people like Bob on the network, and the market will keep the exchange fee low.It\u2019s early days with Ethereum, and this capability could easily be written into an Ethereum token, but currently only exists in Ripple-based blockchains. This another reason why banks are gravitating towards this protocol, since it has the built in functionality of handling the ownership and transfer of multiple financial instruments\u200a\u2014\u200aeven instruments that have their own blockchains.As I talked about a couple weeks ago, the Ripple protocol isn\u2019t without it\u2019s downsides. Ripple has some fundamental flaws that must be examined and weighed both for the benefit of banks looking to move to this new technology as well as folks looking to innovate on blockchain technology in the crypto-sector. A report commissioned by distributed ledger consulting group R3CEV and authored by bitcoin developer Peter Todd has raised questions about Ripple and it\u2019s ability to withstand the rigorous security demands of high-finance.\u201cRipple still holds the majority of XRP, and it is in their favor for its value to increase,\u201d says the report. \u201cRipple justifies XRP as an \u2018anti-spam mechanism\u2019 to deter transactions\u2026 However, as the volume of transactions increases the server load, transaction speed is slowed while the cost of the transaction and the amount of required XRP continues to increase.\u201dTodd next walks readers through a number of theoretical attacks that could take place against the Ripple protocol, discussing his estimates of the cost, scope, duration and probability of the scenarios.Perhaps the most glaring, Todd\u2019s writing infers, is the damage that could be done due to a \u201csoftware backdoor\u201d, as he finds that Ripple \u201cdoes not provide a secure way to download any of their software\u201d.\u201cThis is a serious omission that has lead to significant monetary losses in the past. Ripple Labs should be following industry best-practice by signing git commits and tags as well as PGP signing their Ubuntu packages,\u201d Todd added.Todd ends by highlighting the potential real-world implications of these attacks in an elaborate scenario involving a dispute between the Russian government and Shell Oil, forecasting how these parties might attempt to achieve their aims through coercion on the network.This is a common flaw in some implementations of cryptos as well\u200a\u2014\u200athose looking to launch a new cryptocurrency and looking to avoid being 51% attacked during the nascent moments of the life of the coin may look to private mining or some other form of centralization, but in these cases, they\u2019re creating honeypots for hackers as well as the key thing blockchain technology was designed to mitigate: central points of failure. As we discussed in the Bitfinex post a couple weeks ago, the common key component to every major loss, theft or hack in cryptocurrency history has been central points of failure.My prediction is that this group of banks will move forward with their implementation of Ripple, and see some gains from using this new technology, and likely use it as a stepping stone to more open versions of the technology in the future. As I said, this is technology of particular importance to financial institutions, but it isn\u2019t remarkably complex technology, and could easily be achieved on a more robustly supported blockchain like Ethereum, or even future updates to Bitcoin.The post Ask Doctor Bitcoin: What Makes Ripple a Unique Blockchain Technology? appeared first on Mark \u201cRizzn\u201d Hopkins.via WordPress http://ift.tt/2cGv8iC", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Take a Ripple to the\u00a0Heart", "author_name": "Yummi Delish a.k.a.

The structure of rosters will look different as players move fluidly back-and-forth between teams. The two-way contracts allow for improved integration between the NBA and their D-League affiliates. But with such a change comes perhaps some unintended consequences.To clarify a few things, each NBA team (including those without D-League affiliates of their own), may sign up to two players to two-way contracts. Players may move freely back and forth between both teams as the two-way players do not count against the 15-man NBA roster.A player may spend a total of 45 days on the NBA roster before a team must provide them with a qualifying offer to keep them on the NBA side. Players with three years or fewer of NBA service may sign a two-way contract. For more details on salary, click here for a breakdown.Reputation To Be\u00a0BuiltFirst, NBA teams will be navigating uncharted waters with two-way contracts. Speaking to a number of NBA front office people, some suggest two-way deals will be offered nearly immediately after the NBA Draft, while some suggest teams might wait it out through training camp.Whatever the case may be, teams will need to establish credibility with this first year of two-way contracts. Teams may bring two-way players up to NBA rosters for up to 45 days, but there is no guarantee they will do so. The minimum a two-way player can earn is $75,000, while they can cap out at approximately $275,000 if they are on an NBA roster for the maximum allotment.At first teams will be cautious about making sure players don\u2019t use up those days early (unless they have outperformed their deal at which point they will max them out and sign them to a qualifying offer thereafter). With that, teams should take consideration into ensuring a player does see those 45 days on their roster.Obviously a player has to earn it, and should be treated on a case-by-case basis, but if a player has, for example, 22 days left on their deal, teams should call up that player for the remaining 22 days of their deal in order to maximize their salary and reward them for signing a two-way deal.Most of this is done on handshake agreements between teams and agents obviously, but teams who provide players with greater opportunity on the NBA side will definitely see greater attention the following year when teams can offer new two-way deals.Watered Down D-League\u00a0DraftI\u2019ve written extensively on the draft and its needless length. Each season the D-League seems to acknowledge this by reducing the number of required rounds. Last season, the draft was reduced to six rounds from eight, with only the first four rounds required for draft selection.As reported this past week, the D-League is acknowledging this once more by reducing the draft to four rounds in total according to a league source. Any teams who traded for fifth or sixth round picks will not be compensated for those picks, nor are teams allowed to trade those picks (obviously).Two-way contracts just add another layer to D-League rosters that make the draft value plummet. Add your two-way contracts, plus affiliate players (up to four from NBA training camp), as well as returning players (some teams had five returners this past season) and you are already at 11 players, before the draft even takes place. D-League rosters are allowed a maximum of 12 players, with 10 being active on game day.Thus, it will be even more challenging for players to make a roster outside of the first round of the draft.Add in the fact there will be three new teams added to the D-League next season and a late first-round pick doesn\u2019t hold the same value as it did even two years ago (19 teams took part in the 2015 as opposed to 25 next year).Thus, in the first four rounds you\u2019ll hear 100 names selected with a majority being waived roughly 10 days later at the end of training camp. That isn\u2019t to say gems can\u2019t be found in the draft. Marcus Posley was selected 44th overall by the Skyforce and has been a valuable rotational piece for them this season.Fewer 10-Day\u00a0Deals?I\u2019ve heard multiple opinions on this concern. Does the addition of two-way contracts negate the need for 10-day contracts? Yes and no.Two-way players don\u2019t count against the NBA roster and thus are 16th and 17th addition for guys who can earn minutes on the NBA side to continue their development. That being said, the two-way contracts are for those on the cusp of the NBA but aren\u2019t quite there yet, thus some D-League seasoning could help them on that path.10-day deals, typically, are for teams looking for someone who can contribute immediately. Whether that\u2019s through a rebuilding process and turn a new leaf over with a roster, or for a team looking to add a piece for a playoff piece. That\u2019s certainly not always the case, but for the most part 10-days are for the immediate future, whereas two-way deals are viewed as the long-term option for teams.Plus, if a team needs a point guard but neither of their two-way players are such, they can add a point guard from the D-League or free agency through a 10-day deal to fill that roster void.The other question becomes, where do all the minutes go? With the addition of the two-way contracts, it\u2019s been predicted the minutes for 10-day deals next season might be cut in half next season as a result of two-way contracts. That remains to be seen, but it would seem reasonable to think teams have a greater investment in two-way players thus giving them limited minutes would take priority over a 10-day deal.Risk/RewardTeams will often subsidize the low D-League salaries with training camp guarantees. Those can range anywhere from $50,000, up to $250,000 (Ben Bentil). That will no longer be the case with two-way contracts as players will only be allowed to receive a maximum $50,000 guarantee per the new NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement. If a player is signed with a greater training camp guarantee, that player is not allowed to sign a two-way deal with that team. That being said, this could work a number of different ways.$50,000 could set the market for some teams across the board for two-way players and affiliates. Teams might be inclined to invite players to camp and offer all $50,000 with the possibility of signing them to a two-way deal based on their camp performance. If a team offers more they can\u2019t do that so it\u2019s possible this is the new market standard for camp players across the board.Obviously for teams like the Nuggets, Wizards, Pelicans, Trail Blazers, and Clippers, that won\u2019t be the case as they won\u2019t have affiliate players to send to their non-existent D-League affiliate, but this could set a trend moving forward. Again, it all depends on when teams wish to unload their two-way deals. Some teams may choose to be forthright and make a move immediately after the draft, while others might wait to see what a player brings to training camp.While a player can earn up to $275,000 on a two-way deal, there is a possibility they could earn more if they seek a D-League buyout and sign overseas.

I don\u2019t even remember exactly what we disagreed about, but I definitely remember how much I enjoyed that back and forth with her.Our discussion was so lively that it spilled over into an hour-long conversation after the workshop ended, and sparked a lifelong friendship.A few weeks ago, my partner, Yvette, and I headed down to the Outer Banks of North Carolina to visit and vacation with Rita, who\u2019s now retired.On our second evening with her, we ate at The Tale of the Whale, a restaurant with one of the most spectacular views, and delicious food.Toward the end of our meal, Rita excused herself to use the restroom. When she sat back down, she noticed that her dinner companions were now a strange man, eating dinner with his lovely wife. \u201cOops,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cI must have sat down at the wrong table!\u201dLaughter ensued and Rita quickly made her way back to our table. Moments later the woman joined us at our table, nudged Rita over to make room for herself, and proceeded to laugh hysterically.She returned to her table after a few moments, and we all continued to laugh for the rest of our meal.When the bill came, I heard Rita whisper something to our waitress, who was also their waitress. I wasn\u2019t at all surprised to learn later that she had taken care of their bottle of wine.Emulating RemarkableI keep thinking about Rita\u2019s generous nature, and I\u2019m struck by the ripple effect of knowing her. As a result, I find myself wanting to emulate that level of generosity in my life.It\u2019s left me asking myself a few simple questions, like:What behaviors do I encourage in others by the way I behave?How can I gain that same great feeling afforded by Rita\u2019s way of being?In what ways can I share my resources?Am I generous? How do I know?When am I stingy, and why?How to I spend more time with people who inspire me the way Rita does?Sure, Rita is retired from her leadership role at DuPont, but she\u2019ll never be retired from her leadership role in life.Rather than focusing on how you can get more out of your people, consider helping them discover, grow and share all they have to offer.

Watch his full talk and all of our fireside chats with leading financial services executives, fintech startups, and venture investors here.Since its earliest days, Ripple has been focused on how it can unlock \u201cthe Internet of Value,\u201d according to Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of enterprise blockchain firm Ripple.\u201cWe acknowledge we\u2019re on Mile 1 of a 26 mile race,\u201d stated Garlinghouse while speaking to Fortune\u2019s Jeff Roberts at CB Insights\u2019 annual Future of Fintech conference.Ripple, which offers a blockchain-based cross-border payments solution, is built on top of its associated cryptocurrency XRP.Despite some controversy, XRP is uniquely positioned to solve cross-border payments, according to Garlinghouse, using its product xRapid to fund real-time liquidity.With so called \u201cbridge currency,\u201d Garlinghouse claims \u201cwe can accelerate the engine of commerce on a global basis\u00a0\u2026 enable payments to move the way information moves today.\u201dHe went on to say that while money transfer giants like Western Union have spent 100 years optimizing their massive treasury operations, Ripple has optimized its product and made it just as efficient within 6 months.While talking about the company\u2019s target market, he mentioned that banks won\u2019t be the company\u2019s first customers. Ripple currently has 6 different pilots with payments providers, but expects 1 bank to use XRP in its payment flow this year.\u201cIt\u2019s faster, it\u2019s cheaper\u00a0\u2026 and so, why wouldn\u2019t someone use it?\u00a0\u2026 if banks can use a product like [this] to fund real-time liquidity\u00a0\u2026 that\u2019s a big shift in a positive\u00a0way.\u201dWhen challenged about whether Ripple had control over XRP (as the company owns a majority of outstanding XRP), Garlinghouse noted that if Ripple shut down tomorrow, XRP would continue to operate.\u201cXRP is not a security. If Ripple shut down tomorrow, [the] XRP ledger would continue to operate\u00a0\u2026 if you buy XRP, you\u2019re not buying shares of Ripple.\u201dOn blockchain in general, Garlinghouse noted there\u2019s a lot of misinformation in the market and we\u2019re seeing these \u201cHoly Wars\u201d play out across the space.But, this revolution of blockchain isn\u2019t happening outside of the system. Garlinghouse argued that since the government isn\u2019t going away, banks aren\u2019t going away.

There is a sharp increase in volumes on the background of the decline to the blue trend line, which also shifted slightly. In the current situation, the most appropriate solution may again be a decrease in trading activity until the technical picture becomes clearer and new key points are formed. In the case of another decline to the blue line, it may be worthwhile to use the opportunity to open a small long position.EthereumETH chart at the moment testing the support line at $154. Volatility has increased, long shadows form on the candles, which indicates uncertainty among the participants, but it is at such moments that key turning points are usually formed, so we are closely following the dynamics and waiting for the formation of a local trend, within which it will be possible to increase the share in portfolio with the prospect of mid-term position holding.RippleA small position in the XRP is closed by a foot during the breakdown of the support line ($0.317). The chart reached another support a month ago at the level of $0.295 and so far they are consolidating around this price. While the current dynamics does not allow us to make the assumption that the bottom is formed since at the moment there is a weakness. However, in this asset, the dependence on general market sentiment is most noticeable, therefore, scenarios of future movement both up and down are possible. In this regard, we prefer to stand aside until the time of greater certainty.EOSEOS chart did not meet with any support at $4.9, but at the moment it identified a new local level of $4.57. At the current coin, the probability of a decline to $4.4 remains. However, for medium-term traders, the coin still looks promising, so in case of a change in the current trend in the market as a whole and the formation of a local trend in this instrument, there may be good conditions for new purchases.LitecoinLTC chart is below support and moves within a downtrend marked on the price chart with a blue line. In the current situation, there are no other ideas besides just waiting. In the event that chart can break the trend and return above the green line, it will be possible for traders to reconsider their attitude to the coin and only in this case look for points with an optimal ratio of profit for the formation of a share in the portfolio.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

And when they are being social, it seems as if a vast majority of the conversations being had are putting down other people or not accepting others for who they truly are.Because of this, lots of people don\u2019t understand that they are worth anything. Let me just tell you here and now, you are good enough!Screw the people that don\u2019t like you for who you are and don\u2019t support the different approaches that you take towards living your best life. After all, the life that you are currently living is yours, and yours only. No one else has control or can dictate the course of your life but you. So, stop letting the words of other people bring you down. This life is yours to live, so take advantage of it!There are people out there that will rise up and support you for who you are, you just need to make an effort to surround yourself with those kinds of people! Once you begin to find these kinds of people, you will find the results to be very positive and impactful.Ripple Strategy #2\u200a\u2014\u200aHave a Detective MindsetAs a rippler seeking connections, you must be willing to come to a conversation with an inquisitive mindset. Or as I\u2019d like to put it, a detective mindset. You need to be willing to have conversations and ask the right questions.For a manager or leader of a team, these questions can be as simple as:Why are you here? What excites you? Where are you from?Asking such questions show others that you are truly interested in learning more about them and ultimately, connecting with them. When you create opportunities to have authentic conversations, you will get authentic answers in return.If you\u2019re an executive and want to get the most out of your people, you should be curious about those working for you.You need to make time to engage with your people.If you would like to get the most out of them, you must be the top engager within the organization. If you set out to be the top engager, your people will be more inclined to not let you down and do the best work that they can because their leader has made them feel valuable by setting out to connect with them.When you set out to have conversations, you will win the hearts and minds of your people over.Ripple Strategy #3\u200a\u2014\u200aReveal and Leverage Connection PointsSomething that I strongly believe to be essential and important to any relationship is connection points. Some of your that are reading may be unfamiliar with the term connection points, so allow me to explain.In my eyes, connection points are the bite-sized morsels of information you learn about someone. Perhaps where they are from, a hobby or how committed they are to their family. These unique qualities about someone stand out and make them how they are in your heart and your mind. Leveraging connection points can quickly connect you and bond you to other people in a way that much more powerful than job title, profession or other surface facts about someone.For example, using these little nuggets makes your relationship more memorable leveraging these items to continue your conversations with them can contribute to your relationship in a very positive manner. Things that only you and the other person can relate to which immediately creates a sense of uniqueness in your relationship hopefully for both of you.Connection points can be something as simple as having a similar childhood experience, being from the same state or city, liking the same sports team, having a distinct interest in a hobby like mountain biking or underwater basket weaving (I made that last one up).You get the point.As you can see, I believe strongly in connection points and how powerful they can be to anchor new connections and built sustainable longer-term relationships with the people already know but want to know better.It\u2019s not just about learning things about other people. It\u2019s about creating strong inroads and leveraging connection points to establish a deeper, more meaningful relationship with another human being. It\u2019s about creating that Ripple.Get good at taking notes, capturing information and finding opportunities to reengage people. It tells people that you want them in your life personally or professionally and it shows that that you have genuine interest in their life.Put These Strategies to\u00a0Work!Using these strategies will help you find a way to make an impact on other people in a positive way\u200a\u2014\u200abig or small. It will also develop you into someone unique and worth paying attention to.I would love to hear how these strategies work for you.These strategies certainly have been essential to my personal and professional brand, and I continue to use these strategies on a consistent basis because I have found them to be beneficial and worth using!Ripple On!!!P.S.

A fantastic campaign out of the US is launching today creating an amazing call to action around gender balance. We\u2019re thrilled to see this taking place, and of course, love the lessons and shared learning about how we can all get behind this campaign.It\u2019s an extremely timely discussion, but Canada\u2019s been leading this conversation for a while. With our Prime Minister\u2019s appointment in 2015 of a gender-balanced cabinet, we\u2019ve seen this issue get important airtime, but we know that other institutions have been working toward this for some time.December 6th Mural\u200a\u2014\u200aYork U Lassonde School of EngineeringWe\u2019ve been working with the incredible team at the Lassonde School of Engineering, York University, who launched Canada\u2019s first 50:50 challenge for an engineering school. Over the past few months, we\u2019ve been learning about the world of STEM, and getting to understand the experience of women in this industry. For more than 30 years, many in the scientific and tech communities have asked about the lack of women\u2019s involvement. Despite some initial breakthroughs with dedicated programming and resources through the 80s and 90s, progress towards better gender balance has slowed. To overcome this, Lassonde set this ambitious goal to see their faculty, student body and their approach to engineering education transform. We\u2019ve been hanging out at Lassonde to better understand these efforts, and to help them to develop a new strategy to achieving this ambition.York U Lassonde School of EngineeringCan we find a way forward so that women and other underrepresented groups find their ways to opportunities in STEM, to stay within the sector and succeeded at creating new innovations for us all?

The currency (shortened as XRP) has shown an astounding value appreciation over the past year by as much as 4000%. That is $40K for every $1000 that was invested.XRP\u2019s original promise (fast block mining) is exciting and make it a potential alternative to fiat-currencies for daily transactions, but I wouldn\u2019t be so optimistic about its future. Here\u2019s why:1. Ripple is better off with no volatility[embed]https://youtu.be/vsEVF4LV_gI[/embed]As Brad Garlinghouse states in this interview, the goal of Ripple, the company, is to become a professional alternative to SWIFT and other traditional money-transfer services. He believes Bitcoin is not the way banks would go, because, for starters, it can split, plus, it was not created with such professionalism in mind, it is the wild west of cryptocurrencies. So, a cryptocurrency with high volatility is not in Ripple\u2019s best interests. Because if people have expectations that it will go so much up in value, they will not spend, they will hoard, making it impossible to replace fiat-currencies. Hence Ripple decided to lock up $14B in XRP cryptocurrency, rendering itself as a relatively stable resort.2. But the primary XRP exchange is no longer associated with\u00a0Ripple!Here comes the second piece you should be aware of before buying into XRP. Ripple, the company, and Ripple, the currency are now two different things. While Ripple still develops and maintains the Ripple source code, its primary exchange (where you can actually buy XRP directly with cash or its equivalents) is now part of a smaller company called Gatehub. This decision makes sense for the business. Operating an exchange should be messy. Ripple, still a small operation, needs to focus its limited resources on one thing; and that is, as of today, is to sell its solutions to banks. However, this also means that there is not a single reliable exchange that supports direct fiat-currency to XRP trade as of today.3. XRP is NOT as decentralized[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNXedeCyNg[/embed]Thirdly, XRP, by design, is not as decentralized as Bitcoin. It is very much under the wings of a single company. My experience entertaining it, if you install a node, it will not hold a wallet, but it will just serve to prove transactions. The official wallet clients of Ripple rely on third party full nodes to transact. And as Ripple Chief Technologist David Schwartz explains in the video above, Ripple -the company- has the power to identify each node on the system and can shut them down if they ever feel threatened.4. Goldman Sachs is going with its\u00a0own.Last but not least, a patent awarded to Goldman Sachs suggests that the company is already considering or working on its own cryptocurrency to facilitate intercontinental transactions. While this is certainly great news for the blockchain industry as a whole as it validates its potential, it may not be the best for Ripple, as it also validates that they will not be able to partner with one of the world\u2019s biggest banks.5. Fast mining? Ethereum already has\u00a0that!If what makes Ripple a sexy alternative to Bitcoin is its fast mining, then it faces stiff competition. Ethereum, which is already more popular, positioned as the de-facto currency of ICOs, already has quick transactions as short as 15 seconds. Moreover, Ethereum\u2019s liquidity levels are higher, as it is available for direct trade in most popular exchanges.All in all, Ripple as a company may have a future, but would that have any impact to XRP as a currency is another unanswered question one should consider. If one day a credible exchange like Coinbase decides to support Ripple, its value may jump like it did with Ethereum just recently. But we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to happen, or whether that\u2019s what the company wants or would let happen; so it\u2019s full of question marks.", "responses": ""}, {"title":

February 2018, Western Union confirmed that it was testing the development of Ripple, a company that announced ambitious plans to optimize payment systems. Applications for cooperation with various money transfer services and pilot projects involving xRapid have for some time successfully supported XRP afloat, feeding investors with promises. However, it seems that the testing of Ripple offers did not bring companies satisfaction.In this month Hikmet Ersek, CEO of Western Union reported that displeased at the price consequences of the use of XRP. He expected that introduction of NT would shorten expenses and will promote efficiency. Judging on statements, changes did not happen in the best side.Ripple representatives immediately responded to critical statements from Ersek. Ashish Birla, senior vice president of the company said:\u201cIf they moved the large volumes facilities, maybe, they would get a due effect. But conducting only 10 transactions, there is nothing to be surprised, that no obvious economy is visible. A company accomplishes million of transactions in a month, and I am not surprised, that 10 translations through our decisions did not show staggering results\u201d.Now Western Union gave a patent request on cryptocurrency application. We will mark that neither Ripple nor XRP in her not mentioned. The mutual relations of Western Union and Ripple lasted all the half-year. WU, alike, did certain conclusions decided that did not want to be limited to only one cryptocurrency.Some believe that this is another bad news for Ripple\u2019s cryptocurrency: from the beginning of the year, from time to time, the topic of the overvalued and uselessness of XRP, the insolvency of the asset for investment, emerges from time to time.

Some people love it, others hate it. A core of die-hard crypto believers don\u2019t view it as cryptocurrency at all, seeing it as a centralised protocol that doesn\u2019t use a blockchain and is just another tool to help banks and bankers do what they have always done: siphon money off the rest of us.Ripple launched in 2012 as a B2B solution for financial organisations. Its token, XRP, trades just like other cryptos on most exchanges. Ripple doesn\u2019t exactly use a traditional blockchain: instead it has a distributed consensus ledger that relies on a network of validating servers. It\u2019s not open like the bitcoin blockchain, more \u2018semi-permissioned\u2019, involving gateways and so-called trust lines.The market treated XRP much the same as other cryptos in the bubble at the end of last year. Traders certainly believe Ripple has a future as a payment network between banks. But is it crypto? That depends on your outlook.Ripple is a different model to blockchain. It certainly represents an improvement on existing money transfer protocols, which is why many banks are starting to take an interest (fuelling that speculative demand for XRP). It won\u2019t be for everyone, especially the more libertarian of bitcoin believers. It\u2019s more open than existing banking solutions, but hardly in the same category as popular blockchains.Will it be part of the new financial order?

The capitalization index from Wednesday added 3.2% and currently stands at $191 billion.Credit: CoinMarketcapThe news background for these coins is neutral, and the market as a whole, not counting purchases in BTC, remains unprincipled.BitcoinBTC chart could finally move higher, breaking even the psychological mark at the level of $6000. At the moment, this coin shows the best dynamics among the cryptocurrencies from the TOP-10 list in terms of capitalization. The movement is in trend, so from a technical point of view, everything is according to the classic\u200a\u2014\u200awe move the stop loss as new price highs update to a safe level and manage the position, unloading or increasing its volume, as the chart is removed or approach directly to the trend line itself. The immediate goal is in the region of $6800, but given the amplitude dynamics of the pair in recent times, it is highly likely that the movement to this point can be stretched over time.EthereumETH is trying to catch up with the leader, however, while buyers are cautious, as a result, the chart did not manage to overcome the maximum of the current week. As we already wrote in the last review, at such moments it is more correct to redistribute capital in favor of the leaders and carefully observe the dynamics of those who are lagging behind. Such behavior of participants may not necessarily be a signal of weakness, and sometimes even the other way around\u200a\u2014\u200aa kind of pent-up demand is being formed, which, as practice shows, can, in turn, provoke a rather sharp reduction in the spread between these two crying coins. One way or another, the immediate goal of $184 remains, but so far there is no good opportunity to open a position with an acceptable profit/risk ratio.RippleThere is still a weakness in XRP. Chart fell to the level of support is are now trying to rebound. Such dynamics are preserved for a decent period of time, and in this coin, we do not take any actions until it becomes obvious that the situation has changed somehow.EOSEOS dynamics is ragged and well reflects the state of investor uncertainty. Spikes in volatility at key points clearly confirm this. While it is impossible to say at the moment who will be stronger\u200a\u2014\u200athe bulls or bears, so we remain out of position and wait for any prompts. In the case of going up, things are not as clear as they might seem at first glance since the volatility factor creates market noise, which clearly interferes with making trading decisions.LitecoinChart of LTC at the beginning struck the lower boundary of the converging triangle, after which it simultaneously turned around and went beyond the upper boundary. Such dynamics also reflect the uncertainty among the participants, so before making a decision on the formation of a position in this coin, we consider it important to wait until the moment when volatility decreases and the technical picture becomes more obvious.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

The capitalization rate from Wednesday rose by 1.2% to $178 billion.BitcoinBTC chart remains within the trading range and, moving in a trend, continue their smooth ascent to resistance around $5,400. Thus, over a longer period of time, the consolidation process has been going on for more than two weeks. As before, we believe that small purchases within a trend can be justified only at points where the risk is minimal, i.e. when approaching chart to the trend line itself. For more aggressive purchases, conditions are still being formed, so this will become possible only if the upper limit of the trading range at the level of $5,400 is broken.EthereumETH after the rebound from the support continued the upward movement. Within the local trend, as well as in BTC, it is possible to make small purchases with a short stop. The likely target is in the resistance area ($184). Over a longer period of time, our view of the technical situation does not change\u200a\u2014\u200athe chart line is within a wide trading range with borders of $154- $184.RippleIn XRP, there is a situation of uncertainty about the direction of further movement of quotations. Prices returned above the support line, however, against the background of the dynamics of a number of other cryptocurrencies, this did not happen very confidently. You can see the formation of a local uptrend, so you can try to open reasonable in volume long positions with a small stop if the chart approaches the blue line.EOSEOS, like other cryptocurrency market heavyweights, remains sideways. The chart is moving within the trading range of $4.90- $5.90, which was formed after the rapid growth at the beginning of the month. You can buy in small volumes from the blue line with a stop below the trend line itself, or do nothing and wait for clearer signals in the form of reaching the upper or lower border of the trading range. Due to the fact that at the present time the technical picture of the most liquid instruments is approximately the same, and the dynamics of a single coin, by and large, depending on the overall market dynamics, for short-term speculation everyone chooses his own tools based on personal preferences.LitecoinIn LTC, the strategy does not change\u200a\u2014\u200awe remain in a small long, and in the case of a breakdown of the red line, it will be possible to increase the share in the portfolio.

The company itself is building on top of the decentralized XRP network to create applications like xRapid for on-demand liquidity, xCurrent for enterprise payment processing, and xVia for frictionless cross-border payments.Asheesh Birla is the Senior Vice President of Product Management at Ripple. Asheesh sat down with PCMag to talk about the difference between cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, regulation around the world, Ripple\u2019s cross-border payments goals, and the future of decentralized apps.PCMag: Let\u2019s start with the price conversation and get it out of the way. XRP hasn\u2019t been immune to the big swings and market drops the cryptocurrency market has experienced this year after the boom of 2017. XRP and ETH have leapfrogged each other a couple times in recent months as the second-largest cryptocurrency. How big a factor is price of the cryptocurrency to Ripple\u2019s day-to-day operations as a separate company?Asheesh Birla, Ripple Senior VP of Product ManagementAsheesh Birla: Day-to-day, we don\u2019t think about the price. Back in 2013, when most digital assets were nearly worthless, we didn\u2019t really factor price into it. We don\u2019t factor it in all that much right now either; we take a longer-term view of the entire market. I think our founders have done a good job of laying out a vision and making clear that if you\u2019re here for a one- or two-year blip, this is not the place to be. Your [crypto] project has to be tuned into the long-term instead of the day-to-day volatility.This is my third crash now in the crypto-market, and I am not phased by it. The flip side is that sometimes you crash and take out all the folks who are not focused on solving real problems and real use cases. And, I think you are going to see some really interesting companies come out of this next downturn.That\u2019s a sentiment I\u2019ve have heard from a lot of people as I have covered crypto the last couple of years; blockchain companies separating the coin from the technology. I often find the perception of cryptocurrencies as digital stocks to be frustratingly reductive. How much focus do you think should be put on coin price and market cap compared to the actual underlying technology at work and what it\u2019s being used for in the real world?So, at the end of the day, what is going to drive volume and liquidity through a digital app? If you have volume and liquidity, then it remains a prominent digital app. But, it is solving real-world problems. It has to be a product, in Silicon Valley, we call that a 10x better experience, and [if] you can\u2019t deliver a 10x better experience using blockchain, then don\u2019t use blockchain. We\u2019ve seen a lot of products come out of the last few years that are sort of like blockchain tourism. Like, that sounds like a database. That sounds like something you should use Google Sheets for, not a sophisticated decentralized blockchain database. So that\u2019s been the frustrating part. When prices are climbing, people are using it as marketing either to get funding or to get rid of [their coins].People always talk about whether next year\u2019s the year that \u201cblockchain goes mainstream,\u201d but that\u2019s a surface-level cocnversation. What does Ripple see as the most widely deployed blockchain based apps that scale? Meaning blockchain apps that go beyond a database or Google Sheet, as you said, to actually use this decentralized computing model to solve real-world problems.The underpinning of this technology is that without friction, without permission, I can move value from one blockchain to another. Today, if you want to money across borders, you are essentially trusting Citi Bank, JPMorgan, or HSBC. Those three banks control most of the cross-border flow. Either directly or indirectly, you are going to trust those three companies to move money on your behalf and they charge whatever fees they want. If they don\u2019t care about the emerging market or the other firms then expense just goes up and up and up.So what a digital app allows you to do is, instead of trusting those three companies, you can now start moving value internationally using digital assets. That\u2019s what Ripple has with xRapid. Customers tell us that they either have to trust Citibank, where they have to pay an arm and a leg and it takes days, or if I want an instant payment I have to open up a local bank account in my destination for every country. That takes months. Those are my two options in 2018. You can get an Uber to your house in two minutes, but getting money internationally is still a mess.What we\u2019ve done with xRapid is to use a digital asset and this new infrastructure, using digital exchanges like Bittrex and so forth, and convert from US dollars into XRP, move that XRP instantly into let\u2019s say Mexico and then have it traded again for Mexican pesos and paid out. That all happens in minutes, for far cheaper than I can today, and I don\u2019t have to set up accounts in the destination countries.On that subject, Ripple has a really interesting perspective on cross-border payments around the world given all the markets in which you\u2019re operating. What would you say are the countries or markets where you\u2019re seeing the most activit on this front, or citizens in the most dire need of these types of solutions for things like remittances, for instance in Venezuela.Good question; a lot of it is driven by regulation. We are seeing a lot of activity in Southeast Asia, where regulators are realizing that this technology can help boost their economies even further. Just like they did with cell phones and mobile devices, they want to leapfrog the west in terms of modern financial inclusion.There are a couple of trends behind that. One, the regulators are really friendly. Two, these economies\u2019 GDP is growing at 7\u20138 percent a year, and number three, they are going from cash to digital via mobile payment at a crazy clip. So those countries are now saying we\u2019re going build a modern day financial product. We are not going to use the 1950s wire technology or SWIFT technology; we\u2019re going to use blockchain.Regulation is an important point. Beyond whatever government agencies in the US like the SEC are doing, worldwide we\u2019re seeing a lot of countries lay groundwork to open up so-called crypto havens for business and investment. Are there particular markets where you think the regulatory environment and the financial factors are ripe for blockchain-based payments tech to scale really fast in the next year or two?All of that criteria is true of most Southeast Asian countries. Even right now, if you just look at the interest in digital apps that 80 some percent of all trading volume in crypto is coming out of Asia. So there is a lot of consumer interest, there is a lot of regulatory interest, and I think in the last trend is that these countries are growing so fast that going from cash to digital you are seeing all sorts of new tech products come out that are going to be the next generation financial companies in the region.I go to Asia probably twice a year, and every time I go back it\u2019s a different story. The last time I went back there was a vegetable stand owner that didn\u2019t speak English and couldn\u2019t read very well, but accepted payments via a mobile device. Just eight months before that, he said he didn\u2019t have a phone and only accepted cash. It\u2019s changing right before our eyes.How is Ripple this potential payment market of however many billions or trillions of dollars? What are the biggest goals for building financial infrasructure on top of that?The big thing is pushing further into the countries that really matter. Let\u2019s take India, for example. That market is moving so quickly that I not only need to think about the bank that accepts the payment and the regulated financial institution that receives the payment, but I need to be at the next-generation financial institution as well. We want to connect with mobile phones. In the next five years, especially in India, people will access their bank accounts primarily through their phones. The other goal is educating regulators that this is a fundamentally different and better way to move money. Our regulatory team is continuing to build on that progress.Going back to this evolution of blockchain technology in 2019 and beyond, aside from payments, where do you fall on the debate over the types of blockchain apps and distributions that will lead the charge? Public vs. private blockchains, cryptocurrency vs. blockchain apps and services, etc.On digital app part of it, you should think of it like the combustion engine. You really can\u2019t do anything alone with the digital asset. You need to build something around it. You need the rest of the car. Public digital assets like XRP and Bitcoin hold a lot of value, but they\u2019re one piece of the puzzle. What I think Ripple has learned in the past five years is that you have to build around that technology to make it useful.On private blockchains, my opinion is that I just don\u2019t see the point. I think it\u2019s another word ofr a database. If you\u2019re building your entire product on a private blockchain, you\u2019re a great marketing company.Ripple has partnered with a number of banks and financial institutions, like Santander, AMEX, and BBVA among others, but Ripple CTO David Schwartz told Reuters earlier this year that for banks, blockchain-based cross-border payments still aren\u2019t scalable for a number of reasons. How does Ripple straddle that line between working with traditional financial markets while also building these open-source solutions that decentralize what banks have centralized?We decided to work with financial institutions and I think that has paid off, but you also have to think about all the financial requirements and regulations. In 2013 there was that Bitcoin maxim of \u201cwe don\u2019t need any of that. We don\u2019t need government or banks or corporations anymore, just Bitcoin.\u201d That approach doesn\u2019t work. Working with financial institutions and regulators is a longer road, but it\u2019s the right one.Those two ideas don\u2019t always coexist well\u2026to the point where the International Monetary Fund has started talking about governments setting up their own central bank-backed digital currencies.I haven\u2019t read the IMF piece, but I do know a lot of the larger banks have some sort of what I call \u201cblockchain tourism.\u201d There\u2019s always a side team or collection of innovation labs working on a blokchain product. But at the end of the day, even if a country like the United States created a centrally backed coin, the reason Ripple works for cross-border payments is because there is no central bank for the world. It\u2019s unlikely that the US central bank would trust the Argentina central bank. That\u2019s why it\u2019s useful to have a digital asset that both entiities could essentially trust.But for that level of cross-border trust, central banks would have to give up some control.Yes, they would have to be willing\u2026which doesn\u2019t seem likely. All the central banks would have to come together, probably somewhere like Davos. But can you imagine the US government saying \u2018\u201cWait, hold up, my credit is way up here, and you want me to trust the Argentine peso?\u201dOn that subject of connecting the world, I also wanted to talk about some of the social impact initiatives you guys are working on around cross-border payments and remittances. Specifically in serving the under-banked populations of the world, are there particular markets that you guys are focusing on and that need the most help and that Ripple really thinks you can provide some tools to the people there?Mexico is our first xRapid corridor. We\u2019re seeing a lot of traction there because it is an underserved population. In these markets, the larger correspondents don\u2019t want that business anymore. They\u2019re folding and restricting on it so that the largest banks now only take up 8 percent of their market. It\u2019s just too expensive to operate. So I think that is a perfect insertion point for us to come in with something that is far cheaper than anything else they\u2019ve been seeing, that we can get up and running in a couple weeks.Lastly, I want to touch on future trends. What are some of Ripple\u2019s blockchain payment goals on the horizon for 2019? Maybe a partnership with a big e-commerce provider? I would look at a lot of the companies building apps on top of XRP. Ripple is one company with cross-border payments. Coil is another company building on top of the XRP ledger going after micropayments. It\u2019s a technology that goes through the browser and then you go to different websites to automatically pay for streaming content. Omni is another company building on top of the XRP ledger operating to use XRP for renting and storage.Those are both involved with Xpring, a Ripple initiative that will invest in, incubate, acquire, and provide grants to companies and projects using the XRP digital asset and ledger. Early entrepreneurs Xpring is offering support to include Scooter Braun, Stefan Thomas (Coil), and Tom Mcleod (Omni).Read more: \u201cIn Venezuela, Cryptocurrency Is an Oppressor and a Lifeline\u201d", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Altcoin News: Ripple Co-Founder Donated $25 Million in XRP to American University", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-news-ripple-co-founder-donated-25-million-in-xrp-to-american-university-7d8a32f007bd?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 8", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "Altcoin News: Ripple Co-Founder Donated $25 Million in XRP to American UniversityApril 8, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN\u00a0MAGAZINEMarko VidrihBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 8Chris Larsen, a co-founder of Ripple, donated $25 million in XRP to San Francisco University.University representatives stressed that this donation was the largest donation in crypto assets received by an educational institution in the United States.

Even those fiercely critical of the way it\u2019s been conducted acknowledge the need for a system overhaul.The sweep is also clearly a move by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to consolidate power, leaving some skeptical that corruption is the sole motivator\u200a\u2014\u200aif at all.Much of it was to tell the Al Saud family to stay out of government-related business which, in itself, is a very good thing- Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School of EconomicsYet for investors trying to read the signs from the outside, whatever the machinations and motivations behind the arrests, it brings reforms that have been needed for ages.\u201cClearly, the clamp down on corruption is a good thing as the Saudi economy has been hindered by corruption for many decades,\u201d said Jason Tuvey, a Middle East economist at London-based Capital Economics.\u201cFor one, small firms have struggled to compete with large firms that previously had a close relationship with the royal family, but also individuals and businesses had to rely on an army of brokers to cut through bureaucracy.\u201dStill the detention of 11 princes, four ministers and dozens of others on Saturday, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, may have a chilling effect on investment\u200a\u2014\u200aboth inside and outside the kingdom\u200a\u2014\u200ain the near term until there is more clarity over whether the drag net will widen.A Saudi man chats with a robot on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiatives conference held at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh at the end of October (AFP)After all, just days after it served as the site of the kingdom\u2019s \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d, a foreign investment conference, the six-year-old Ritz Carlton essentially became a prison, an overnight conversion that has to have rattled onlooking investors.Likewise, from Twitter to Citigroup to Apple, many of those thought to be detained inside the hotel hold significant stakes in multinational corporations. Questions have even been raised about whether London\u2019s Savoy Hotel, owned by bin Talal, could become Saudi government property.While the ramifications have not yet been significant and have yet to fully unfold, one clear epicentre is Lebanon, which is on edge after Prime Minister Saad Hariri\u2019s resignation from Riyadh on the same day as the arrests, and given the close economic ties between the two countries.Many fingers, many\u00a0piesSaudi Arabia is desperate to attract investment to diversify its economy away from oil. Vision 2030, the reform programme announced by MbS in June 2016, aims to create 450,000 jobs in the non-governmental sector by 2020, and bolster the private sector\u2019s share of GDP to 60 percent from 40 percent in 2014.The latest sweep of arrests, in addition to solidifying MBS\u2019s control over the kingdom, is also a warning to get in line with the reforms, say observers.\u201cMuch of it was to tell the Al Saud family to stay out of government-related business which, in itself, is a very good thing,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, Associate Professor in Comparative Politics at the London School of Economics. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how much collateral damage there is in terms of capital flight and business confidence.\u201dSo far, although detainees have lost their wealth as shares in their companies have dropped, there has not been a negative impact on the Saudi economy. While the crackdown froze the detainees\u2019 banks accounts, putting $33bn of personal wealth at risk, according to Bloomberg figures, company accountants have not been frozen.Prince Alwaleed bin Talal owns sizeable shares in Newscorp, Twitter and Citigroup via his Kingdom Holdings company (AFP)However, the full extent of these princes\u2019 investments in the Saudi economy is unknown. \u201cI\u2019m sure they have fingers in many pies,\u201d said Tuvey.To maintain investor confidence, Riyadh will have to quickly demonstrate that the arrests will not result in show trials, and is purely about removing the old order that had monopolised the economy.On this front, the kingdom may take lessons from other GCC countries, including the UAE, which have started their own anti-corruption campaigns, said Theodore Karasik, a senior advisor to Gulf State Analytics, a Washington DC-based consultancy.\u201cNow it\u2019s Saudi\u2019s turn. It is meant to send a message to everyone in the kingdom and the region that the new Saudi is anti-corruption and graft, and is seeking to open up to investors in a new and transparent environment,\u201d Karasik said.READ MORE\u25baSaudi Arabia seeks to reassure investors after royal purgeThe Saudis, however, have already taken a different tack: the Emirati campaign was carried out less publicly and over a period of time, not a sudden announcement that rounded up the big shots in a five-star hotel.And it\u2019s the speed and breadth of the clampdown that may deal a short-term blow to the economy as investors are warded off sinking money in an already muted investor climate.\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that investment in Saudi contracted by 16 percent last year,\u201d said Tuvey.\u201cThe last thing they need is political upheaval as they\u2019ve been trying to court foreign investors as part of Vision 2030, but given uncertainty, and reliance on partnerships with those detained, it will probably hold that back as well.\u201dNo international probesGiven the uncertainty surrounding the scale of the anti-corruption probes, international investors may be wary that they, too, will become snared in the sweep. Allegations of bribery to secure contracts in the kingdom go back decades, including British Aerospace (BAE), which was investigated by the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office in the 2000s.But it seems that MbS does not want to go that far.\u201cThe focus is not on bribes paid by international corporations to Saudi ministers or businessmen. I think MbS would be reluctant to snare big international firms in the public domain,\u201d said Tuvey.\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell, but as going after many more non-royal businesspeople would be very costly economically, I\u2019d guess that the main future targets, if any, will be other princes and officials,\u201d said Hertog.Karasik however said he had heard more people will be rounded up for alleged corruption over the next fortnight.Construction companies a key\u00a0targetSome of the arrests took analysts by surprise, especially those related to media companies, which have traditionally backed the Saudi royal family, like Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, which owns Al Arabiya TV, and bin Talal, who has an 80 percent stake in Rotana.The clampdown on individuals with construction firms, however, was much less shocking. \u201cConstruction companies were inevitable, as in the past have been brought up for claims of over-inflated contracts,\u201d said Tuvey.The biggest firm caught up in the campaign belongs to Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the Saudi Binladin Construction Group, one of the key developers of the holy city of Mecca.But what is notable is that the firm was already in bad economic shape, having lost billions of dollars after not being granted government contracts following a crane crash that killed 107 people in 2015. The company laid off 77,000 foreign workers in 2016.The other firm is Saudi Oger, which was established by Lebanon\u2019s Hariri family and went bust in July. One of the arrested princes, Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd, held a large informal share in the company, according to Hertog. \u201cSaudi Oger was involved in questionable projects under (kings) Fahd and Abdullah,\u201d he said.Ironically, it was Saudi Oger that built the Ritz-Carlton Hotel where the princes are currently detained.A poster of Saad Hariri\u200a\u2014\u200asaying \u2018God protect you\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aseen in the northern city of Tripoli this week (AFP)With Hariri\u2019s resignation hours before the arrests, there has been a great deal of speculation as to whether there is a connection between the resignation and the probes. \u201cIt is hard to know what is going on, but there are rumours that Hariri is caught up in this corruption clampdown,\u201d said Tuvey.On Thursday, a top Lebanese government official told Reuters that many in government believe that the kingdom is holding Hariri against his will.\u201cKeeping Hariri with restricted freedom in Riyadh is an attack on Lebanese sovereignty. Our dignity is his dignity. We will work with (foreign) states to return him to Beirut,\u201d he was quoted as saying.There is further speculation as to whether the clampdown was coordinated between Riyadh and Washington, with Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, having made an unannouncedvisit to the kingdom in October to meet with MbS.Curiously, there are also allegations that some of those arrested, such as bin Talal, were connected to US lobby firm the Podesta Group, whose founder, John Podesta, is the former campaign manager of Hillary Clinton.Bin Talal, who was pro-Clinton, famously made his opposition to Trump\u2019s presidency public on Twitter during the 2016 campaign.\u201cYou are a disgrace not only to the GOP, but to all America,\u201d he tweeted at Trump. \u201cWithdraw from the US presidential race as you will never win.\u201dThe Lebanon connectionAccording to Karasik, the arrests are also connected to the \u201cmixing of moneys between Lebanese and Saudi banks subject to baksheesh(bribes). This is why Hariri resigned, and he\u2019s now helping the Saudis with uncoupling the Lebanese-Saudi banking system to create a new culture around it to go after Hezbollah.\u201dSaudi Arabia is part of the Anti-Terror Quartet (ATQ), which includes the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt. The ATQ has blockaded Qatar for six months over Doha\u2019s alleged funding of terrorism, and is staunchly opposed to Iran and its proxies like Lebanon-based Hezbollah.If even a few billion dollars in deposits were withdrawn, it would affect the economy- Senior manager at a Lebanese bankLebanon\u2019s financial sector is under pressure following the US\u2019 Hezbollah International Finance Prevention Act (HIFPA) of December 2015, with the US considering further additions to the act.If the Saudi probe widens, the risk is that Lebanese banks and construction firms become embroiled. Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia accused Lebanon of declaring war on the kingdom because of Hezbollah\u2019s aggression. If Riyadh follows through with this line, Saudi and other Gulf actors may withdraw money from Lebanese banks.\u201cIf even a few billion dollars in deposits were withdrawn, it would affect the economy,\u201d said a senior manager at a Lebanese bank that wanted anonymity. \u201cThe bigger threat is if the Saudis kick out Lebanese working there, as the Emiratis have done.

This is the message of David Schwarz, Chief Technology Officer of the company. He answered questions about the company at Quora\u2019s \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session.Schwartz insists that the San Francisco-based company has no control over XRP, making it different from Bitkine in the eyes of the radical Crippure Purists who make up the early Cripp class.He said: \u201cAbsolutely not. XRP Ledger is an open source technology with a solid community of developers, so if Ripple disappears, XRP and XRP Ledger will remain. The XRP project is an independent digital asset and transactions are verified in a fully decentralized way through the consensus process\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning that the stakeholders in the network are the ones who collectively manage the transactions and not every physical or legal person\u201dIn the past, many critics have pointed out that XRP is a highly centralized token in the hands of a parent company known as Ripple, which still owns more than 50% of XRP\u2019s total offering. Critics also claim that the coin is not backed by a traditional block but instead uses a method known as \u201cHashTree,\u201d which is patented by Ripple Labs. According to them, Ripple does not differ from the existing financial system.Schwartz explains in detail why XRP is decentralizedRipple and XRP are not the same things. Ripple is a block startup. XRP is his native token and will continue to function even if Ripple Labs are shut down.Owners of XRP do not own shares in Ripple.Ripple is fully decentralized because it has only 7 out of 150 validators that feed XRP block.Schwarz added that they held 54% of XRP to ensure price stability. \u201cIt eliminates any worries that Ripple will flood the market with XRP at once\u200a\u2014\u200awhich, incidentally, would not be good for us,\u201d he said.The Swiss Stock Exchange adds an XRP Derivative (ETP)According to their official website, Switzerland\u2019s main stock exchange, SIX, today added an RTP (RIP) based exchange-traded product (ETP) on April 2.As reported in March, the stock exchange has already confirmed that it plans to include the product called Amun Ripple (AXRP). Hanni Rashvan, co-founder and CEO of Amun, the AXRP cryptographic developer, claims to be the first such product on the market:We can safely say we expect to release the world\u2019s first XRP ETP over the next two months.In addition, Rashvan also told the media that the company also received the SIX approval to release four more ETPs for other bottles\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM) and Eos (EOS). In November last year, SIX also added the world\u2019s first ETP to track an index of multiple Cripp assets based on BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH and LTC.In early March, the company also launched ETH ETP, and in February it listed the ETC for tracking the BTC.As noted in December, these developments appear to be part of a wider trend that sees the United States being left behind, where it is crypto-wave ETP compared to Europe.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "AI C\u0168NG C\u00d3 TH\u1ec2 THAM GIA 30,000 XRP Airdrop!!!", "author_name": "Huobi Global", "link": "https://medium.com/huobi-global/ai-c%C5%A9ng-c%C3%B3-th%E1%BB%83-tham-gia-30-000-xrp-airdrop-68b15f416b22?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 25, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "AI C\u0168NG C\u00d3 TH\u1ec2 THAM GIA 30,000 XRP Airdrop!!!Huobi GlobalBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 25, 2018AI C\u0168NG C\u00d3 TH\u1ec2 THAM GIA 30,000 XRP Airdrop!!!Trong th\u1eddi gian di\u1ec5n ra s\u1ef1 ki\u1ec7n, t\u1ea5t c\u1ea3 maker \u0111\u1ea1t \u0111\u1ee7 c\u00e1c y\u00eau c\u1ea7u giao d\u1ecbch tr\u00ean Huobi OTC v\u00e0 giao d\u1ecbch \u00edt nh\u1ea5t 0.1 BTC s\u1ebd c\u00f3 c\u01a1 h\u1ed9i chia s\u1ebb airdrop 30,000 XRP.Th\u1eddi gian s\u1ef1 ki\u1ec7n:10 Ng\u00e0y\uff0817 th\u00e1ng 9\u201326 th\u00e1ng 9 n\u0103m 2018, 0:00\u201324:00, gi\u1edd Singapore GMT+8 \uff09KH\u00d4NG \u0111\u1eb7t c\u1ecdc b\u1ea3o ch\u1ee9ng, 0% ph\u00ed giao d\u1ecbch (BTC&ETH&USDT)B\u1eaeT \u0110\u1ea6U GIAO D\u1ecaCH NGAY! https://otc.huobi.com\u00a0H\u01b0\u1edbng d\u1eabn \u0111\u0103ng qu\u1ea3ng c\u00e1o Huobi OTC https://bit.ly/2xoUZZdAI C\u0168NG C\u00d3 TH\u1ec2 THAM GIA 30,000 XRP Airdrop!!!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Feodora Angel", "link": "https://medium.com/@Feodora_Angel/xch4nge-666099c1c536?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 9", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "Feodora AngelBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 9XCH4NGE- P2P Platform Connecting Crypto Users Worldwide.

Chunka Mui is the managing director of the Devil\u2019s Advocate Group, a consulting team that helps organizations design and stress test their innovation strategies. Mr. Mui published a popular book titled The New Killer Apps.What fascinates me about these scenarios is the sheer breadth and depth of societal impact. In this segment, Chunka Mui does a great job of describing this impact. Here is a seven minute animated version of our discussion that picks up where segment two left off:You can view segment one here.You can view segment two here.Download The PDF Version of the TranscriptBeyond the Driverless CarAn Interview with Chunka MuiTranscriptSEGMENT 3 of 5: The Ripple EffectFrank Diana: So, I want to shift gears. I want to focus on the ripple effects of these future scenarios. Specifically, but maybe more importantly, how the ripple effect starts to more intensely blur the boundaries across these various industries and I find that this autonomous vehicle scenario works extremely well to get leaders to see just how broad and deep the impact clearly is; and so, one of the things that you have done extremely well in your writing is to kind of make that real for leaders. Talk about the various things that the autonomous vehicle will impact and how it does cross industry boundaries, so walk us through some of the industries impacted, examples would be things like municipal revenue streams drying up because traffic accidents or traffic violations don\u2019t occur or parking revenues drying up. Those kinds of things that people don\u2019t normally think about. So, give us an example of some of the breadth and depth of this scenario.Chunka Mui: Sure. If we think about autonomous technology, I think there is a breakpoint if we think about extreme scenarios. There is a breakpoint at whether or not the car is autonomous\u200a\u2014\u200awhether or not it requires a driver. That\u2019s the extreme case, so if we have totally driverless cars, consider this possibility\u200a\u2014\u200abusiness models today, automotive business models today are built on individual car ownership. If you did not require a driver in autonomous cars, you could:imagine a driverless taxi service that instead of requiring you to buy a car that came to you and in a few minutes time took you point to point;Then you start imagining that people might take uber-like services, instead of owning a carAnd there has been financial modeling that says that those services could actually operate for about 20% the cost of owning a carSo dramatically less costly because you\u2019ve taken the most expensive element of a car service, the driver, out of the equationOkay, so let\u2019s imagine that scenario:You start having uber-like car services, instead of car ownershipEach year about 500B flow through US car dealersSo, if you started having a shift away from individual car ownership to mobility servicesThat money, that channel gets dramatically impactedNow, people will still buy cars, because services like uber will still be buying cars, but they\u2019ll be buying them as whole fleets, as opposed to individuallyAnd they\u2019ll be buying them from manufacturersSo here\u2019s one technical capability that translates to enormous business model disruption\u00bd trillion dollars a year\u2026Frank Diana: Yep. Great example and what about things like less cars on the road, impact to the environment, fuel efficiencies that come from the ability for driverless cars to drag behind one and other. The need for infrastructure diminishes, because you again have less cars on the road. What about those kinds of things. You get a lot of that happening as well as this scenario plays out. Correct?Chunka Mui: Well, here\u2019s another interesting statistic, in downtown city centers some studies find that as much as 30% of traffic is people driving around looking for parking spots. So, if you have a driverless car that drops you off and then drives away by itself, either to park itself far away in a cheap lot or just go to next passenger, you can dramatically reduce the traffic that\u2019s going around looking for parking spots. And here\u2019s another interesting ripple effect from that. Once you have that, then you start asking yourself\u200a\u2014\u200ado I need parking garages? More specifically, do I need expensive parking garages downtown or even if I need parking garages at all, can I move them further away?And suddenly you start thinking well what do you do with all that real estate that\u2019s now devoted to cars? In some ways that\u2019s good because you can repurpose that real estate for other uses. You might turn them in to parks; you might turn them in to commercial areas. But then suddenly, you also have this massive amount of real estate that\u2019s flooding the market which may have dramatic negative effectsSo, as you start thinking about these simple, relatively simple technical capabilities you can imagine the ripple effects on industry is dramatic.Now, one of the things we have to realize is we don\u2019t always understand exactly what\u2019s going to happen.In the sense that, if we make transportation cheaper by 80%, does that mean we have less cars on the road or do we have more cars on the road?We certainly have more efficient use of infrastructure, if we have don\u2019t have any more cars on the road, but we actually may actually have miles traveled go up.Those are the kinds of question you have to think deeply through, if you\u2019re in one of those industries where that\u2019s a critical issue for you.Frank Diana: Yep and to your point there\u2019s no way of knowing exactly how those scenarios play out. To your point on more cars on the road, the fact that young children that can be driven by driverless car and the parents not required or the elderly or disabled start driving again. All those things could actually lead to more cars in the road. Correct?Chunka Mui: Absolutely, absolutely. So that\u2019s, I mean those are both challenges and opportunities. They\u2019re challenges if you sit in an existing industry that\u2019s built upon current assumption. So, for example, $80B a year is spent in the US on collision and auto repair\u200a\u2014\u200awell when you start having fewer accidents that\u2019s a bad thing, but if you\u2019re in the business where you might profit from more people moving from the driver\u2019s seat to the passenger\u2019s seat, for example if you sell content or if you\u2019re in commerce that may be a good thing. So, you have to take these developments and follow the trail of effects.Frank Diana: Well, I think in terms of the objective of that question, objective met because clearly we can see how many different industries, and we just touched the tip of the iceberg here, are impacted and how broadly and deeply you need to think about these scenarios if you\u2019re going to be successful navigating them.Well fascinating stuff Chunk and unfortunately, we\u2019re out of time.

Since Monday, market capitalization has decreased by 1% to a value of $182 billion.Against the background of neutral news, in a number of instruments, there is a noticeable purchase at current levels. Volatility has decreased and, judging by the mood of the participants, the probability of the market moving to new \u201chighs\u201d is increasing.BitcoinThe BTC continues to consolidate around the resistance line, which is a sign of the continued strength of the bulls. Volatility has decreased and the chances of further upward movement increase. On the chart, a figure of an ascending triangle is formed, in case of a breakdown of its upper limit and price movement in the region of $5300, again there will be a good opportunity to open a long position with a short stop.EthereumETH chart returned to the blue line, where, as we noted in the last review, there is a good opportunity to make a first test purchase to check the strength of customers and their confidence in the upcoming growth. Now you can hold the position with the stop below the blue line and carefully monitor the dynamics of the asset. In the case of updating the maximum of the 7th, the share in the portfolio will increase with the transfer of the protective order.RippleXRP also pushed off the uptrend line at first, but ultimately the chart did not hold in the triangle and slipped below the blue line. Trial purchases that we make in such cases, one of their goals have a test of one or another assumption about future dynamics. In this case, the position is covered and we can conclude that now, in order for the market to believe in growth, the coin must be fixed above the resistance line in the region of $0.37. Up to this point, we prefer to stay out of XRP position. However, given that the rate of volatility of the asset\u2019s return relative to the entire market for this instrument is high, we believe that if the entire market grows and the red line breaks through, the momentum may turn out to be fast.EOSEOS chart came close to weekly highs. It is difficult to say whether the triangle will continue to narrow, or we will see a way out of it in the coming hours. To open a position, it is worth waiting for the breakdown and subsequent confirmation in the form of fixing chart above the level of $5.85 for some time, picking up the position gradually. In general, the technical picture for the coin develops favorably. Obviously, there is a purchase even at these levels, so the chances of growth are good.LitecoinLTC came down from the triangle, and therefore the idea of \u200b\u200bforming a pulse is soon canceled, but this does not mean that it is canceled over a longer time interval. In the event that chart still can break through resistance at $96, the impulse is most likely to occur. Now, when the volatility has decreased, and there are signs of the emergence of a local trend, we are again starting to gradually form a long position with a stop below $84.5 per LTC.DISCLAIMER:All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.
