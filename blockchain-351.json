To hear the blockchain hype train tell it, blockchain will now:Solve income inequalityMake all data secure foreverMake everything much more efficient and trustlessSave dying babiesWhat the heck is a blockchain, anyway? And can it really do all these things? Can blockchain bring something amazing to industries as diverse as health care, finance, supply chain management and music rights?And doesn\u2019t being for Bitcoin mean that you\u2019re pro-blockchain? How can you be for Bitcoin but say anything bad about the technology behind it?In this article, I seek to answer a lot of these questions by looking at what a blockchain is and more importantly, what it\u2019s not.What is a blockchain?To examine some of these claims, we have to define what a blockchain is and herein lies a lot of the confusion. Many companies use the word \u201cblockchain\u201d to mean some sort of magical device by which all their data will never be wrong. Such a device, of course, does not exist, at least when the real world is involved.So what is a blockchain? Technically speaking, a blockchain is a linked list of blocks and a block is a group of ordered transactions. If you didn\u2019t understand the last sentence, you can think of a blockchain as a subset of a database, with a few additional properties.The main thing distinguishing a blockchain from a normal database is that there are specific rules about how to put data into the database. That is, it cannot conflict with some other data that\u2019s already in the database (consistent), it\u2019s append-only (immutable), and the data itself is locked to an owner (ownable), it\u2019s replicable and available. Finally, everyone agrees on what the state of the things in the database are (canonical) without a central party (decentralized).It is this last point that really is the holy grail of blockchain. Decentralization is very attractive because it implies there is no single point of failure. That is, no single authority will be able to take away your asset or change \u201chistory\u201d to suit their needs. This immutable audit trail where you don\u2019t have to trust anyone is the benefit that everyone that\u2019s playing with this technology is looking for. This benefit, however, come at a great cost.The Cost of BlockchainsThe immutable audit trail uncontrolled by any single party is certainly useful, but there are many costs to create such a system. Let\u2019s examine some of the issues.Development is stricter and\u00a0slowerCreating a provably consistent system is not an easy task. A small bug could corrupt the entire database or cause some databases to be different than other ones. Of course, a corrupted or split database no longer has any consistency guarantees. Furthermore, all such systems have to be designed from the outset to be consistent. There is no \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d in a blockchain. If you break things, you lose consistency and the blockchain becomes corrupted and worthless.You may be thinking, why can\u2019t you just fix the database or start over and move on? That would be easy enough to do in a centralized system, but this is very difficult in a decentralized one. You need consensus, or the agreement of all players in the system, in order to change the database. The blockchain has to be a public resource that\u2019s not under the control of a single entity (decentralized, remember?), or the entire effort is a very expensive way to create a slow, centralized database.Incentive structures are difficult to\u00a0designAdding the right incentive structures and making sure that all actors in the system cannot abuse or corrupt the database is likewise a large consideration. A blockchain may be consistent, but that\u2019s not very useful if it\u2019s got a lot of frivolous, useless data in it because the costs of putting data into it are very low. Neither is a consistent blockchain useful if it has almost no data because the costs of putting data into it are very high.What gives the data finality? How can you ensure that the rewards are aligned with the network goals? Why do nodes keep or update the data and what makes them choose one piece of data over another when they are in conflict? These are all incentive questions that need good answers and they need to be aligned not just at the beginning but at all points in the future as technology and companies change, otherwise the blockchain is not useful.Again, you may be wondering why you can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d some broken incentive. Once again, this is easy in a centralized system, but in a decentralized one, you simply cannot change anything without consensus. There\u2019s no \u201cfixing\u201d anything unless there\u2019s agreement from everyone.Maintenance is very\u00a0costlyA traditional centralized database only needs to be written to once. A blockchain needs to be written to thousands of times. A traditional centralized database needs to only checks the data once. A blockchain needs to check the data thousands of times. A traditional centralized database needs to transmit the data for storage only once. A blockchain needs to transmit the data thousands of times.The costs of maintaining a blockchain are orders of magnitude higher and the cost needs to be justified by utility. Most applications looking for some of the properties stated earlier like consistency and reliability can get such things for a whole lot cheaper utilizing integrity checks, receipts and backups.Users are sovereignThis can be really good as companies don\u2019t like the liability of having user data in the first place. This can be bad, however, if the user is \u201cmisbehaving\u201d. There\u2019s no way to kick out the user that\u2019s spamming your blockchain with frivolous data or has figured out a way to profit in some fashion that causes other users lots of inconvenience. This is related to the above observation that incentive structures have to be designed really, really well in that a user that figures out an exploit is not likely to give that up, especially if there\u2019s profit for the user.You may be thinking that you can simply refuse service to malicious users, which would be very easy to do in a centralized service. However, unlike a centralized service, refusing service is difficult because no single entity has the authority to kick anyone out. The blockchain has to be impartial and enforce the rules defined by the software. If the rules are insufficient to deter bad behavior, you\u2019re out of luck. There is no \u201cspirit\u201d of the law here. You simply have to deal with malicious or misbehaving actors, possibly for a very long time.All upgrades are voluntaryA forced upgrade is not an option. The other players on the network have no obligation to change to your software. If they did, such a system would be much easier, faster and cheaper to build as a centralized system. The point of a blockchain is that it\u2019s not under the control of a single entity and this is violated with a forced upgrade.Instead, all upgrades have to be backwards-compatible. This is obviously quite difficult, especially if you want to add new features and even harder when thinking from a testing perspective. Each version of the software adds a lot to the test matrix and lengthens the time to release.Again, if this were a centralized system, this would be very easy to correct by no longer servicing older systems. You cannot do this, however in a decentralized system as you cannot force anyone to do anything.Scaling is really\u00a0hardFinally, scaling is at least several orders of magnitude harder than in a traditional centralized system. The reason is obvious. The same data has to live in hundreds or thousands of places than in a single place. The overhead of transmission, verification and storage is enormous as every single copy of the database must pay them instead of those costs being paid just once in a traditional, centralized database.You can, of course, reduce the burden by reducing the number of nodes. But then at that point, why do you need a decentralized system at all? Why not just make a centralized database if scaling costs are the main concern?Centralization is a lot\u00a0easierIf you notice a theme, it\u2019s that decentralized systems are very difficult to work with, expensive to maintain, hard to upgrade and a pain to scale. A centralized database is much faster, less expensive, easier to maintain and easier to upgrade than a blockchain. So why do people keep using the word blockchain as if it\u2019s some panacea for all their problems?First, a lot of these industries that are being sold on blockchain are really overdue for IT infrastructure upgrades. Health care has notoriously terrible software. Financial settlement is still running on software from the 70\u2019s. Supply chain management software is both difficult to use and hard to install. Most companies in these industries resist upgrading because of the risk involved. There are lots of infrastructure upgrades that cost hundreds of millions and end up being rolled back anyway. Blockchain is a way to sell these IT infrastructure upgrades and make them a bit more appetizing.Second, blockchain is a way to look like you\u2019re on the leading edge of technology. Like it or not, the word \u201cblockchain\u201d has taken on a life of its own. Very few people actually understand what it is, but want to appear hip so use these words as a way to sound more intelligent. Just like \u201ccloud\u201d means someone else\u2019s computer and \u201cAI\u201d means a tweaked algorithm, \u201cblockchain\u201d in this context means a slow, expensive database.Third, people really don\u2019t like government control of certain industries and want a different adjudication mechanism than the legal framework which is often slow and expensive. To them, \u201cblockchain\u201d is really just a way to get rid of the heavy apparatus of government regulation. This is overselling what blockchain can do. Blockchain doesn\u2019t magically take away human conflict.The result is a lot of people that are hyped up on the promises without actually understanding the abilities or costs. What\u2019s worse, the actual technical details and costs are abstracted away from a lot of VCs and executives in such a way as to obscure what a blockchain can and can\u2019t do. Everyone under them become afraid to say that the emperor has no clothes and we have the situation that we have now.So what is blockchain good\u00a0for?We\u2019ve already established that a blockchain is very expensive relative to centralized databases. So the only reason you should be using a blockchain is to decentralize. That is, remove the single point of failure or control.This naturally means that the software or database must not change things around often, if at all. There should be little upside to upgrading and much downside to screwing up or changing the rules.Most industries are not like this. Most industries require new features or upgrades and the freedom to change and expand as necessary. Given that blockchains are hard to upgrade, hard to change and hard to scale, most industries don\u2019t have much use for a blockchain.The one exception we\u2019ve found is money. Unlike most industrial use cases, money is better if it doesn\u2019t change. Immutability and difficulty in changing the rules is a positive for money and not a detriment. This is why blockchain is the right tool for the job when it comes to Bitcoin.What\u2019s clear is that a lot of companies looking to use the blockchain are not really wanting a blockchain at all, but rather IT upgrades to their particular industry. This is all well and good, but using the word \u201cblockchain\u201d to get there is dishonest and overselling its capability.ConclusionBlockchain is a popular term these days and unfortunately, this \u201cblockchain not Bitcoin\u201d meme won\u2019t die. If you are a centralized service, a blockchain doesn\u2019t get you anything that you can\u2019t do a thousand times cheaper with a centralized database. If you are a decentralized service, then you\u2019re probably fooling yourself and not thinking about the single points of failure that exist in your system. There wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cyou\u201d at all in a truly decentralized service.Biggest joke in this entire\u00a0articleBack in the early 2000\u2019s, there was a push by a lot of executives in the tech industry to use Java and XML. Despite these two things being tools and not actual products, many executives insisted on their use, no matter how poor the fit was to what their engineers were trying to achieve. Blockchain is very much like that. Focus on the problems you\u2019re solving and the tools will make themselves readily apparent. Focus on tools that you want to use and you\u2019ll end up making Rube Goldberg machines that don\u2019t do anything particularly well.In a sense, current conceptions of blockchain are trying to do the impossible. They want the security of a decentralized system with the control of a centralized one. The desire is the best of both worlds, but what they end up getting is the worst of both worlds. You get the costs and difficulty of a decentralized system with the failure modes of a centralized one.Blockchain is used way too much as a buzzword to sell a lot of useless snake oil.

After all, they are the trending and media\u2019s favorite topics these days\u200a\u2014\u200athe buzzwords of the year. Even the people who\u2019ve never mined a cryptocurrency or understand how it works, are talking about it. I have more non-technical friends than technical ones. They have been bugging me for weeks to explain this new buzzword to them. I guess there are thousands out there who feel the same. And when that happens, there comes a time to write something to which everyone can point the other lost souls to\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s the purpose of this post\u200a\u2014\u200awritten in plain english that any regular internet user understands.By the way, I am curator of a weekly newsletter, Unmade, which delivers one idea from the future to your inboxes.Blockchain: why do we even need something this\u00a0complex?\u201cFor every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aH. L.\u00a0MenckenUnlike every other post on the internet, instead of first defining the Blockchain, we\u2019ll understand the problem it solves.Imagine, Joe is your best friend. He is traveling overseas, and on the fifth day of his vacation, he calls you and says, \u201cDude, I need some money. I have run out of it.\u201dYou reply, \u201cSending some right away,\u201d and hung up.You then call your account manager at your bank and tell him, \u201cPlease transfer $1000 from my account to Joe\u2019s account.\u201dYour account manager replies, \u201cYes, sir.\u201dHe opens up the register, checks your account balance to see if you have enough balance to transfer $1000 to Joe. Because you\u2019re a rich man, you have plenty; thus, he makes an entry in the register like the following:The Transaction RegisterNote: We\u2019re not talking about computers only to keep things simple.You call Joe and tell him, \u201cI\u2019ve transferred the money. Next time, you\u2019d go to your bank, you can withdraw the $1000 that I have just transferred.\u201dWhat just happened? You and Joe both trusted the bank to manage your money. There was no real movement of physical bills to transfer the money. All that was needed was an entry in the register. Or more precisely, an entry in the register that neither you nor Joe controls or owns.And that is the problem of the current systems.To establish trust between ourselves, we depend on individual third-parties.For years, we\u2019ve depended on these middlemen to trust each other. You might ask, \u201cwhat is the problem depending on them?\u201dThe problem is that they are singular in number. If a chaos has to be injected in the society, all it requires is one person/organization to go corrupt, intentionally or unintentionally.What if that register in which the transaction was logged gets burnt in a fire?What if, by mistake, your account manager had written $1500 instead of $1000?What if he did that on purpose?For years, we have been putting all our eggs in one basket and that too in someone\u00a0else\u2019s.Could there be a system where we can still transfer money without needing the bank?To answer this question, we\u2019ll need to drill down further and ask ourselves a better question (after all, only better questions lead to better answers).Think about it for a second, what does transferring money means? Just an entry in the register. The better question would then be \u2014Is there a way to maintain the register among ourselves instead of someone else doing it for us?Now, that is a question worth exploring. And the answer is what you might have already guessed. The blockchain is the answer to the profound question.It is a method to maintain that register among ourselves instead of depending on someone else to do it for us.Are you still with me? Good. Because now, when several questions have started popping in your mind, we will learn how this distributed register works.Yes, but tell me, how does it\u00a0work?The requirement of this method is that there must be enough people who would like not to depend on a third-party. Only then this group can maintain the register on their own.\u201cIt might make sense just to get some Bitcoin in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSatoshi Nakamoto in\u00a02009How many are enough? At least three. For our example, we will assume ten individuals want to give up on banks or any third-party. Upon mutual agreement, they have details of each other\u2019s accounts all the time\u200a\u2014\u200awithout knowing the other\u2019s identity.1. An Empty\u00a0FolderEveryone contains an empty folder with themselves to start with. As we\u2019ll progress, all these ten individuals will keep adding pages to their currently empty folders. And this collection of pages will form the register that tracks the transactions.2. When A Transaction HappensNext, everyone in the network sits with a blank page and a pen in their hands. Everyone is ready to write any transaction that occurs within the system.Now, if #2 wants to send $10 to #9.To make the transaction, #2 shouts and tells everyone, \u201cI want to transfer $10 to #9. So, everyone, please make a note of it on your pages.\u201dEveryone checks whether #2 has enough balance to transfer $10 to #9. If she has enough balance, everyone then makes a note of the transaction on their blank pages.First transaction on the\u00a0pageThe transaction is then considered to be complete.3. Transactions Continue HappeningAs the time passes, more people in the network feel the need to transfer money to others. Whenever they want to make a transaction, they announce it to everyone else. As soon as a person listens to the announcement, (s)he writes it on his/her page.This exercise continues until everyone runs out of space on the current page. Assuming a page has space to record ten transactions, as soon as the tenth transaction is made, everybody runs out of the space.When page gets\u00a0filledIt\u2019s time to put the page away in the folder and bring out a new page and repeat the process from the step 2 above.4. Putting Away The\u00a0PageBefore we put away the page in our folders, we need to seal it with a unique key that everyone in the network agrees upon. By sealing it, we will make sure that no one can make any changes to it once its copies have been put away in everyone\u2019s folder\u200a\u2014\u200anot today, not tomorrow and not even after a year. Once in the folder, it will always stay in the folder\u200a\u2014\u200asealed. Moreover, if everyone trusts the seal, everyone trusts the contents of the page. And this sealing of the page is the crux of this method.[Jargon Box] It is called \u2018mining\u2019 on the page to secure it, but for the simplicity of it, we\u2019ll keep calling it \u2018sealing.\u2019Earlier the third-party/middleman gave us the trust that whatever they have written in the register will never be altered. In a distributed and decentralized system like ours, this seal will provide the trust\u00a0instead.Interesting! How do we seal the page\u00a0then?Before we learn how we can seal the page, we\u2019ll know how the seal works, in general. And as a pre-requisite to it is learning about something that I like to call\u2026The Magic\u00a0MachineImagine a machine surrounded by thick walls. If you send a box with something inside it from the left, it will spit out a box containing something else.[Jargon Box] This machine is called \u2018Hash Function,\u2019 but we aren\u2019t in a mood to be too technical. So, for today, these are \u2018The Magic Machines.\u2019The Magic Machine (aka Hashing Function)Suppose, you send the number 4 inside it from the left, we\u2019d find that it spat out the following word on its right: \u2018dcbea.\u2019How did it convert the number 4 to this word? No one knows. Moreover, it is an irreversible process. Given the word, \u2018dcbea,\u2019 it is impossible to tell what the machine was fed on the left. But every time you\u2019d feed the number 4 to the machine, it will always spit out the same word, \u2018dcbea.\u2019hash(4) ==\u00a0dcbeaGiven the word, \u2018dcbea,\u2019 it is impossible to tell what the machine was fed on the left. But every time you\u2019d feed the number 4 to the machine, it will always spit out the same word, \u2018dcbea.\u2019Let\u2019s try sending in a different number. How about 26?hash(26) ==\u00a094c8eWe got \u201894c8e\u2019 this time. Interesting! So, the words can contain the numbers too.What if I ask you the following question now:\u201cCan you tell me what should I send from the left side of the machine such that I get a word that starts with three leading zeroes from the right side of it? For example, 000ab or 00098 or 000fa or anything among the others.\u201dPredicting the\u00a0inputThink about the question for a moment.I\u2019ve told you the machine has a property that we cannot calculate what we must send from the left after we\u2019re given the expected output on the right. With such a machine given to us, how can we answer the question I asked?I can think of one method. Why not try every number in the universe one by one until we get a word that starts with three leading zeroes?Try everything to calculate the\u00a0inputBeing optimistic, after several thousand attempts, we\u2019ll end up with a number that will yield the required output on the right.It was extremely difficult to calculate the input given the output. But at the same time, it will always be incredibly easy to verify if the predicted input yields the required output. Remember that the machine spits out the same word for a number every time.How difficult do you think the answer is if I give you a number, say 72533, and ask you the question, \u201cDoes this number, when fed into the machine, yields a word that starts with three leading zeroes?\u201dAll you need to do is, throw the number in the machine and see what did you get on the right side of it. That\u2019s it.The most important property of such machines is that\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cGiven an output, it is extremely difficult to calculate the input, but given the input and the output, it is pretty easy to verify if the input leads to the output.\u201dWe\u2019ll remember this one property of the Magic Machines (or Hash Functions) through the rest of the post:Given an output, it is extremely difficult to calculate the input, but given an input and output, it is pretty easy to verify if the input leads to the\u00a0output.How to use these machines to seal a\u00a0page?We\u2019ll use this magic machine to generate a seal for our page. Like always, we\u2019ll start with an imaginary situation.Imagine I give you two boxes. The first box contains the number 20893. I, then, ask you, \u201cCan you figure out a number that when added to the number in the first box and fed to the machine will give us a word that starts with three leading zeroes?\u201dThis is a similar situation as we saw previously and we have learned that the only way to calculate such a number is by trying every number available in the entire universe.After several thousand attempts, we\u2019ll stumble upon a number, say 21191, which when added to 20893 (i.e. 21191 + 20893 = 42084) and fed to the machine, will yield a word that satisfies our requirements.In such a case, this number, 21191 becomes the seal for the number 20893. Assume there is a page that bears the number 20893 written on it. To seal that page (i.e. no one can change the contents of it), we will put a badge labeled \u201821191\u2019 on top of it. As soon as the sealing number (i.e. 21191) is stuck on the page, the page is sealed.The sealed\u00a0number[Jargon Box] The sealing number is called \u2018Proof Of Work,\u2019 meaning that this number is the proof that efforts had been made to calculate it. We are good with calling it \u2018sealing number\u2019 for our purposes.If anyone wants to verify whether the page was altered, all he would have to do is\u200a\u2014\u200aadd the contents of the page with the sealing number and feed to the magic machine. If the machine gives out a word with three leading zeroes, the contents were untouched. If the word that comes out doesn\u2019t meet our requirements, we can throw away the page because its contents were compromised, and are of no use.We\u2019ll use a similar sealing mechanism to seal all our pages and eventually arrange them in our respective folders.Finally, sealing our\u00a0page\u2026To seal our page that contains the transactions of the network, we\u2019ll need to figure out a number that when appended to the list of transactions and fed to the machine, we get a word that starts with three leading zeroes on the right.Note: I have been using the phrase \u2018word starting with three leading zeroes\u2019 only as an example. It illustrates how Hashing Functions work. The real challenges are much more complicated than this.Once that number is calculated after spending time and electricity on the machine, the page is sealed with that number. If ever, someone tries to change the contents of the page, the sealing number will allow anyone to verify the integrity of the page.Now that we know about sealing the page, we will go back to the time when we had finished writing the tenth transaction on the page, and we ran out of space to write more.As soon as everyone runs out of the page to write further transactions, they indulge in calculating the sealing number for the page so that it can be tucked away in the folder. Everyone in the network does the calculation. The first one in the network to figure out the sealing number announces it to everyone else.Immediately on hearing the sealing number, everyone verifies if it yields the required output or not. If it does, everyone labels their pages with this number and put it away in their folders.But what if for someone, say #7, the sealing number that was announced doesn\u2019t yield the required output? Such cases are not unusual. The possible reasons for this could be:He might have misheard the transactions that were announced in the networkHe might have miswritten the transactions that were announced in the networkHe might have tried to cheat or be dishonest when writing transactions, either to favor himself or someone else in the networkNo matter what the reason is, #7 has only one choice\u200a\u2014\u200ato discard his page and copy it from someone else so that he too can put it in the folder. Unless he doesn\u2019t put his page in the folder, he cannot continue writing further transactions, thus, forbidding him to be part of the network.Whatever sealing number the majority agrees upon, becomes the honest sealing\u00a0number.Then why does everyone spend resources doing the calculation when they know that someone else will calculate and announce it to them? Why not sit idle and wait for the announcement?Great question. This is where the incentives come in the picture. Everyone who is the part of the Blockchain is eligible for rewards. The first one to calculate the sealing number gets rewarded with free money for his efforts (i.e. expended CPU power and electricity).Simply imagine, if #5 calculates the sealing number of a page, he gets rewarded with some free money, say $1, that gets minted out of thin air. In other words, the account balance of #5 gets incremented with $1 without decreasing anyone else\u2019s account balance.That\u2019s how Bitcoin got into existence. It was the first currency to be transacted on a Blockchain (i.e. distributed registers). And in return, to keep the efforts going on in the network, people were awarded Bitcoins.When enough people possess Bitcoins, they grow in value, making other people wanting Bitcoins; making Bitcoins grow in value even further; making even more people wanting Bitcoins; making them grow in value even further; and so on.The rewards make everyone keep working in the\u00a0network.And once everyone tucks away the page in their folders, they bring out a new blank page and repeat the whole process all over again\u200a\u2014\u200adoing it forever.[Jargon Box] Think of a single page as a Block of transactions and the folder as the Chain of pages (Blocks), therefore, turning it into a Blockchain.And that, my friends, is how Blockchain works.", "responses": "308"}, {"title": "Ten years in, nobody has come up with a use for blockchain", "author_name": "Kai Stinchcombe", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/ten-years-in-nobody-has-come-up-with-a-use-case-for-blockchain-ee98c180100?source=search_post---------3", "post_date": "Dec 22, 2017", "readtime": "16 min read", "upvotes": "52K", "content": "Ten years in, nobody has come up with a use for blockchainKai StinchcombeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 22, 2017(Sequel here: Blockchain is not only crappy technology but a bad vision for the future.)Everyone says the blockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, is going to change EVERYTHING. And yet, after years of tireless effort and billions of dollars invested, nobody has actually come up with a use for the blockchain\u2014besides currency speculation and illegal transactions.Each purported use case\u200a\u2014\u200afrom payments to legal documents, from escrow to voting systems\u2014amounts to a set of contortions to add a distributed, encrypted, anonymous ledger where none was needed. What if there isn\u2019t actually any use for a distributed ledger at all? What if, ten years after it was invented, the reason nobody has adopted a distributed ledger at scale is because nobody wants it?Payments and\u00a0bankingThe original intended use of the blockchain was to power currencies like bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200aa way to store and exchange value much like any other currency. Visa and MasterCard were dinosaurs, everyone proclaimed, because there was now a costless, instant way to exchange value without the middleman taking a cut. A revolution in banking was just the start\u2026 governments, unable to issue currency by fiat anymore, would take a back seat as individual citizens transacted freely outside any national system.The killer feature: knowing you can get your money\u00a0backIt didn\u2019t take long for that dream to fall apart. For one thing, there\u2019s already a costless, instant way to exchange value without a middleman: cash. Bitcoins substitute for dollars, but Visa and MasterCard actually sit on top of dollar-based banking transactions, providing a set of value-added services like enabling banks to track fraud disputes, and verifying the identity of the buyer and seller. It turns out that for the person paying for a product, the key feature of a new payment system\u200a\u2014\u200athink of PayPal in its early days\u200a\u2014\u200ais the confidence that if the goods aren\u2019t as described you\u2019ll get your money back. And for the person accepting payment, basically the key feature is that their customer has it, and is willing to use it. Add in points, credit lines, and a free checked bag on any United flight and you have something that consumers choose and merchants accept. Nobody actually wants to pay with bitcoin, which is why it hasn\u2019t taken off.The key feature of a new payment system\u200a\u2014\u200athink of PayPal in its early days\u200a\u2014\u200ais the confidence that if the goods aren\u2019t as described you\u2019ll get your money\u00a0back.It would take 5,000 nuclear reactors to run Visa on the blockchain.Plus, it\u2019s not actually that good a payment system\u200a\u2014\u200aVisa can handle sixty thousand transactions per second, while Bitcoin historically taps out at seven. There are technical modifications going on to improve Bitcoin\u2019s efficiency, but as a starting point, you have something that\u2019s about 0.01% as good at clearing transactions. (And, worth noting, for those seven transactions a second Bitcoin is already estimated to use 35 times as much energy as Visa. If you brought Bitcoin\u2019s transaction volume up to Visa\u2019s it would be using as much electricity as the rest of the world put together.)Freedom to transact without government supervisionIn many countries, and often our own, a little bit of ability to keep a few things private from the authorities probably makes the world a better place. In places like Cuba or Venezuela, many prefer to transact in dollars, and bitcoin could in theory serve a similar function. Yet there are two reasons this hasn\u2019t been the panacea it\u2019s assumed: the advantages of government to the individual, and the advantages of government to society.Mt Gox loses all its customers\u2019 moneyThe government-backed banking system provides FDIC guarantees, reversibility of ACH, identity verification, audit standards, and an investigation system when things go wrong. Bitcoin, by design, has none of these things. I saw a remarkable message thread by someone whose bitcoin account got drained because their email had been hacked and their password was stolen. They were stunned to have no recourse! And this is widespread\u200a\u2014\u200ain 2014, the then-#1 bitcoin trader, Mt. Gox, also lost $400m of investor money due to security failures. The subsequent #1 bitcoin trader, Bitfinex, also shut down after a loss of customer funds. Imagine the world if more banks had been drained of customer funds than not. Bitcoin is what banking looked like in the middle ages\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201chere\u2019s your libertarian paradise, have a nice day.\u201dBitFinex loses all of its customers\u2019 moneyBitcoin is what banking looked like in the middle ages\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201chere\u2019s your libertarian paradise, have a nice\u00a0day.[This issue is particularly near and dear to my heart because my own company, True Link, is designed to help vulnerable seniors\u200a\u2014\u200apeople likely to give out their credit card number over the phone, enter sketchy sweepstakes or donate to sketchy charities, participate in scam investments, or install password-stealing malware. As the people who most need security enhancements in banking and payments, they depend heavily on the existing protections and would absolutely be harmed by many of the proposed changes in favor of private-key authenticated, instant, and irreversible transfers. Someone starting from a human perspective on banking security\u2014who is currently harmed and how can we help them?\u2014would come up with something very different from blockchain!]Mongolian banks experienced +400% transaction volume with new sanctions against Russia. New slogan \u2013\u201cBitcoin: less cops than Mongolia.\u201dSecond, government policies are designed to disrupt terrorist financing and organized crime, and prevent traffic in illegal goods like stolen credit card numbers or child pornography. The mainstream preference is to have transactions private but not undiscoverable under warrant\u200a\u2014\u200aask \u201cshould the government have a list everyone you\u2019ve paid money to,\u201d and most will say no; ask \u201cshould the government be able under warrant to get a list everyone a child pornography collector has paid money to,\u201d and most will say yes. Nobody wants bitcoin to 100x the total traffic in goods and services our government defines as illegal\u200a\u2014\u200aas one bitcoin enthusiast pointed out to me, \u201cIf you invented cash today, it would be illegal too.\u201dMicropayments and bank-to-bank transfersIt\u2019s worth noting two particular payment use cases where people are particularly excited about blockchain-based currencies: micropayments and bank-to-bank transfers. In terms of micropayments, people enthuse that bitcoin transactions are free and instant. Actually, they take about eight minutes to clear and cost about four cents to process. People have proposed that you will use bitcoins for micropayments\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, paying two cents to a musician to listen to their song on the internet, or four cents to read a newspaper article. Yet the infrastructure to do this\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, advance authorization with the source of funds so you don\u2019t have to wait eight minutes to read the article you just clicked\u200a\u2014\u200aactually eliminates the need for bitcoin at all. If you\u2019re happy to pay four cents an article or two cents a song, you can set it up to bill once a month from your bank account and read to your heart\u2019s content. And in practice, people prefer subscription services to micropayments.Three years in, Ripple is to SWIFT what toothpicks are to the US\u00a0GDPIn terms of interbank payments, many people mention Ripple as a promising way to transfer money between banks. Over the last 30 days it processed two billion dollars (as of this writing) worth of interbank and interpersonal transactions\u200a\u2014\u200aabout 40 seconds\u2019 worth of volume on the SWIFT interbank network\u200a\u2014\u200aafter three years of being available to banks to trade 90% of the world\u2019s high-volume currencies. This is like the proportion of US GDP comprised by toothpick sales. Why haven\u2019t banks preferred this new technology? The answer is that setting up a Ripple Gateway isn\u2019t actually much different than using the existing corresponding-account system\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept that a lost password or security token can lead to much larger and more instant actual losses\u200a\u2014\u200awhich, as a reminder, has happened to more leading bitcoin exchanges than have managed to avoid it. The same features that make the banking system attractive to end users also make it attractive to banks. They already have ledgers, and don\u2019t need to distribute them, anonymize them, encrypt them, publish them, and make them irreversible.\u201cSmart\u201d contracts\u201cSmart\u201d contracts are contracts written as software, rather than written as legal text. Because you can encode them directly on the blockchain, they can involve the transfer of value based directly on the cryptographic consent of the parties involved\u200a\u2014\u200ain other words, they are \u201cself-executing.\u201d And in theory, contracts written in software are cheaper to interpret\u200a\u2014\u200abecause their operation is literally mathematical and automatic, there are no two ways to interpret them, which means there\u2019s no need for expensive legal battles.The DAO loses all its customers\u2019 moneyAnd yet the real-world examples show the ways this is problematic. The most prominent and largest smart contract to date, an investment vehicle called the Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabled its members to invest directly using their private cryptographic keys to vote on what to invest in. No lawyers, no management fees, no opaque boardrooms, the DAO \u201cremoves the ability of directors and fund managers to misdirect and waste investor funds.\u201d And yet, due to a software bug, the DAO \u201cvoted\u201d to \u201cinvest\u201d $50m, a third of its members\u2019 money, into a vehicle controlled by very clever programmers who knew a lot about recursion issues during balance updates. Some said this was a hack or an exploit because the software had not functioned as intended, while others said that there was no such thing as a hack\u200a\u2014\u200athe whole point was that the software made decisions autonomously and there were no two ways to interpret it, and if you didn\u2019t understand how the software worked you shouldn\u2019t have participated. In the end, everyone got together and voted to retroactively amend the software contract and move the money back to its original owners. What\u2019s the takeaway? Even the most die-hard blockchain enthusiasts actually want a bunch of humans arguing about the underlying intention behind a contract, rather than letting the software self-execute. Maybe the \u201cdumb\u201d way is smart after all?Even crypto enthusiasts want to argue about what their contracts meanThe DAO was an illustrative experiment, but what about for routine transactions at big companies? The investors and startups in the smart-contract space promise that the block chain will enable super-fast execution and payment\u200a\u2014\u200afor example that in healthcare applications, \u201cinstead of waiting 90\u2013180 days for a claim to be processed, or spending hours on the phone trying to get your bill paid, it can in theory be processed on the spot.\u201d But that\u2019s true for any software-enabled purchasing system. My company\u2019s Amazon servers scale automatically based on website traffic and bill us for how much we use. The idea that smart contracts would change this is a fallacy\u200a\u2014\u200ait conflates the legal arrangement being put into effect with software with the legal arrangement itself being coded as software. Amazon\u2019s terms of service are not a smart contract, but the billing system that implements those terms is automated. To the extent that health insurance billing, for example, is not automated, the problem isn\u2019t that existing software isn\u2019t \u201csmart\u201d enough to handle submitting claims and paying them electronically, it\u2019s that the insurance company is slow moving, either by accident or because they on-purpose prefer a human review.Can bitcoin make this go faster\u00a0please?In the end, everyone from blockchain enthusiasts to health insurers actually wants to argue out in human language what the business relationship is and interpret it on an ongoing basis, and then to write software that handles the fulfillment and payment. That already exists\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s the status quo.Distributed storage, computing, and messagingAnother implausible idea is using the blockchain as a distributed storage mechanism. On its face it makes sense\u200a\u2014\u200ayou break your document up into \u201cblocks\u201d, encrypt them, and put them in a distributed ledger\u2026 it\u2019s backed up across multiple locations, it\u2019s secure, and easy to track everything that happened.Yet there are multiple excellent ways to break up files, encrypt them, and replicate them across multiple storage media in different locations. There is already a company that bills itself as a cheaper, distributed Dropbox, which encrypts and stores files across multiple users\u2019 hard drives and pays them a small fee for the free space on their hard drives. The block chain is just a particularly inefficient and insecure way of doing this.Ha! Can your blockchain do\u00a0THIS?There are four additional problems with a blockchain-driven approach. First, you\u2019re relying on single-point encryption\u200a\u2014\u200ayour own private keys\u200a\u2014\u200arather than a more sophisticated system that might involve two-factor authorization, intrusion detection, volume limits, firewalls, remote IP tracking, and the ability to disconnect the system in an emergency. Second, price tradeoffs are entirely implausible\u200a\u2014\u200athe bitcoin blockchain has consumed almost a billion dollars worth of electricity to hash an amount of data equivalent to about a sixth of what I get for my ten dollar a month dropbox subscription. Fourth, systematically choosing where and how much to replicate data is an advantage in the long run\u200a\u2014\u200athe blockchain\u2019s defaults on data replication just aren\u2019t that smart. And finally, Dropbox and Box.com and Google and Microsoft and Apple and Amazon and everyone else provide a set of valuable other features that you don\u2019t actually want to go develop on your own. Analogous to Visa, the problem isn\u2019t storing data, it\u2019s managing permissions, un-sharing what you shared before, getting an easy-to-view document history, syncing it on multiple devices, and so on.The same argument holds for proposed distributed computing and secure messaging applications. Encrypting it, storing it forever, and replicating it across the entire network is just a ton of overhead relative to what you\u2019re actually trying to accomplish. There are excellent computing, messaging, and storage solutions out there that have all the encryption and replication anyone needs\u200a\u2014\u200aactually better than blockchain based solutions\u200a\u2014\u200aand have plenty of other great features in addition.Stock issuanceIt was much-heralded when NASDAQ launched an internal blockchain-driven exchange for privately-held stocks. But wait: correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but the whole purpose of NASDAQ (or the DTCC trade clearing system, for example) is that it has a ledger of who owns what stocks? Were they nervous that their systems, absent blockchain, would soon be unable to keep track of who owns what?Similar to other transaction-tracking problems such as customer-to-merchant payments, the difference between NASDAQ\u2019s ledger and blockchain\u2019s ledger is that blockchain is distributed\u200a\u2014\u200ait addresses the problem of lack of a trusted intermediary. And yet (for legal transactions) the company itself, its transfer agent of record, a clearinghouse, or an exchange are all trusted intermediaries and typically provide value-added services in addition. The reason NASDAQ is the right home for a blockchain-driven exchange is that they\u2019re expert in the compliance and security aspects of trading stock. Cut out the middleman (here, NASDAQ itself) and the government and you\u2019ll ultimately be limited to companies that choose to make an end-run around the legal, compliance, and tracking systems common to the mainstream market. As people who trade in unlisted stocks will tell you, that\u2019s a recipe for getting your money stolen.Why you want to file securities paperwork when you issue securitiesAnd we\u2019re already seeing this. New companies have also begun creating blockchain-based \u201ccoins\u201d convertible into company stock, and selling them to the public in Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs, as a cheaper and more flexible way to raise money than a traditional Initial Public Offering of stocks on an exchange. It will be interesting to see how long this craze lasts\u200a\u2014\u200aamong other things, offering tokens convertible to stock counts as a securities offering, and so the SEC rules presumably apply to these securities offerings just like any other. Either the \u201ccoins\u201d are just less-secure electronic stock certificates\u200a\u2014\u200aprotected by however carefully you store your password, rather than by the laws and protections of a securities exchange\u200a\u2014\u200aor it\u2019s another attempt to do an end-run around the law.Authenticity verificationAnother plausible use of the blockchain is that if you want to make a public, unalterable, undeleteable signed statement, you can \u201cpublish\u201d it to the block chain\u200a\u2014\u200athinking of the distributed ledger as more like a diary than a way to buy and sell. In theory you could use this for recording vote tallies, verifying the origin of diamonds or brand-name gear, verifying people\u2019s identity, resolving the ownership of domain names, keeping items in escrow, disclosing provisional patents under seal, notarizing documents, and so on.One vote per person. Bitcoin wallets are harder to\u00a0count!Without diving too thoroughly into the details of each of these, it seems the use cases all fall apart pretty quickly. For voting, the status quo is recording the total number of ballots cast, with the voter dropping a visible paper ballot in a box, and journalists and observers from both sides watching the ballot boxes the whole time. The tough problem in voting is keeping who voted for who anonymous and yet making sure that voters and votes are one to one. Paper does this so much better than blockchain.For a public notary or similar, verifying your driver\u2019s license or having witnesses known to you present means that it wasn\u2019t signed with a stolen password or private key\u200a\u2014\u200abut, if a password or private key is adequate, you can just publish it signed with a PGP key. For establishing the authenticity of brand name goods like watches or handbags, or that a diamond was ethically mined, the ledger being distributed and encrypted doesn\u2019t add any value\u200a\u2014\u200athe originating company can just include a certificate you can verify online, just as they have done in the past. In cases of escrow, a smart contract can automatically pay for the goods without a need for a third party to verify and hold the funds, but you still need a trusted party to verify that the goods are delivered and as-promised.Proving you know something, in the modern\u00a0worldAnd finally, if you want to irrefutably prove that you knew X at time Y without disclosing the actual knowledge publicly, encrypt it and email it to yourself at both a gmail and a hotmail address or post it on bitbucket, or print it out and notarize it, or postmark it by mailing it to yourself, or tweet an md5 of it, or whatever. But then again, how large is the irrefutably-prove-you-knew-X-at-time-Y-without-disclosing-X industry? Can you think of any leading company, or any company at all, that provides this service?For domain resolution\u200a\u2014\u200athe process of figuring out whose servers get to see the traffic and respond to your requests when you type a URL into your address bar\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s promising to imagine that an all-digital record of smart contracts, where the actual act of payment being published to the ledger also updates who the domain resolves to, obviating the need for domain escrow services. Yet in practice, as with the DAO or other smart contracts, if valuable domains change hands due to theft or security issues, you actually need a way to override the ledger\u200a\u2014\u200aas the result of a court order, for example. Just like with government-backed, law-backed bank accounts, real companies won\u2019t prefer a situation in which a security breach or stolen password could result in someone else permanently and irrevocably owning bankofamerica.com or disney.com or sony.com or whatever. Adopting block chain technology makes theft or impersonation more likely rather than less. It sounds hypothetical until you realize more leading bitcoin exchanges have been hacked than not\u200a\u2014\u200asomething that very rarely happens with the leading domain name providers.So what\u2019s\u00a0left?Washing machines of the future will be able to order their own detergentEach of these seems trivial\u200a\u2014\u200ayes, everyone knows handbags already come with certificates of authenticity with an ID number you can look up online\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept that in each case, millions if not tens of millions of dollars have been spent on entire companies dedicated to just that particular use case. And you can get even more esoteric\u200a\u2014\u200aSecond Life on the blockchain, or blockchain-enabled appliances so your washing machine can smart-contract for its own detergent, or a sports league where the coaching decisions are written on the blockchain. (For real!)In the end, the advantages of the existing human and software systems surrounding transactions\u200a\u2014\u200afrom verifying identity with a driver\u2019s license to calling and clarifying the statements made in a credit disputed transaction to automatically billing your credit card for a newspaper subscription\u200a\u2014\u200aoutweigh the purported benefits, as well as hidden costs, of irrevocable, automated execution. Blockchain enthusiasts often act as if the hard part is getting money from A to B or keeping a record of what happened. In each case, moving money and recording the transaction is actually the cheap, easy, highly-automated part of a much more complex system.Nobody went out and did a survey about whether most credit card users would be willing to give up their frequent flyer miles in return for also losing the ability to dispute a transaction.Which leaves us where we started\u200a\u2014\u200acurrency speculation and illegal transactions\u200a\u2014\u200aalong with perhaps a lesson. In conversations with bitcoin entrepreneurs and investors and consultants, there was often a lack of knowledge or even interest in how the jobs were being done today or what the value to the end user was. With all the money spent on bitcoin cash registers, nobody went out and did a survey about whether most credit card users would be willing to give up their frequent flyer miles in return for also losing the ability to dispute a transaction. Presumably, they thought, the reason IPOs are so expensive or venture fund formation paperwork is so onerous is because all those lawyers and accountants are just getting rich sitting around pushing paper\u2026 a bunch of smart engineers in their 20s with no industry experience could certainly do their jobs, automatically, in a matter of months, with just a few million bucks of venture capital.So far, not so much.Don\u2019t smart contract me,\u00a0bro!Kai Stinchcombe is CEO and cofounder of True Link Financial, a banking and investment service for seniors.

Its failure to achieve adoption to date is because systems built on trust, norms, and institutions inherently function better than the type of no-need-for-trusted-parties systems blockchain envisions. That\u2019s permanent: no matter how much blockchain improves it is still headed in the wrong direction.This December I wrote a widely-circulated article on the inapplicability of blockchain to any actual problem. People objected mostly not to the technology argument, but rather hoped that decentralization could produce integrity.Let\u2019s start with this: Venmo is a free service to transfer dollars, and bitcoin transfers are not free. Yet after I wrote an article last December saying bitcoin had no use, someone responded that Venmo and Paypal are raking in consumers\u2019 money and people should switch to bitcoin.What a surreal contrast between blockchain\u2019s non-usefulness/non-adoption and the conviction of its believers! It\u2019s so entirely evident that this person didn\u2019t become a bitcoin enthusiast because they were looking for a convenient, free way to transfer money from one person to another and discovered bitcoin. In fact, I would assert that there is no single person in existence who had a problem they wanted to solve, discovered that an available blockchain solution was the best way to solve it, and therefore became a blockchain enthusiast.There is no single person in existence who had a problem they wanted to solve, discovered that an available blockchain solution was the best way to solve it, and therefore became a blockchain enthusiast.The number of retailers accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment is declining, and its biggest corporate boosters like IBM, NASDAQ, Fidelity, Swift and Walmart have gone long on press but short on actual rollout. Even the most prominent blockchain company, Ripple, doesn\u2019t use blockchain in its product. You read that right: the company Ripple decided the best way to move money across international borders was to not use Ripples.A blockchain is a literal technology, not a\u00a0metaphorWhy all the enthusiasm for something so useless in practice?People have made a number of implausible claims about the future of blockchain\u2014like that you should use it for AI in place of the type of behavior-tracking that google and facebook do, for example. This is based on a misunderstanding of what a blockchain is. A blockchain isn\u2019t an ethereal thing out there in the universe that you can \u201cput\u201d things into, it\u2019s a specific data structure: a linear transaction log, typically replicated by computers whose owners (called miners) are rewarded for logging new transactions.In The Golden Compass, Dust permeates the world. It is created by consciousness and is itself conscious, and can condense into angels. Blockchain is not like\u00a0that.There are two things that are cool about this particular data structure. One is that a change in any block invalidates every block after it, which means that you can\u2019t tamper with historical transactions. The second is that you only get rewarded if you\u2019re working on the same chain as everyone else, so each participant has an incentive to go with the consensus.The end result is a shared definitive historical record. And, what\u2019s more, because consensus is formed by each person acting in their own interest, adding a false transaction or working from a different history just means you\u2019re not getting paid and everyone else is. Following the rules is mathematically enforced\u2014no government or police force need come in and tell you the transaction you\u2019ve logged is false (or extort bribes or bully the participants). It\u2019s a powerful idea.So in summary, here\u2019s what blockchain-the-technology is: \u201cLet\u2019s create a very long sequence of small files\u200a\u2014\u200aeach one containing a hash of the previous file, some new data, and the answer to a difficult math problem\u200a\u2014\u200aand divide up some money every hour among anyone willing to certify and store those files for us on their computers.\u201dNow, here\u2019s what blockchain-the-metaphor is: \u201cWhat if everyone keeps their records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?\u201dAn illustration of the difference: In 2006, Walmart launched a system to track its bananas and mangoes from field to store. In 2009 they abandoned it because of logistical problems getting everyone to enter the data, and in 2017 they re-launched it (to much fanfare) on blockchain. If someone comes to you with \u201cthe mango-pickers don\u2019t like doing data entry,\u201d \u201cI know: let\u2019s create a very long sequence of small files, each one containing a hash of the previous file\u201d is a nonsense answer, but \u201cWhat if everyone keeps their records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?\u201d at least addresses the right question!Blockchain-based trustworthiness falls apart in\u00a0practicePeople treat blockchain as a \u201cfuturistic integrity wand\u201d\u2014wave a blockchain at the problem, and suddenly your data will be valid. For almost anything people want to be valid, blockchain has been proposed as a solution.It\u2019s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it\u2019s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity.It\u2019s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it\u2019s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity.To understand why this is the case, let\u2019s work from the practical to the theoretical. For example, let\u2019s consider a widely-proposed use case for blockchain: buying an e-book with a \u201csmart\u201d contract. The goal of the blockchain is, you don\u2019t trust an e-book vendor and they don\u2019t trust you (because you\u2019re just two individuals on the internet), but, because it\u2019s on blockchain, you\u2019ll be able to trust the transaction.In the traditional system, once you pay you\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll receive the book, but once the vendor has your money they don\u2019t have any incentive to deliver. You\u2019re relying on Visa or Amazon or the government to make things fair\u2014what a recipe for being a chump! In contrast, on a blockchain system, by executing the transaction as a record in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone, the transfer of money and digital product is automatic, atomic, and direct, with no middleman needed to arbitrate the transaction, dictate terms, and take a fat cut on the way. Isn\u2019t that better for everybody?Hm. Perhaps you are very skilled at writing software. When the novelist proposes the smart contract, you take an hour or two to make sure that the contract will withdraw only an amount of money equal to the agreed-upon price, and that the book\u200a\u2014\u200arather than some other file, or nothing at all\u200a\u2014\u200awill actually arrive.An e-book consultantAuditing software is hard! The most-heavily scrutinized smart contract in history had a small bug that nobody noticed\u200a\u2014\u200athat is, until someone did notice it, and used it to steal fifty million dollars. If cryptocurrency enthusiasts putting together a $150m investment fund can\u2019t properly audit the software, how confident are you in your e-book audit? Perhaps you would rather write your own counteroffer software contract, in case this e-book author has hidden a recursion bug in their version to drain your ethereum wallet of all your life savings?It\u2019s a complicated way to buy a book! It\u2019s not trustless, you\u2019re trusting in the software (and your ability to defend yourself in a software-driven world), instead of trusting other people.\u201cI\u2019d rather look at the source code to make sure he didn\u2019t vote\u00a0twice.\u201dAnother example: the purported advantages for a voting system in a weakly-governed country. \u201cKeep your voting records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone\u201d sounds right\u200a\u2014\u200ayet is your Afghan villager going to download the blockchain from a broadcast node and decrypt the Merkle root from his Linux command line to independently verify that his vote has been counted? Or will he rely on the mobile app of a trusted third party\u200a\u2014\u200alike the nonprofit or open-source consortium administering the election or providing the software?These sound like stupid examples\u200a\u2014\u200anovelists and villagers hiring e-bodyguard hackers to protect them from malicious customers and nonprofits whose clever smart-contracts might steal their money and votes??\u200a\u2014\u200auntil you realize that\u2019s actually the point. Instead of relying on trust or regulation, in the blockchain world, individuals are on-purpose responsible for their own security precautions. And if the software they use is malicious or buggy, they should have read the software more carefully.The entire worldview underlying blockchain is\u00a0wrongYou actually see it over and over again. Blockchain systems are supposed to be more trustworthy, but in fact they are the least trustworthy systems in the world. Today, in less than a decade, three successive top bitcoin exchanges have been hacked, another is accused of insider trading, the demonstration-project DAO smart contract got drained, crypto price swings are ten times those of the world\u2019s most mismanaged currencies, and bitcoin, the \u201ckiller app\u201d of crypto transparency, is almost certainly artificially propped up by fake transactions involving billions of literally imaginary dollars.How exactly does blockchain stop this guy from spraying pesticides?Blockchain systems do not magically make the data in them accurate or the people entering the data trustworthy, they merely enable you to audit whether it has been tampered with. A person who sprayed pesticides on a mango can still enter onto a blockchain system that the mangoes were organic. A corrupt government can create a blockchain system to count the votes and just allocate an extra million addresses to their cronies. An investment fund whose charter is written in software can still misallocate funds.How then, is trust created?In the case of buying an e-book, even if you\u2019re buying it with a smart contract, instead of auditing the software you\u2019ll rely on one of four things, each of them characteristics of the \u201cold way\u201d: either the author of the smart contract is someone you know of and trust, the seller of the e-book has a reputation to uphold, you or friends of yours have bought e-books from this seller in the past successfully, or you\u2019re just willing to hope that this person will deal fairly. In each case, even if the transaction is effectuated via a smart contract, in practice you\u2019re relying on trust of a counterparty or middleman, not your self-protective right to audit the software, each man an island unto himself. The contract still works, but the fact that the promise is written in auditable software rather than government-enforced English makes it less transparent, not more transparent.The same for the vote counting. Before blockchain can even get involved, you need to trust that voter registration is done fairly, that ballots are given only to eligible voters, that the votes are made anonymously rather than bought or intimidated, that the vote displayed by the balloting system is the same as the vote recorded, and that no extra votes are given to the political cronies to cast. Blockchain makes none of these problems easier and many of them harder\u2014but more importantly, solving them in a blockchain context requires a set of awkward workarounds that undermine the core premise. So we know the entries are valid, let\u2019s allow only trusted nonprofits to make entries\u2014and you\u2019re back at the good old \u201cclassic\u201d ledger. In fact, if you look at any blockchain solution, inevitably you\u2019ll find an awkward workaround to re-create trusted parties in a trustless world.A crypto-medieval systemYet absent these \u201cold way\u201d factors\u2014supposing you actually attempted to rely on blockchain\u2019s self-interest/self-protection to build a real system\u2014you\u2019d be in a real mess.The Knights Templar was sort of a banking system, actually.Eight hundred years ago in Europe\u200a\u2014\u200awith weak governments unable to enforce laws and trusted counterparties few, fragile and far between\u200a\u2014\u200atheft was rampant, safe banking was a fantasy, and personal security was at the point of the sword. This is what Somalia looks like now, and also, what it looks like to transact on the blockchain in the ideal scenario.Somalia on purpose. That\u2019s the vision. Nobody wants it!Even the most die-hard crypto enthusiasts prefer in practice to rely on trust rather than their own crypto-medieval systems. 93% of bitcoins are mined by managed consortiums, yet none of the consortiums use smart contracts to manage payouts. Instead, they promise things like a \u201clong history of stable and accurate payouts.\u201d Sounds like a trustworthy middleman!Trusted sellers of stolen credit cards and\u00a0cocaine.Same with Silk Road, a cryptocurrency-driven online drug bazaar. The key to Silk Road wasn\u2019t the bitcoins (that was just to evade government detection), it was the reputation scores that allowed people to trust criminals. And the reputation scores weren\u2019t tracked on a tamper-proof blockchain, they were tracked by a trusted middleman!If Ripple, Silk Road, Slush Pool, and the DAO all prefer \u201cold way\u201d systems of creating and enforcing trust, it\u2019s no wonder that the outside world had not adopted trustless systems either!In the name of all blockchain stands for, it\u2019s time to abandon blockchainA decentralized, tamper-proof repository sounds like a great way to audit where your mango comes from, how fresh it is, and whether it has been sprayed with pesticides or not. But actually, laws on food labeling, nonprofit or government inspectors, an independent, trusted free press, empowered workers who trust whistleblower protections, credible grocery stores, your local nonprofit farmer\u2019s market, and so on, do a way better job. People who actually care about food safety do not adopt blockchain because trusted is better than trustless. Blockchain\u2019s technology mess exposes its metaphor mess\u200a\u2014\u200aa software engineer pointing out that storing the data a sequence of small hashed files won\u2019t get the mango-pickers to accurately report whether they sprayed pesticides is also pointing out why peer-to-peer interaction with no regulations, norms, middlemen, or trusted parties is actually a bad way to empower people.Smarter produce in under 2.2\u00a0secondsLike the farmer\u2019s market or the organic labeling standard, so many real ideas are hiding in plain sight. Do you wish there was a type of financial institution that was secure and well-regulated in all the traditional ways, but also has the integrity of being people-powered? A credit union\u2019s members elect its directors, and the transaction-processing revenue is divided up among the members. Move your money! Prefer a deflationary monetary policy? Central bankers are appointed by elected leaders. Want to make elections more secure and democratic? Help write open source voting software, go out and register voters, or volunteer as an election observer here or abroad! Wish there was a trusted e-book delivery service that charged lower transaction fees and distributed more of the earnings to the authors? You can already consider stated payout rates when you buy music or books, buy directly from the authors, or start your own e-book site that\u2019s even better than what\u2019s out there!Projects based on the elimination of trust have failed to capture customers\u2019 interest because trust is actually so damn valuable. A lawless and mistrustful world where self-interest is the only principle and paranoia is the only source of safety is a not a paradise but a crypto-medieval hellhole.As a society, and as technologists and entrepreneurs in particular, we\u2019re going to have to get good at cooperating\u200a\u2014\u200aat building trust, and, at being trustworthy. Instead of directing resources to the elimination of trust, we should direct our resources to the creation of trust\u2014whether we use a long series of sequentially hashed files as our storage medium or not.Kai Stinchcombe coined the terms \u201ccrypto-medieval\u201d \u201cfuturistic integrity wand\u201d and \u201csmart mango.\u201d Please use freely: coining terms makes you a futurist.", "responses": "786"}, {"title": "We already know blockchain\u2019s killer\u00a0apps", "author_name": "Haseeb Qureshi", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/we-already-know-blockchains-killer-apps-f2d443eba35?source=search_post---------5", "post_date": "Oct 31, 2017", "readtime": "25 min read", "upvotes": "30K", "content": "We already know blockchain\u2019s killer\u00a0appsHaseeb QureshiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 31, 2017It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Silicon Valley scoffed at cryptocurrencies. All over coffee shops in Mountain View and Menlo Park, you heard the same conversation: \u201cSure, it\u2019s cool technology, but when are we going to see the killer app\u201d?A few merchants dipped their toes into accepting Bitcoin in 2014. But adoption largely backed off. I remember seeing a few Bitcoin ATMs in Austin, and then they disappeared. Bitcoin reneged on its promise to replace cash, so most venture capitalists assumed it was dead on arrival. Without a killer app driving consumer adoption, cryptocurrencies seemed like they would be nothing more than a curiosity for cryptographers and paranoids.In the last year, interest in cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed. The public cryptocurrency market cap has surged to highs of over $170B. With over 1.5B raised through ICOs in 2017, over 70 crypto exchanges open for business, and crypto hedge funds and VCs popping up left and right, it seems that everyone is clambering to get a seat on the rocketship.In all this frenzy, nobody is asking about killer apps anymore.I believe this is a mistake.As a consumer technology, cryptocurrencies are a hot mess. They\u2019re extremely difficult to purchase, the networks are slow, the transaction fees are high, the community is full of trolls, hackers, and scammers, it\u2019s far too easy to lose your funds or have them stolen, and even if you win the battle to secure your funds or use a custodial service like Coinbase, merchant acceptance is scarce.The developer tools are even worse. The cryptocurrency ecosystem is fragmented and territorial. The tooling, documentation, and developer education are shoddy to nonexistent.Cryptocurrencies suck for both users and builders. Yet, despite these glaring problems, the demand and hype only go up.This should strike you as alarming. If it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ve fallen asleep at the wheel.What does this\u00a0mean?To make sense of this phenomenon, you\u2019re forced to one of two possible conclusions.The first is that the value of crypto is entirely in speculation.There\u2019s a lot of unfounded speculation in cryptocurrency markets, no doubt. Many of my close friends think cryptocurrencies are entirely a bubble. This kind of skepticism is a healthy perspective in a frothy market, but I\u2019d say this is too broad a claim.The other possibility is that crypto\u2019s underlying value is in something other than the user experience. But this seems to belie everything we know about how technological value creation takes place.The founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, argues that crypto won\u2019t have a killer app at all:\u2026 There will be no \u201ckiller app\u201d for blockchain technology. The reason for this is simple: the doctrine of low-hanging fruit. If there existed some particular application for which blockchain technology is massively superior to anything else\u00a0\u2026 then people would be loudly talking about it already.\u00a0\u2026 And so far, there has been no single application that anyone has come up with that has seriously stood out to dominate everything else on the horizon.\u201dVitalik Buterin (The Value of Blockchain Technology)Vitalik repudiates the \u201ckiller app\u201d framework. He believes that blockchain will become valuable for the many long-tail applications that it enables.I disagree.I think the \u201ckiller app\u201d framework is the correct one. While there are many cutting-edge applications that technologists will find exciting (myself included), the major drivers of blockchain\u2019s value are relatively narrow.Amidst the hype-train of ICOs, \u201cdecentralizing the Internet,\u201d and bullshit artists trying to hoist everything they can think of onto a blockchain, it\u2019s instructive to take the 1000-foot view and remind ourselves of the big picture.I argue there are four killer apps for blockchains:Dark web and black market paymentsDigital goldPayments (macro and micro)TokenizationKiller app #1: Dark web and black market\u00a0paymentsMarket size (approx.): Billions to 10s of Billions USDWhat\u2019s blocking this? Privacy-coin development, scalingBitcoin has done a decent job of distancing itself from its roots. But the first and foremost killer app for cryptocurrencies has always been as a payments layer for those who require anonymity and censorship-resistance. Primarily, these have been users of the dark web.The dark web refers to recesses of the Internet that can only be accessed through special anonymizing protocols, such as Tor, I2P, and Freenet. Transactions that take place through dark web markets range from the relatively innocuous, like purchasing prescription drugs, all the way to hacked credential dumps, digital ransoms, firearms, and famously, assassinations.Before Bitcoin, dark web markets had a glaring problem. How can you perform payments between pseudonymous dark web buyers and sellers, on opposite sides of the world, when they don\u2019t trust each other and don\u2019t want anyone to know who they are?Bitcoin fit like a glove. It was global, trustless, pseudonymous, and (mostly) invulnerable to state actors. Bitcoin took off as the unofficial currency of dark web marketplaces like The Silk Road, AlphaBay, and their successors.Most of Bitcoin\u2019s usage is now relatively benign, but Bitcoin owes a large debt to the dark web. All cryptocurrencies need a bootstrapping phase before which they don\u2019t offer much security. The dark web brought the initial wave of users and miners into Bitcoin and breathed life into the ecosystem.By most estimates, the GMV of the dark web is over $1B a year. Of course, the dark web is a tiny portion of the overall black markets of the world. But as cryptocurrencies grow in adoption and usability, we\u2019ll see more black markets adopt cryptocurrencies as the standard medium of payment.Though Bitcoin was the first currency to play this role, newer currencies with stronger anonymity-preserving features like Monero and ZCash (and perhaps eventually Mimblewimble) are better positioned to become the de facto currencies of the dark web.Killer App #2: Digital\u00a0GoldMarket size: Trillions+ USDWhat\u2019s blocking this? Volatility, consumer awarenessDepending on who you ask, describing Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d can be taken as an insult or a declaration of victory.This term gets thrown around a lot, but what does it mean for something to be digital gold?The power of analog\u00a0goldGold as a material is not intrinsically useful. Less than 10% of all the gold mined is used for any industrial or manufacturing purpose. Despite that, humans have converged on believing that gold is highly valuable.Why?Putting aside the primitive reasons why humans are attracted to gold, it has several nice economic properties. Gold is hard to mine and new deposits are found infrequently, so its supply undergoes relatively little inflation. Gold also doesn\u2019t tarnish or corrode, so existent gold will remain salable. This leads to minimal price fluctuations, making it appealing as a stable store of value. Furthermore, no market or state actor has a monopoly on gold, so its rises and falls are uncorrelated with any country. For these and other reasons, humans have agreed on gold as the Schelling Point for a static store of value.As this static store of value, gold serves as a hedge against global economic movements. Even as economies rise and fall, gold remains gold, and its movements are largely independent. Thus, for the last several thousand years, gold has served as our globally decentralized store of value. It\u2019s valuable because we all agree to use it that way.But gold, it turns out, is far from the ideal store of value. Gold bars are big and heavy. Gold is expensive to house and guard. It\u2019s difficult to transport. It can be stolen and manipulated. You can easily lie about having gold, or the purity of that gold.Still, a first-world citizen might well ask\u200a\u2014\u200awhat\u2019s the big deal? I can buy some bits of gold if I need to, and if I\u2019m desperate to keep my money safe, I can just deposit my funds into a bank.Why digital gold is so importantMost first-world citizens don\u2019t grasp just how much of the world does not have either 1) secure banking infrastructure, or 2) functioning gold markets. When your currency is inflating due to governmental instability, when currency controls prevent you from divesting from the volatile local currency, when the banking infrastructure is too weak to trust local banks, and when the state is corrupt or incompetent, one of the few ways to secure your wealth is to invest it in gold. And in a lot of places, that\u2019s very difficult to do safely.For many of my software developer friends who\u2019ve only ever lived in the United States, it\u2019s hard to imagine having such a deep mistrust of one\u2019s government or economy.If you use human development index (HDI) as a proxy for what portion of the world is highly-developed, the UN lists about 50 nations as being in the \u201cvery high human development\u201d category, including the U.S., most of Europe, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. The least developed of these highly-developed economies in currently Kuwait. The highly developed countries in total comprise only 15% of the world\u2019s population.In other words, 85% of the world\u2019s population lives in places less developed than Kuwait. In the US, with a stable currency like the USD, with robust financial infrastructure and layers of technology on top of it (Visa, Paypal, Venmo, etc.), it\u2019s hard to imagine what the value-add of Bitcoin would be. But much of Bitcoin\u2019s value is going to be delivered to the other 85% of the world.Technologists have been chasing after digital gold for a long time. Many schemes have been tried, including e-gold and e-Bullion (both with gold-backed reserves), or DigiCash, which aimed to be a centralized digital currency.They all failed. Bitcoin is the first digital currency to ever truly succeed at this.Isn\u2019t Bitcoin too volatile to replace\u00a0gold?You might argue that a currency that fluctuates by 15% on a normal day cannot possibly replace gold. This is a fair point. Bitcoin has not yet been able to serve as a stable store of value. But Bitcoin does not need to immediately replace gold. For now, it simply needs to complement it.Stability is only one of the many properties that gold serves in a market. For those who require stability, stablecoins like Tether, BitUSD, or the upcoming Basecoin can satisfy that niche. Five or ten years from now, after the hype and speculation simmer down and Bitcoin becomes a boringly well-understood financial asset, its price will stabilize.In fact, as Chris Burniske points out, Bitcoin is already about as volatile as oil, and less volatile than many S&P 500 equities.Bitcoin is now about 5\u20136 times more volatile than gold, and the gap is gradually closing.Still, you might hear this and assume this is speculation. Bitcoin cannot yet act as digital gold, but people are buying it hoping it one day will.I\u2019d argue there are several reasons why, even with its volatility, Bitcoin is already a very effective form of digital gold.Why Bitcoin serves as digital\u00a0goldFirst, Bitcoin\u2019s value is not dependent on any nation-state or any economy. In fact, Bitcoin has been shown to be almost entirely uncorrelated with any other asset class, including gold itself.Second, Bitcoin can be acquired and traded from anywhere in the world, regardless of local markets and banking infrastructure. This is key to being an effective destination for capital flight.These first two points could describe most cryptocurrencies, but there\u2019s a third and larger point that comes out in favor of Bitcoin in particular: Bitcoin, like gold, is very resistant to change.Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has seen surprisingly little innovation or evolution since its invention in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. While protocols like Ethereum and Ripple have undergone significant and enterprising pivots in their roadmaps, Bitcoin and its community are ideologically committed to maintaining something close to its original design.Take Bitcoin\u2019s spectral creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. After single-handedly inventing and coding the first version of the Bitcoin protocol, Satoshi disappeared from the Bitcoin world in 2010. His absence imbues an almost religious reverence around the technology\u2019s initial specification, and many Bitcoiners are devoted to its technological immutability. This is furthered by the political deadlock among miners, developers, and users, who are all opposed to any of the other parties changing the balance of power.Bitcoin also has a stable roadmap for inflation and is mined at a predictable rate. It always produces on average one block every ten minutes. In almost all ways, Bitcoin is predictable. This is ideal for something to serve as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Gold, by its nature, is predictable and doesn\u2019t change.Bitcoin has the most hashing power, and so is the most secure cryptocurrency. It\u2019s the most universal, the most liquid, the most ubiquitous, and has the smallest price movements of all cryptocurrencies (some stablecoins aside). It\u2019s also the simplest, and has the most brand awareness\u200a\u2014\u200aboth great properties for gold.As a payments layer, Bitcoin is slow, expensive, and unscalable. But if Bitcoin is to serve as digital gold, that doesn\u2019t matter. Bitcoin being hard to move around encourages people to treat it like gold. Almost all of the political and economic characteristics of Bitcoin make it the natural cryptocurrency to fill this niche.And it already does. In many jurisdictions, if someone wants to hedge against their local economy, escape currency controls, divest from a collapsing currency, or just commit some good old-fashioned tax evasion, Bitcoin is the most natural way to do it.Beyond economicsI\u2019ve often heard the argument: but gold is more than just the sum of its economic properties. There is a narrative valence around gold. Gold is the metal of kings, of legendary palaces, of ancient riches.Unlike Bitcoin, nobody needs to explain why gold is valuable. You don\u2019t need to round up bankers to expensive conferences and give them presentations on why gold is a good store of value. Gold is simple. Bitcoin is complicated. So in the long run, the argument goes, Bitcoin can never replace gold.This is nonsense.It\u2019s true that the stories we tell matter. But those stories can change. On the island of Yap the Yapese decided that large stone disks would be their store of value. Eventually, after the introduction of modern currencies, the Rai stones fell mostly out of use, and they now primarily transact with US dollar bills. Stories don\u2019t win over everything. Eventually, raw utility supplants tradition.Furthermore, gold has not always been as stable or as valuable as it is now. Oil once had the same physical aura and narrative valence as gold, but as other commodities started to overtake its utility, it became less valuable.If Bitcoin is a serious improvement over gold and starts to displace its role, the market will respond and re-price accordingly.I\u2019ll grant this though: gold\u2019s simplicity is a great feature. But Bitcoin is likewise the simplest cryptocurrency. You can explain the intuitions behind Bitcoin to any captive high schooler who has a basic grasp of probability and a moderate attention span. Bitcoin is also simple in that it can\u2019t do a lot. Its programmability is stunted at best, but this is just fine for a store of value.But this argument against technically complex money is ultimately a fallacy. Take credit cards.The first plastic credit card was issued in 1958. The magnetic stripe was introduced in 1970. By the mid-70s credit cards were totally pedestrian and ubiquitous in American society. How many people who transact with credit cards can explain what magnetism even is? Forget about knowing how their credit scores work.If a technology sufficiently improves over the status quo, people will habituate to it. In 2007, smartphones were exotic, futuristic gadgets. Ten years later, they\u2019re just a pedestrian necessity of modern life. If Bitcoin is cheaper, easier, and more ubiquitous, it will follow the same course\u200a\u2014\u200apeople will shrug it off the way they shrug off all the amazing technology that goes into their smartphone or their credit card.To the digital native of the future, Bitcoin wallets will probably seem more natural than vaults full of useless metals painstakingly drilled out of the earth.How does Bitcoin size up to the gold market right\u00a0now?Gold is a 3\u20136 trillion dollar market depending on how you do the accounting, and its daily trading volume is between 70 and 200 billion dollars per day. Let\u2019s use the most conservative sizing of 3T market cap, and 70B dollars a day.On January 1st this year, Bitcoin was at 0.5% of gold\u2019s market cap, and its trading volume was 0.1% of gold\u2019s trading volume. Today, Bitcoin is 3.3% of gold by market cap, and 3.1% of its trading volume.This trend will likely continue. And I suspect that once Bitcoin starts to seriously gain on gold, four things will happen.Nation states will panic and increase their backlash against cryptocurrencies.Gold markets will start to fall.There will be increased attempts to regulate Bitcoin to protect the interests of gold holders.Bitcoin will stop being taken seriously as a contender for the blockchain payments layer.(Of course, my guess is as good as anyone\u2019s and I\u2019m far from an expert, so take this all with a healthy serving of salt.)Killer App #3: Payments (macro and\u00a0micro)Market size: Hundreds of billions USDWhat\u2019s blocking this? Adoption, ease of use, scalingSo long as cryptocurrencies require their users to have impeccable key management, blockchains can\u2019t solve the peer-to-peer payments problem. Dark web regulars might be able to take the time and risk to navigate all the technical complexity. But for blockchains to work in the above-ground economy, you need more than theoretical security\u200a\u2014\u200ayou need actual, in-the-wild security. Money needs to be so easy to use that the average person on the street won\u2019t fuck it up and expose themselves to danger.Right now, most people are far below that level of technical competence. Until that happens or we can figure out a good abstraction layer, cryptocurrencies will not be tenable for a consumer peer-to-peer payments system.Parallel to this, many economies are making big leaps forward in the ease of traditional payments. Look at Venmo in the U.S., M-Pesa in Africa, or AliPay and WeChat Pay in China. Traditional fintech is moving fast enough that its advances will easily overtake blockchain in the short to medium term on this front.In both adoption and ease of use, cryptocurrencies are far behind the traditional banking system. But there are two use cases where cryptocurrencies are far ahead.International paymentsSay I want to send $20,000 to a vendor in India. To transfer this amount of money, I would need to perform a bank wire (which usually costs ~$50 in fees), wait several days for all of the cogs of the banking infrastructure to grind through the transaction, until it finally arrives in India. On top of this, our respective banks may charge their own unfavorable rates for exchanging between currencies. And this is assuming that everything works as expected.Alternatively, I could send the vendor $20,000 worth of Ether in one transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. On an average day, the transaction would be finalized on the blockchain in less than 10 minutes, and the transaction fees would be around 50 cents. Note that Ethereum is not a blockchain that\u2019s optimized for payments, so both the latency and the transaction fee could be orders of magnitude lower.In terms of simplicity, speed, and transaction fees, blockchains are without peer when it comes to international payments. There are still regulatory and technical problems that get in the way of mass adoption, but a lot of what\u2019s standing in the way is simply knowledge, trust, and the optics of transacting in cryptocurrencies.The other area of payments where blockchains are moving far ahead of the competition is in micropayments.MicropaymentsWith traditional financial networks (taking Visa as the canonical example), any monetary transfer incurs fees of at least 20 cents. This means it\u2019s infeasible to transact any amount less than 20 cents, and at 50 cents, a seller would be sacrificing 40% of their revenue to Visa.This renders most micropayment schemes untenable on traditional payments networks. A lot of otherwise innovative business models are simply ruled out. What if you wanted to create a blogging service that charged 25c to read past the fold? Tough luck\u200a\u2014\u200aafter payment processing fees, it wouldn\u2019t be worth the HTML it was printed on.There has been one nominal solution for this: namely, maintaining an internal ledger. This is what advertising companies do. Google might pay you a cent for someone clicking through an ad on your website, but it\u2019s not going to directly pay you that cent\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead, it marks down that cent in its internal database, and then settles up with you on a monthly basis.This is really just micro-accounting. True micro-payments would imply that I don\u2019t need an account with the New York Times, I can just pay for an article without ever signing in or having a long-term subscription.Blockchains can solve this problem. Take Dash, a cryptocurrency optimized for payments. It currently features median transaction fees of 1\u20133 cents, with an average block time of 3 seconds. With Dash, a 25 cent fee per article would mean only 10% of the revenue would go to transaction fees. (I have many reservations about Dash, but it does demonstrate the potential of a payments-optimized currency.)With Bitcoin or Ethereum, Lightning Network and state channels can get us closer to the dream of true micro-payments. There\u2019s quite a bit more complexity to making these work, so we\u2019re probably at least a couple years away from building all the requisite infrastructure and developer tools. For more about Lightning Network and how it works, check out this blog post.Banks on\u00a0defenseThere are a lot of experiments going on in this space, and it\u2019ll be a while before we\u2019ll know how they shake out. But make no mistake of it: banks are afraid. They can see the marauders coming over the hill and the catapults being wheeled slowly behind them.Banks may be able to protect their market share if they adopt blockchains. Already many banks are experimenting with Ripple, R3, Hyperledger, and other blockchain solutions to improve their clearing times and lower fees. But cryptocurrencies are preparing to launch an all-out attack against the market share of traditional banks, and the banks have woken up to this. A battle is coming, and it won\u2019t be bloodless.It\u2019s going to be an interesting next few years.Killer App #4: TokenizationMarket size:\u00a0???What\u2019s blocking this? Regulation, legal frameworksNick Szabo first coined the term \u201csmart contract\u201d in 1996. It would be 19 years later in Ethereum, the first Turing-complete smart contracts platform, that smart contracts would reach their potential.Many Ethereum proponents claim that with the advent of smart contracts, the writing is on the wall for traditional commerce. Supposedly everything will become decentralized, rent-seeking oligopolies will be abolished, and before we know it, the entire world will be mediated by smart contracts.For now, you can rest assured this is science fiction. Smart contract schemes can be postulated for just about anything, but in most domains there are still glaring problems. The users aren\u2019t there, the UX isn\u2019t there, the scaling isn\u2019t there, the incentives aren\u2019t there, the regulation isn\u2019t there, and even if they all were\u200a\u2014\u200ain most cases, the value proposition is tenuous. Most people just don\u2019t care about the benefits of smart contracts or decentralization. For most problems, blockchain is more of a hindrance than a help.Though there\u2019s much innovation in this space, it\u2019s all highly experimental, and killer use cases for smart contracts have yet to be proven.The one exception to this is tokenization.Tokenization is the killer app of\u00a0EthereumEthereum was the first currency to democratize ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings). Creating a new digital token has become as easy as copy and pasting a smart contract, fiddling with a few variables, and deploying it into the blockchain.(Some say if you listen closely enough, you can hear a new shitcoin being born every minute.)AWS is to the web app as Ethereum is to the token. And while this has enabled a great Renaissance of technological speculation (read: ICO bubble), one would be wise to disentangle the medium from the message.The pro-token argument is somewhat subtle, and it has many detractors. Let me first lay out the case, and then the best arguments against it (looking at you, Preston Byrne).First, what do we mean by tokenization?There are two kinds of tokenization: protocol tokenization and asset tokenization.Protocol TokenizationConsider BitTorrent.I\u2019m guessing most of you have used BitTorrent before. To be clear, BitTorrent is not an application\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a protocol, which all BitTorrent clients implement. Specifically, BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer protocol that allows users to obtain files from a swarm of other peers. While you download files, you also upload the chunks you\u2019ve already downloaded. And if you\u2019re a good user, after you\u2019re done downloading you\u2019ll continue to upload, which pays the bandwidth forward to other users.There\u2019s an obvious weakness in this protocol\u200a\u2014\u200athe free rider problem. Someone can download less than they upload and refuse to pay it forward. BitTorrent\u2019s solution to this is\u2026\u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t really have one. It tries to throttle the download speed of free riders, but this doesn\u2019t work very well. Some torrenters tried to solve this problem by creating invite-only communities with persistent reputation, but most users prefer to use BitTorrent in total anonymity. Without any incentives around the exchange of bandwidth, BitTorrent is vulnerable to this tragedy of the commons. If BitTorrent functions well, it\u2019s only because its citizens happen to be well-behaved.Good will doesn\u2019t\u00a0scaleThomas Hobbes long ago predicted that to make a society function at massive scale, you need the right incentives in place.Traditionally, we have used a Leviathan to enforce these incentives. By propping up a central authority (usually the state, or in BitTorrent\u2019s case, a centralized identity service), you can force each actor in a system to behave\u200a\u2014\u200aother than the Leviathan itself, of course.Modern democratic theory arose in response to precisely this problem: given that you need a central authority to enforce incentives, how can you prevent that authority from itself becoming corrupt and misbehaving? By default, each actor\u2019s incentive is to exploit its own power. So we invented elections, we invented constitutions, we invented checks and balances and impeachment proceedings. We did all this to try to cage the Leviathan, to prevent the inevitable drift of central authorities toward corruption and rent-seeking.Up until now, central authorities are the best solution we\u2019ve come up with to this problem.But protocol tokens may now change that. They may offer us a new way to solve incentive alignment problems.Protocol tokens, such as Filecoin, serve as an intra-protocol incentive scheme. By calibrating the incentives and how they align with the token, you can create a protocol just like BitTorrent where instead of merely hoping users do the right thing, you pay them to do the right thing. And instead of hoping users aren\u2019t assholes, you charge them money to be assholes.By programmatically aligning incentives and creating the right payoff matrix, a protocol can use economics and game theory to incent users toward the desired protocol behavior. Design the incentives right, and almost magically, everything falls into place and the economy runs smoothly. No central authority required, no checks or balances, no elections or impeachments, no laws or courts. The incentives simply work without them.(The analogy I\u2019m making between pay-to-play BitTorrent and Filecoin is a loose one, but nevertheless instructive.)Decentralized regulationThe purpose of most regulation is to tweak incentives such that a system behaves in a way that\u2019s globally optimal. But normal regulation is enforced by humans, and is therefore mutable. If a company bribes or cajoles its regulators, regulators will often look the other way. And if a company has enough money or political clout, it can lobby for those regulations to be overturned.Decentralized regulation is immune to regulatory capture or political pressure. Normal regulators can be bribed or bullied by monopoly powers, but decentralized regulation is built into the code.And crucially, decentralized regulation can be mathematically examined for its soundness. Real-world regulation is much harder to analyze\u200a\u2014\u200aits specifications are fuzzy, and its thousands of edge cases must be expensively adjudicated in courts of law.Economists have long day-dreamed about problems that could be solved by market mechanisms. The laboratory has been opened, and by simply issuing a coin and a few rules, you are free to run your own cryptoeconomic experiment.So this is the first kind of tokenization. It\u2019s real, and almost everyone who understands it can see that it\u2019s a big idea. It might be a long ways away before it becomes mainstream. But there\u2019s a good chance that the successor of the web will be accessed via a digital token.Asset TokenizationThe second form of tokenization, asset tokenization, is the process of taking a traditionally illiquid asset and transforming it into fungible shares on a blockchain. Those shares can be traded on a trustless marketplace to enable their liquidity.When you hear this, you should be skeptical. As Preston Byrne points out, you can already do all of that\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s called IPOing then issuing shares on a stock exchange. What\u2019s the value-add of doing this on a blockchain?Obviously, there already exist centralized exchanges like the NYSE that enable trading of \u201ctokenized assets,\u201d i.e., shares of company stock.That said, it\u2019s very expensive to get listed on the NYSE (the average company incurs about $3.7M to get listed). Foreign investors have to jump through expensive hoops to invest in American assets, and vice versa. There are large regulatory and legal barriers here which prevent the free flow of capital. (Granted, most of these barriers exist for good reasons. But there are also layers of waste and rent-seeking that have accrued on most of these processes.)(One glaring example of this is GBTC, a publicly traded Bitcoin investment vehicle\u200a\u2014\u200aessentially a trust that holds Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is twice as expensive to purchase as just buying the equivalent Bitcoins directly.)There are also many types of assets that cannot be traded through these exchanges. With stock markets, we have invented schemes to divide a company into fungible shares and trade them openly on markets. But we have yet to do so with real estate, fine art, or other assets generally considered to be valuable or value-producing.Preston Byrne argues: well, effectively what you\u2019re saying is that \u201ctokenization onto a blockchain allows you to break securities laws.\u201d That\u2019s hardly an innovation so much as a circumvention.This I grant. But there are other benefits to tokenized assets, for which decentralization is the prerequisite.The benefits of decentralized token\u00a0marketsThe first benefit is that with a decentralized, tokenized market, you no longer need to trust any central intermediary. If you live in a country where your state institutions and financial infrastructure are weak or corrupt, then so long as you have access to the Internet, you\u2019ll be able to participate in a robust and liquid global market for tokenized assets.The second reason is that there are major startup costs to creating a well-functioning marketplace.Here\u2019s a toy example: consider FarmVille. FarmVille has many in-game assets\u200a\u2014\u200amoney, in-game items, whatever. Those assets live squarely in Zynga\u2019s databases. Presumably FarmVille players value these assets, so buyers and sellers would willingly engage in a marketplace for them.However, to enable that marketplace, Zynga would have to invest in building and managing an exchange that integrates with its database. In reality, Zynga doesn\u2019t want this for PR and regulatory reasons\u200a\u2014\u200abut let\u2019s ignore that for the moment. Even if they wanted to build it, creating this fully-featured exchange would be significant engineering work.That\u2019s just FarmVille. There are thousands of games like this that have fervent demand for in-game assets, but for each of them to have a functioning marketplace, each gaming company would have to reduplicate the efforts to build a secure and feature-complete exchange. And if any such company builds their exchange insecurely, or decides that it\u2019s no longer in the company\u2019s interest to maintain it, the exchange would go down and the asset-holders would ultimately eat the cost of illiquidity.A blockchain solves these problems. If you issue your assets as a token on a blockchain to begin with, then you inherit an enormous shared infrastructure for managing and maintaining markets. Assuming you use a common token specification like ERC20, then you can use smart contracts to easily create financial deals or instruments across different tokens, trustlessly atomically swap them, create simple escrow contracts, or use an automatic price discovery mechanism like Bancor to bootstrap liquidity. Exchanges could seamlessly list your tokens and allow anyone to purchase it with any other token with just a few lines of code. And with blockchain-based insurance, eventually you may be able to take out a loan for a car based on your portfolio of digital assets.We could call this whole suite of abilities a financial infrastructure as a service, created at no cost to the issuer, maintained entirely by the blockchain.These benefits further improve liquidity and market depths. When users trust that your exchange won\u2019t be shut down or censored (either by a state or by a company whose interests are no longer served) both buyers and sellers will be confident in trading the asset, and users will be more motivated to acquire it.When Peter McKeon lays these arguments out in his essay, he notes that most assets gain a 25% increase in value from being liquid. This is an enormous gain for the many illiquid assets in the global economy.Asset tokenization is a big deal, as are protocol tokens. Of course, there are a many problems we have to figure out before we can get there (both technical and regulatory), so we\u2019re likely several years away before these fully bear fruit. But if enough builders align to push them forward, these two forms of tokenization will lead to massive value creation.To summarizeI argue that the four killer apps of cryptocurrencies are 1) dark web and black market payments, 2) digital gold, 3) macro/micro payments, and 4) tokenization. If the recent surge of cryptocurrency market cap to 170B+ struck you as unbelievable, I hope after reading this, it will make more sense.That said, I don\u2019t want to disregard the other exciting ideas in this space. There are many promising applications that may prove to be killer apps on blockchains\u200a\u2014\u200asocial networks that pay their participants (Earn.com (which I\u2019m working on right now\u2014formerly 21.co), Steemit), decentralized prediction markets (Gnosis, Augur), decentralized storage networks (Filecoin, Maidsafe, Sia), to name just a few.This space is full of innovation and moving extremely fast. But if history is any indication, it\u2019s likely that the largest killer app for blockchains is going to be something no one yet expects.That\u2019s all from me.

And if there is a theme that emerged in the testimony, it is the significant role that big data analytics play in business success.It is no wonder that a good number of the world largest corporations including Facebook, Google, and Twitter are in the business of selling marketing insights. One area of big data analytics that has recently attracted a lot of attention from corporations, politicians, and government agencies in sentiment analysis.This method involves analyzing comments and suggestions left on social media sites and identifying their attitude towards a brand by using variables such as emotion, tone, and context. While the number of likes and followers a business gains on social media are essential, it is the users\u2019 reactions towards the brand or the product that counts. Firms must, therefore, understand the emotional and logical responses of their target audience to be able to market to them effectively.Sentiment analysis gives businesses insights to better understand the language of their target audiences and adjust their products and marketing approach accordingly. Politicians use it to understand what interests a specific voting bloc and create political campaigns to match their interests accordingly.While there is no doubt that big data analytics including sentiment analysis are of vital importance to businesses in this age of IoT, they aren\u2019t affordable to all. However, with blockchain, SMBs can now leverage big data analytics without having to worry about costs or compliance.For instance, SENNO, a Neo based platform, is the first combining blockchain and Artificial Neural Networks in sentiment analysis, allowing businesses to tap into the data at lower costs. Using this platform, businesses don\u2019t have to incur the costs of setting up big data infrastructure. They just need to connect to the SENNO network through an API, and and the sentiment analysis is done for them.Apart from lowering implementation costs, the project seeks to help businesses become compliant with big data regulatory requirements. In May this year, a new and very stringent big data regulation known as the GDPR will come into effect, impacting how businesses in Europe and all over the world collect and manage their users\u2019 data. The compliance is expected to be very costly, effectively locking out firms without the resources to comply out of the big data analytics game.However, with blockchain tech, businesses will be able to to enjoy big data\u2019s fruits at a lower cost and with all it\u2019s advantages. When it comes to data protection, blockchain offers the most advanced solutions as it applies encryption and hashing to protect data and is not easy to hack given its distributed nature. The only problem with the blockchain in relation to the GDPR is that data stored on it is not erasable.Nevertheless, with the rate at which blockchain tech is developing, there is no doubt that a solution to this challenge will be found.Either way, businesses tapping into blockchain solutions have nothing to worry about given that the burden of compliance is no longer on their shoulders. Also, with new solutions being developed, businesses will soon be able to leverage the power of AI without incurring the enormous costs involved in setting up and implementing an independent AI strategy.In marketing, artificial neural networks are involved to gather and extract actionable insights from big data. The best thing about these networks is that they can learn from data and therefore increase accuracy with time. In sentiment analysis, neural networks are responsible for identifying and classifying emotions in texts, therefore, enabling targeted marketing. As blockchain solutions for big data analytics continue to develop, SMBs will be able to use them to gain a competitive edge.", "responses": "276"}, {"title": "How does blockchain really work?

I built an app to show\u00a0you.Sean HanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 4, 2017According to Wikipedia, a blockchain is:A distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called\u00a0blocks.That sounds nice, but how does it work?To illustrate a blockchain, we will use an open source command-line interface called Blockchain CLI.I also built a browser-based version of this here.Installing the Command-Line Interface versionIf you haven\u2019t already, install Node.js.Then run the following in your terminal:# Clone this repository$ git clone https://github.com/seanseany/blockchain-cli# Go into the repository$ cd blockchain-cli# Install dependencies$ npm install# Run the app$ npm startYou should see \ud83d\udc4b Welcome to Blockchain CLI!and a blockchain \u2192 prompt ready to take commands.What does a block look\u00a0like?To see your current blockchain, enter blockchain or bc into the command prompt. You should see a block like the image below.A block on the blockchainIndex (Block #): Which block is it? (Genesis block has index 0)Hash: Is the block valid?Previous Hash: Is the previous block valid?Timestamp: When was the block added?Data: What information is stored on the block?Nonce: How many iterations did we go through before we found a valid block?Genesis BlockEvery blockchain will start with the\ud83c\udfc6 Genesis Block. As you will see later, each block on the blockchain is dependent on the previous block. So, the Genesis block is needed to mine our first block.What happens when a new block is\u00a0mined?Let\u2019s mine our first block. Enter mine freeCodeCamp\u2665\ufe0e into the prompt.The blockchain looks at the latest block on the blockchain for the index and previous hash. In this case Genesis block is the latest block.Index: o+1 = 1Previous Hash: 0000018035a828da0\u2026Timestamp: When the block is addedData: freeCodeCamp\u2764Hash:\u00a0??Nonce:\u00a0??How is the hash calculated?A hash value is a numeric value of a fixed length that uniquely identifies data.The hash is calculated by taking the index, previous block hash, timestamp, block data, and nonce as input.CryptoJS.SHA256(index + previousHash + timestamp + data + nonce)The SHA256 algorithm will calculate a unique hash, given those inputs. The same inputs will always return the same hash.Did you notice the four leading 0\u2019s in the block\u00a0hash?The four leading 0\u2019s is a minimum requirement for a valid hash. The number of leading 0\u2019s required is called difficulty.function isValidHashDifficulty(hash, difficulty) {  for (var i = 0, b = hash.length; i < b; i ++) {      if (hash[i] !== '0') {          break;      }  }  return i >= difficulty;}This is also known as the Proof-of-Work system.What\u2019s a\u00a0nonce?A nonce is a number used to find a valid hash.let nonce = 0;let hash;let input;while(!isValidHashDifficulty(hash)) {       nonce = nonce + 1;  input = index + previousHash + timestamp + data + nonce;  hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(input)}The nonce iterates until the hash is valid. In our case, a valid hash has at least four leading 0\u2019s. The process of finding a nonce that corresponds to a valid hash is mining.As the difficulty increases, the number of possible valid hashes decreases. With less possible valid hashes, it takes more processing power to find a valid hash.Why does this\u00a0matter?It matters because it keeps the blockchain immutable.If we have the following blockchain A \u2192 B \u2192 C, and someone wants to change data on Block A. This is what happens:Data changes on Block A.Block A\u2019s hash changes because data is used to calculate the hash.Block A becomes invalid because its hash no longer has four leading 0\u2019s.Block B\u2019s hash changes because Block A\u2019s hash was used to calculate Block B\u2019s hash.Block B becomes invalid because its hash no longer has four leading 0's.Block C\u2019s hash changes because Block B\u2019s hash was used to calculate Block C\u2019s hash.Block C becomes invalid because its hash no longer has four leading 0's.The only way to mutate a block would be to mine the block again, and all the blocks after. Since new blocks are always being added, it\u2019s nearly impossible to mutate the blockchain.I hope this tutorial was helpful for you!If you would like to checkout a web version of the demo, head on over to http://blockchaindemo.io", "responses": "114"}, {"title": "How Blockchain is Taking Gaming to a Whole New\u00a0Level", "author_name": "Samuel Miller", "link": "https://medium.com/aerum-technologies/how-blockchain-is-taking-gaming-to-a-whole-new-level-5de0eb10256?source=search_post---------9", "post_date": "Oct 23, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "14K", "content": "How Blockchain is Taking Gaming to a Whole New\u00a0LevelSamuel MillerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 23, 2018Blockchain technology encompasses so much more than just cryptocurrencies these days. And while these currencies are by far blockchain\u2019s most famous use case, the potential for blockchain far, far exceeds a straightforward transfer of value.The gaming industry, for example, has always been fairly controversial due to a range of issues. Many players feel particularly worried about the protection of their data, fraudulent activities, high fees, and most of all, unfair and hidden odds.In these cases, P2P doesn\u2019t just mean peer-to-peer; it means player-to-player. As with the other P2P industries that blockchain is disrupting, such as FinTech, there are already plenty of ways in which blockchain technology is being applied to resolve these issues and many more of the challenges faced by the gaming industry. Here are just a few.Reducing fraudThe gaming industry suffers a lot from online fraud. One of the main advantages of blockchain technology is that it enables highly secure data encryption. What\u2019s more, all of it is entirely accessible and transparent to the player. In other words, blockchain is a for game changer for venues such as online casinos, lotteries, and virtually anything which relies on random number generation.On top of this, hackers will have particularly hard time, if it is even possible, to destroy a decentralized blockchain network, making sure gamer data stays safe. This is an inherent feature of distributed ledger technology whereby nodes in the ledger maintain the distributed databases in a shared manner, and each node has the complete information in the entire database.Making In-Game Purchases a Lot\u00a0EasierIn-game purchases are particularly popular and are currently one of the main ways for game developers to monetize their growing user base, keeping them in business and keeping players playing.Allowing players to purchase in-game assets using a dedicated cryptocurrency eliminates the intermediaries and delays. In other words, players will be able to purchase their in-game items instantly, and at a reduced cost.Unique Interoperable Player\u00a0ProfilesIf the game is developed on the blockchain, its players will be able to take their unique public address from one game to another. This means that they will be able to transact with their cryptocurrencies across different games from the same public address.This creates incredible flexibility and cross-platform interoperability which far exceeds the capabilities and constraints of existing centralized solutions.Total Asset OwnershipIn the majority of the existing gaming solutions, the players don\u2019t really own their in-game purchases. A distinct benefit of blockchain games is that they allow players to truly hold ownership of their assets by using smart contracts in order to govern in-game transactions.These smart contracts are executed automatically upon fulfilling the pre-set conditions and, as with any other smart contract, the results cannot be reversed.In other words, when you launch a blockchain-powered game, all of the in-game assets that the users have bought through smart contracts are immediately transferred to their public address. Another distinct benefit here is that these smart contracts allow for full transparency and every player can easily take a look at the implied rules.AERUM: A Blockchain Fit for the ChallengeOne of the biggest challenges faced by blockchain gaming is speed. The majority of the existing networks are just too slow for serious gaming. Take a real world example: in a real-time multiplayer game, even a very simple action can easily trigger a cascade of state changes. But because existing blockchains are too slow, even this simple action can take a serious toll on the frame-rate because every single state change has to be verified on the blockchain.Here\u2019s where AERUM comes in.AERUM\u2019s network is blazing fast. Compared to the competition, AERUM provides incredibly high-performance with a quick 2 second block time and real-time transaction execution in less than 5 seconds.The network also delivers virtually unlimited, on-demand scalability being able to handle 500 to 100,000+ transactions-per-second. It is 100% compatible with the industry forerunner Ethereum, while, at the same time offering 25x better throughput. AERUM also features end-to-end integration with Ethereum, guaranteeing easy and secure transfers thanks to cross-chain atomic swaps.You can read more about the AERUM network on its official website or stay tuned on the project\u2019s Facebook or Twitter page.

However, it is easy to get mixed up as usually when we talk about blockchains we also talk about the problems we are trying to solve with them. This is the case in the popular blockchain-based projects such as Bitcoin and Ethereum\u00a0. The term \u201cblockchain\u201d is usually strongly tied to concepts like transactions, smart contracts or cryptocurrencies.This makes understanding blockchains a necessarily harder task, than it must be. Especially source-code-wisely. Here I will go through a super-simple blockchain I implemented in 200 lines of Javascript called NaiveChain.Block structureThe first logical step is to decide the block structure. To keep things as simple as possible we include only the most necessary: index, timestamp, data, hash and previous hash.The hash of the previous block must be found in the block to preserve the chain integrityBlock hashThe block needs to be hashed to keep the integrity of the data. A SHA-256 is taken over the content of the block. It should be noted that this hash has nothing to do with \u201cmining\u201d, since there is no Proof Of Work problem to solve.Generating a\u00a0blockTo generate a block we must know the hash of the previous block and create the rest of the required content (= index, hash, data and timestamp). Block data is something that is provided by the end-user.Storing the\u00a0blocksA in-memory Javascript array is used to store the blockchain. The first block of the blockchain is always a so-called \u201cgenesis-block\u201d, which is hard coded.Validating the integrity of\u00a0blocksAt any given time we must be able to validate if a block or a chain of blocks are valid in terms of integrity. This is true especially when we receive new blocks from other nodes and must decide whether to accept them or not.Choosing the longest\u00a0chainThere should always be only one explicit set of blocks in the chain at a given time. In case of conflicts (e.g. two nodes both generate block number 72) we choose the chain that has the longest number of blocks.Communicating with other\u00a0nodesAn essential part of a node is to share and sync the blockchain with other nodes. The following rules are used to keep the network in sync.When a node generates a new block, it broadcasts it to the networkWhen a node connects to a new peer it querys for the latest blockWhen a node encounters a block that has an index larger than the current known block, it either adds the block the its current chain or querys for the full blockchain.Some typical communication scenarios that follows when the nodes obey the described protocolNo automatic peer discovery is used. The location (=URLs) of peers must be manually added.Controlling the\u00a0nodeThe user must be able to control the node in some way. This is done by setting up a HTTP server.As seen, the user is able to interact with the node in the following ways:List all blocksCreate a new block with a content given by the userList or add peersThe most straightforward way to control the node is e.g. with Curl:#get all blocks from the nodecurl http://localhost:3001/blocksArchitectureIt should be noted that the node actually exposes two web servers: One for the user to control the node (HTTP server) and one for the peer-to-peer communication between the nodes.(Websocket HTTP server)The main components of NaiveChainConlusionsThe NaiveChain was created for demonstration and learning purposes. Since it does not have a \u201cmining\u201d algorithm (PoS of PoW) it cannot used in a public network. It nonetheless implements the basic features for a functioning blockchain.You can check the Github repository for more technical details.If you want to understand more about blockchains, I suggest you to check out Naivecoin: a tutorial for building a cryptocurrency.

It allows value exchange without the need for trust or a central authority. Imagine you and I bet $50 on tomorrow\u2019s weather in San Francisco. I bet it will be sunny, you that it will rain. Today we have three options to manage this transaction:We can trust each other. Rainy or sunny, the loser will give $50 to the winner. If we are friends, this could be a good way of managing it. However, friends or strangers, one can easily not pay the other.We can turn the bet into a contract. With a contract in place both parties will be more prone to pay. However, should either of the two decide not to pay, the winner will have to pay additional money to cover legal expenses and the court case might take a long time. Especially for a small amount of cash, this doesn\u2019t seem like the optimal way to manage the transaction.We can involve a neutral third party. Each of us gives $50 to a third party, who will give the total amount to the winner. But hey, she could also run away with all our money. So we end up with one of the first two options: trust or contract.Neither trust nor contract is an optimal solution: We can\u2019t trust strangers, and enforcing a contract requires time and money. The blockchain technology is interesting because it offers us a third option which is secure, quick, and cheap.Blockchain allows us to write a few lines of code, a program running on the blockchain, to which both of us send $50. This program will keep the $100 safe and check tomorrow\u2019s weather automatically on several data sources. Sunny or rainy, it will automatically transfer the whole amount to the winner. Each party can check the contract logic, and once it\u2019s running on the blockchain it can\u2019t be changed or stopped.

You can find the link to the follow up article at the end of this article.Everyone is talking about Bitcoin these days, from your barber to your friends working at stock market. Don\u2019t worry this article is not about several other articles talking about making money from Bitcoin. However, I will try to help you understand the underlying technology which makes Bitcoin work and how this concept of blockchain can be useful in the coming decades.Historical OverviewOctober 31, 2008, a white paper from an anonymous person or organization named Satoshi Nakamoto was published which explained a novel approach to send money from sender to receiver directly without involving any financial intermediaries. The paper gave a name to this concept\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin. Since, Bitcoin uses some underlying concepts of cryptography, this new way of exchanging money was categorized as cryptocurrency. The only purpose of Bitcoin was for financial transactions but researchers realized that its foundational technology can be harvested to build other secure and robust applications that can revolutionize the way current systems work. \u201cBlockchain\u201d was the name given to this foundational technology. Lots of technical words? Let\u2019s simplify!What is Blockchain?\u200a\u2014\u200aA Real World\u00a0AnalogyLet\u2019s imagine that you live in a city, which has a big parking space to park 200 cars at one time (assume that the parking space just has a ground floor). This parking space has a main gate which stays locked and is only opened when a car moves in or out. Now let\u2019s analyze this single parking building from different points of view \u2014Price: Since some private company built this parking space exclusively for parking purposes and all the maintenance cost will be beared by the owner company, there will be a high renting fee for renting out a single parking space.Security: If thieves get access to the main door, they can easily get to your car (take its wheels, or fuel, or damage the brake, anything!)Limit: What if the number of cars in your city grow from 200 to 300? The parking space will not have enough space for all cars and some other private agency will have to built a new parking space.Trusted: You trust the parking space company and they are responsible for taking care of security and reliability.Centralized: Since all the cars are in one building, we can consider it to be a centralized parking.Now, let\u2019s modify the current scenario. Imagine that there are 200 houses in your city and all 200 houses have two garages each. However, to simplify our explanation, let\u2019s assume each house just has one car (all cars filling up all the slots of big parking space described above). So, each house has one empty garage out of the two garages available. Now, let\u2019s say people of the city decide to rent out the extra garage to anyone who needs a parking. This model of providing parking space will solve the problem of parking 200 cars or more cars (in case people move in and out of the city) without the need of building any central bigger parking space for the entire city. Similar to the previous scenario, let\u2019s analyze this scenario \u2014Price: Since people didn\u2019t built the second garage exclusively for renting purposes and the cost of maintenance will be little, the cost to rent that extra space will be low comparatively to the big central parking spaceSecurity: Each car is locked in a different garage therefore thieves will have to unlock all the garages to get access to the cars, thus providing more security. (Security in blockchain is a bit different but for simplicity let\u2019s consider it this way for now!)Limit: As the number of houses grow, assuming each new house also has extra garage space, the space to keep more cars will keep increasing. Thus, increasing the network of lessee and lessor.Trustless: Since, no central authority controls these distributed parking spaces, we assume that there will be certain rules set by all the participating garage owners for renting out their places.Decentralized: As mentioned in the previous point, these parking spaces are distributed throughout the city, we can consider it to be a decentralized parking.The above analogy provides the foundation for understanding the actual technical infrastructure of the Blockchain.Parking Model to Technical ModelThe parking model presents a very basic overview of Blockchain in some real world language. Now, let\u2019s try to match the components of our parking example to the actual technical model \u2014The big central parking is a centralized system like AWS, Google Cloud etc. (these cloud platforms are also distributed at some level but for the sake of simplicity, we will assume them to be a single entity).The cars are the data and applications.The distributed parking is a decentralized system\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain.Wait! We missed something.All decentralized systems are not Blockchain!! Yes, Blockchain is a particular type of decentralized system that has a unique property. Which property? Let\u2019s talk about it.\u201cBlocks\u201d make BlockchainLet\u2019s revisit our distributed parking example and make a small change. Let\u2019s assume that the lock to a particular garage is generated when a car is parked inside it (we assume that the same car goes to the same parking everyday). Also, assume that we have numbered all the distributed garages in serial order. The lock-key pair of garage #50 is based on the lock-key pair of garage #49 and also on the features (like color, weight, engine number etc.) of the car parked inside garage #50 and this process starts from garage #1 and moves till garage #200 or even more.Each garage\u2019s lock-key pair depends on the garage\u2019s car features and previous garage\u2019s lock-key\u00a0pair.Therefore, if a thief tries to break into garage #49 and modifies any feature of the car, say its color or registration number, the features of car in garage #49 will change which means a new lock-key pair for garage #49 will be generated and since lock-key-pair for garage #50 depends on lock-key pair of garage #49, lock-key pair for garage #50 will also change and same goes on for future garages.Now, let\u2019s make one last assumption that computing a lock-key pair requires lots of computing resources which means if we have to recompute these pairs in case any thief modifies any car feature in any garage, it will be practically impossible to recompute all the pairs again.What happens if a lock-key pair is\u00a0changed?Hope you remember that we talked about all garage owners abiding by some rules? One of these rules is to check for a valid garage. A garage is valid if you can validate its lock-key pair and if any lock-key pair gets changed, the lock-key pairs of all the following garages get invalid because every pair depends on the previous pair. (Process to validate a lock-key pair for a particular garage is very fast as compared to generating one).This dependence of one pair on the previous pair makes it a chain of garages and in technical world, these garages are \u201cblocks\u201d, thus getting its name\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain (a chain of blocks).Blocks in Blockchain are tied to the next block by hashes just like lock-key pairs in our example. Similar to garage example, if data in one block is modified, hashes need to be recalculated for all the following blocks and since calculating the hash is a very resource intensive operation, it gets practically impossible to do that and hence the network rules out the invalidated block. The calculation of hash is called mining and we will talk more about it in the next release of this series.How do the blocks recover from modification?All the computers on the blockchain network, keep a copy of the full blockchain, so if one block or one complete chain at a particular computer or multiple computers is modified, the whole network tries to compare it with their own copies of the full chain.If majority of the nodes (or computers) on the network find that the modified chain is invalid, the modified chain is replaced with valid chain from other nodes. This makes Blockchain vulnerable to 51% attack. In simpler words, if more than 50% of the nodes on the network are malicious (or say have a modified chain), then the whole network can be compromised.ConclusionPhew!! that was a lot of information to digest.

While Satoshi converged a database structure with peer-to-peer networking, cryptographic tokenization, consensus formation algorithms, and game theoretical economic incentivization to create a means for trustless digital storage and transmission of value, the \u201cDigital Gold\u201d use case, is only one use case.Bitcoin as a digital store of value is the least interesting use of blockchain\u00a0\u2026 There, I said it.Far more interesting are programmable money, programmable asset transfer, and shared, tamper-resistant business logic. People fixated on Bitcoin are missing the fact that we\u2019re verging upon the next generation of the world-wide-web.The Bitcoin protocol is the world\u2019s largest modern-day abacus; it only enables us to move a bead (or coin) from one side to the other. The ability to do this on a global, permissionless substrate is not trivial. But I can\u2019t overemphasize the limited scope of this initial design, due to its use of a virtual machine which isn\u2019t Turing-complete.Here\u2019s an example of a Bitcoin script:scriptPubKey: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGscriptSig: <sig> <pubKey>The above script should serve to explain the inherent limitations of the Bitcoin scripting language. Ethereum can be thought of as Bitcoin + everything else, with a high level software language reminiscent of Javascript.While still being able to store and transmit value (the single Bitcoin use case), we\u2019re also able to program our agreements using Ethereum. Here are two examples of typical agreements that are now easily codified using Ethereum\u2019s Solidity programming language.A LoanAn Initial Public Offering or CrowdfundingOur agreements are turning from Microsoft Word documents written by attorneys and recognized by notaries into agreements bound by code, transacting assets that are natively digital.As the Internet commoditized the cost for communication, Ethereum commoditizes our costs of agreement and trust.2. 2018 in blockchain years is the equivalent of 1994 to the 1996 boom of the Internet.Intranets FirstSimilar to the evolution of the Internet that began on private Intranets, permissioned blockchains will give way to the permissionless blockchains once they successfully achieve scalability and privacy.The StackThe next generation of the internet will be a \u201cstack\u201d comprised of: (1) a decentralized transaction layer (the strongest of which I believe to be Ethereum); (2) a decentralized file storage layer (IPFS and Swarm are early leaders); (3) a decentralized messaging layer (Matrix or Whisper are strong candidates); and (4) a high throughput computing resource (Golem is an example of attempting to accomplish this).StandardsAs Jeremy Millar noted at the inception of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, blockchain technologies will be helped tremendously in 2018 through formal standardization processes similar to when Java evolved into Java 2 Enterprise Edition through standardization of database and web API\u2019s to be the most widely used software language on Earth.Consumer Facing ApplicationsEarly use cases of consumer facing Internet applications in the 90\u2019s were gambling, pornography, and games.Interestingly, we\u2019re seeing frontrunners on Ethereum in the same genres with Spankchain, Fun Fair, Virtue Poker, and Crypto Kitties consumer facing applications on Ethereum.3. Ethereum will continue to be the largest blockchain developer ecosystem in 2018 by many multiples.Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers\u2026 you get the point.The ecosystems with the most developers typically win. I don\u2019t see how permissioned blockchains that lack cryptoeconomic incentives will ever stand against public permissionless ecosystems.Ethereum already has a thriving developer community. Truffle, the smart contract developer framework, has 250,000+ developer downloads. Infura, which can be seen as an Akamai for Ethereum and IPFS, now handles over 2 billion requests per day and smoothly scaled to peak at 4.5 billion requests per day one day in December. MetaMask, which brings Ethereum seamlessly to browsers, has over 500,000 active users.4. Blockchain will be a vessel of good.As the world takes note of the societal implications of blockchain technology, we will see an uptick in humanitarian applications in 2018.In 2017 we saw the World Food Program employ Ethereum to distribute 1.4 million food vouchers to 10,500 Syrian refugees in Jordan. And it is aiming for one million transactions, per day. This innovative program, dubbed \u201cBuilding Blocks\u201d, demonstrates how database efficiency will deliver tangible benefits to the most vulnerable. I applaud the World Food Program\u2019s efforts and believe that its success is a sign of great things to come.5. Enterprises will take the training wheels offAs permissionless blockchains continue their scalability and privacy upgrade process, permissioned blockchains will continue to lose the developer mindshare and potentially lose their client base similar to how AOL, Prodigy, and Compuserve services lost out to the Internet. There will be narrow use-cases for intranet-like permissioned blockchains, just as SWIFT never touched the internet, but the long tail will be using permissionless protocols.Intranets were great training wheels, until the Internet was pervasive. The same trajectory will occur with permissioned blockchains in 2018 and beyond.6. Proof of Stake changes the blockchain consensus gameOn New Years Eve \u201917, the Ethereum research team dropped the testnet alpha of Casper, named after the Greediest Heaviest Observed SubTree protocol. All eyes in the blockchain space will be watching the transition of Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake.A proof-of-work consensus algorithm is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a blockchain by requiring some work from the service requester, usually by processing complex equations on a GPU or ASIC computer.In proof-of-stake public blockchains, like Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Casper implementation, a set of validators each bet on blocks they deem likely to be validated, and the weight of each validators vote depends on the size of its deposit. Punishments are levied on bad actors who bet on more than one block at a certain depth or who don\u2019t participate when they are supposed to.Benefits of proof-of-stake include:The ability to reduce the large electricity consumption and hardware costs to secure a blockchain. It is estimated the Bitcoin electric consumption will trend toward equivalent consumption of the country of Denmark by 2020.Due to reduced energy consumption, token issuance isn\u2019t necessarily intrinsic to the securitization of the network. Negative net issuance could occur, whereby tokens are actually burned thereby reducing the supply and increasing value per token.51% attacks become exponentially more expensive, as you risk what you stake. Vlad Zamfir often explains that \u201cif you participate in a failed 51% attack, PoS will burn your ASIC farm down\u201d.7. Token Fever\u200a\u2014\u200aNot so fast on the SAFT.As Earth continues to realize the advantages of natively digital assets for everything (natural resources, fiat, gold, music, loyalty points, Madonna concert tickets, software, real estate, IoT device registration, stocks, electrons, etc.) on global distributed ledgers, regulation will be necessary. Regulators will be empowered to create smart contract software specifications and develop tests that compliant companies must pass.With respect to the tokenization regulatory process, I\u2019m thankful to Marco Santori, Juan Batiz-Benet, and Jesse Clayburgh for taking the first crack at self-regulation through the SAFT whitepaper (hat-tip to Y-Combinator\u2019s SAFE), but I\u2019m not convinced that the well-intentioned SAFT is right for most tokenization projects.ConsenSys began the Brooklyn Project to embark on a journey of self-regulatory best practices and the bright legal minds of Cardozo Law and the ConsenSys legal team wrote an exquisite paper detailing the limitations of the SAFT.Token Foundry will be the first platform to allow regulatory compliant utility token launches without using a SAFT\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning everyone (not just accredited people on Sand Hill Rd.) will be able to participate and purchase tokens in an initial sale, thereby continuing to democratize venture capital.I imagine the SAFT debate will continue to evolve into 2018 to further the best practices for tokenization. I look forward to seeing ConsenSys\u2019 tokenization best practices public unveiling in 2018.8.

I expect similar outreach to other exchanges. Software like Balanc3 is being used to track the p&l of a person or company\u2019s digital assets as well as trading history. Pay your taxes.10. People will take control of their online identitiesWe will continue to see the growing trend wherein people, companies, and machines manage their identity self-sovereignly rather then by a third party service provider like a bank, Facebook, or another internet service provider.Interestingly, governments will increasingly find themselves as attestors to these self-sovereign identities, similar to how Zug, Switzerland is attesting to citizens identity usage with uPort, Ethereum leading self-sovereign identity solution.11. In 2018, governments and regulatory bodies will mandate the use of blockchain to track and trace high value assets.\u201cThe supply chain stuff is really tricky\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aElon MuskCompanies and organizations will realize that for the first time, it is possible to offload basic track and trace infrastructure to the public chain. This will lead to a decrease in cost and regulatory burden, and an increase in customer brand loyalty. These two trends will set the stage for a shared track and trace infrastructure supported by the public chain.Major Fortune 50 companies are already demanding public chain track and trace use cases for which they are using the Viant platform to build their solutions.12. The evolution of law will continue to intersect computer science.\u201cThe first thing we do, let\u2019s kill all the lawyers\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aShakespeareThe lawyers of tomorrow will need to understand fundamental future aspects of computer science as much as legal precedent.Using OpenLaw, lawyers can create, deploy, and edit next-generation legal agreements relying on Ethereum and IPFS. Here are great examples of restricted stock grant purchase, standard agreement for equity, and an ERC20-token purchase agreement.Enterprise Ethereum Alliance has formed a working group with many of the leading law firms and legal schools to ensure the legal industry can adapt.13. \u201cFor the first time, open source, peer-to-peer protocol developers can monetize their project on a protocol level\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aOlaf Carlson-WeeFor the first time we\u2019ll be able to incentivize and monetize open source work, which will feel like adding a match to nitroglycerin in a Cambrian explosion of new blockchain technology paradigms. With new tokenized projects like Bounties.Network and Gitcoin, we\u2019re adding a cryptoeconomic layer to software engineering.14. BUGS begone: smart contract audits will be a necessity in 2018For decades software engineers created code with bugs, which was somewhat inconsequential as software primarily served as a communication mechanism. As we transition to an Internet of Value with digitally tokenized assets, bugs can mean potential loss of capital. We don\u2019t need to re-dance the polka or revel in the DAO-Saster of 2017, and 2016 respectively to agree that smart contract security audits are necessary.Superstars like Phil Daian and ConsenSys Diligence will become the heroes of smart contract security audit and this could be one of the largest niches/job markets within the blockchain ecosystem.15. Don\u2019t just regulate blockchain\u2026.regulate THROUGH the blockchain.2018 will be the year of G-to-C and G-to-G (Government to Citizen and Government to Government)\u200a\u2014\u200alaws, regulations, treaties written in smart contracts, making it 100x cheaper and more straightforward to comply with them and 100x cheaper and easier to do appropriate oversight without having to subpoena personal and company records.16. Stablecoins are comingStablecoins are the basis of financial instruments for hedging and derivatives that will be necessary for this wild-west industry to cross the chasm to safe and more easily used financial products. Maker DAO, VariabL, and Basecoin are attempting this from the startup eco-system, but I think this is a great space for an enterprise banking incumbent to provide value, liquidity, and validity to the digital asset ecosystem.I predict we\u2019ll see a bulge bracket bank blockchain-based stablecoin in 2018 if they can get it through compliance.17. Tangoing with ContangoAfter witnessing the first bitcoin futures products on regulated U.S. exchanges that are cash-settled in 2017, I foresee the market will evolve to physically settled offerings to avoid banging the close to manipulate futures. Moreover, we\u2019ll see other digital asset derivatives, such as ether.These derivative contracts will provide forward pricing curves that are necessary to the genesis and evolution of digital asset exchange traded funds.18. The total market cap of blockchain-based digital assets will exceed $2 trillion U.S. dollars by January 1, 2019.\u201cNew Car, Caviar, Four Star Daydream\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aPink FloydThe price of ether will exceed $2,000 in 2018. Ether will continue to outperform bitcoin, and the total market cap of ether will exceed that of bitcoin in 2018. Bitcoin\u2019s governance issues, reluctance to evolve, and extremely high fees could lead it to its demise. Bitcoin Cash has a serious chance of eclipsing Bitcoin. The market cap of Filecoin will exceed that of bitcoin by 2023.There will be a crypto-winter, though not in \u201918, as the industry is in the spring of its youth.Interesting times,AK(@ConsenSysAndrew)Andrew is a co-founder of ConsenSys Capital, the financial services offering constellation at ConsenSys including ConsenSys Ventures, Token Foundry, and ConsenSys Capital Asset Management.

In the 5+ years I\u2019ve been working in the VC industry, this is by and large the fastest I\u2019ve seen any area of technology take off in terms of new company (or project) formation. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that founders and VCs were mainly focused on centralized exchanges, enterprise or private blockchain solutions, wallets, amongst several other popular blockchain startup ideas that dominated the market from 2012 to somewhere around 2016.However, as I wrote about a few months ago, the rise of Ethereum with its turing-complete scripting language and the ability for developers to include state in each block, has paved the way for smart contract development. This has led to an influx of teams building decentralized projects seeking to take advantage of the most valuable property of blockchains\u200a\u2014\u200athe ability to reach a shared truth that everyone agrees on without intermediaries or a centralized authority.There are many exciting developments coming to market both in terms of improving existing blockchain functionality as well as the consumer\u2019s experience. However, given the rapid pace at which projects are coming to market, I\u2019ve found it to be difficult to keep track of each and every project and where each one fits into the ecosystem. Furthermore, it\u2019s easy to miss the forest for the trees without a comprehensive view of what the proverbial forest looks like. As a result, I have compiled a list of all of the decentralized blockchain-based projects that I have been following, was able to dig up through research, along with recommendations from friends in the ecosystem. This market landscape is the output of that work.A quick disclaimer: While it\u2019s difficult to pigeonhole a number of projects into one category, I did my best to pinpoint the main purpose or value proposition of each project and categorize them as such. There are certainly many projects that fall into the gray area and could fit into multiple categories. The hardest ones are the \u201cfat protocols\u201d which offer functionality in more than a couple of areas.Below is an overview of each broader category I\u2019ve identified, touching on some of the subcategories they\u2019re comprised of:CurrenciesFor the most part, these projects were created with the intention of building a better currency for various use cases and represent either a store of value, medium of exchange, or a unit of account. While Bitcoin was the first and is the most prominent project in the category, many of the other projects set out to improve upon a certain aspect of Bitcoin\u2019s protocol or tailor it towards a specific use case. The Privacy subcategory could probably fall into either the Payments or Base Layer Protocols categories, but I decided to break them out separately given how important anonymous, untraceable cryptocurrencies (especially Monero and ZCash) are for users who would like to conceal a transaction because they prefer not to broadcast a certain purchase for one reason or another, or for enterprises who don\u2019t want to reveal trade secrets.Developer ToolsProjects within this category are primarily used by developers as the building blocks for decentralized applications. In order to allow users to directly interact with protocols through application interfaces (for use cases other than financial ones), many of the current designs that lie here need to be proven out at scale. Protocol designs around scaling and interoperability are active areas of research that will be important parts of the Web3 development stack.In my opinion, this is one of the more interesting categories at the moment from both an intellectual curiosity and an investment standpoint. In order for many of the blockchain use cases we\u2019ve been promised to come to fruition such as fully decentralized autonomous organizations or a Facebook alternative where users have control of their own data, foundational, scalable infrastructure needs to grow and mature. Many of these projects aim at doing just that.Furthermore, these projects aren\u2019t in a \u201cwinner take all\u201d area in the same way that say a cryptocurrency might be as a store of value. For example, building a decentralized data marketplace could require a a number of Developer Tools subcategories such as Ethereum for smart contracts, Truebit for faster computation, NuCypher for proxy re-encryption, ZeppelinOS for security, and Mattereum for legal contract execution to ensure protection in the case of a dispute. Because these are protocols and not centralized data silos, they can talk to one another, and this interoperability enables new use cases to emerge through the sharing of data and functionality from multiple protocols in a single application. Preethi Kasireddy does a great job of explaining this dynamic here.FintechThis category is fairly straightforward. When you\u2019re interacting with a number of different protocols and applications (such as in the Developer Tools example above), many may have their own native cryptocurrency, and thus a number of new economies emerge. In any economy with multiple currencies, there\u2019s a need for tools for exchanging one unit of currency for another, facilitating lending, accepting investment, etc.The Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) subcategory could arguably have been categorized as Developer Tools. Many projects are already starting to integrate the 0x protocol and I anticipate this trend to continue in the near future. In a world with the potential for an exorbitant number of tokens, widespread adoption of applications using several tokens will only be possible if the complexity of using them is abstracted away\u200a\u2014\u200aa benefit provided by decentralized exchanges.Both the Lending and Insurance subcategories benefit from economies of scale through risk aggregation. By opening up these markets and allowing people to now be priced in larger pools or on a differentiated, individual basis (depending on their risk profile), costs can decrease and therefore consumers should in theory win. Blockchains are both stateful and immutable so because previous interactions are stored on chain, users can be confident that the data that comprises their individual history hasn\u2019t been tampered with.SovereigntyAs the team at Blockstack describes in their white paper,Over the last decade, we\u2019ve seen a shift from desktop apps (that run locally) to cloud-based apps that store user data on remote servers. These centralized services are a prime target for hackers and frequently get hacked.Sovereignty is another area that I find most interesting at the moment. While blockchains still suffer from scalability and performance issues, the value provided by their trustless architecture can supersede performance issues when dealing with sensitive data; the safekeeping of which we\u2019re forced to rely on third parties for today. Through cryptoeconomics, users don\u2019t need to trust in any individual or organization but rather in the theory that humans will behave rationally when correctly incentivized.The projects in this category provide the functionality necessary for a world where users aren\u2019t forced to trust in any individual or organization but rather in the incentives implemented through cryptography and economics.Value ExchangeA key design of the Bitcoin protocol is the ability to have trust amongst several different parties, despite there being no relationship or trust between those parties outside of the blockchain. Transactions can be created and data shared by various parties in an immutable fashion. It\u2019s widely considered fact that people begin to organize into firms when the cost of coordinating production through a market is greater than within a firm individually. But what if people could organize into this proverbial \u201cfirm\u201d without having to trust one another? Through blockchains and cryptoeconomics, the time and complexity of developing trust is abstracted away, which allows a large number people to collaborate and share in the profits of such collaboration without a hierarchical structure of a traditional firm. Today, middlemen and rent seekers are a necessary evil in order to keep order, maintain safety, and enforce the rules of P2P marketplaces. But in many areas, these cryptoeconomic systems can replace that trust, and cutting out middlemen and their fees will allow users to exchange goods and services at a significantly lower cost.The projects in the subcategories can be broken down into two main groups: fungible and non-fungible. Markets that allow users to exchange goods and services that are fungible will commoditize things like storage, computation, internet connectivity, bandwidth, energy, etc. Companies that sell these products today compete on economies of scale which can only be displaced by better economies of scale. By opening up latent supply and allowing anyone to join the network (which will become easier through projects like 1Protocol) this no longer becomes a daunting task, once again collapsing margins towards zero.Non-fungible markets don\u2019t have the same benefits although they still allow providers to earn what their good or service is actually worth rather than what the middlemen thinks it\u2019s worth after they take their cut.Shared DataOne way to think about the shared data layer model is to look at the airline industry\u2019s Global Distribution Systems (GDS\u2019s). GDS\u2019s are a centralized data warehouse where all of the airlines push their inventory data in order to best coordinate all supply information, including routes and pricing. This allows aggregators like Kayak and other companies in the space to displace traditional travel agents by building a front end on top of these systems that users can transact on. Typically, markets that have been most attractive for intermediary aggregators are those in which there is a significant barrier to entry in competing directly, but whereby technological advances have created a catalyst for an intermediary to aggregate incumbents, related metadata, and consumer preferences (as was the case with GDS\u2019s).Through financial incentives provided by blockchain based projects, we\u2019re witnessing the single most impactful technological catalyst which will open up numerous markets, except the value no longer will accrue to the aggregator but rather to the individuals and companies that are providing the data.In 2015, Hunter Walk wrote that one of the biggest missed opportunities of the last decade was eBay\u2019s failure to open up their reputation system to third parties which would\u2019ve put them at the center of P2P commerce. I\u2019d even take this a step further and argue that eBay\u2019s single most valuable asset is reputation data which is built up over long periods of time, forcing user lock-in and granting eBay the power to levy high taxes on its users for the peace of mind that they are transacting with good actors. In shared data blockchain protocols, users can take these types of datasets with them as other applications hook into shared data protocols, reducing barriers to entry; increasing competition and as a result ultimately increasing the pace of innovation.The other way to think about shared data protocols can be best described using a centralized company, such as Premise Data, as an example. Premise Data deploys network contributors who collect data from 30+ countries on everything from specific food/beverage consumption to materials used in a specific geography. The company uses machine learning to extract insights and then sells these datasets to a range of customers. Rather than finding and hiring people to collect these datasets, a project could be started that allows anyone to collect and share this data, annotate the data, and build different models to extract insights from the data. Contributors could earn tokens which would increase in value as companies use the tokens to purchase the network\u2019s datasets and insights. In theory, the result would be more contributors and higher quality datasets as the market sets the going rate for information and compensates participants accordingly relative to their contribution.There are many similar possibilities as the \u201copen data platform\u201d has been a popular startup idea for a few years now with several companies finding great success with the model. The challenge I foresee will be in sales and business development. Most of these companies sell their dataset to larger organizations and it will be interesting to see how decentralized projects distribute theirs in the future. There are also opportunities that weren\u2019t previously possible or profitable as a standalone, private organization to pursue, given that the economics don\u2019t work for a private company.AuthenticityUltimately, cryptocurrencies are just digital assets native to a specific blockchain and projects in this category are using these digital assets to represent either real world goods (like fair tickets) or data. The immutability of public blockchains allows network participants to be confident in the fact that the data written to them hasn\u2019t been tampered with or changed in any way and that it will be available and accessible far into the future. Hence why, for sensitive data or markets for goods which have traditionally been rife with fraud, it would make sense to use a blockchain to assure the user of their integrity.TakeawaysWhile there\u2019s a lot of innovation happening across all of these categories, the projects just getting started that I\u2019m most excited about are enabling the web3 development stack by providing functionality that\u2019s necessary across different use cases, sovereignty through user access control of their data, as well as fungible value exchange. Given that beyond financial speculation we\u2019ve yet to see mainstream cryptocurrency use cases, infrastructure development and use cases that are vastly superior for users in either cost, privacy, and/or security in extremely delicate areas (such as identity, credit scoring, VPN\u2019s amongst others) seem to be the most likely candidates to capture significant value.Longer-term, I\u2018m excited about projects enabling entire ecosystems to benefit from shared data and the bootstrapping of networks (non-fungible value exchange). I\u2019m quite sure there are several other areas that I\u2019m not looking at correctly or haven\u2019t been dreamt up yet!As always if you\u2019re building something that fits these criterion or have any comments, questions or points of contention, I\u2019d love to hear from you.Thank you to Jesse Walden, Larry Sukernik, Brendan Bernstein, Kevin Kwok, Mike Dempsey, Julian Moncada, Jake Perlman-Garr, Angela Tran Kingyens and Mike Karnjanaprakorn for all your help on the market map and blog post.Disclaimer: Compound is an investor in Blockstack and two other projects mentioned in this post which have not yet been announced.", "responses": "138"}, {"title": "Blockchain Governance: Programming Our\u00a0Future", "author_name": "Fred Ehrsam", "link": "https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/blockchain-governance-programming-our-future-c3bfe30f2d74?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 27, 2017", "readtime": "17 min read", "upvotes": "21K", "content": "Blockchain Governance: Programming Our\u00a0FutureFred EhrsamBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 27, 2017This post describes why blockchain governance design is one of the most important problems out there, its critical components, current approaches, potential future approaches, and concludes with suggestions for the community.Why Blockchain Governance MattersAs with organisms, the most successful blockchains will be those that can best adapt to their environments. Assuming these systems need to evolve to survive, initial design is important, but over a long enough timeline, the mechanisms for change are most important.As a result, I believe governance is the most vital problem in the space. Other fundamental problems like scalability are arguably best approached by using governance to set the right incentives for people to solve them. Yet little research has gone into governance and it feels poorly understood.Evolutionary tree of life, from Leonard Eisenberg.Satoshi showed us the immense power of releasing a blockchain-based incentive structure into the world. A 9 page whitepaper spawned a $150bn cryptocurrency, a computer network bigger than the top 500 supercomputers by 10,000x, and a diverse ecosystem of developers, users, and companies. This was arguably one of the highest leverage actions in human history. It showed the power of blockchains as networks that can connect everyone and bootstrap themselves into existence if well constructed.We are increasingly living in digital networks, spending an average of 11 hours a day on screens in the US with over half of that on internet connected devices, growing 11% each year. However, these networks are highly centralized (Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter) and continue to consolidate. In the current model, all of the profit and power of a network is within one company, and you\u2019re either inside or you\u2019re outside. It\u2019s important the networks we live in serve our best interests. With blockchains emerging as the new global infrastructure, we have the opportunity to create vastly different power structures and program the future we want for ourselves.For these reasons, I believe blockchain governance system design is one of the highest leverage activities known.A Cambrian ExplosionIt\u2019s rare a new government or central bank gets created, and even more rare to see experimentation with a new form of governance when it does.Blockchains are unique because they 1) allow thousands of governance systems and monetary policies to be tried at the speed of software with 2) in some cases, much lower consequences of failure. As a result, there will be a Cambrian explosion of economic and governance designs where many approaches will be tried in parallel at hyperspeed. To be clear, I am including economic design and monetary policy (said another way, incentive structure) in governance because, like other aspects of the system, they can be modified as time passes.Many of these attempts will be spectacular failures. With millions of algorithmic central banks we will have millions of crypto George Soroses trying to break the Bank of England. Through this process, blockchains may teach us more about governance in the next 10 years than we have learned from the \u201creal world\u201d in the last 100 years.Two Critical Components of Governance1. IncentivesEach group in the system has their own incentives. Those incentives are not always 100% aligned with all other groups in the system. Groups will propose changes over time which are advantageous for them. Organisms are biased towards their own survival. This commonly manifests in changes to the reward structure, monetary policy, or balances of power.2. Mechanisms for coordinationSince it\u2019s unlikely all groups have 100% incentive alignment at all times, the ability for each group to coordinate around their common incentives is critical for them to affect change. If one group can coordinate better than another it creates power imbalances in their favor.In practice, a major factor is how much coordination can be done on-chain vs. off-chain, where on-chain coordination makes coordinating easier. In some new blockchains, on-chain coordination allows the rules or even the ledger history itself to be changed.Current ApproachesWhat follows is a dissection of the benefits and drawbacks of today\u2019s two largest blockchains: Bitcoin and Ethereum. We are currently in the primordial ooze phase of blockchain governance. Systems are simple and little has been tried.BitcoinBitcoin was the first successful attempt to create a standalone blockchain. Let\u2019s examine it as a base:1. IncentivesDevelopers: increase value of existing token holdings, social recognition, maintain power for control over future direction.Miners: increase value of existing token holdings, expected future block rewards, and expected future transactions fees.Users: increase value of existing token holdings, increase functional utility (e.g. store of value, uncensorable transactions, file storage).2. Mechanisms for coordinationMostly off-chain. Developers coordinate through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process and a mailing list. Miners can coordinate on-chain in the sense that they are creating the chain itself.Resulting systemThe checks and balances system created is somewhat analogous to the US government and has a number of benefits. Similar to the Senate submitting new bills, developers submit pull requests. Similar to the judiciary, miners decide whether or not to actually adopt the laws in practice. Similar to the executive branch, the nodes of the network can veto by not running a version which aligns with what the miners are running. And similar to citizens, the users can revolt. Finally, economic incentives dictate that it is in everyone\u2019s best interest to maintain trust in the system. For example: if miners alienated all the users, the tokens would decrease in value and they would go out of business. As the first system of its kind, it\u2019s incredible that Bitcoin is still going strong.Bitcoin as branches of US Government. Image from Buck\u00a0Perley.There are risks to the system caused by asymmetries in incentives. Miners push for changes which increase future cumulative transaction fees, while developers don\u2019t care as long as the value of Bitcoin keeps going up. Developers\u2019 direct economic incentives are weak. New developers have little incentive to work on Bitcoin because there is no direct way to earn money by doing it. As a result, they often work on new projects\u200a\u2014\u200aeither by creating Ethereum tokens, entirely new chains, or companies. No new blood entering increases the perception and reality of early developers as the most knowledgable and experienced. This results in a self-reinforcing cycle of more power becoming concentrated in a small group of early core developers, slower technological advancement, and conservatism. Developers are at risk of being bribed since they have a lot of power but weak economic incentives. Some early holders and universities have sponsored developers, but with limited impact thus far.Similarly, asymmetries in ability to coordinate give miners disproportionate power. Communication amongst miners is easier because they are a small and concentrated group. Since mining is a business with economies of scale, we\u2019d expect a continued trend towards natural monopoly in mining and even greater coordination advantage. As a reference point, 95% of mining power was able to sit on one small stage 2 years ago. Miners can also gain disproportionate power by bribing developers or hiring their own. Finally, the checks and balances system of Bitcoin relies on some level of transparency: for example, users becoming aware of a single miner gaining more than 51% of the hashing power or developers having some level of independence. And a miner who was able to gain >51% of hashing power would be incented to remain anonymous. Rather than sparking a specific catastrophic event, this would cause an unknowing descent into a centralized world of control through censorship and asset freezing.EthereumThe systemic incentives and mechanisms of coordination in Ethereum are similar to Bitcoin at the moment.Dynamics will change as Ethereum moves to proof of stake. The power of miners will be replaced by anyone who holds a sufficient amount of Ether to run a virtual miner (a \u201cvalidator\u201d). This is especially true as solutions like 1protocol will allow even the smallest Ether holder to participate, flattening the distinction between a miner and a user, and potentially reducing the biggest centralization risk in Bitcoin.The incentives of core developers remain the same. Coordination around challenging issues has been swifter and smoother than in Bitcoin to date. This is due to 1) a culture more open to change because Ethereum was created as a reaction to what could not be done in a rigid Bitcoin environment and 2) direction from Vitalik who is widely trusted in the community.Current weaknesses in the model include 1) over reliance on its creator (Vitalik) and 2) like Bitcoin, limited ways to incentivize core development, forcing more projects to create tokens to support themselves. Vitalik is making a conscious effort to step back, which will be a delicate process.New Chains Experimenting with On-Chain GovernanceNew blockchains are making it much easier to coordinate by enabling on-chain governance.TezosIn Tezos, anyone can submit a change to the governance structure in the form of a code update. An on-chain vote occurs, and if passed, the update makes its way on to a test network. After a period of time on the test network, a confirmation vote occurs, at which point the change goes live on the main network. They call this concept a \u201cself-amending ledger\u201d.Such a system is interesting because it shifts power towards users and away from the more centralized group of developers and miners. On the developer side, anyone can submit a change, and most importantly, everyone has an economic incentive to do it. Contributions are rewarded by the community with newly minted tokens through inflation funding. This shifts from the current Bitcoin and Ethereum dynamics where a new developer has little incentive to evolve the protocol, thus power tends to concentrate amongst the existing developers, to one where everyone has equal earning power.This also enables users to directly coordinate on-chain, dramatically increasing their power and reducing the power of miners compared to a system like Bitcoin or Ethereum.DFINITYOne step further would be a system which allows on-chain votes to the rules of the system like Tezos and direct, retroactive changes to the ledger itself. In other words, if something happens that tokenholders do not like (ex: a hack, a marketplace selling drugs), they can roll back or edit the ledger in addition to the rules of governance themselves. DFINITY, an in-development blockchain, is taking this approach. Proponents of this system point to events like hard fork caused by The DAO hack and the recent $150m Parity multi-sig bug and suggest such events would be much smoother if everyone could just vote to undo them. On the flip side, this system allows direct censorship and peoples\u2019 tokens to be forcibly taken. As we saw with Ethereum\u2019s hard fork to revert The DAO hack, this is possible with existing blockchains, but requires higher friction through off-chain coordination and hard forking instead of on-chain coordination with no forking.DFINITY is maximally flexible. Depending on what parts of the protocol Tezos allows to be changed, it is possible protocol changes effectively let you re-write the ledger as in DFINITY. As a result, it\u2019s likely these systems will have different voting thresholds for different changes, perhaps requiring a supermajority for some things and a simple majority for others.The Double-Edged Sword of On-Chain GovernanceOn-chain governance is a double edged sword. On the upside it helps make sure a process is consistently followed which can increase coordination and fairness. It also allows for quicker decision making. On the downside it\u2019s risky because the metasystem becomes harder to change once instituted. Like anything put directly into code, it can be exploited or gamed more quickly and easily if flawed. Vlad Zamfir, a principal architect of Ethereum\u2019s proof of stake, feels \u201cthe risks far outweigh the rewards\u201d and \u201crepresent an extremely risky proposition\u201d.For some use cases, tending towards being static may be good. This may be especially true for store of value. Perhaps lower level protocols should lean toward stasis and conservatism\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cmeasure twice and cut once\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awhile higher level protocols should be more flexible\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cmove fast and break things\u201d. In the words of Calvin Coolidge: \u201cit is much more important to kill bad bills than to pass good ones\u201d. Like established companies, some of the more established protocols may be able to watch what new protocols do and adopt techniques which seem to be working. This seems especially true of Ethereum which has shown a willingness to hard fork and the ability to maintain network value through them. Consequently, I\u2019d expect to see the most innovation in the next few years from Ethereum tokens and entirely new chains.It\u2019s probable we haven\u2019t found the best governance systems yet, which means a more general system which allows many different methods to be tried is valuable, if for nothing more than learning. A more complex system can simulate less complex ones, but the reverse is generally hard.The most interesting learnings will come from exploring the balance of mutability so systems can evolve and immutability for stability.Future ApproachesNext we\u2019ll talk about future governance strategies with potential which have yet to be tried.FutarchyIn futarchy, society defines its values and then prediction markets are used to decide what actions will maximize those values. Said another way: \u201cvote on values, bet on beliefs\u201d. It was originally proposed in 2000 by Robin Hanson, an economics professor at George Mason University.Ralph Merkle has a particularly eye-opening proposal for a blockchain implementation of futarchy in his paper called DAOs, Democracy, and Governance. In his proposal, every citizen is polled once a year and asked the question \u201chow satisfied were you this year on a scale of 0 to 1?\u201d. Averaged together, these give an overall societal welfare score. A prediction market on this welfare score is developed for every year for the next 100 years, where traders can speculate on the welfare score for any year into the future. An overall future welfare score is then created by averaging the scores for the next 100 years, weighting earlier years more than future years. When a new bill is introduced, there is a 1 week period where markets speculate on whether the overall welfare score will go up or down if the bill is passed. If the bill is passed, the traders who bet on the overall welfare going up now own the overall welfare contracts they bet on. They will make money if they are right and lose money if they are wrong.Example of futarchy for deciding whether or not to fire a CEO where the value to maximize is revenue. Image from ConsenSys.This system could be incredibly powerful for a few reasons. First, voting becomes extremely simple. People don\u2019t need to vote, they are just asked about one thing once a year: their satisfaction. Second, people do not need to develop extensive knowledge of candidates or bills. This is important because candidates are often persuasive and bills are complex to the point where it is hard for a domain-specific researcher to understand their implications, let alone an elected official or an average citizen. Instead, we rely on the wisdom of the markets. Like trading in stocks, only people who are extremely well informed on a topic will bet on it\u200a\u2014\u200aotherwise they are likely to lose money to others who are better informed. Finally, it is a system where market incentives are aligned with societal values.In futarchy the devil is in the implementation details. Hard problems include the governance metaproblem of how to decide on the societal value(s) to maximize in the first place and making sure people aren\u2019t incented to tactically vote an extreme satisfaction score of 0 or 1 to swing policy.Setting goal functions is both important and tricky, as there are always unforeseen consequences. For example, in the case of capitalism, this can manifest in rising wealth inequality and environmental externalities. In the case of artificial intelligence, this can manifest in wireheading or rapidly maximizing something at the unexpected expense of other things, commonly illustrated through the example of a paperclip maximizer which destroys everything to build as many paperclips as possible. These are serious concerns, as I believe the most powerful AIs will be bootstrapped into existence on the blockchain by using tokenized incentives for everyone to feed them the best data and algorithms. If this is true, blockchain governance is the largest determinant of our future trajectory as a species. More on this in a future post.Liquid DemocracyLiquid democracy is system where everyone has the ability to vote themselves, to delegate their vote to someone else, and to remove the delegation of their vote at any time. In the U.S. we do not have a liquid democracy because we cannot vote on many bills directly (our representatives do that for us) and once we elect a representative, they are typically in office for 4 years.This seems like it will be used in proof of stake blockchains given its simplicity.Quadratic VotingQuadratic voting is a system of buying votes, where each additional vote costs twice as much as the one before it. In other words, money buys votes, but with strong diminishing returns. Vitalik proposed a variant on this he calls \u201cquadratic coin lock voting\u201d where N coins let you make N * k votes by locking up those coins for a time period of k\u00b2. This is a nice modification because it aligns incentives over time: more voting power requires living with your decisions for longer. In a tokenized world with little friction of entering or leaving a community, this is especially important.Voting with People or\u00a0Money?A major problem with one person = one vote systems on the blockchain is their susceptibility to sybil attacks. Near zero cost to create infinite accounts means it\u2019s easy to generate infinite votes. This is why the default model in proof of stake and Ethereum-based token governance is one token = one vote.Blockchain-based identity systems like Civic can help enable one person = one vote systems. However, anonymity is likely to be preserved in most cryptocurrencies. Identity gives each coin its own unique history, which can be subjectively judged to be more or less clean than that of another coin, causing fungibility to break down. One potential approach is a balance between identity and money: a fully verified identity gets 100% of the voting power of their money, a partially verified identity gets 50%, and an entirely anonymous identity gets 25%.As mentioned in quadratic voting, other mechanisms which weight community members differently independent of real-world identity are likely to evolve. For example, a new token holder may have diminished voting power until they have been a member of the community for a while, similar to not being able to vote until you are a full citizen of a country.In any case, today\u2019s world would look a lot different if modern governments ran on voting with money, so this change in defaults is not to be taken lightly.Finally, reputation within a token community will be critical. This is already shown through indirect means, where Vitalik\u2019s suggestions carry a lot of weight in the Ethereum community. In a liquid democracy system reputation manifests in the number of votes delegated to a particular person. Someone with high reputation and no money could have 10 million Ether delegated to them and have tremendous governing power.Other ToolsSimple off-chain futures markets have already shown themselves as a powerful tool. In the recently proposed and contentious Bitcoin SegWit2x fork, futures markets speculated on the expected value of SegWit2x vs. non-SegWit2x chains. The markets consistently valued a SegWit2x chain at less than 20% of a non-SegWit2x chain for 3 weeks. Supporters of SegWit2x then called off their forking efforts because they felt they had \u201cnot built sufficient consensus\u201d. While it\u2019s hard to know exactly what caused them to reach this conclusion, it seems like futures markets were a strong indicator of lack of support.Futures markets on Bitcoin\u2019s SegWit2xOther tools are being built for governance and standardization at different layers. ZeppelinOS is a series of basic libraries which are commonly being used as the base of Ethereum token systems, covering things like token sale mechanics, token vesting, and access controls to the treasury of the project. Aragon is trying to create standard implementations of these systems in the same way Delaware C corporations implement corporations in a standard way.ForkingIt\u2019s worth noting that forking is always an option. Applying Albert Hirschman\u2019s classic voice or exit paradigm for affecting change in a system, voice is governance, weak exit is selling your coins, and strong exit is forking.We\u2019ve seen many examples of forking so far, and this is great! In physical nations forking is nearly impossible. This was also the case in software until blockchains emerged. They make it easy to take all the code and state of a system and try a new path. In the Web 2.0 world, forking is the equivalent of Facebook allowing any competitor to take their entire database and codebase to a competitor. Don\u2019t like how Facebook is operating it\u2019s newsfeed? Create a fork with all the same code, social connections, and photos.The ability to fork significantly reduces lock-in and increases diversity, allowing many more paths to be tried than we would ever see in modern governments, central banks, or Web 2.0 companies. As in corporate spinoffs, forking is also beneficial when two niche chains can more effectively serve distinct needs than one chain ineffectively serving both sets of needs.However, it is still valuable to avoid hard forks when possible. A hard fork is a non-backwards compatible change. Downsides of hard forks include:Reducing network effects. Not everyone is speaking the same language anymore.Creating work. Anyone who was using the forked protocol probably had their code broken. In a world that is increasingly interconnected through transparent and trustless code execution, these effects compound.Reducing trust. Now that we\u2019ve had a breaking change, those previously referencing the protocol must now go outside the blockchain and somehow figure out what the \u201cright\u201d new version is to use.Because of the dramatically reduced friction for exit, the need for effective voice (governance) is more critical than ever. It is trivial to fork a blockchain and copy all of its code and state. So the value isn\u2019t in the chain of data, it\u2019s in the community and social consensus around a chain. Governance is what keeps communities together and, in turn, gives a token value.Community SuggestionsFor users: Spend more time looking at the governance system of your blockchain, less time on the issue of the day. Current events are just a manifestation of the larger system that caused them. So while it\u2019s easy to get riled up by the news, the highest leverage point for change comes from designing or changing the system, not arguing about its current manifestations.For developers: Try inflation funding. And if you are creating a new token using a simple 1 token = 1 vote system, consider quadratic coin lock voting as a low risk/high return alternative.For everyone: Watch and learn from the experiments that will be run on the new on-chain governance systems.ConclusionLike organisms, the ability of a blockchain to succeed over time is based on its ability to evolve. This evolution will bring about many decisions on direction, and it is the governance around those decisions which most strongly determine the outcome of the system. If programming in the system is important, the metaprogramming of the system itself is most important.I believe governance should be the primary focus of investors in the space. The fundamentals of cryptoeconomics and overarching governance schemas of these networks are critical to survival, under-appreciated, and poorly understood. Investors can add significant value through the luxury of being able to observe and learn from multiple projects at one time. They should be active in the governance of the tokens they participate in and transparent with a community if they feel the design of the system can be improved.We are birthing into existence systems which transcend us. In the same way democracy and capitalism as systems determine so much of the emergent behavior around us, blockchains will do the same with even greater reach. These systems are organisms which take on lives of their own and are more concerned with perpetuating themselves than the individuals which comprise them. As technology stretches these systems to their limits, the implications become more pronounced. So we\u2019d be wise to carefully consider the structure of these systems while we can. Like any new powerful technology, blockchains are a tool that can go in many different directions. Used well, we can create a world with greater prosperity and freedom. Used poorly, we can create systems which lead us to places we didn\u2019t intend to go.Thanks to Vitalik Buterin, Buck Perley, Vlad Zamfir, Luke Duncan, Brian Armstrong, Ralph Merkle, Arthur Brietman, Julia Galef, Dominic Williams, Luis Iv\u00e1n Cuende, Matt Huang, Demian Brenier, Andy Coravos, Chris Burniske, Jim Posen, Balaji Srinivasan, Scott Nolan, Elad Gil, Chris Dixon, Maksim Stepanenko, Albert Wenger, Simon de la Rouviere, Sophia Cui, Lucas Ryan, Jay Graber, and Jeromy Johnson for conversations and ideas which contributed to this post.", "responses": "173"}, {"title": "Blockchains don\u2019t scale.

My excitement about the potential of blockchain technology has been building ever since.\u00a0\u00a0Decentralized digital currency, once just a far-fetched goal, is finally making inroads into the mainstream. While that\u2019s exciting on its own merit, I\u2019m personally most excited about the potential for decentralized applications. Financial exchanges, prediction markets, and asset management platforms all carry enormous potential.\u00a0\u00a0The trustless systems supporting them are no less intriguing; identity verification systems, smart property, censorship resistant social platforms, and autonomous structures and governance models like DAOs. The most disruptive use cases probably haven\u2019t even been dreamt up yet.\u00a0\u00a0But this dream still remains a dream for the foreseeable future\u200a\u2014\u200awhile a few early enthusiasts and entrepreneurs are experimenting with building such applications, there\u2019s still a big missing piece that prevents us from seeing these applications come to fruition: scalability. Blockchains, as it stands today, are limited in their ability to scale. \u00a0That\u2019s not to say that this will be the case forever, but it\u2019s definitely true today. In fact, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s one of the biggest technological barriers we face with blockchain technology today. It\u2019s quickly become a very active area of research among researchers in the community and cryptocurrency in general.Why isn\u2019t the blockchain scalable?Currently, all blockchain consensus protocols (eg. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Tendermint) have a challenging limitation: every fully participating node in the network must process every transaction. Recall that blockchains have one inherent critical characteristic\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cdecentralization\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awhich means that every single node on the network processes every transaction and maintains a copy of the entire state.\u00a0While a decentralization consensus mechanism offers some critical benefits, such as fault tolerance, a strong guarantee of security, political neutrality, and authenticity, it comes at the cost of scalability. The number of transactions the blockchain can process can never exceed that of a single node that is participating in the network. In fact, the blockchain actually gets weaker as more nodes are added to its network because of the inter-node latency that logarithmically increases with every additional node.\u00a0In a traditional database system, the solution to scalability is to add more servers (i.e. compute power) to handle the added transactions. In the decentralized blockchain world where every node needs to process and validate every transaction, it would require us to add more compute to every node for the network to get faster. Having no control over every public node in the network leaves us in a pickle.\u00a0As a result, all public blockchain consensus protocols that operate in such a decentralized manner make the tradeoff between low transaction throughput and high degree of centralization. In other words, as the size of the blockchain grows, the requirements for storage, bandwidth, and compute power required by fully participating in the network increases. At some point, it becomes unwieldy enough that it\u2019s only feasible for a few nodes to process a block\u200a\u2014\u200aleading to the risk of centralization.\u00a0In order to scale, the blockchain protocol must figure out a mechanism to limit the number of participating nodes needed to validate each transaction, without losing the network\u2019s trust that each transaction is valid. It might sound simple in words, but is technologically very difficult. Why?Since every node is not allowed to validate every transaction, we somehow need nodes to have a statistical and economic means to ensure that other blocks (which they are not personally validating) are secure.There must be some way to guarantee data availability. In other words, even if a block looks valid from the perspective of a node not directly validating that block, making the data for that block unavailable leads to a situation where no other validator in the network can validate transactions or produce new blocks, and we end up stuck in the current state. (There are several reasons a node might go offline, including malicious attack and power loss.)Transactions need to be processed by different nodes in parallel in order to achieve scalability. However, transitioning state on the blockchain also has several non-parallelizable (serial) parts, so we\u2019re faced with some restrictions on how we can transition state on the blockchain while balancing both parallelizability and utility.Gimme the\u00a0numbersSo what do the scalability numbers actually look like? Let\u2019s take a look.\u00a0An Ethereum node\u2019s maximum theoretical transaction processing capacity is over 1,000 transactions per second [1]. Unfortunately, this is not the actual throughput due to Ethereum\u2019s \u201cgas limit\u201d, which is currently around 6.7 million gas on average for each block [2].Source: etherscan.ioQuick \u201cgas\u201d primer in case the measurement is new to you: in Ethereum, gas is a measure of computational effort, and each operation is assigned a fixed amount of gas (for example, getting the balance of an account costs 400 gas, creating a contract costs 32,000 gas, sending a transaction costs 21,000 gas, etc.). Transactions have a gas limit field to specify the maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to buy. Hence, the \u201cgas limit\u201d for each block determines how many transactions will fit in a block based on the gas limit specified by each transaction in the block.Ethereum\u2019s gas limit is somewhat similar to Bitcoin\u2019s 1 MB limit on the size of each block, with the difference being that Ethereum\u2019s gas limit is dynamically set by miners while Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit is hard-coded into the protocol.\u00a0\u00a0This gas limit for Ethereum imposes a soft cap on the network\u2019s computational power per block: with the current 6.7 million gas limit and the current average gas used per standard transaction of approximately 21K, we get approximately 300 standard transactions every block. The current average block time is 20 seconds which equates to roughly 15 transactions per second (300 / 20 = 15) at best [4]. This gets much lower with more complex transactions (e.g. median gas used by smart contract calls is 50K [3], which means roughly ~7 transactions per second).Combined with the fact that the number of transactions on the Ethereum network is growing at a significant pace, you can see how this would become a problem. Daily transactions increased from approximately 40K to 240K from Q2 2016 to Q2 2017 [4], which represents a 500% year-over-year growth. Moreover, just in the past month it reached a peak of over 440K transactions per day! If we do some back of the envelope calculations, that\u2019s an average of 5 transactions per second.Uh oh.Similarly, Bitcoin, despite having a theoretical limit of 4,000 transactions per second, currently has a hard cap of about 7 transactions per second for small transactions and 3 per second for more complex transactions.Note that these limitations don\u2019t exist for private blockchains. Private blockchains can, in fact, achieve over 1,000 transactions per second on Ethereum or Bitcoin. Why? Because if you\u2019re running a private blockchain, you have the ability to ensure that every node on the network is a high-quality computer with high bandwidth internet connection. Scaling the blockchain currently would require us to add more compute to every node for the network to get faster. Since privately managed networks have control over every node in the network, they can do this. Moreover, since you\u2019re on a private network, you can handle some actions that would otherwise happen on the blockchain off the blockchain, such as making sure that each node that is participating is running a real node.I\u2019ve been architecting and implementing a new protocol on Ethereum, and have first-handly been confronted with future-proofing the issue of scalability. Personally, I\u2019ve been fascinated by the amount of research, discussion and most importantly, experimentation happening to solve this problem. In the rest of the post, I\u2019ll describe some of the proposed solutions being discussed in the community to solve scalability. Each comes with unique strengths and tradeoffs.The truth of the matter is that unfortunately, none of the solutions provide the silver bullet answer to scalability. In reality, each one of these solutions will help improve scalability incrementally. Combined together, there\u2019s a promising outlook for the future of blockchain scalability.Please note that the goal of this post is not to explore all the technical intricacies or to debate the merits of each proposed solution. Instead, my goal is to give you a 10,000 foot overview of some of the proposed solutions that I am aware of. If readers are interested, I can dive into some of the specific solutions in more depth in later posts. This post also assumes that you have a basic understanding of how the blockchain works. (If not, you can check out my last post \u201cBitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, Tokens, ICOs: Why should anyone care?\u201d for a refresher.)Let\u2019s dig in.SolutionsScaling the blockchain is a known challenge and has been an active area of research for several years. Specifically, if you\u2019ve been following the multi-year debacle in the Bitcoin community, you may have heard of two Bitcoin-specific scaling solutions known as SegWit and the 2 megabyte (MB) block size increase.Both of these solutions aim to solve the Bitcoin-specific issue where the Bitcoin-blockchain has a built-in hard limit of 1 megabyte (MB) per block, which caps the number of transactions that can be added to a block. As a result, Bitcoin has been facing delays (sometimes hours and even days) in processing and confirming transactions for a while now. Similarly, as we saw in the previous section, Ethereum also faces limitations in its ability to scale.Until we figure out how to scale the blockchain, we\u2019re limited to how fast and wide the use cases can actually grow. So let\u2019s take a look at some solutions on the table.Proposed solution #1: SegWit (Bitcoin-only)Every Bitcoin transaction contains:InputSender\u2019s previous transaction detailsSender\u2019s unique private key (i.e. `scriptSig`) which verifies that the sender has the right amount (based on their previous transactions) to make the transactionOutputAmount to sendRecipient\u2019s public address (i.e. `ScriptPubKey`)Out of these elements, the digital signature (`scriptSig`) is the largest in terms of size, accounting for ~60\u201370% of the transaction. Still, signatures are only needed at validation time.Segregated witness (also commonly known as Segwit) is solution to separate (i.e. \u201csegregate\u201d ) transaction signatures (i.e. \u201cwitnesses\u201d) from the rest of the transaction data. The signature is stripped off from within the input and moved to a structure towards the end of a transaction.Moreover, with SegWit, the witnesses are moved to a new \u201cwitness\u201d field in the transaction data, which allows for us to change the way block sizes are calculated. The block size limit is no longer measured in bytes. Instead, blocks and transactions are given a new metric called \u201cweight\u201d that correspond to the demand they place on node resources. Specifically, each byte of a segregated witness is given a weight of 1, each other byte in a block is given a weight of 4, and the maximum allowed weight of a block is 4 million, which allows a block containing SegWit transactions to hold more data than allowed by the current maximum block size. This would effectively increase the limit from 1 MB limit to a little under 4 MB, giving us a ~70% increase in transactions.SegWit also solves other issues besides scalability, such as transaction malleability and increased security (which I won\u2019t go into here since it\u2019s not related to scalability.)Proposed solution #2: 2 MB Block size (Bitcoin-only)While one side of the Bitcoin community (the users) strongly support SegWit, the other side of the community (the miners) prefers a hard fork that would change the 1 MB block size limit to 2 MB (Keep in mind that the 1 MB limit cannot be modified without a hard fork). The basic idea is simple: by increasing the block size, it would allow for more transactions to fit in each block, allowing the network to handle more transactions per second.Plans of this block size increase have long been a subject of heated debate in the Bitcoin community, and have gained increasing attention since the beginning of 2015, when the size of blocks started to approach the current hard limit of 1 MB.Proposed solution #3: Off-chain state\u00a0channelsState channels are essentially a mechanism by which blockchain interactions that could and would normally occur on the blockchain instead get conducted off of the blockchain. This is done in a cryptographically secure way without increasing the risk of any participant, while providing significant improvements in cost and speed. I personally believe state channels will be a critical part of scaling blockchain technologies to support higher levels of use.\u00a0\u00a0A state channel works as follows:Part of the blockchain state is locked via multi-signature or some sort of smart contract, where the only way to update it is if a specific set of participants agree completely.Participants make updates amongst themselves by constructing and cryptographically signing transactions without submitting it to the blockchain. Each new update overrides previous updates.At some later point, participants submit the state back to the blockchain, which closes the state channel and unlocks the state again.Steps 1 and 3 involve blockchain operations which are published to the network, pay fees and wait for confirmations. However, Step 2 does not involve the blockchain at all. It can contain an unlimited number of updates and can remain open indefinitely. In this sense, the blockchain is used purely as a settlement layer to process the final transaction of a series of interactions for the final settlement, which helps lifts the burden from the underlying blockchain.At any point during the process, any participant can send a transaction into the contract to close the channel and start a settlement procedure. This starts a time limit within which participants can submit transactions, and the transaction with the highest sequence number is processed. If one of the participants leaves or tries to cheat, another one can at any time publish the latest transaction to the blockchain to finalize the state, assuming all the participants completely agree on the\u00a0state.Not only is transactional capacity increased with state channels, but they also provide two other very important benefits: increased speed and lower fees. Because a majority of the transactions are happening off-chain, payments can be handled instantaneously since updates between two parties that happen off-blockchain don\u2019t require the extra time to be processed and verified by the network. Secondly, payments also incur lower fees because only a small number of on-chain transactions are needed to secure the settlement state channels, while a majority of the transactions are happening off-chain without fees.There are several different implementations of this. For example, Lightning Network is a decentralized network that uses state channels via smart contracts to enable instant and scalable payments across a network of participants. Initially, Lightning Network was created for Bitcoin, but it seems now that they allow for transactions across blockchains as well.Raiden Network is the Ethereum analogy of the Lightning network. Raiden Network also leverages off-chain state networks to extend Ethereum with scalable and instant transactions.Proposed solution #4:\u00a0ShardingSharding in the blockchain world is similar to database sharding in traditional software systems. With traditional databases, a shard is a horizontal partition of the data in a database, where each shard is stored on a separate database server instance. This helps spread the load across different servers.Similarly, with blockchain sharding, the overall state of the blockchain is separated into different shards, and each part of the state would be stored by different nodes in the network.A single\u00a0shardTop level diagram of blockchain sharding\u00a0[6]Transactions that occur on the network are directed to different nodes depending on which shards they affect. Each shard only processes a small part of the state and does so in parallel. In order to communicate between shards, there needs to be some message-passing mechanism.There are various ways to implement message-passing. In Ethereum\u2019s case, the approach they are taking is a \u201creceipt\u201d paradigm: when a transaction within a shard executes, it can change the state of its own local shard, while also generating \u201creceipts\u201d, which are stored in some sort of distributed shared memory that can later be viewed (but not modified) by other shards.Ethereum\u2019s receipt paradigm\u00a0[1]Ethereum\u2019s receipt paradigm\u00a0[6]Overall, sharding the blockchain requires us to create a network where every node only processes a small portion of all transactions, while still maintaining high security\u2026 A difficult challenge to say the least.Why?Well, for one, the blockchain protocol assumes that all nodes in the network don\u2019t trust each other. Still, the transactions need to agree on a common state despite being processed on different computers. Since each node does not trust one other, it is not enough for a node processing transactions on shard A to simply say to the nodes processing transactions on shard B that a transaction occurred; rather, it would need to prove it to them somehow.Additionally, since the goal of sharding is to not have every node validating every transaction, we need to figure out a mechanism that determines which nodes validate which shard in a secure way, without creating opportunities for an attacker who might have a lot of power in the system to disrupt the network.Another reason it\u2019s difficult to implement sharding is because a transaction executed on the blockchain can depend on any part of the previous state in the blockchain, which makes it challenging to do things in parallel. Moreover, with parallelization, you now need a fool proof way to mitigate with race conditions and the like.There\u2019s a lot more technical goodies to how sharding will be implemented in Ethereum\u200a\u2014\u200ain particular, how to use \u201ccryptoeconomic incentives\u201d to drive actors in a system to not cheat (in this case, ensuring that nodes are passing on valid information to other nodes)\u200a\u2014\u200awhich I hope to explore in a future post.Proposed solution #5:\u00a0PlasmaPlasma was very recently introduced and is among the more promising proposed solutions to scalable computation on the blockchain.Plasma is essentially a series of contracts that run on top of a root blockchain (i.e. the main Ethereum blockchain). The root blockchain enforces the validity of the state in the Plasma chains using something called \u201cfraud proofs\u201d. (Note: Fraud proofs are a mechanism by which nodes can determine if a block is invalid using mathematical proofs).Source: Plasma WhitepaperThe blockchains are composed into a tree hierarchy, and each branch is treated as a blockchain that has its own blockchain history and computations that are map-reducable. We call the child chains \u201cPlasma blockchains\u201d, each of which are a chain within a blockchain.Source: Plasma WhitepaperThe Plasma blockchain does not disclose the contents of the blockchain on the root chain (e.g. Ethereum). Instead, only the blockheader hashes are submitted on the root chain, which is enough to determine validity of the block. If there is proof of fraud submitted on the root chain, then the block is rolled back and the block creator is penalized. In other words, we only submit data to root chain in Byzantine conditions.As a result, the root blockchain processes only a tiny amount of commitments from child blockchains, which in turn decreases the amount of data passed onto the root blockchain and allows for a much larger number of computations.Source: Plasma WhitepaperIn addition, data is only propagated to those who wish to validate a particular state. This makes contract executions more scalable by eliminating the need for every node to watch every chain. Instead, they only watch the ones they are economically impacted by in order to enforce correct behavior and penalize fraud. Fraud proofs allows any party to enforce invalid blocks and ensure that all state transitions are validated.Additionally, if there is an attack on a particular chain, participants can rapidly and cheaply do a mass-exit from the corrupt child chain.Source: Plasma WhitepaperSource: Plasma WhitepaperPlasma might seem similar to state channels implementations (e.g. Lightning Network) that handle transactions off chain. The main difference between state channels and Plasma is that with Plasma, not all participants need to be online to update state. Moreover, the participants do not need to submit data to the root blockchain in order to participate and confirm transactions.The neat part about Plasma is that state channel type solutions like Lightning Network could be the main interface layer for rapid financial payments/contracts on top of Plasma, while Plasma maintains updates to the state with minimal root chain state commitments.Source: Plasma WhitepaperThere\u2019s a lot of intricate details to this solution that I hope to delve into a future post.Proposed solution #6: Off-chain computations (e.g.\u00a0TrueBit)TrueBit is an example of a solution that uses off-chain computations to enable scalable transactions among Ethereum smart contracts. Essentially, just like state channels, TrueBit uses a layer outside the blockchain to do the heavy lifting. In other words, its a system that verifiably executes computations off-chain that would be otherwise prohibitively expensive to execute on-chain. It works like this:Instead of every node participating, specific participants in the network, called \u201cSolvers,\u201d perform the computations made by smart contracts and submit a solution to the problem, along with a deposit. If the Solver is correct, then the solver is rewarded and the deposit returned. Otherwise, if the Solver cheated, the deposit is forfeited and any dispute is resolved on the blockchain using the \u201cVerification Game\u201d.The Verification Games goes like this: You have a set of participants in the network called \u201cVerifiers\u201d who check the Solvers\u2019 work off the blockchain. If no Verifier signals an error, then the system accepts the solution. If a Verifier does dispute the correctness of the Solver\u2019s solution, the game proceeds in a series of rounds to settle the dispute on the blockchain, where \u201cJudges\u201d in the network with limited computational power adjudicate all disputes. The system is built to ensure that the work done by the Judges on the blockchain is small compared to the work required to perform the actual task off the blockchain.At the end of this game, if the Solver was in fact cheating, it will be discovered and punished. If not, then the Challenger will pay for the resources consumed by the false alarm.A very rough diagram of off-chain computations as proposed by\u00a0TrueBitLastly, in order to convince Verifiers that bugs actually exist and that it\u2019s worth their effort to try to find those bugs, TrueBit does something interesting where it occasionally forces Solvers to submit incorrect solutions, which reverses the normal system incentives: the Solver gets paid for submitting an incorrect solution and penalized for submitting a correct one. This ensures there\u2019s always a reward in the system for Verifiers who are validating transactions.In summary, the protocol allows anyone to post a computational task, and anyone else to receive a reward for completing it, while the system\u2019s incentive structure guarantees the correctness of returned solutions. And by moving the computations and verification process off the Ethereum blockchain into a separate protocol, it can scale to large numbers of computations without being constrained by Ethereum\u2019s gas limit.Other proposed solutions to blockchain scalability.There are a few other proposals floating around the crypto community that I find interesting. While the solutions are not directly aimed at solving scalability, they help indirectly address some scalability problems more easily.Proof of\u00a0stakeSimilar to Proof-of-work, Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism which underpins security of the blockchain by preventing doublespend.In traditional Proof-of-Work based blockchains, miners maintain the integrity of the blockchain data by racing to solve computation-intensive, Proof-of-work mathematical puzzles in exchange for rewards. In this regard, they help validate transactions with their CPU power, and the more CPU power you have the proportionately larger your ability to influence the network is. In Proof-of-Stake, stakeholders vote with their \u201cdollars\u201d (in Ethereum\u2019s case, ether) instead of compute power.How does this work exactly?The blockchain keeps track of certain validating nodes, called \u201cvalidators\u201d, who must place a security deposit (which is referred to as \u201cbonding\u201d) in order to take part in validating the blocks. If a validator produces anything that the protocol considers \u201cinvalid\u201d in a crypto-graphically provable manner, their deposit AND the privilege of participating in the consensus process is forfeited. If they bet correctly, they earn their deposit back along with transaction fees.Effectively, the validators make money by betting with the eventual consensus and lose money by betting against the consensus. An analogy can be made to Proof-of-work where each miner is betting with their hash power on which block will be accepted. If they bet wrong in order to cheat the system, then any block they produce will be orphaned, causing them to lose money.There are several different kinds of Proof-of-stake consensus algorithms as well as different mechanisms for assigning rewards to validators, which I won\u2019t go into in this post.How does Proof-of-Stake help scalability?One example is with sharding. Sharding with Proof-of-work is tricky to do securely. Recall that with sharding, we split up the validation responsibility among many nodes so that every node doesn\u2019t have to process everything. However, Proof-of-work is implemented to be completely anonymous, which poses a problem because even if a single shard is secured by only a small portion of a miners hashpower, an attacker can direct all of their hashpower toward attacking this shard and disrupt the network. For example, let\u2019s say we have two shards, A and B. A has 90% of the hashpower and B has 10%. A can attack B with only 5.1% of the total hashpower (by virtue of the majority 51% attack).This changes with Ethereum\u2019s current Proof-of-Stake proposal because it is designed such that validators have known identities (i.e. Ethereum addresses). Knowing their identities allows us to solve this type of targeted attack by randomly choosing a set of nodes from the entire set of validators to process any given set of transactions on a shard, which makes it impossible for an attacker to specifically target any particular shard.Another reason Proof-of-stake helps scalability (specifically for Ethereum) is because unlike Proof-of-work which issues new tokens for miners who validate blocks, in Proof-of-Stake, validators will likely be earning only transaction fees. As a result, they have an incentive to increase the block \u201cgas limit\u201d (because it earns them more fee while also fitting more transactions in each block), if their validation server can handle the load. The caveat is that validators will only raise gas limit to a point that is tolerable by the other validators, because otherwise they get reduced returns from causing other, slower validators to fall out of sync.Blockchain rentAnother Ethereum-specific solution is \u201cBlockchain rent\u201d [5]. Blockchain rent is a solution that aims to reduce the amount of data that is stored on the network in order to help speed up transaction times. With Ethereum, users pay for computational steps, memory, transaction logs, and permanent storage. While most of these are resources are paid for in a properly incentivized manner, the claim here is that storage is not.In the current system, users only pay for bytes of storage. However, in reality, we can make the argument that storage is different from the other resources because it is stored forever permanently in the blocks. Instead, blockchain rent proposes to set the cost of storage to be `bytes x time`. This way, there\u2019s an incentive built into the protocol to keep the network lighter and reduce transaction times.Decentralized storageAnother solution for keeping the network lighter is using a decentralized storage service such as Swarm. Swarm is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol for Ethereum that lets you store application code and data off the main blockchain in swarm nodes, which are connected to Ethereum blockchain, and later exchange this data on the blockchain\u00a0.The basic premise here is that instead of nodes storing everything on the blockchain, they only store data that is more frequently requested locally and leave other data on the \u201ccloud\u201d via Swarm.A very rough diagram of decentralized storage using\u00a0SwarmThere\u2019s more, but for the sake of brevity (this post is getting quite long!), I\u2019ll leave those out for now\u00a0:)ConclusionThis topic is monstrously complex, but I hope this post was useful in giving you a big-picture idea of why scalability matters in blockchain, and how it might be solved.This is not be a comprehensive list of by any means, and I\u2019ll be following up on this topic as research progresses. I personally doubt that there\u2019ll be a single silver bullet answer to scalability\u2026 but I believe some combination of approaches will eventually solve the issue and allow blockchain applications to leap forward.As always, don\u2019t hesitate to correct any mistakes I\u2019ve made, or start a (healthy) discussion in the comments.\u00a0\u00a0 Happy blockchaining!\u00a0;)", "responses": "138"}, {"title": "Introducing WorkChain.io: The Blockchain Solution for the Future of Payroll\u200a\u2014\u200aMake Everyday\u00a0Payday", "author_name": "Ivan Petrovic", "link": "https://medium.com/workchain-io/introducing-workchain-io-the-blockchain-solution-for-the-future-of-work-89df3ba9e2ea?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 4, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "45K", "content": "Introducing WorkChain.io: The Blockchain Solution for the Future of Payroll\u200a\u2014\u200aMake Everyday\u00a0PaydayIvan PetrovicBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 4, 2018WorkChain.io has a singular aim: to make earning cryptocurrency possible for anyone who receives a paycheck.We give workers instant access to their paycheck the moment they clock out. It\u2019s their earnings on their terms\u200a\u2014\u200atrue financial control that everyone deserves. And by automating the entire work to paycheck flow on the blockchain, we free employers from payroll processing time and costs.And, as you\u2019re about to find out, we\u2019re not just a whitepaper or a concept. We\u2019re a fully functioning platform.What Are the Problems with Today\u2019s Payroll that WorkChain.io Solves?WorkersAnyone who\u2019s ever received a paycheck knows the frustration of waiting two-to-four weeks for it to arrive. You do the work but don\u2019t see a dime for your efforts for weeks. All the while bills, rent, car payments and an assortment of other life expenses pile up. This outdated payroll cycle is a relic of the Industrial Age.Not only is getting paid bi-weekly or monthly completely out of touch with the on-demand, real-time way we work, it places major financial pressure on people. It strips them of financial control, leaving them unable to truly manage their finances, often leading to a cycle of debt.In fact, 78 percent of U.S. workers live paycheck to paycheck and 28% of workers are distracted at work due to financial stress.EmployersOn the other side of the payroll process, employers deal with labor-intensive, inefficient and costly payroll processing. Standard payroll comes with a heavy reliance on banks and third-party processors, leading to constant fees, administration and delays.Payroll is also extremely expensive too. In-house payroll costs on average between $722 and $1165 per employee per year. And outsourcing payroll to processors only cuts payrolls costs down by\u00a027%.The Solution: How WorkChain.io Brings Payroll into Real-timeWorkChain.io uses blockchain technology to create a seamless system for automating payroll and delivering paychecks on-demand and in real-time with cryptocurrency payouts using a stable coin such as TrueUSD. It does this by connecting with established HR systems to verify an individual\u2019s work, shift or hours on the blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200athen instantly releasing earnings connected with the work.WorkChain.io takes the manual work out of payroll by building verified work records on the blockchain, eliminating much of the administration and cost associated with processing payroll.How It\u00a0Works1.

It\u2019s also our responsibility to help mitigate the damage that would be caused by the technology\u2019s adoption.I\u2019m writing this because I\u2019ve been working on blockchain architecture for around 3 years and I have become very concerned about the risks that blockchains pose to society.The blockchain space has generated a lot of hype about how it can improve the lives of its users, and how it might positively impact society. Unfortunately, on the other hand, it has produced very little discussion about the harms (accidental or deliberate) that can arise from the use and abuse of blockchain technology.BackgroundThe blockchain\u2019s security makes it a source of trust because it\u2019s difficult for anyone to influence the blockchain. On the other hand, that same security makes it equally difficult for anyone to interfere with the blockchain to prevent harm.I\u2019m going to give some concrete examples to illustrate that the same properties that make the blockchain potentially useful also make it potentially dangerous.Censorship resistanceCensorship resistance is one of the blockchain\u2019s most important security properties. It can be an invaluable tool for people targeted by totalitarian regimes. People can communicate political speech and share logistical information that might not be possible otherwise. Censorship resistance can help keep political power in check.On the other hand, censorship is actually important for preventing many forms of online abuse. For example, imagine if you were unable to un-tag yourself from an embarrassing photo that someone posted to Facebook without your consent. The right to be forgotten, which allows people to stop their personal information from being searchable. But this right cannot necessarily be guaranteed on a censorship resistant blockchain.Financial freedomBy providing potentially everyone \u201cwith a Swiss bank in [their] pocket\u201d, blockchain technology may be able to dramatically improve global financial inclusion and freedom. It will potentially allow anyone to safely save and transmit money. Ubiquitous access to financial services can help alleviate poverty on a global scale.On the other hand, the same financial freedom can pose critical threats to a government\u2019s ability to enforce its policy goals. Goals like tax collection, enforcing capital controls, and preventing terrorism financing may be challenged by the possible success of blockchain technology. Very notably, the US Government\u2019s ability to enforce international economic sanctions may also be at risk.New kinds of organizationsWe are more-or-less used to organizing via legal institutions like the corporation. New kinds of organizations are becoming possible thanks to the blockchain. These organizations may use the blockchain simply as a way of communicating or transmitting money, and they also may have some of their rules enforced by the blockchain. The DAO, for example, allowed thousands of people from across the globe to pool their money together and to collectively decide what to do with it.But this new technology may also enable organizations with nefarious goals. Cyber criminals who infect their victim\u2019s computers with ransomware are able to accept ransom payments without fear of having their accounts shut down or their payments reverted, thanks to the blockchain. Commission-based ransomware is able to distribute commission payments to criminals within a larger network. This effectively permits new forms of criminal organization. In a similar way, dark net marketplaces have facilitated an ecosystem of new criminal enterprises. This is new enough that it\u2019s hard to imagine how exactly criminal organizations will take advantage of the blockchain.Moving forwardThese examples only scratch the surface. I hope they can provide a starting point for a very broad conversation about the potential negative impact of blockchain technology on society.I think this conversation is critical for the responsible and ethical deployment of blockchain technology. Being mindful of risks, of course, is not enough to mitigate them.

Some of our investments in this space include DaWanda, Delivery Hero, DocPlanner, and more recently StarOfService or Storefront. At the same time, we have been following closely the advent of blockchain technology, and led two investments in blockchain-based companies with Bitbond and Chainalysis. The aim of this post is to make use of our expertise in marketplaces to seize the potential of blockchain technology within the marketplace landscape.In a nutshell, our theory so far is that it can impact marketplaces in 3 ways:First, a new generation of marketplaces based on blockchain technologies could emerge, and disrupt industries.Second, some new products based on blockchain technology could become an integral part of existing marketplace stacks and drive incremental business efficiency.Lastly, they could provide a solution to tamper marketplaces\u2019 network effects and prevent marketplaces\u2019 operators from extracting too much value from their users.Platform thinking in the marketplace worldWe thought a good way to start was the simple and very good framework created by Sangeet Paul Choudary in his book Platform Thinking. This framework provides a way to analyze any online platform, in this case a marketplace. Choudary views a marketplace as a combination of three main components:(We\u2019ll deconstruct this framework with some of the bricks that are interesting when we think about blockchain technology. The bricks mentioned below do not constitute an exhaustive description.)A network of\u00a0usersBuyers and sellers active in the marketplace. The role of any marketplace\u2019s operator is to reduce friction in order to facilitate transactions within this network. There many actionable ways to reduce frictions, but 3 stand out as important pieces when we try to measure the impact of blockchain technology in the marketplace world:Increasing the level of trust either by playing the role of a trusted third-party or by leveraging user reviewsImproving the matching between buyers and sellersImproving marketplace\u2019s UX and UI.An infrastructure layerThe technical pieces that marketplace operators need to build to enable these transactions. These are not always visible to users, but it always includes:A protocol to exchange value or a payment infrastructure (eg. Paypal or Stripe)A protocol to exchange data (eg. TCP)A hosting platform (most of the time AWS, Azure or another cloud service provider).A data\u00a0layer:Any data stored on:UsersPast transactionsGoods or services sold on the marketplaces.The data layer fuels most current marketplaces\u2019 efficiency. For example, a better and more granular understanding of each user allows marketplace operators to build a better matching experience. User reviews and historical transactions increase the level of trust. They are also the core of a marketplaces\u2019 reputation systems.Let\u2019s quickly review Choudary\u2019s three examples to make each of these pieces clearer:Craigslist stores almost no data on their users and relies on a very simple infrastructure. The whole value of Craigslist lies within its very large network of buyers and sellers.AirBnB in its early days was a case in point of a successful vertical marketplace. They leveraged a smaller community of people (hence a smaller network) interested in only one service: accommodation. The members of this community were matched more efficiently thanks to an improved technology infrastructure and a more granular understanding of their users based on data.Since then, they have done such a great job in reducing friction that they can now rely on a network that is probably as large as Craigslist\u2019s and have stored an incredible amount of data on their users and their past transactions.", "responses": "10"}, {"title": "Blockchain: how mining works and transactions are processed in seven\u00a0steps", "author_name": "Jimi S.", "link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/how-a-miner-adds-transactions-to-the-blockchain-in-seven-steps-856053271476?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 2, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "2.4K", "content": "Blockchain: how mining works and transactions are processed in seven\u00a0stepsJimi S.BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 2, 2018Ever wondered how the mining process on a blockchain works, or how your transaction gets confirmed and is added to the blockchain? So have I. And since I couldn\u2019t find any clear step by step explanation of this process, I decided to write one myself. Here is how a blockchain transaction is processed on a blockchain, in seven steps.(visit r/BlockchainSchool for more easy to understand blockchain explanations)Step 1: A user signs off on a transaction from their wallet application, attempting to send a certain crypto or token from them to someone else.Step 2: The transaction is broadcasted by the wallet application and is now waiting to be picked up by a miner on the according blockchain. As long as it is not picked up, it hovers in a \u2018pool of unconfirmed transactions\u2019. This pool is a collection of unconfirmed transactions on the network that are waiting to be processed. These unconfirmed transactions are usually not collected in one giant pool, but more often in small subdivided local pools.Step 3: Miners on the network (sometimes referred to as nodes, but not quite the same!) select transactions from these pools and form them into a \u2018block\u2019. A block is basically a collection of transactions (at this moment in time, still unconfirmed transactions), in addition to some extra metadata. Every miner constructs their own block of transactions. Multiple miners can select the same transaction to be included in their block.Example: two miners, miner A and miner B. Both miner A and miner B can decide to include transaction X into their block. Each blockchain has its own maximum block size. On the Bitcoin blockchain, the maximum block size is 1 MB of data. Before adding a transaction to their block, a miner needs to check if the transaction is eligible to be executed according to the blockchain history. If the sender\u2019s wallet balance has sufficient funds according to the existing blockchain history, the transaction is considered valid and can be added to the block. Miners will usually prioritise transactions that have a high transaction fee set, because this provides them a higher reward.Step 4: By selecting transactions and adding them to their block, miners create a block of transactions. To add this block of transactions to the blockchain (to have all other miners and nodes register the transactions), the block first needs a signature (also referred to as a proof of work). This signature is created by solving a very complex mathematical problem that is unique to each block of transactions. Each block has a different mathematical problem, so every miner will work on a different problem unique to the block they built. All of these problems are equally hard to solve. In order to solve this mathematical problem, a lot of computational power is used (and thus a lot of electricity). You could compare it to running a calculation on a calculator, only much heavier and on a desktop. This is the process referred to as mining.

There has been massive speculation that Ethereum will be able to scale before 2020, with Casper, Plasma and Sharding.The time taken to process \u2018shard\u2019 blocks, those split up between groups of computers, would be around ten seconds, Buterin suggested back in April. You can read more about Sharding here.Ethereum developers have sought ways of providing on-chain scaling improvements for some time, but there is a sense now that the second phase of the ETH blockchain is approaching, maybe even faster than anticipated.Bitcoin Exchange\u00a0GuideTowards a World of Decentralized GovernanceAll these neat quotes about the world-computer and smart contracts going mainstream are great, but dApp platforms are still maturing. Ethereum Foundation\u2019s co-founder Joseph Lubin has a lot to offer on how Ethereum is evolving, and was recently quoted at the Rise conference.He spoke on an interesting panel whose participants were the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s co-founder himself Joseph Lubin, CEO of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital Mike Novgoratz, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek, Tenx\u2019s Julian Hosp, and Wall Street Journal columnist Jacky Wong.Lubin mentioned that he believes the ETH blockchain is currently transition from phase one to phase two, where new layers are being built on top of the decentralized core. According to Lubin, the fundamental layer one of the blockchain has now been well established.Although we\u2019re still in the early stages of Ethereum, the community is filled with some of the smartest minds in tech, to quote Raul Jordan, Ethereum is also attracting the most daily active developers in blockchain. Ethereum might not have the global recognition of Bitcoin, which had essentially a 5-year head start plus being the first-mover, however Ethereum is a platform that spawned and continues to produce a lot of blockchain innovation, startups, altcoins and thus attracts software developers to the \u201cnew\u201d space.From Decentralized Foundations to Scalable\u00a0ProductsLubin characterizes layer two systems as those becoming more mature, with various on-, side-, or off- chain mechanisms that enable and will partake in greater scalability.If Ethereum is meant to be a world-computer, it\u2019s envisioned Ethereum will have thousands of transactions in the layer two systems that should be ramified in 2018.Sharding, Plasma and Casper are coming to the ETH blockchainPlasma as a Layer Two\u00a0SolutionLubin gave the example of Plasma, which is an on-chain scaling solution for Ethereum. This was introduced back in August 2017 by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon, creator of Bitcoin\u2019s own Lightning Network, which could also be thought of as a \u201clayer two\u201d solution.How Lubin conceptualizes all of this is super insightful. He went on: unlike the early internet, which started \u201cnarrow,\u201d he added, blockchain is starting out with a \u201cvery broad\u201d offering for potential applications.The blockchain is like quantum computing, a new kind of potential in technology; just as AI is in a formative stage of its development. If dApp are just five year sold, imagine what they will become in five more years?Many see Ethereum is the real driver of innovation in the space now. Ethereum fueling an incredible array of ICOs in 2017, is a catalyst that\u2019s itself working hard to mature, and is to blockchain innovation as a form of \u201ccrypto-fuel\u201d for decentralized ecosystems.That\u2019s quite a more salient role to the evolution of blockchain, than say, Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is widely seen as more of a crypto Gold; a kind of crypto asset that has incredible price volatility and serves as a kind of baseline for the value of the cryptocurrency market as a whole.Uncertainty is the Time for Crypto\u00a0IdealismIf Ethereum's world computer means a moving away from \u201cfrictional analog contexts\u201d, Ethereum\u2019s partnerships in the Cloud with the likes of Amazon are also incredibly symbolic.Here is the ecosystem, the platform, that has the most value and enterprise partnerships that is also a cocoon for blockchain startups to demonstrate products that can integrate with the real world. Ethereum in this sense, is indeed like the \u201cether\u201d where blockchain innovation and crypto-innovation can take place. It\u2019s another layer of digital creation that was previous not possible.All to say that Ethereum is evolving and attempting to scale faster. Who knows if fungible digital tokens will overhaul existing systems and serve all aspects of the global economy? Would governments, tech companies and regulators allow it? Could consumers veto them? It\u2019s unlikely, but even the likes of PayPal and Alibaba are wracking up the blockchain patents, so who knows. The war of the future works in mysterious ways.A Paradigm Shift in Collective Infrastructure and\u00a0PowerIf places like Malta and South Korea lead the way in legal reform acknowledging cryptocurrencies, places like Singapore and China are the birthplace of some of the most interesting blockchain startups. Ethereum is by default, a leader in a global movement.Whatever \u201cnatively digital world\u201d that\u2019s manifesting, whether it be an algorithmic hierarchy, or an unchecked use of AI by corporations or facial recognition nets by Governments, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s almost beyond our means to \u201cregulate\u201d in any effective way, as progress is occurring too fast on too many fronts simultaneously\u200a\u2014\u200athis is only bound to accelerate in the 2020s, and even faster in the 2030s.Indeed, it\u2019s likely our fundamental pillars and institutions like voting, democracy, capitalism, banking, and how to regulate corporate monopolies needs to be entirely rethought and redone. What does 3D-printing do to the construction industry or retail? What does quantum computing do to the cloud? What do dApp platforms do for democracy? We\u2019re starving for upgrades, and we\u2019re going to see them with accelerated returns.If Ethereum is a pioneer of blockchain, what that represents is bigger than whatever ETH becomes. Just as Bitcoin showed the world what distributed ledgers could do\u200a\u2014\u200a, and indeed if Ethereum is not a security (SEC), consumer utility tokens may offer \u201ca whole new model for delivering services and products to consumers. The way we investing in the future is changing, and the values of young people disadvantaged in an economic system that is stacked against them also is an environmental press that is bound to transform basically all infrastructures, industries and business verticals.It turns out the world-computer is at the center of a revolution that\u2019s going to take decades to come. Technology is undergoing a convergence that will combine blockchain, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and economics with business models and companies yet to be invented.", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "Blockchain Technology Is Set to Disrupt Every Industry\u200a\u2014\u200aand Music Is\u00a0Next", "author_name": "Nicolas Cole", "link": "https://medium.com/@nicolascole77/blockchain-technology-is-set-to-disrupt-every-industry-and-music-is-next-6479b4340b15?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 27, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "2.2K", "content": "Blockchain Technology Is Set to Disrupt Every Industry\u200a\u2014\u200aand Music Is\u00a0NextNicolas ColeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 27, 2018Nicolas Cole InstagramWhat is happening today with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is how I imagine the dot-com gold rush in the 90s felt.Since I was too young to experience those years (I was 5 years old), I am paying extra close attention to what is happening today. And for those that don\u2019t realize it yet, Bitcoin and Ethereum are quickly changing the world. Age-old industries are being disrupted, the first (and potentially most foundational industry of all) being money.Anyone who thinks Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are just a fad falls into the same category of people who thought \u201cthat Internet thing\u201d was just a fad back in the 90s.That\u2019s what makes these innovations so interesting is that they seem to be eliciting all the same reactions, meanwhile showing all the same signs of future success. Remember when we thought the concept of sending each other pictures over the Internet was \u201ccrazy\u201d and would \u201cnever happen?\u201d I swear, I have a family video from the early 90s of my uncle showing my dad his brand new laptop, and making a joke that one day they would press a button and the digital photo would just appear on the other person\u2019s laptop.They both started laughing\u200a\u2014\u200aas if that would never happen.And then it happened just a few years\u00a0later.That\u2019s what\u2019s happening today with blockchain technology.It\u2019s so dense and do difficult to explain (similar to the concept of the Internet back in the 90s) that it has yet to really become a mainstream topic of consideration. But to those paying close attention, blockchain has all the potential in the world to disrupt some very old, very big industries: banking, big pharma, insurance, voting, and entertainment, to name a few.Here\u2019s what interests me about blockchain technology and the entertainment industry:How many times have we heard the infamous case study of a band being signed to a major label, only to sue them (and usually their manager) a few years later after realizing they\u2019d been skimped on millions of dollars in royalties?That has been happening since the days of Elvis.What\u2019s interesting about blockchain technology is that, by using what are called \u201csmart contracts,\u201d those contracts are executed on automatically through the blockchain. So, if a band signs to a label and their contract states that they receive 70% of every dollar made, with the label receiving 30%, those distributions happen every time a dollar enters the door\u200a\u2014\u200aassuming all of this is being done on the blockchain. No more relying on a person to count the dollars. No more trusting other people to deliver on the contract. It all happens on the blockchain, and is validated through math.The whole idea behind blockchain technology is trust. Transparency. Everything is out in the open, and anything that gets processed through the blockchain can be seen and validated by anyone on the blockchain.Take that concept, and you can see why this is such threatening technology to such big industries. A lot happens behind closed doors, so to put it all out into the open is groundbreaking, to say the least.Another way that blockchain technology is impacting the music industry is with royalty distributions on digital platforms.As it stands, artists are victims of the system. If they want access to the massive user bases on Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, etc., then they have to be OK with getting paid pennies on the dollar for people to listen to their music. What an artist makes on these streaming platforms is nothing compared to what artists in the 90s made on CD sales.One startup that is looking to tackle this issue with blockchain technology is called OPUS, a streaming platform for artists to upload their music and receive 98% of the revenue. For those that don\u2019t know, 98% is unheard of, and is leagues above what an artist would make selling their music on Apple Music, for example.The idea behind OPUS is to solve for three massive issues in the music business: revenue share, censorship, and transparency. This is the beauty of using blockchain technology, because all three of those can be delivered on. The revenue share issue is solved by giving artists 98% of all royalties, the censorship issue because the power remains in the artists hands, and the transparency issue because labels can no longer hide money from the artists. And because it is built on the blockchain, none of these parameters can be changed down the road\u200a\u2014\u200awhereas other services may decide one day to cut the percentage given to artists.OPUS is currently raising funds through an ICO to continue working toward this vision of artist empowerment.When you look at the landscape of digital music, I really do believe decentralizing the industry is the next logical step. Even SoundCloud, one of the most popular streaming platforms on the Internet, has reported that they are quickly running out of cash and exploring potential acquisition deals (not so much out of choice, but by necessity) because artists have no way to monetize their audiences. But with something like OPUS, artists still have to do the heavy lifting of marketing their own music, except they\u2019re more handsomely rewarded for their efforts.Blockchain technology will fundamentally change the way business is done in industries all over the world.

So many excellent BPs which, by almost all accounts, add tremendous value to the EOS community are currently being squeezed outside of the Top 21. At the same time, BPs that lack basic governance disclosures, have added less in terms of value-add tools for the community, or who have only formally announced their candidacy within the last two weeks, are experiencing incredible voting support and have a place among the Top 21.What is going on? It\u2019s a little concerning, isn\u2019t it?As someone who is quite dialed-in to the EOS \u201cscene\u201d and spends a lot of time analyzing and reviewing Block Producers, I find myself asking: am I missing something? Are these BPs doing something special that I just don\u2019t know about? What could a BP possibly have done in the last two weeks to justify their positioning in the Top 21 and rank above so many others who have contributed so well for so long?And almost everybody I\u2019ve spoken to about it is thinking the same thing. But nobody is talking about it\u200a\u2014\u200aat least not openly.Let\u2019s Call a Spade a\u00a0SpadeBy my estimation, there are about 15 to 20 EOS accounts (\u201centities\u201d is probably a better word) that actually move the needle when it comes to BP election. Collectively, these 15 to 20 entities make up about 50% (or 125 million) of the actual votes currently being cast on the network. I\u2019ve done quite a bit of research around this.There are literally 10+ million BP vote swings that occur daily based on the shuffling of account or proxy support by and for certain BPs. As a result, over the last week I\u2019ve watched several BPs go from being ranked among the Top 10 to now being ranked in position 21 to 30+. This means that not only is the distribution and positioning of top BPs quite volatile, but also having the support of just a few of these 15 to 20 accounts can \u201cmake or break\u201d a BP, at least in the short-term.So, who do these accounts belong to? Well, that is the million dollar question and of course we don\u2019t quite know (although, we could speculate) because, for the most part, there is no human-form identity attached to the accounts themselves.As many of us know, those who hold the most tokens on the EOS mainnet also hold the most power to elect Block Producers. On EOS, 1 token currently equals 1 vote which can be cast for up to 30 Block Producers. The rationale for this has always been that those who have the most at stake and, therefore, the most to lose should have the biggest say in determining network operations. Theoretically, they should also be the ones who will work hardest to serve and protect the network given the investment that they\u2019ve made.In principle, this seems reasonable. But when you consider the disparity in token ownership that clearly exists, coupled with what could only be described as \u201chighly correlated voting patterns\u201d among groups of \u201csimilarly situated Block Producers,\u201d which results in a Top 21 that excludes some of the top BP contributors, we must ask ourselves: is this system currently working the way we wanted it to? And furthermore, do we want it to keep working this way?Before you answer, consider this: owning and operating a Block Producer is essentially like running a technology business, and it\u2019s expensive. The disparity in earnings between being, say, BP 21 and BP 22 is significant. In fact, a BP in position 22 will earn about 50% of what a BP in position 21 earns. And how does this impact tokenholders? Well, this means that the longer high value-add BPs are held outside of the Top 21, the more difficult it will become for those BPs to justify their own existence as a sustainable business and going concern. As a result, they will slowly disappear by shutting up shop or by moving to competing chains where they are more justly rewarded.And, of course, it\u2019s not just about the money. For BPs, there is understandably a huge pride element involved, borne out of the enormous dedication that many of them demonstrate on a daily basis to develop and support the EOS blockchain. It\u2019s as much about the perception of fairness and public recognition of valuable contributions being justly rewarded through the voting process as it is about the money.So What Should We Do About\u00a0It?Well, the good news is that the EOS blockchain is not going to just stop producing blocks any time soon because of this. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom. EOS is and will continue to be a leading blockchain platform in this space, and can certainly live up to its promise of being the world\u2019s most powerful infrastructure for decentralized applications.But what it does mean, in my opinion, is that as it stands EOS will never be the best EOS it can be if it doesn\u2019t course-correct on a system which is clearly being gamed. Slowly but surely, the integrity of the chain will be eroded and EOS will face the same centralization of mining issues that plague so many other blockchain networks.Finding a \u201cfix\u201d for this will be tricky and a silver bullet may not exist. If changes were to be made, great care must be taken to ensure that we don\u2019t over-correct and jump from the proverbial frying pan into the fire. However, I do want to put forward an idea for discussion which might help dilute some of the issues I\u2019ve described above.It\u2019s probably been the worst kept secret in the EOS community that Dan Larimer and Block.One are currently working on the ability to create individual biometric identities on the EOS blockchain. I\u2019m very interested in the ways we could use this technology to move us ever so slightly away from the \u201c1 EOS = 1 Vote\u201d concept, and closer to a \u201c1 Entity = 1 Vote\u201d concept. If we could manage this, I believe we would create a much more equitable distribution of Block Producers whereby performance, pay and the public perception are more appropriately aligned.How Could We Do\u00a0This?The purpose of this article was not to present a proposal or solution to the issues described. These issues are complex and sensitive, and I simply haven\u2019t spent enough time thinking about it to confidently put forward any kind of proposal at this stage. This said, for the sake of prompting further discussion and dialogue, here is an idea to consider to get the ball rolling:Update the EOS system contract to determine the election of Block Producers based on (1) the total number of votes received, and (2) the total number of unique identities that have voted.The only way this potential solution could work is if Dan Larimer and Block.One (or anyone else, for that matter) do, in fact, create the technology to establish on-chain biometric IDs. Under these criteria, the final positioning of Block Producers could be determined using a weighted allocation to each voting component, such as 75% / 25%, and could be calculated as follows:BP positioning based on total number of votes received: 4BP positioning based on total number of unique IDs that voted: 20Weighted BP ranking: (4 * 75%) + (20 * 25%) = Rank 8Under this system, the BP rank would simply be used to determine the relative positioning of all Block Producers, since not every weighted calculation will provide an integer as it has here. In situations where BPs are ranked the same based on this calculation, the total number of votes received could be used as a \u201ctie-breaker\u201d to determine final positioning.I realize that it will be extremely challenging to implement any proposal that disrupts the status quo for those at the top of pile. But that does not mean we should not try, and it does not mean that we should not lead by example. Let\u2019s not also forget that there are some extremely large tokenholders out there yet to cast their votes, and who could help get a proposal around this across the finish line.Wrapping UpIn its current form, I am concerned that the EOS mainnet has over-emphasized the \u201c1 EOS = 1 Vote\u201d concept to the extent that it\u2019s detrimental to the health and future of the network. Remember that in systems where most parties are inherently \u201cgood,\u201d it\u2019s also implied that some parties are inherently \u201cnot good\u201d and could look to take advantage of others\u2019 good nature. And if any of these \u201cnot good\u201d actors obtain considerable power, watch out.The point of this article was to air issues that almost everyone seems to think exist, but that nobody is really comfortable talking about. A fair and equitable distribution of BPs is essential for continued network strength, security and viability. It also helps to ensure that culturally we represent what EOS is: a global network built for a global community.From a BP\u2019s perspective, I can understand how it would be difficult to discuss these issues openly. It could easily be dismissed as \u201cwhining\u201d or just \u201csour grapes.\u201d But for tokenholders and proxy voters who are not in that position, I consider it our duty to have more open, honest and mature discussions about these issues without fear of being accused of prejudice, divisiveness or simply spreading \u201cFUD.\u201dFinally, it\u2019s not easy to stick your neck out on sensitive issues like these, and even I\u2019ve gone back and forth about whether to publish this article. But if you agree with what I\u2019ve written on any level, I encourage you to share this article, as well as your own views, to help drive this discussion forward and ensure the brightest possible future for EOS.", "responses": "23"}, {"title": "The Value of Being Stupid about Blockchain", "author_name": "John Wolpert", "link": "https://media.consensys.net/the-value-of-being-stupid-about-blockchain-c46ba3c99cd6?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 12, 2018", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "1.8K", "content": "The Value of Being Stupid about BlockchainHow I learned to stop worrying and embrace the odd utility of the hype\u00a0cycle.John WolpertBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 12, 2018Photo by Verena Yunita Yapi on\u00a0UnsplashThese days it seems like everyone has a blockchain project. \u201cBlockchain\u201d has gone from the utopian ideal of crypto-anarchists to the latest business buzzword. Got a boss that won\u2019t approve your IT project? Slap the word \u201cblockchain\u201d on it and see what happens.The refrain you hear from blockchain snobs like me is, \u201cThe first rule of blockchain is that you probably don\u2019t need blockchain.\u201d But maybe we\u2019re missing the point. Maybe some of the projects that don\u2019t need blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200atechnologically speaking\u200a\u2014\u200astill represent an important shift in priorities that were set in motion by the advent of blockchain.The Truth About \u201cBlockchain for Business\u201dBlockchain, like any database technology, can do lots of things. But it\u2019s only uniquely qualified to do one technical thing and one social thing:The technical thing: Prevent double-spend of a digital asset without trusting intermediaries.The social thing: Maintain a single source of truth and a shared set of business rules across legally separate entities without anyone being able to alter them and control the system.The latter is a social innovation because it changes the equation of perceived power in consortia. In a true blockchain-based system, no one can set themselves up as the ruler or hegemon. This lowers the social barrier to forming the network.For example, in the past if a car maker built a database to track parts for all vehicles, other car makers wouldn\u2019t use it, sometimes for no better reason than they didn\u2019t want to feel like a second class citizen to the company running the server. But today, an organizer can say, \u201cHey, the magic of blockchain means we all have control but none of us is in control of the system we\u2019re using to work together.\u201d And that can mean an easier time getting members to join.But here\u2019s the dirty secret. Few-to-none of the private blockchain consortia that you\u2019ve been reading about are run this way. So far, there is almost always a powerful company calling the shots for everyone else. Hegemony is alive and well.For any private blockchain network currently in production\u200a\u2014\u200aand especially for those that use the term \u201cdistributed ledger technology (DLT)\u200a\u2014\u200athe organizer has probably not yet given up root access to the servers or nodes running it. Many never will. Most of the participants\u200a\u2014\u200ahaving satisfied themselves that the organizer isn\u2019t playing shenanigans\u200a\u2014\u200awill find themselves content to let them stay in control. Which of course begs the question:\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we have formed these consortia years ago with conventional technology?\u201dThe Cultural Shift Toward CollaborationThe answer is, we could have\u200a\u2014\u200atechnically. But we didn\u2019t.What\u2019s new is that blockchain mania has brought inter-company collaboration to the top of our collective backlog. It\u2019s driving the technology zeitgeist. And with that accomplished, one might be forgiven for perceiving a need for blockchain when a noSQL database and some NodeJS would suffice.So go ahead\u2026knock yourself out. It\u2019s time to build that solution you\u2019ve been planning for the last fifteen years, the one nobody had the courage or interest to fund until the blockchain hype cycle unlocked Pandora\u2019s box. Finally digitize those paper personnel documents, track bananas in shipping containers, or build a shared database to speed dispute resolution. Just make sure to call it \u201cblockchain\u201d so that pointy haired managers will prioritize the work. And then, if you can get away with it, simply use a conventional database to get the job done. Your life will be a lot easier if you can pull that off.But if you must use a blockchain, use a Blockchain-as-a-Service platform that lets you quickly string up a few nodes in a private network running on an enterprise Cloud. Don\u2019t know who should get the nodes or why anyone would want to run one? Don\u2019t worry. Just run them all yourself. After all, the key was being able to say, \u201cIt\u2019s ok everybody\u2026it\u2019s blockchain!\u201d Soon, none of them will remember or care that you still have the root keys to the network.Sure, you now have essentially a traditional, centralized SaaS application running on significantly more complicated and expensive decentralized gear, but at least you got the consortium started.Laying the Track for the Internet of\u00a0ValueWhether or not you really need a blockchain today, times are changing. Countless services are popping up on blockchains like Ethereum. Billions of connections between parties all over the world are surging as networks evolve to handle the load. And standards like ERC20 and ERC721 are making transactions, logic and data models compatible with each other by design.In 2019, smart consortia won\u2019t start by stringing up private networks. They\u2019ll start by publishing something like an ERC, setting a standard for interop across all applications that implement it. That will help prevent the balkanization and network incompatibility that springs up as solutions that should have started out together come crashing into each other. This is what drives permanent employment and massive profits for system integrators (and bone-crushing costs for the rest of us).By 2020, the concept of \u201cpublic\u201d versus \u201cprivate\u201d blockchain networks will be relegated to a historical footnote. We will not pit public networks against private networks. Instead there will be public transactions and private transactions, confidential contracts and open contracts, and they will coordinate their scope across bilateral, multilateral and public environments depending on the needs of users\u200a\u2014\u200ajust as messages today pass between private and public environments using common Internet protocols.In this world, we can transact peer-to-peer, conduct completely confidential agreements, and seamlessly coordinate public and private data, business rules, and users in minutes without having to set up different blockchain infrastructure for each group or use\u00a0case.Now things start to get interesting. The project that could have been built on a conventional database has access to a full-fledged token economy that crosses geographies, sectors, and use cases. Applications run transactions across each other without compromising privacy and confidentiality.

They are undifferentiated and capable of developing into different types of cells. This means that they have the potential to regenerate, repair, and replenish other cells in the body. Stem cell research is focused on the use of stem cells for the treatment of illness and injury. While still in its infancy, there is tremendous potential for stem cell technology to improve the quality of life for many.Already, breakthroughs in stem cell research span the gamut. The most successful and established stem cell therapies have been done with bone marrow transplants, first performed over 40 years ago. Since then, further developments have been made. There are now many stem cell therapies available or under development around the world, such as immune system therapies, CHO cell and hybridomas, neural stem cell therapies, mammary epithelial cell therapies, prostate epithelial cell therapies, pulmonary stem cell research, intestinal stem cell research, and more.Challenges Parallel Those of Early Cancer\u00a0ResearchDespite the strides that have been made in our knowledge of stem cells and their application for human welfare, there remains two issues 1) a pressing need for further research and development across a vast array of medical conditions that impact millions of people around the world. 2) There is also an issue with linking patients in need of stem cell treatments with the doctors who have the best knowledge relating to their needs.The difficulties in stem cell research are similar to those that plagued cancer research a few decades ago. There isn\u2019t an adequate infrastructure for sharing information about research to ensure patients always receive the best treatment for their situation. A similar lack of infrastructure for maximizing collective knowledge characterizes global stem cell research.A Blockchain SolutionOne of the most significant applications for blockchain technology is in making collective knowledge accessible. This quality makes it well-suited for use in medical and health research contexts. Stem Cell Innovations (SCI) is working to create a unique platform that brings together stem cell knowledge and blockchain technology. SCI has existed since 2013 as a network of researchers, expert medical professionals, investors, and engineers hoping to expand access to stem cell research and treatment knowledge around the world. Now it is taking advantage of blockchain technology to further this goal.There are three significant aspects of SCI\u2019s plan. First, it will use blockchain to create a collaborative network for players in the stem cell industry to facilitate the transmission of research and development around the world. The system will be able to continuously maintain and refine this collective knowledge based on clinical results and the latest research. In this sense, SCI hopes to achieve with stem cell treatment what has been achieved in regards to cancer research.However, SCI has plans to go beyond this as well. The second significant aspect of its blockchain network is it will also function as a patient health information storage ledger. Data will be stored on the SCI blockchain and users can control which information doctors and medical organizations can access. This means patients can be connected to doctors around the world and share with them the relevant aspects of their health information. This service would everyone in the world benefit from the latest stem cell research.The third significant aspect is SCI project is cord blood banking. The best stem cells are found in \u201ccord blood\u201d. This is blood found in the umbilical cord immediately after birth. Cord blood banking (also known as stem cell banking) is the process of collecting cord blood and cryogenically freezing its stem cells. Being able to collect and store that blood for future use is a growing trend in medicine.Stem cell banking allows parents to safeguard their children against possible medical issues in the future by ensuring they have access to their pure stem cells if needed. However, the complexity and cost of current stem cell banking options present many barriers to almost all parents who would want to take advantage of this medical technology. SCI plans to offer stem cell banking through an application ecosystem. Using its app parents will be able to sign up for stem cell storage, order a collection kit, and schedule courier pickup through one secure platform.SCI plans to run on dual blockchain platforms. The first will be built on an Ethereum base powered by the ERC20 platform. The second blockchain will be custom built by SCI engineers specifically for storing and processing patient stem cell records. This customized blockchain will be known as SCIChain and will use the Hyperledger Fabric network. It will be designed to use smart contracts to protect user data and ensure only authorized individuals have access to it.ConclusionThe potential of stem cell treatment is enormous, but like the early days of cancer researcher, the science is being held back by a lack of sufficient knowledge sharing. SCI plans to provide the technological infrastructure to change that. However, more than this it will take advantage of the security and transparency of blockchain data storage to allow patients to connect with doctors and share knowledge relevant to their condition, but they can also control when and how much of their personal health information to share. From my perspective, the cord blood banking services is just an add on to these more fundamental services.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Why Blockchain Differs From Traditional Technology Life\u00a0Cycles", "author_name": "Daniel Heyman", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/why-blockchain-differs-from-traditional-technology-life-cycles-95f0deabdf85?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 1", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "2.1K", "content": "Why Blockchain Differs From Traditional Technology Life\u00a0CyclesWhy another bubble is likely and what the blockchain space should focus on\u00a0nowDaniel HeymanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 1In the aftermath of the 2001 internet bubble, Carlota Perez published her influential book Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. This seminal work provides a framework for how new technologies create both opportunity and turmoil in society. I originally learned about Perez\u2019s work through venture capitalist Fred Wilson, who credits it as a key intellectual underpinning of his investment theses.In the wake of the 2018 ICO bubble and with the purported potential of blockchain, many people have drawn parallels to the 2001 bubble. I recently reread Perez\u2019s work to think through if there are any lessons for the world of blockchain, and to understand the parallels and differences between then and now. As Mark Twain may or may not have said, \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\u201dFramework OverviewIn Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital, Carlota Perez analyzes five \u201csurges of development\u201d that have occurred over the last 250 years, each through the diffusion of a new technology and associated way of doing business. These surges are still household names hundreds of years later: the Industrial Revolution, the railway boom, the age of steel, the age of mass production and, of course, the information age. Each one created a burst of development, new ways of doing business, and generated a new class of successful entrepreneurs (from Carnegie to Ford to Jobs). Each one created an economic common sense and set of business models that supported the new technology, which Perez calls a \u2018techno-economic paradigm\u2019. Each surge also displaced old industries, drove bubbles to burst, and led to significant social turmoil.Technology Life\u00a0cyclesPerez provides a framework for how new technologies first take hold in society and then transform society. She calls the initial phase of this phenomenon \u201cinstallation.\u201d During installation, technologies demonstrate new ways of doing business and achieving financial gains. This usually creates a frenzy of investment in the new technology which drives a bubble and also intense experimentation in the technology. When the bubble bursts, the subsequent recession (or depression) is a turning point to implement social and regulatory changes to take advantage of the infrastructure created during the frenzy. If changes are made, a \u201cgolden age\u201d typically follows as the new technology is productively deployed. If not, a \u201cgilded age\u201d follows where only the rich benefit. In either case, the technology eventually reaches maturity and additional avenues for investment and returns in the new technology dwindle. At this point, the opportunity for a new technology to irrupt onto the scene emerges.Image from Technology Revolutions and Financial CapitalInclusion-ExclusionWithin Perez\u2019s framework, new techno-economic paradigms both encourage and discourage innovation, through an inclusion-exclusion process. This means that as new techno-economic paradigms are being deployed, they provide opportunities for entrepreneurs to mobilize and new modes of business to create growth, and at the same time, they exclude alternative technologies because entrepreneurs and capital are following the newly proven path provided by the techno-economic paradigm. When an existing technology reaches maturity and investment opportunities diminish, capital and talent go in search of new technologies and techno-economic paradigms.Technologies CombineOne new technology isn\u2019t enough for a new techno-economic paradigm. The age of mass production was created by combining oil and the combustion engine. Railways required the steam engine. The information age required the microprocessor, the internet, and much more. Often, a technology will, as Perez says, \u201cgestate\u201d as a small improvement to the existing techno-paradigm, until complementary technologies are created and the exclusion process of the old paradigm ends. Technologies can exist in this gestation period for quite sometime until the technologies and opportunities are aligned for the installation period to begin.Frenzies and\u00a0BubblesIn many ways, the bubbles created by the frenzy in the installation phase makes it possible for the new technology to succeed. The bubble creates a burst of (over-)investment in the infrastructure of the new technology (railways, canals, fiber optic cables, etc.). This infrastructure makes it possible for the technology to successfully deploy after the bubble bursts. The bubbles also encourage a spate of experimentation with new business models and new approaches to the technologies, enabling future entrepreneurs to follow proven paths and avoid common pitfalls. While the bubble creates a lot of financial losses and economic pain, it can be crucial in the adoption of new technologies.Connecting the\u00a0DotsA quick look at Perez\u2019s framework would leave one to assume that 2018 was the blockchain frenzy and bubble, so we must be entering blockchain\u2019s \u201cturning point.\u201d This would be a mistake.My analysis of Perez\u2019s framework suggests that blockchain is actually still in the gestation period, in the early days of a technology life cycle before the installation period. 2018 was not a Perez-style frenzy and bubble because it did not include key outcomes that are necessary to reach a turning point: significant infrastructure improvements and replicable business models that can serve as a roadmap during the deployment period. The bubble came early because blockchain technology enabled liquidity earlier in its life cycle.There are three main implications of remaining in the gestation period. First, another blockchain-based frenzy and bubble is likely to come before the technology matures. In fact, multiple bubbles may be ahead of us. Second, the best path to success is to work through, rather than against, the existing technology paradigm. Third, the ecosystem needs to heavily invest in infrastructure for a new blockchain-based paradigm to emerge.The ICO Bubble Doesn\u2019t Match\u00a0Up2018 did show many of the signs of a Perez-style \u2018frenzy period\u2019 entering into a turning point. The best way (and ultimately the worst way) to make money was speculation. \u2018Fundamentals\u2019 of projects rarely mattered in their valuations or growth. Wealth was celebrated and individual prophets gained recognition. Expectations went through the roof. Scams and fraud were prevalent. Retail investors piled in for fear of missing out. The frenzy had all the tell-tale signs of a classic bubble.Although there are no \u201cgood bubbles,\u201d bubbles can have good side effects. During Canal Mania and Railway Mania, canals and railways were built that had little hope of ever being profitable. Investors lost money, but after the bubble, these canals and railways were still there. This new infrastructure made future endeavors cheaper and easier. After the internet bubble burst in 2001, fiber optic cables were selling for pennies on the dollar. Investors did terribly, but the fiber optics infrastructure created value for consumers and made it possible for the next generation of companies to be built. This over-investment in infrastructure is often necessary for the successful deployment of new technologies.The ICO bubble, however, did not have the good side effects of a Perez-style bubble. It didn\u2019t produce nearly enough infrastructure to help the blockchain ecosystem move forward.Compared to previous bubbles, the cryptosphere\u2019s investment in infrastructure was minimal and likely to be obsolete very soon. The physical infrastructure\u200a\u2014\u200ain mining operations, for example\u200a\u2014\u200ais unlikely to be useful. Additional mining power on a blockchain has significantly decreasing marginal returns and different characteristics to traditional infrastructure. Unlike a city getting a new fiber optic cable or a new canal, new people do not gain access to blockchain because of additional miners. Additionally, proof of work mining is unlikely to be the path blockchain takes moving forward.The non-physical infrastructure was also minimal. The tools that can be best described as \u201ccore blockchain infrastructure\u201d did not have easy access to the ICO market. Dev tools, wallets, software clients, user-friendly smart contract languages, and cloud services (to name a few) are the infrastructure that will drive blockchain technology toward maturity and full deployment. The cheap capital provided through ICOs primarily flowed to the application layer (even though the whole house has been built on an immature foundation). This created incentives for people to focus on what was easily fundable rather than most needed. These perverse incentives may have actually hurt the development of key infrastructure and splintered the ecosystem.I don\u2019t want to despair about the state of the ecosystem. Some good things came out of the ICO bubble. Talent has flooded the field. Startups have been experimenting with different use cases to see what sticks. New blockchains were launched incorporating a wide range of new technologies and approaches. New technologies have come to market. Many core infrastructure projects raised capital and made significant technical progress. Enterprises have created their blockchain strategies. Some very successful companies were born, which will continue to fund innovation in the space.The ecosystem as a whole continues to evolve at breakneck speed. As a whole, however, the bubble did not leave in its wake the infrastructure one would expect after a Perez-style bubble.Liquidity Came\u00a0EarlyThe 2018 ICO bubble happened early in blockchain technology\u2019s life-cycle, during its gestation period, which is much earlier than Perez\u2019s framework would predict. This is because the technology itself enabled liquidity earlier in the life-cycle. The financial assets became liquid before the underlying technology matured.In the internet bubble, it took companies many years to go public, and as such there was some quality threshold and some reporting required. This process enabled the technology to iterate and improve before the liquidity arrived. Because blockchain enabled liquid tokens that were virtually free to issue, the rush was on to create valuable tokens rather than valuable companies or technologies. You could create a liquid asset without any work on the underlying technology. The financial layer jumped straight into a liquid state while the technology was left behind. The resulting tokens existed in very thin markets that were highly driven by momentum.Because of the early liquidity, the dynamics of a bubble were able to start early for the space in relationship to the technology. After all, this was not the first blockchain bubble (bitcoin already has a rich history of bubbles and crashes). The thin markets in which these assets existed likely accelerated the dynamics of the bubble.What the Blockchain Space Needs to Focus on\u00a0nowIn the fallout of a bubble, Perez outlines two necessary components to successfully deploy new and lasting technologies: proven, replicable business models and easy-to-use infrastructure. Blockchain hasn\u2019t hit these targets yet, and so it\u2019s a pretty obvious conclusion that blockchain is not yet at a \u201cturning point.\u201dWhile protocol development is happening at a rapid clip, blockchain is not yet ready for mass deployment into a new techno-economic paradigm. We don\u2019t have the proven, replicable business models that can expand industry to industry. Exchanges and mining companies, the main success stories of blockchain, are not replicable business models and do not cross industries. We don\u2019t yet have the infrastructure for mass adoption. Moreover, the use cases that are gaining traction are mostly in support of the existing economic system. Komgo is using blockchain to improve an incredibly antiquated industry (trade finance) but it is still operating within the legacy economic paradigm.Blockchain, therefore, is still in the \u201cgestation period.\u201d Before most technologies could enter the irruption phase and transform the economy, they were used to augment the existing economy. In blockchain, this looks like private and consortium chain solutions.Some people in blockchain see this as a bad result. I see it as absolutely crucial. Without these experiments, blockchain risks fading out as a technological movement before its given the chance to mature and develop. In fact, one area where ConsenSys is not given the credit I believe it deserves is in bringing enterprises into the Ethereum blockchain space. This enterprise interest brings in more talent, lays the seeds for additional infrastructure, and adds credibility to the space. I am more excited by enterprise usage of blockchain today than any other short-term developments.The Future of Blockchain FrenzyThis was not the first blockchain bubble. I don\u2019t expect it to be the last (though hopefully some lessons will be learned from the last 12 months). Perez\u2019s framework predicts that when the replicable business model is found in blockchain, another period of frenzied investment will occur, likely leading to a bubble. As Fred Wilson writes, \u201cCarlota Perez [shows] \u2018nothing important happens without crashes.\u2019 \u201d Given the amount of capital available, I think this is a highly likely outcome. Given the massive potential of blockchain technology, the bubble is likely to involve more capital at risk than the 2018 one.This next frenzy will have the same telltale signs of the previous one. Fundamentals will decrease in importance; retail investors will enter the market for fear of missing out; fraud will increase; and so on.Lessons for Blockchain BusinessesPerez\u2019s framework offers two direct strategic lessons for PegaSys and for any serious protocol development project in the blockchain space. First, we should continue to work with traditional enterprises. Working with enterprises will enable the technology to evolve and will power some experimentation of business models. This is a key component of the technology life-cycle and the best bet to help the ecosystem iterate.Second, we must continue investing in infrastructure and diverse technologies for the ecosystem to succeed. This might sound obvious at first, but the point is that we will miss out on the new techno-economic paradigm if we only focus on the opportunities that are commercially viable today. Our efforts in Ethereum 1.x and 2.0 are directly born from our goal of helping the ecosystem mature and evolve. The work other groups in Ethereum and across blockchain are doing also drives towards this goal. We are deeply committed to the Ethereum roadmap and at the same time recognize the value that innovations outside Ethereum bring to the space. Ethereum\u2019s roadmap has learned lessons from other blockchains, just as those chains have been inspired by Ethereum. This is how technologies evolve and improve.", "responses": "7"}, {"title": "Let\u2019s Build the Tiniest Blockchain", "author_name": "Gerald Nash", "link": "https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain-e70965a248b?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 16, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "10.1K", "content": "Let\u2019s Build the Tiniest BlockchainIn Less Than 50 Lines of\u00a0PythonGerald NashBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 16, 2017Note: Part 2 of this piece can be found here.Although some think blockchain is a solution waiting for problems, there\u2019s no doubt that this novel technology is a marvel of computing. But, what exactly is a blockchain?Blockchaina digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly.In more general terms, it\u2019s a public database where new data are stored in a container called a block and are added to an immutable chain (hence blockchain) with data added in the past. In the case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, these data are groups of transactions. But, the data can be of any type, of course.Blockchain technology has given rise to new, fully digital currencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin that aren\u2019t issued or managed by a central authority. This brings new freedom to individuals who believe that today\u2019s banking systems are a scam or subject to failure. Blockchain has also revolutionized distributed computing in the form of technologies like Ethereum, which has introduced interesting concepts like smart contracts.In this article, I\u2019ll make a simple blockchain in less than 50 lines of Python 2 code. It\u2019ll be called SnakeCoin.We\u2019ll start by first defining what our blocks will look like. In blockchain, each block is stored with a timestamp and, optionally, an index. In SnakeCoin, we\u2019re going to store both. And to help ensure integrity throughout the blockchain, each block will have a self-identifying hash. Like Bitcoin, each block\u2019s hash will be a cryptographic hash of the block\u2019s index, timestamp, data, and the hash of the previous block\u2019s hash. Oh, and the data can be anything you want.Awesome! We have our block structure, but we\u2019re creating a blockchain. We need to start adding blocks to the actual chain. As I mentioned earlier, each block requires information from the previous block. But with that being said, a question arises: how does the first block in the blockchain get there? Well, the first block, or genesis block, is a special block. In many cases, it\u2019s added manually or has unique logic allowing it to be added.We\u2019ll create a function that simply returns a genesis block to make things easy. This block is of index 0, and it has an arbitrary data value and an arbitrary value in the \u201cprevious hash\u201d parameter.Now that we\u2019re able to create a genesis block, we need a function that will generate succeeding blocks in the blockchain. This function will take the previous block in the chain as a parameter, create the data for the block to be generated, and return the new block with its appropriate data. When new blocks hash information from previous blocks, the integrity of the blockchain increases with each new block. If we didn\u2019t do this, it would be easier for an outside party to \u201cchange the past\u201d and replace our chain with an entirely new one of their own. This chain of hashes acts as cryptographic proof and helps ensure that once a block is added to the blockchain it cannot be replaced or removed.That\u2019s the majority of the hard work. Now, we can create our blockchain! In our case, the blockchain itself is a simple Python list. The first element of the list is the genesis block. And of course, we need to add the succeeding blocks. Because SnakeCoin is the tiniest blockchain, we\u2019ll only add 20 new blocks. We can do this with a for loop.Let\u2019s test what we\u2019ve made so far.Don\u2019t worry. It goes up to\u00a020.There we go! Our blockchain works. If you want to see more information in the console, you could edit the complete source file and print each block\u2019s timestamp or data.That\u2019s about all that SnakeCoin has to offer. To make SnakeCoin scale to the size of today\u2019s production blockchains, we\u2019d have to add more features like a server layer to track changes to the chain on multiple machines and a proof-of-work algorithm to limit the amount of blocks added in a given time period.If you\u2019d like to get more technical, you can view the original Bitcoin whitepaper here.

Distributed ledger technology can make local and global transactions a lot quicker, safer, and cheaper. Those same benefits can be easily applied to the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending market, essentially leveling both investors and borrowers alike.The P2P Market: Where Does it\u00a0Stand?The concept behind P2P lending is as basic as it gets\u200a\u2014\u200aone party lends money or assets to another party. Whether or not interest is involved is entirely up to the contracting parties, though the overwhelming majority of deals do include interest.Peer-to-peer lending used to be known as social lending and its history dates back to the 1700s. It reached its peak throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, eventually becoming the most widely used method of lending in Europe.As new technologies and techniques began emerging, however, the market started to diversify and evolve, but the popularity of P2P lending never went away. The very first digital P2P lending platform was launched back in 2005 and by now, 13 years later, the platform has managed to lend more than GBP2.8 billion to UK consumers.According to the popular forecasting website Statista, the P2P lending market will be worth $1 trillion by 2025, outlining its importance for users.Issues With the P2P Lending\u00a0MarketAt its core, the P2P lending market requires one very simple, but elusive, component to function\u200a\u2014\u200atrust. Over time, as the market and the world got more complicated, that simple trust between parties began to break down.This is where intermediaries come in. They provide an additional (and indeed effective) layer of protection, safeguarding parties from fraud and other nefarious intentions. In return for this security, though, they also demand high fees, regulation, and other counterproductive complications.It is all thanks to these expensive, intrusive third-parties that the peer-to-peer lending market became a far cry from what was intended to be.Enter BlockchainBlockchain technology answers the question of how to create trust and security without any of the traditional downsides described above. At its core, distributed ledger technology is a trustless and decentralized environment where intermediaries are not only redundant but entirely unnecessary.A distributed and immutable ledger allows for the transfer of asset ownership from one person to another without the need for a third party, which means that finally the ease and efficiency of P2P lending practices can be revived as they were originally intended.The benefits are significant, especially for small-to-medium-enterprises and individuals, because as it stands, access to credit can be difficult and complicated.Blockchain technology also provides a number of important advantages, including:Low transaction feesCryptocurrency transactions have minimal or no transaction fees at all, which is far more convenient than the fees on credit card transactions.Increased accessibilityAccording to McKinsey research, there are over 2 billion unbanked and underbanked people throughout the world, and without access to any form of credit. Blockchain allows anyone with access to internet to easily receive P2P loans effectively.SpeedTransacting on the blockchain is particularly fast with most of the operations happening instantly or in a few short minutes.P2P lending provides many benefits to the end user as compared to traditional institutional lending. However, the issues which are currently affecting it are making it a lot less convenient than it can and should be. Blockchain technology can effectively meet all of these problems, transforming the market and offering billions greater, more secure access to credit.AERUM\u2019s SolutionAs disruptive as it is, blockchain is still a relatively new technology. Perhaps the best example of this is Ethereum, the number one platform in terms of developers and apps, is unable to handle more than 20 transactions per second. This scalability issue is a huge roadblock for mass adoption.Unfortunately, the majority of the existing solutions are unable to scale up to the challenge that real-world applications demand. The P2P lending market is an incredibly intensive one, and if blockchain technologies are to transform it, the scalability issue is amongst the first hurdle to overcome.Fortunately, there is a solution. AERUM\u2019s blockchain is a brand new, cutting edge platform that solves all of these issues. Not only is it blazing fast, but it manages to deliver something that other competitors are still struggling with\u200a\u2014\u200aon-demand scalability.This means that parties will be able to adjust the throughput of the network based on what\u2019s currently needed. AERUM\u2019s network can effectively handle from 500 to 100,000+ transactions per second. It\u2019s also very easy to implement with existing platforms, because it is fully compatible with Ethereum.

The remittances sent on 2015 rose to the highest level in at least 15 years. This brought a total amount of $68.3 billion that migrants transferred higher than a pre-recession peak of $64.5 billion in 2008.\u201cFamily remittances to 17 Latin American Countries grew over 8% from 2016 to 2017, reaching Over $75Billion.

Complaining that remittance transactions are prone to the risk of money laundering and other financial crimes, banks have been closing the correspondent banking accounts of many money-transfer operators (MTOs). Remittance service providers and banks need not only to apply \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d (KYC) regulations, they also need to know their customer\u2019s customer. According to the World Bank\u2019s survey on this phenomenon in the G20 countries, MTO account closures by banks was widespread. This situation has continued this year, in which banks are closing the bank accounts of MTOs. A risk-based approach is what the Guidance on financial inclusion of the Financial Access Task Force (FATF) recommends when dealing with AML/CFT systems. Nevertheless, several financial institutions do not want to take any risk and prefer to close the accounts of money transfer operators (MTOs).To add to this issue, a great amount of remittance users are, in the most part, either unbanked or underbanked with little to no banking services provided to them due to their legal situation in their respective countries. this forces people to incur in additional expenses in the form of fees that certain MTOs offer which are in many cases higher than a regular international bank to bank wire transfer.As a simple example a Venezuelan migrant in Chile, that had to flee his country looking for better opportunities. Has absolutely no banking services available to him for the first year until he can successfully apply for a visa, and even then the banking services he can obtain are quite limited for the next 5 years until he can get full residency. During that time this Venezuelan worker would have only the alternative to use one of the many MTOs. Which for their service will charge a fee that ranges from 5% all the way to 18% if we factor the spread difference of the exchange rate.The establishment of Blockchain digital payment systems for remittances instead of using regular cash MTOs for these types of transactions are of enormous benefit to the poor in developing countries. Through its ITM Network in conjunction with its proprietary REALM Platform INVESTA is setting a network across the region and some European countries which provide transparency, safety and reliability safeguards. interoperability of bank and nonbank financial service providers so different types of systems work with each other, adequate physical infrastructure to offer digital payments, availability of cash-out points, stability of prices, and sequencing in the adoption of digital payments and mobile money.Several attempts to solve most of the issues have been approached by different companies from many sectors of the industry. Most of them with innovative solutions, others in conjunction with banking related products. But what INVESTA proposes is to solve this issue taking what already works and making it better, faster, easier and above all safer. All with the use of our Inter Numerical Valuechain.

In all, 17 people confirmed the manipulation of Supermicro\u2019s hardware and other elements of the attacks.\u201dAnd then nothing. It appears as if Americans are not concerned that a foreign government could have outfoxed Amazon, Google, and our own federal government and walked away with volts of information.When it\u2019s a foreign adversary perpetrating the heist against Americans, we call it espionage; when it\u2019s citizen-on-citizen, we call it cybercrime. Our journalists call the perpetrators, \u201cmiddlemen\u201d and \u201chackers.\u201d At this moment in time, our personal data is a resource as life-giving as it is lethal. I\u2019d call anybody in the business of stealing it a thug.Bloomberg recounts how in September 2015, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the White House to announce a cybersecurity deal: China would no longer support hackers who stole intellectual property from US companies for the benefit of Chinese companies. In the weeks after the deal was touted, we learn, the Pentagon quickly and quietly ushered the country\u2019s leading tech executives and investors to McClean, Virginia to see if anyone could create a product which would identify hardware implants.Bloomberg concludes its article by proclaiming, \u201cIn the three years since the briefing in McLean, no commercially viable way to detect attacks like the one on [these] motherboards has emerged\u200a\u2014\u200aor has looked likely to emerge.\u201dThat\u2019s fair\u200a\u2014\u200auntil now.Distributed ledger technology, the technology behind blockchain, changes everything.There\u2019s an Arms Race, and the Bad Guys Are WinningThe alleged chip implants allowed The Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army to gain control of the systems they were put into. Gaining control of mission-critical devices doesn\u2019t have to require chip implants though. Take for example the hack which blew out half of the internet in October 2016\u200a\u2014\u200athree guys between nineteen and twenty years old from Pennsylvania and Louisiana compromised a bunch of DVRs and webcams and then directed them to attack the servers which host our favorite websites when they told the devices they no longer belonged to their owners.At the end of the day, in all cases, it comes down to \u201ctransmission control.\u201dTCP/IP\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is the abbreviation for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol\u200a\u2014\u200ais a bundle of protocols developed by DARPA between 1978\u20131983 and from which the internet spawned. We analogize TCP/IP as the information superhighway; architecturally, it is responsible for connection establishment, management, and reliable data transport between software processes on devices.The problem, though, is TCP/IP, as we know it, doesn\u2019t do anything to govern the processes which run on the hardware it connects. If a central server says, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve decided Jonathan Manzi\u2019s iPhone no longer belongs to him and belongs to Elon Musk instead\u201d then, presto, TCP/IP makes it happen.How We Can Throw a Knockout Punch with Distributed Ledger TechnologyWhen each device is manufactured, it follows a recipe\u200a\u2014\u200athe list of ingredients is called the BOM, or bill of materials. The parts which can have malicious software loaded on them\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, the microchips\u200a\u2014\u200aare, at the finest level of detail, unique due to the properties of silicon. In other words, each has a unique fingerprint.In a distributed ledger framework, each device\u200a\u2014\u200atake my iPhone\u200a\u2014\u200awould have the fingerprints of its pertinent parts stored on it\u200a\u2014\u200aand here\u2019s the kicker\u200a\u2014\u200ait would have the fingerprints of all the pertinent parts of all other iPhones in the Universe also stored on it. And when a new iPhone is manufactured, my iPhone and all other iPhones in the Universe add the new iPhone\u2019s fingerprints.This way, if through TCP/IP, a treacherous message comes through\u200a\u2014\u200aManzi\u2019s iPhone now belongs to Musk\u200a\u2014\u200aManzi\u2019s iPhone understands the Universe recognizes Musk\u2019s iPhone as being assigned to fingerprints which Manzi\u2019s phone does not have. It doesn\u2019t allow the hack to happen.To be clear, TCP/IP need not be replaced, we just need to introduce a distributed ledger based protocol to sit on top and coordinate decide-to-device communication.A Status Quo Which Will Be Our Ruin; A Breakthrough to Unite UsAs we enter the era of cyberware, every gadget and device is a new battleground.Imagine if an adversary had control of our traffic grids and the delivery rooms of our hospitals.Just like we united globally around technology to create the internet, we must unite again to prevent cybercrime by bolting on a universal protocol for node-to-node coordination on-top of TCP/IP.Jonathan Manzi is the Co-Founder and CEO of Beyond Protocol, Inc., a mostly stealth Silicon-Valley distributed ledger technology venture building \u201cthe internet of the new era\u200a\u2014\u200athe ethical language of machines.\u201d", "responses": "7"}, {"title": "Announcing EnjinX: Ad-Free, User-Friendly Ethereum Blockchain Explorer", "author_name": "Ilija Rolovi\u0107", "link": "https://blog.enjincoin.io/announcing-enjinx-ad-free-user-friendly-ethereum-blockchain-explorer-3d679ba034c8?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 27, 2018", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "26K", "content": "Announcing EnjinX: Ad-Free, User-Friendly Ethereum Blockchain ExplorerEnjinX is a modern, fast, responsive web app for exploring Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens & blockchain data.

I\u2026dev.toI want to make it clear that I have respect for almost all of the developers in this space, and this is not intended to attack anyone. It\u2019s meant to elaborate on what the real concerns are and explain how the original article does nothing to address those real concerns. I would actually love to see something that does, because then we can throw it into Bitcoin. That being said, there are some developers who mislead, obscure, ignore, and attack via protocol confusion like what occurred with 2X and the replay protection drama, but most aren\u2019t like that. You can\u2019t watch something like this or read something like this and hate these developers. They\u2019re genuinely trying to fight the same fight as us, and I believe Afri is part of the latter group, not the former.https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/6372If you\u2019ve read my other articles you\u2019re going to see some small bits of that information repeated. Up until now I wrote primarily about Bitcoin from a \u201cmaximalist\u201d perspective (still am) and focused on conflicts within that community. What you may find interesting if you only watch from the corner of your eye, is that the reason for \u201cconflict\u201d here is exactly the same. I\u2019ll even use Proof-of-Stake as further leverage for my argument without criticizing it.Edit: It seems like people are not reading the subtitle and misunderstanding something. This is not about archival nodes. This is about fully validating nodes. I don\u2019t care if you prune the history or skip the line to catch-up with everyone else. This is about about staying in sync, after the fact. Light nodes aren\u2019t nodes.This has become a 2-part article. When you\u2019re done with this article you can read the follow-up one:Sharding centralizes Ethereum by selling you Scaling-In disguised as Scaling-OutThe differences between Light-Clients & Fully-Validating Nodesmedium.comIndexMy Argument: Ethereum\u2019s runaway data directory size is just the tip.My Prediction: It will all work, until it doesn\u2019t.My Suggestion: Transpose.My Argument: Larger blocks centralize validators.It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s the central argument in the entire cryptocurrency community in regards to scaling. Not many people familiar with blockchain protocol actually deny this. The following is an excerpt from what I consider to be a very well put together explanation of various \u201cLayer 2\u201d scaling options. (Of which, the only working one is already implemented on Bitcoin.)https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-ethereums-layer-2-scaling-solutions-state-channels-plasma-and-truebit-22cb40dcc2f4That article is written by Josh Stark. He gets it. His company even announced a project that\u2019s meant to mirror the Lightning Network on Ethereum. (Which is oddly coincidental given Elizabeth Stark\u2019s company is helping build Lightning.)The problem? Putting everything about Proof of Stake completely to the side, the incentive structure of the base layer is completely broken because there is no cap on Ethereum\u2019s blocksize, and even if one was put in place it would have to be reasonable, and then these Dapps wouldn\u2019t even work because they\u2019re barely working now with no cap. It doesn\u2019t even matter what that cap is set at for this argument to hold because right now there is none in place.Let\u2019s backtrack a bit. I\u2019m going to briefly define a blockchain and upset people.Here is what a blockchain provides:An immutable & decentralized ledger.That\u2019s it.Here is what a blockchain needs to keep those properties:A decentralized network with the following prerogatives:Distribute my ledger\u200a\u2014\u200aValidateAppend my ledger\u200a\u2014\u200aWorkIncentivise my needs\u200a\u2014\u200aTokenHere is what kills a blockchain:Any feature built into the blockchain that detracts from the network\u2019s goals.A blockchain is just a tool for a network. It\u2019s actually a very specific tool that can only be used by a very specific kind of network. So much so that they require each other to exist and fall apart when they don\u2019t co-operate, given enough time. You can build on top of this network, but quite frankly anything else built into the base layer (L1) that negatively affects the network\u2019s ability to do its job is going to bring the entire network to its knees\u2026given enough time.Here\u2019s an example of an L1 feature that doesn\u2019t effect the network: Multisig.It does require the node to do a bit of extra work, but it\u2019s \u201cmarginal\u201d. The important thing to note is hardware is not the bottleneck for these (properly designed) networks, network latency is. Something as simple as paying to a multi-signature address won\u2019t tax the network any more than paying to a normal address does because you\u2019re paying on a per-byte basis for every transaction. It\u2019s a blockchain feature that doesn\u2019t harm the network\u2019s ability to continue doing its job because the data being sent over the network is (1)paid for per-byte, and (2)regulated via the blocksize cap. Regulated, not \u201cartificially capped\u201d. The blocksize doesn\u2019t restrict transaction flow, it regulates the amount of broadcast-to-all data being sent over the network. Herein lies the problem.When we talk about the \u201cdata directory\u201d size, it\u2019s a direct reference to the size of the entire chain of blocks from the original genesis block, but taking this at face value results in the standard responses:Disk space is cheap, also see Moore\u2019s Law.You can prune the blockchain if you need to anyway.You don\u2019t need to validate everything from the genesis block, the last X amount of blocks is enough to trust the state of the network.What these completely ignore is the data per-second a node must process.You can read my entire article about Moore\u2019s Law if you want, but I\u2019ll excerpt the important part below. Over in Oz they try and argue \u201cyou don\u2019t need to run a node, only miners should decide what code is run\u201d. It\u2019s borderline absurd, but I won\u2019t have to worry about that here because Proof of Stake completely removes miners and puts everything on the nodes. (They always were, but now there aren\u2019t miners to divert the argument.)Moore\u2019s Law is a measure of integrated circuit growth rates, which averages to 60% annually. It\u2019s not a measure of the average available bandwidth (which is more important).Bandwidth growth rates are slower. Check out Nielsen\u2019s Law. Starting with a 1:1 ratio (no bottleneck between hardware and bandwidth), at 50% growth annually, 10 years of compound growth result\u2019s in a ~1:2 ratio. This means bandwidth scales twice as slow in 10 years, 4 times slower in 20 years, 8 times in 40 years, and so on\u2026 (It actually compounds much worse than this, but I\u2019m keeping it simple and it still looks really bad.)Network latency scales slower than bandwidth. This means that as the average bandwidth speeds increase among nodes on the network, block & data propagation speeds do not scale at the same rate.Larger blocks demand better data propagation (latency) to counter node centralization.Strictly from an Ethereum perspective with a future network of just nodes after the switch to Proof of Stake, you\u2019d generally want to ensure node centralization is not an issue. The bottleneck for Bitcoin\u2019s network is its blocksize (as it should be), because it ensures the growth rate of network demands never exceed the growth rate of external (and in some cases indeterminable) limitations like computational performance or network performance. Because of Ethereum\u2019s exponentially growing blocksize, the bottleneck is not regulated below these external factors and as such results in a shrinking and more centralized network due to network demands that increasingly exceed the average users hardware and bandwidth.Bitcoin SPV clients aren\u2019t nodes. They don\u2019t propagate blocks or transactions around the network, they leech, and all that they leech are the block headers.Remember this because it\u2019s going to get very important later in this\u00a0article:You can put invalid transactions into a block and still create a valid block header.If the network is controlled by 10 FULL-nodes, you only need half of them to ignore/approve invalid transactions so long as the header is valid.This is why validating the transactions matter from a network perspective, and why you need a large decentralized network. It doesn\u2019t matter from my grandmas perspective and that\u2019s fine, but we aren\u2019t talking about my grandma. We\u2019re talking about ensuring the network of working and actively participating nodes grows, not shrinks.This node was participating until it got cut off due to network demand growth:https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/58ectw/geth_super_fast/d908tik/It\u2019s not uncommon and it continues to happen:https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/14647Notice how the solution is to \u201cfind a good peer\u201d or \u201cupgrade your hardware\u201d? Good peers shouldn\u2019t be the bottleneck. Hardware shouldn\u2019t be either. When all of your peers are hosed up by so many others leeching from them (because the good peers are the ones doing the real work), you create a network of masters and slaves that gradually trend towards only one master and all slaves. (If you don\u2019t agree with that statement you need to make a case for how this trend won\u2019t subside in the future because currently that\u2019s the direction this is going towards and it won\u2019t stop unless a cap is put in place. If your answer is sharding, I address that fairy dust at the end.) It\u2019s the definition of centralizing. Unregulated blocks centralize networks. Large (but capped) blocks are only marginally better, but set a precedent for an ever increasing block size, which is equally as bad because it sets a precedent of increasing the size \u201cin times of need\u201d, which mirrors the results of unregulated blocksizes. This is why we won\u2019t budge on the Bitcoin blocksize.I tweeted about it a few times but clearly I didn\u2019t think that was enough. My Twitter reach doesn\u2019t really extend much into the Ethereum space.That chart is symbolic and not representative of any actual numbers. It only serves to visually express the point I\u2019m trying to make. To clarify, the green curve represents an aggregated average of the various demands of the Ethereum Network. At some point your node will fall out of sync because of this or a blocksize cap will be put in place. It could happen now, or it could happen in 10 years, or in 50 but your node will fall out of sync at some point at this rate. It will never happen in Bitcoin. You can deny it now all you want, but this article will be here for when it happens, and when it does asinine Dapps like CryptoKitties, Shrimp Farm, Pepe Farm, and whatever comes next will cease to function. This is exactly what happened to Ryan Charles\u2019 service Yours.org that he originally built on Bitcoin. The only difference being Bitcoin already had the cap in place and Ryan either didn\u2019t foresee this from a lack of understanding, or for some reason he expected the blocksize to keep getting raised. Instead of reassessing he doubled down on BCash, meanwhile Yalls.org took his concept and implemented the same exact thing on top of Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network.My Prediction: Ethereum will implement a blocksize cap and it will race BCash to both of their\u00a0deaths.http://bc.daniel.net.nz/ \u2190No longer updating statistics, chart is edited & extrapolated using REAL current\u00a0data.https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/143/what-are-the-ethereum-disk-space-needsThe chart above isn\u2019t even a prediction. This is me filling in the blanks (in yellow) on what was the last remaining graph that compared both chains data directories, and then extrapolating from it. Here\u2019s what we know:Bitcoin\u2019s future is predictable. The blockchain growth & network demands will always be linear. (Ideal)The amount of data an Ethereum node is required to process per second is through the roof and climbing. (Unideal)If Ethereum on-chain demand freezes where it is now, blockchain growth will continue the linear trend highlighted by that dotted line. (Very bad)If Ethereum on-chain demand continues to grow exponentially the amount of people complaining about their node going out of sync will reach a tipping point. (There\u2019s only one option when this occurs.)That graph above? The owner stopped trying to maintain the node. Physical demands are an issue as well, like time constraints in your personal life. Servicing requirements need to be low, not high, not reasonable\u2026low.Do you know what I do to service my Bitcoin/Lightning node? I leave my laptop on. That\u2019s it. If I have to reboot I shut down the services, reboot, and start them back up again. Day to day I use my laptop for an assortment of other tasks, none of which inhibit its ability to run the node software. With all due respect if a change was implemented and forced on me that resulted in my node no longer being compatible with the network and unable to maintain a sync, I would flip out over the idiocy that allowed that, if I was a misinformed individual. Fortunately I\u2019m not and I signed up for a blockchain with foresight (Bitcoin).The problem? I don\u2019t think most of the people running Ethereum nodes are informed enough to know what they signed up for. I don\u2019t think they understand the fundamental incentive models, and I don\u2019t think they fully realize where and why they break down with something as simple as not having a blocksize cap. Hopefully this article will succeed at teaching that.So what happens when that psychological tipping point is reached? Do people give up? How many nodes have to be lost for this to occur? The explorer websites aren\u2019t even tracking this data anymore. Etherscan.io is no longer tracking full or fast sync directories, Etherchain.org says: Error: Not FoundEtherscan also isn\u2019t letting you zoom out on the memory pool, the queue of transactions waiting to be included into blocks. The reason fees go up is because this queue builds up. You should be able to see this over time. Here\u2019s one that tracks Bitcoin\u2019s mempool, side by side with the Etherscan.io one:https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,4d /// https://etherscan.io/chart/pendingtxBoth of these charts are monitoring the rough total pending transaction counts on these networks, and the scales are about the same, 4/5 days respectively. The difference? I can zoom out on the Bitcoin one and see the entire history. Why does this matter? Psychology matters when your network has no regulated upper boundaries. Here what ours looks like zoomed out:See what I mean? See how scale matters? What if I zoomed out on Ethereum\u2019s mempool and saw that it was at the top of an ever growing mountain? I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s where it is today, but I am saying that this information needs to stop being obscured. I\u2019m also saying that if/when it ever is unobscured, it\u2019ll be too late and nothing can be done about it anyway. It\u2019s already too late now.Let\u2019s take a look at block and transaction delay on Bitcoin\u2019s network. Below you\u2019ll see two charts. The 1st one is how long it takes for a block to spread across the network, the 2nd is for a transaction. Transactions are processed by the nodes (all 115,000 of them) and held onto until a valid block is created by a miner and announced to the network.Block propagation times have dropped drastically because of very well designed improvements to the software. Transactions are validated when they come in and kept in the mempool. When a new block is received, it\u2019s quickly cross referenced with all the transactions you already have stored, and very rarely includes many transactions you haven\u2019t received yet. This allows your node to validate that block extremely fast and send it out to all your other peers.Transaction times on the other hand have slowly gone up but seem to be stabilizing. They\u2019ve been \u201cintentionally\u201d allowed to go up as a result of privacy improvements in the software, but that\u2019s a worthy tradeoff because blocks are 10 minutes apart on average anyway, so a delay of 16 seconds is acceptable. I\u2019d imagine that once blocks are consistently full this growth will level off because transaction fees from the blocksize cap will self-regulate the incoming flow of transactions, assuming no other protocol changes are made.Keep in mind, none of this information is available for Ethereum:https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/bitcoin/Bitcoin is designed with this in mind. The transaction count queue goes up but the blocks are regulated. People end up learning how to use this tool we call a blockchain the right way over time and transaction flow stabilizes. With an unregulated tool you end up with a bunch of people chaotically trying to use that tool all at once for some random \u201cfeature\u201d like CryptoKitties that ends up grinding the entire thing to a halt until the backlog is processed. All of the Ethereum full-nodes need to process every single one of these contracts. You might not need to, and they might tell you that you don\u2019t need to, but someone does need to. So how many of them are there? What do higher fees do? They deter stupid Dapps like CryptoKitties at the base layer. There is absolutely zero need for them, and larger more \u201cfunctional ideas\u201d will only experience the same thing but much worse because blockchains don\u2019t scale.These Dapps are crippling your blockchain because it\u2019s unregulated:But that was the promise though, right? That was the dream. That was the entire premise of the Ethereum blockchain: Bitcoin, but better. It\u2019s not.Clearly unregulated blocks don\u2019t result in infinite transactions, but the real takeaway here is the network can\u2019t even physically handle the current amount, there just aren\u2019t enough nodes capable of processing that information and relaying it in a timely fashion. Do you know how many Ethereum nodes there are? Do you really know? The Bitcoin network has about 115,000 nodes, of which about 12,000 are listening-nodes. Almost all of them are participating nodes, because that\u2019s regulated too. What a listening-node is, compared to a non-listening, doesn\u2019t matter here because they are all participating in sending and receiving blocks to and from the peers they are connected to. The default is 8, the client won\u2019t even let you get more than 8 unless you add them manually. This was intentionally put in place, and it\u2019s recommended you don\u2019t add more because it\u2019s unhealthy for the network:https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/8140Remember this from earlier?Find a good\u00a0peer.That\u2019s not how you fix things. This is a prime example of why a chain that allows participants the freedom to be selfish via lack of regulation is bad. This only has one outcome: Master & Slave nodes, where the limited masters serve all the slave nodes. Sounds decentralized, right? Especially when the financial requirements to be one of those master nodes keeps going up\u2026To be fair, and as an aside: This is the exact criticism the Lightning Network gets, but it\u2019s a completely different type of network. Blockchain networks are peer-to-peer broadcast networks. State-Channel networks like Lightning are peer-to-peer anycast networks. The way information is being sent is completely different. Your refrigerator has enough hardware to be a Lightning node. Lightning \u201cHub & Spoke\u201dcriticisms are with channel balance volumes. Hub & Spoke is equivalent to the Master & Slave issues, but with channel balances there is no bottleneck on the data. You just standardize the Lightning clients to open X amount of channels with X amount funds in each, then network forms around that standard, completely avoiding hubs or spokes, just like the Bitcoin clients standardize 8 peers. The Lightning Network is new so we don\u2019t know what that standard should be yet because we have almost zero data we can measure. /endlightningdefenseSpeaking of zero data we can measure, why are these the only charts for Ethereum node counts? Where\u2019s the history? How many of these nodes used fast/warp sync and never fully validated it all? You don\u2019t need to store it all because you can prune, but again, how many are fully validated? How many are just light clients syncing only the block headers?https://www.ethernodes.org/network/1It\u2019s funny how propaganda sites like Trustnodes pushing BCash conspiracies publish pieces like the following one with bold-faced lies, then it gets circulated around and no one outside the flow of correct information questions it:I\u2019m not linking to a BCash propaganda site.There are 115,000 Bitcoin nodes and they all fully validate:http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.htmlSo what do you do now? What do you do as an individual who slowly comes to this realization? What do you do as an individual who has no idea what\u2019s going on? What happens to a network that is primarily made up of these individuals that slowly leave (not literally, but as a participating node downgrading to a light-node)? How many participating nodes are left? How many nodes hold a full copy of the original genesis block? What happens when 5 data centers are serving the entire network of slaves (light-nodes) the chain? Who\u2019s validating those transactions when everyone is only syncing the block headers? You can sit there and repeat time and time again that \u201cthe network only needs the recent state history to be secure\u201d all you want, but when your network is broken from the bottom up and most nodes can\u2019t even keep up with the last 1,000 blocks, how is that secure in any way?The takeaway from all of\u00a0this:Ethereum\u2019s blocksize growth is bad because of node processing requirements, not how much they need to store on a hard-drive.To prevent complete collapse of the network, Ethereum will need to implement a reasonable blocksize cap.Implementing a blocksize cap will raise fees and in return prevent many Dapps from functioning, or severely slow down. Future Dapps won\u2019t work.If Dapps don\u2019t work, Ethereum\u2019s entire proposition for existing is moot.Where does BCash fit\u00a0in?BCash just increased their blocksize from 8MB to 32MB, and is adding new OP_CODES soon to allow \u201cfeatures\u201d like ICOs and BCash Birdies\u2122.BCash has \u201croom to grow\u201d coming from a completely understressed blockchain, while Ethereum is a completely overstressed blockchain.https://txhighway.cashEthereum is dying and BCash is trying to be exactly like it while ignoring all the warning signs we\u2019ve been trying to bring to everyones attention. They wanted bigger blocks and ICOs, they got it now. Both chains will become the same thing: Centrally controlled blockchains that will slowly die, but given temporary life support via gradual blocksize increases to continue supporting fraudulent utility tokens, until the entire system breaks down when no one can run a node.My Suggestion: Stop using centralized blockchains.This section has been extensively expanded on in the follow-up article. The diagrams have been completely redone. Reading that is a must after this.The only one in that room that runs a fully validating node is the one that\u2019s simultaneously holding up the painting, and the Ethereum network. I\u2019ve managed to make no mention of Vitalik this whole article so I can focus on the technicalities, but if this picture (or the original) doesn\u2019t represent the essence of the Ethereum space then I don\u2019t know what does. I applaud Vitalik for calling out scammers like Fake Satoshi, yet at the same time he equally misrepresents the functionality claims of Ethereum.Oh, and that golden goose egg you call sharding? It\u2019s hocus pocus. Fairy dust. It\u2019s the same node centralization issue with a veil thrown in front of it. It\u2019s effectively force feeding you the Master & Slave network I just warned you about, under the disguise of \u201cnew scaling tech\u201d.Forgetting Vitalik\u2019s diagram he put out because it\u2019s meaningless, let\u2019s try to simplify Ethereum\u2019s current network first. The diagram below essentially shows all the light-clients in pink and the \u201cgood\u201d full-nodes in purple. Your fast/warp sync node may be purple now until it can\u2019t or you give up on upgrading/maintaining and just use the light client feature, then it joins the pink group.As time moves forward, the pink nodes increase while the purple decrease. This is inevitable because it\u2019s what everyone is already doing. Do you run a full-node or a light client? Do you run anything at all? Switching to using the light client is consistently recommended \u201cif syncing fails\u201d. That\u2019s not a fix.Don\u2019t worry though, Vitalik is here to save the day. He\u2019s turning \u201cnodes\u201d into SPV clients that only sync the block headers:But what does that mean? Well, fortunately I wasted a lot of time writing and drawing this up too so I can explain it visually, but first let\u2019s start with words:In Bitcoin you either fully validate, or you don\u2019t. You\u2019re either:A Full-Node and do everything. You fully validate all transactions/blocks.An SPV Client that does nothing, is just tethered to a full-node, syncs just the block headers, and shares nothing. They are not part of the network. They shouldn\u2019t even be mentioned here but I\u2019m doing it to avoid confusion.Again, there are 115,000 Bitcoin full-nodes that do everything.https://twitter.com/StopAndDecrypt/status/1002666662590631942You can either read about this in more depth in Part 2, or you can take a look at the standalone article below:Bitcoin Miners Beware: Invalid Blocks Need Not ApplyBitcoin is an impenetrable fortress of validation.hackernoon.comIn Ethereum there are:Full-Nodes that do everything. They fully validate all transactions/blocks.Nodes that try to do everything but can\u2019t sync up because of peer issues so they skip the line and use warp/fast sync, and then \u201cfully\u201d-validate new transactions/blocks.Light-\u201cnodes\u201d that are permanently syncing just the block headers, and I guess they are sharing the headers with other similar nodes, so let\u2019s call these \u201cSPV Nodes\u201d. They don\u2019t exist in Bitcoin, again SPV clients in Bitcoin don\u2019t propagate information around, they aren\u2019t nodes.That Ethereum node count? Guarantee you those are mostly Light-Nodes doing absolutely zero validation work (checking headers isn\u2019t validation). Don\u2019t agree with that? Prove me wrong. Show me data. They are effectively operating a secondary network of just sharing the block headers, but fraudulently being included in the network node count. They don\u2019t benefit the main network at all and just leech.In New-Ethereum (2.0) with Sharding, things change a bit. I\u2019ve went ahead and edited out this section because I wrote an entire second article on it that does a much better job at explaining this, and the differences between Bitcoin and old and new Ethereum (2.0):Sharding centralizes Ethereum by selling you Scaling-In disguised as Scaling-OutThe differences between Light-Clients & Fully-Validating Nodeshackernoon.comThis isn\u2019t scaling. When your node can\u2019t stay in sync it downgrades to a light client. Now with sharding it can downgrade to a \u201cshard node\u201d\u00a0. None of this matters. You\u2019re still losing a full-node every time one downgrades. What\u2019s even worse is they are calling all the pink dots nodes even though they are only syncing the headers and trusting the purple nodes to validate.How would you even know how many fully validating nodes there are in this set up? You can\u2019t even tell now because the only sites tracking it count the light clients in the total. How would you ever know that the full-nodes centralized to let\u2019s say, 10 datacenters? You\u2019ll never know. You. Will. Never. Know.On the other hand, Bitcoin is built from the ground up to prevent this:https://twitter.com/_Kevin_Pham/status/999152930698625024So what are you going to do?What should you do?Are you a developer?

And it\u2019s just the beginning!Building on our rapid trajectory from launch in February 2017 to present day, the Shopin Team is in the middle of a high-octane summer, and we have lots of exciting news and progress to share with our community, participants, and supporters.As we continue our passionate mission to create an enriched retail economy that empowers retailers to become stronger by working together and rewards shoppers based on the data that they fully own and control, Shopin raised more than $40 million during a successful Token Generation Event that ended on April 30 and placed us among the most successful TGEs in cryptocurrency history.A Super Star List of BackersWe could not have accomplished this incredible momentum without the hard work and dedication of our A-list backers from Block One Capital, Nima Capital, Passport Capital, Traub Capital, Lydian Capital, Krowdmentor, Elcap, Genesis Block, Gambit, ICO Syndicate, Ampli Capital, Tom Gonser (founder of DocuSign), and the Chicago Crypto Fund, to name just a few.Partnerships in DevelopmentShopin continues to nurture many fast-moving partnership developments with some of the world\u2019s largest brands, including two large retail brands in the UAE, and the continued support and partnership of Marvin Traub Associates and their far-reaching retail and business connections all over the world.The Wallet Hack and Token Swap SolutionWe launched our Token Swap in mid-July to protect token participants, combat and thwart bad actors involved in a syndicate wallet hack earlier this month, and set a tone to restore security and transparency in the industry-wide TGE process by saving the funds of more than 3,000 Japanese participants. For those of you who didn\u2019t hear the news about the wallet hack, you can read about it here and here, and feel free to ask us any questions on our Telegram channel or contact us directly at marketing@shopin.com.Shopin Making HeadlinesWe continue to pick up press mentions all over the media map. Eran Eyal, our fearless CEO and Founder, recently returned from a trip to Korea where he\u2019s building powerful relationships within the retail and fashion world, and our amazing tech team continues to build out Shopin\u2019s GDPR-compliant technology solution to new and innovative heights.Shopin is making headlines and getting coverage in many of the world\u2019s major press outlets, ranging from Forbes, Bloomberg, and Reuters, to CNBC, Business Insider, and TD Ameritrade, to name just a few. And this is just the tip of the media iceberg!Forbes recently featured Eran and the Shopin business model in a piece titled \u201cThree Breakthroughs That Will Disrupt the Tech World in 2019,\u201d in which the writer, Gideon Kimbrell, described blockchain as the future of data security and privacy, and how our universal Shopper Profile is redefining the role of user data control and ownership as a benefit for both retailers and shoppers.A Master of BlockchainEran also got some major sunshine recently for his incredible work as an entrepreneur in the tech, blockchain, and A.I. space in Andrew Roman\u2019s insightful and well-researched book \u201cMasters of Blockchain & Initial Coin Offerings.\u201dThe spotlight on Eran talked about the early days of Shopin and how his two cofounders, Divakar Rayapaty and Jeremy Harkness, solved some of Shopin\u2019s initial business challenges by leveraging blockchain technology. The author went into details on the trials of raising capital, how Eran successfully built and continues to grow a solid community of supporters, and the process behind launching and concluding a successful ICO in the complex and heady world of cryptocurrency.Our Technology ThrivesOn the tech development and innovations front, we recently released a preview of some of our tech innovations on GitHub on the heels of a third-party audit performed by a representative from Novoa Media. The audit, while mostly internal, included aspects of Shopin\u2019s A.I., personalization algorithms, and back-end software as examples of the significant product development milestones Shopin is spearheading for the technology and crypto communities.\u201cWe\u2019re doing very important blockchain and A.I. development at Shopin,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cThere is a balance of showing transparency and also retaining some of the proprietary stuff we have spent time and capital building. We are leveraging GitHub just like everyone else is, but we are doing some specialized work that we must keep private for the immediate time being. That said, people are always welcome to go see the open source code of the projects we support.\u201dUnder Divakar and Jeremy\u2019s leadership, the Shopin engineering and development team continues to fire away on cylinders and recently extended our Product Roadmap up to 2019 as we pave the way for Shopin\u2019s official launch in Q4.An Accountable and Attestable UtilityShopin also officially demonstrated Proof of Concept (POC) in April when the company\u2019s engineers and technologists were able to prove its function as an accountable and attestable utility that can move between a retailer and a Shopin user as intended.\u201cWe have now proved that Shopin can move tokens on and off the Ethereum network through an Atomic swap,\u201d said Jeremy. \u201cBy establishing this critical POC, we are showing the rest of the world that we can move something that functions fully as a utility into a tech stack that allows retailers and consumers to transact with those tokens with much higher throughput. There is no waiting time for the retailer or the shopper, who is instantly rewarded for engaging with a retailer\u2019s advertising, engaging in loyalty incentives, and redeeming tokens against recommended product purchases. This confirms the Shopin model and will enable us to scale very quickly at this point.\u201dA Sweep of Industry AwardsOn the awards front, we continue to get wonderful and encouraging acknowledgement for how Shopin is leveraging blockchain and A.I. to completely transform and revolutionize the way shoppers and retailers interact with one another.We kicked off the summer season by being named the \u201cMost Promising ICO of 2018\u201d at Bitcoinference, Brussels\u2019 premier blockchain and finance event of the year. Shopin was chosen from a select group of 25 highly original companies ranging from next-gen hardware solutions to digital device technology. The event focused on how blockchain and emerging technology are transcending many of the world\u2019s business institutions.Shopin is also the winner of the \u201cBest ICO\u201d at the North American Bitcoin Conference, Coinagenda Global, and the \u201cTop 5 ICO\u201d at d10E Seoul and Davos.Our Team AdvancesAs we continue our momentum in assembling one of the sharpest, most accomplished teams in the industry, we recently brought on seasoned tech veteran Jennifer Haggerty as our COO. Jennifer began her career working at major investment banks in NYC raising capital for companies in the public markets and executing M&A transactions. She joined online ad tech company DoubleClick (now owned by Google) in Corporate Development and led the raise of more than $1 billion capital in the public markets and over $1 billion in M&A transactions, extending DoubleClick\u2019s leadership and innovation in the early days of online advertising.As our marketing needs ramp up, we recently brought on Leigh Ferreira to spearhead new marketing initiatives and brand strategy.A longtime tech-savvy marketing star with years of experience in consumer marketing, advertising, and branding with an emphasis on web/mobile, social media, video and content partnerships/distribution, Leigh brings tremendous talent and resources to the Shopin Team. Leigh has worked with brands such as Apple, Capital One, Facebook, General Mills, harman/kardon, JP Morgan Chase, Mattel (Barbie, MyScene, Mattel Corporate), TED, Visa, and Poke\u0301mon, to name just a few.Shopin Korea ExpandsDuring his week-long visit, Eran also spent valuable time with Shopin\u2019s Korea team, handpicked for their combined retail, financial, and cryptocurrency expertise.Heather joins Shopin with more than a decade of experience in the financial and business development sectors starting with a decade at Merrill Lynch, and then as VP at HSBC before becoming a lead BD executive at Daewoo Securities. She then struck out to become a successful entrepreneur where she leverages her years of experience and powerful corporate connections in the region.Pierre is an importer of luxury products in Korea with deep relationships throughout the region and decades of entrepreneurial and business development experience, and Eugene is a former partner of investor George Soros and the owner of private equity firm Eos Partners. Fun fact: Jeff Bezos once approached Eugene to head up Amazon Korea.A Global FootprintWith our team spread out all over the world\u200a\u2014\u200afrom Canada, India, Russia, Korea, Tel Aviv, New York, Los Angeles, and Boston\u200a\u2014\u200athe Brooklyn Shopin crew took a moment to give a shout out to all of you for your enduring support!We urge you to stay in touch with us as we continue our exciting journey.

Imagine you didn\u2019t need to trust your bank to deposit your money there. Imagine you didn\u2019t need to trust your government to know it was being just and fair.What would happen?It would change the world.This is precisely the promise of blockchains.Cryptocurrencies, which are built on blockchains, are all over the press these days, mostly because of the high prices, volatility, and sensational narratives surrounding debacles like Mt. Gox and The Silk Road.But there\u2019s something much bigger going on than just digital currencies.While the mainstream media has been busy speculating about prices and black market intrigues, they\u2019ve missed the fact that beneath it all, cryptographers had quietly invented an entirely new set of technological primitives.Blockchains (and the consensus protocols that support them) were invented as a result of developers trying to solve a bold problem: how to create digital, untraceable money. By combining cryptography, game theory, economics, and computer science, they managed to create an entirely new set of tools for building decentralized systems.But what they created will change much more than just how we exchange money. It\u2019s going to change the entire world. And hardly anyone seems to notice.Edward Witten, the famous physicist, once said of string theory that it was \u201ca part of 21st century physics that fell by chance into the 20th century.\u201d In other words, the physics community was not ready for string theory.Blockchain is a 22nd century technology that fell by chance into the early 21st century.It\u2019s painfully obvious that we\u2019re not ready for it.What is a blockchain?At its core, a blockchain is a surprisingly simple and elegant data structure. It\u2019s basically just a linked list with one important augmentation\u200a\u2014\u200aeach block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block. This creates an effectively unalterable chain of blocks and their fingerprints, stretching back to the original block.If everyone in your system replicates this linked list (and verifies its legitimacy by repeating the cryptographic hash functions), it will implement a slow and somewhat crude distributed database that\u2019s resistant to tampering.And that\u2019s a blockchain. Doesn\u2019t sound that amazing, does it?Of course, to actually build a functional protocol, you need a lot more than that\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019ll need authentication (public/private key cryptography), a consensus mechanism (Nakamoto consensus via proof-of-work or various kinds of proof-of-stake), space and time optimizations (Merkle trees and Merkle proofs), and a bunch of fancy peer-to-peer networking stuff. But that\u2019s a subject for another, more technical blog post.The point is this: blockchains are a genuinely new tool for organizing complex systems. And we are only beginning to understand how to integrate them into the real world.The promise of blockchainsIf everyone works off the same blockchain, and everyone openly shares what the current state of the blockchain is, and it\u2019s computationally intractable to tamper with it, and everyone agrees on rules of how new data is committed\u2026 then suddenly everything changes.Suddenly you can build completely decentralized systems that require no trust among participants. So long as enough actors in the system follow the rules of the protocol (in the most primitive case, at least 50% of them are good), then you can imbue the system with provable security guarantees. Conspiracies or bad actors can\u2019t censor or vandalize the system.You can even engineer the right incentives straight into the protocol, and then have every actor in the system enforce them.Using blockchains, a lot of massive coordination problems simply disappear. Conundrums that plague global financial infrastructure, voting, international remittances, insurance policies, custodial records, and even government corruption can simply be designed out of existence.By creating the right system with the right guarantees, you can fix bad incentives. You can eliminate corrupt middle-men and rent-seekers. You can create whole new societies that can coordinate better, more transparently, and more efficiently than ever before considered possible.It\u2019s really hard for most people to grasp the significance of this.I\u2019ll put it this way: if John Locke knew about blockchains, it undoubtedly would\u2019ve compelled him to write a third treatise on government. It would\u2019ve been a revolutionary idea in how to coordinate a society.The future of the\u00a0futureMost people I know right now in Silicon Valley are focused on deep learning and AI as the most promising technological revolution. And I share their enthusiasm! Deep learning is going to upend industries and give us new capabilities that we only imagined in high science fiction.But blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200ablockchain is going to upend entire societies. It\u2019s going to enable new kinds of governance systems that were before only the daydreams of utopians and philosophers.And yet, when you look at the cryptocurrency world right now, you\u2019re not necessarily going to recognize that.Most of what\u2019s going on right now falls into two categories.The first are the crypto-anarchists and hackers who are building low-level protocols. They\u2019re racing to build what will become the decentralized TCP/IP stack for future builders.The second category are the profiteers who trying to make a quick buck off the unaware and the optimistic.Unfortunately, this second category is getting most of the attention.The tower of BlockchainImagine stumbling across the world wide web in 1995, browsing through dinky fan sites catering to eccentrics, and thinking: \u201cHah. Wow. This weird little ecosystem is going to be really important someday.\u201dThat was blockchain a few years ago. In other words, blockchain has safely crossed the Angelfire chasm.Now that it has proven its first glimmer of usefulness, the next act is inevitable.You may have heard about the ICO mania, or the recent rallies of the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The wise and the wily have taken notice and have realized blockchain\u2019s tremendous potential.

The project not only consists of a high transaction throughput and secure blockchain communication infrastructure but also includes a specialized blockchain on chip hardware solution. The BoC provides both blockchain-ready components and artificial intelligence (AI) acceleration. To this end, the chip contains a cold-storage cryptocurrency wallet, hash acceleration, and automatic transaction signing hardware.In this current article, we will discuss the disruptive nature of Skynet, and which measures are put in place to ease adoption.The IoT Chip\u00a0MarketToday, most chips used in connected devices are based on ARM designs. ARM\u2019s market dominance has been due to excellent battery life with good performance, whilst being ahead of the competition continuously in recent years. The company\u2019s market share is estimated to be 94 % in the smartphone segment alone, and these days, it is very hard to find a system on a chip design without an ARM core.Because of this monopoly, ARM is in a position to charge between 1 and 10 million USD upfront for ARM-based chip licensing. They also earn between 1 and 2 % in royalties on every chip sold.It is only recently that alternatives have become available. In the same way, open source software has managed to break up software monopolies, the RISC-V foundation promotes a free and open instruction set architecture for processor cores. RISC-V can be used as a license-free basis for modern system on a chip designs.Skynet, with over 15 patent-pending innovations, plans to leverage and add its IP to this alternative in order to provide a license-free blockchain- and AI-ready chip solution. Skynet Core aims to replace existing processor cores to provide a fully integrated solution for tomorrow\u2019s machine-to-machine (M2M) economy.Skynet Core\u00a0BundleSkynet Core is bundled with a number of features designed to ease adoption and make decentralized intelligent networks of IoT devices a reality:On-chip hardware crypto-currency hardware wallets will allow devices to participate in M2M micropayments and facilitate seamless blockchain integration in the safest possible way.Hardware acceleration for key cryptographic algorithms allows for efficient blockchain integration. This revolutionary design is similar to the way Graphics Processing Units have made computer games and other graphics-intensive applications possible in recent years.The ability to automatically sign transactions provides built-in device identity and data integrity guarantees.AI-specific modules, such as on-chip tensor processor arrays allow deep learning applications, including on-chip training, previously unheard of in embedded devices.The combination of the license-free core design with the bundled modules aimed at seamless end-to-end integration should position Skynet Core as a real alternative for IoT device integrators.Skynet Open Network\u00a0AdoptionThe Skynet Core blockchain chip will not stand on its own. As explained previously, the Skynet Open Network is a high transaction throughput blockchain solution aimed at providing the backbone for secure M2M communication on a global scale.The combination of powerful hardware and the secure communication infrastructure provides the basis for real-world decentralized networks of connected devices. Imagine millions of devices sharing their computing power for deep learning applications.Consider an example of this type of interaction: A group of devices may specialize in data collection participating in a data economy and are rewarded by sharing data. Other devices might put their computing power at the disposal of the network, allowing a third group of devices to use these resources to train AI algorithms on the acquired data. With the Skynet hardware and network combination, all this can be achieved autonomously through M2M interactions in a peer-to-peer manner, without the need for any centralized infrastructure.In this sense, the Skynet Open Network acts as a decentralized alternative to cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Providing a cloud computing service on top of Skynet Open Network is one of many possible decentralized use case scenarios. Third parties might implement the necessary cloud computing abstractions as a decentralized platform as a service model.End-to-end SolutionThe above examples show that Skynet\u2019s integrated approach will provide alternative solutions at several levels. At the lowest level, Skynet Core\u2019s open licensing model will provide a viable alternative to existing chipsets. Integration with specific blockchain and AI hardware modules will provide additional incentives for the system\u2019s adoption.Skynet\u2019s network layer provides the secure backbone, making a decentralized M2M economy possible. On top of this infrastructure, distributed AI applications backed by decentralized resource sharing will make applications possible that we are only beginning to imagine.", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "Creating Your First Blockchain with Java.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency\u200a\u2014\u200aa digital version of an asset, much like gold. In 2017, its value skyrocketed.Blockchain is the tech that underpins it. It\u2019s a powerful concept and has the potential to change the world pretty drastically.But what is\u00a0it?Blockchain is known as \u201cdistributed ledger\u201d technology.Almost everything we do, whether it\u2019s getting ill, buying a house, using a credit card, voting, traveling by car, or using public transport, involves the creation and movement of data.Blockchain is a new way of storing and moving that data, where instead of being held all in one place, the information is atomized and spread over thousands of nodes across a network, all locked together with clever cryptography.That structure allows a lot of cool new opportunities, which we\u2019ll get to in a bit.Hang on. Why does information need revolutionizing? What\u2019s wrong with the way we store information now?At the moment, the data that rules our lives is\u200a\u2014\u200afor the most part\u200a\u2014\u200akept in big lumps in one place, whether on a private server, in the cloud, or on paper in libraries or archives. That\u2019s fine for a lot of things, but it can also be vulnerable to attack.It was recently revealed that hackers breached Uber last year and stole the personal information of 57 million users. You probably heard about the hack\u200a\u2014\u200aand subsequent publication online\u200a\u2014\u200aof data on up to 37 million users of the extramarital dating site Ashley Madison the same year. Or the more recent breach at the U.S. credit rating company Equifax, which saw the personal data of 143 million U.S. consumers, including Social Security numbers and, in some cases, driver\u2019s license numbers and even credit card details, stolen.Photo: Thomas Hawk on\u00a0FlickrThese breaches can have serious consequences, leaving millions of people vulnerable to identity theft and fraud. The personal nature of the Ashley Madison data compounded the problem, contributing to at least two suicides.Blockchain would have stopped\u00a0that?Not necessarily. Blockchain can\u2019t stop hackers getting into your computer system if your admin password is \u201cpassword.\u201d But other times, hackers use brute force\u200a\u2014\u200asheer computing power\u200a\u2014\u200ato attack a system; blockchain makes that nearly impossible.\u201cThe internet was created to move information,\u201d says Jamie Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Business Council and head of communications for BitFury, a leading blockchain technology company. \u201cThat information needed to be stored somewhere, so everyone on earth has a zillion databases. Essentially, you can think of them like houses. It\u2019s hard to break into a house, but not impossible, and cybersecurity is just a lot of really fancy ways to protect that house.\u201dBlockchain technology breaks the database into a million tiny pieces, which are then spread across thousands of computers. \u201cInstead of breaking into a house,\u201d Smith says, \u201cyou now have to break into an entire town.\u201dAnd that\u2019s the \u201cdistributed\u201d part of\u00a0it?Exactly. Each part of the structure\u200a\u2014\u200awhether it\u2019s a unit of currency like bitcoin, or the navigation system of a self-driving car, say, or your health or voting records\u200a\u2014\u200ais spread across the network in a web of interwoven chains of data. The system gets exponentially more secure the more complex it gets.That\u2019s clever.That\u2019s just the start. It also self-checks and self-repairs. The computers participating in the blockchain help maintain its integrity by checking and verifying sets of transactions\u200a\u2014\u200ablocks\u200a\u2014\u200awhich then form a chain with the history of each piece of data encoded on it. Because the blockchain is constantly checking itself, the data on it is immutable. Even if a hacker did somehow manage to break into a block, any changes they made would be immediately and permanently visible.To get participants to volunteer processing power, different systems based on blockchain, including bitcoin, offer incentives in the form of tokens. That\u2019s what bitcoin is: a value token given in exchange for computer power. That process is called \u201cmining,\u201d and the idea was laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin\u2019s inventor, in this famous white paper.Nakamoto saw that with the right incentives, a network \u201cbased on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party\u201d could grow organically, and the more participants on the network, the more power it has to maintain itself. Today, the computers mining bitcoin\u2019s blockchain run almost 5 quintillion encryption procedures\u200a\u2014\u200acalled \u201chashes\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aper second.That sounds like a\u00a0lot.It really is. There has never been a supercomputer built on Earth that could do anything even close to 4 quintillion hash operations per second. It\u2019s more powerful than the world\u2019s top 500 supercomputers combined. This also uses an astonishing amount of electricity\u200a\u2014\u200abitcoin mining now uses more electricity than the nation of Ireland.A direct comparison is difficult, mind you. Supercomputer power, measured in floating operations per second (FLOPS), is not directly comparable to hashes per second. It\u2019s like the difference between torque and horsepower\u200a\u2014\u200aa tractor may be more powerful than a Ferrari, but it won\u2019t go as fast. Bitcoin isn\u2019t beating Deep Blue at chess anytime soon; it\u2019s just not geared for that. But there has certainly never been anything like it before.This Satoshi sounds like a smart dude. Who is\u00a0he?We don\u2019t know. Satoshi\u2019s identity has always been a secret. People have claimed to be him over the years, but none of them really checked out, and it has been speculated that he may have in fact been a group of people. Those thought to be the most likely candidates have strenuously denied it, and there is now such a mythos around him (or her, or them) that it\u2019s probably better not to know.What we do know is that Satoshi emerged out of a movement known as the cypherpunks, a community of cryptographers, programmers, and sundry thinkers who, toward the end of the 20th century, began to wonder if there was a better way to approach privacy, information, and power. Among their number were Jacob Applebaum, who developed the anonymous web browser Tor; Wikileaks\u2019 Julian Assange; and Bram Cohen, who developed the distributed file-sharing platform BitTorrent.BitTorrent? The thing my cousin uses to download bootleg \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 episodes?That\u2019s the one. Cohen\u2019s insight was that rather than sharing whole files, if you broke them up into small chunks, then people could download them piecemeal from each other as well as from the source. In that sense, BitTorrent shares some spiritual DNA with blockchain.These guys sound like anarchists.Anarchists and libertarians, mostly. Blockchain isn\u2019t seductive just because it\u2019s secure; it has the potential to totally circumvent the entire way we operate as a society.Photo: Rex Roof on\u00a0FlickrTo the cypherpunks, according to Steve Bellovin, professor of computer science at Columbia University in New York, this was \u201ca perfect solution.\u201d Cryptocurrencies had been around, in one form or another, since the \u201980s, but they were centrally created or managed. Satoshi\u2019s insight, elegant and simple, was to decentralize the whole thing.\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to trust governments or banks\u200a\u2014\u200ait looked perfect for this kind of mindset,\u201d Bellovin says. It spoke to \u201cthe cypherpunk dream of a frictionless, or near-frictionless, world economy, allowing money to flow around the globe without having to go through choke points run by governments or monopolistic companies.\u201dI bet the big banks don\u2019t like\u00a0that.Some of them are worried. Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan, has been an outspoken critic of bitcoin in particular. Some say the price growth of bitcoin is a bubble that will inevitably burst sooner or later. But there is a lot of hype around blockchain right now, and banks are not immune to enthusiasm. Initial coin offerings (ICOs), in which new cryptocurrencies are launched, have proliferated madly.Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan and bitcoin critic. Photo: Jesse Baca on\u00a0FlickrNot all of them are legit. In November, the SEC filed fraud charges against the organizers of one ICO, PlexCoin. Just two days later, members of a cryptocurrency mining marketplace called NiceHash found that hackers had breached the site and made off with more than $60 million in bitcoin. Blockchain, like any technology, is only as secure as its users.But hang on, can\u2019t they just check the ledger and find the\u00a0hackers?Yes, actually, in theory they can. While bitcoin in its early days had a reputation for being a tool for criminal activity like drugs or money laundering, that was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what it does and doesn\u2019t anonymize. If you have the resources\u200a\u2014\u200aand the ability to subpoena cryptocurrency exchanges to find out what addresses pertain to which users\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can follow the path of a bitcoin much more accurately than you can a paper dollar.To be clear: Do not use bitcoin for illegal activity; it is not anonymous.I wasn\u2019t going\u00a0to.Good.Anyway, despite those hiccups, blockchain went mainstream in 2017, as the value of bitcoin and Ethereum rocketed up tenfold in the space of a year.Ethereum? What\u2019s\u00a0that?Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain. It\u2019s much smaller than bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200aits cryptocurrency token, ether, has a market cap of $42 billion, compared to bitcoin\u2019s quarter of a trillion dollars\u200a\u2014\u200abut Ethereum can integrate smart contracts onto its blockchain. \u201cSo if I upload a program, let\u2019s say a bet, I escrow some money into it, you escrow some money into it, and then a third party lets us know whether the Chicago Bulls beat the New York Knicks or vice versa, resolving our bet,\u201d explains Joe Lubin, one of Ethereum\u2019s founders.Ethereum isn\u2019t meant to be just a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, according to Lubin, but a full enterprise platform onto which programmers can build applications for any number of things. Despite that, one ether went from being worth $8 in January to being worth $434 in December as investors began to sense the enormous sums of money to be made.So where are we going from\u00a0here?Blockchain is going to become more and more normalized as the gold standard\u2014for security, at least. As a base for currency, it will face some challenges, but most large banks now have departments specializing in cryptocurrencies, and some are considering building their own private blockchains.Some countries are, too. Georgia has built a blockchain system for its land title registry; some U.S. states are reportedly considering a pilot scheme to move voting onto a blockchain. There\u2019s talk of using it to secure the New York stock exchange. Walmart, Nestl\u00e9, and Unilever are looking into using a blockchain to underpin their supply chains.There\u2019s a long way to go yet. Tim Draper, a venture capitalist and bitcoin investor, reckons that eventually \u201cbitcoin will be the main source of money. Blockchain will be used to capture identity and secure contracts. It will be so prevalent that people will not know it, but will use it everywhere.\u201dThat could be a long way off. Bitcoin\u2019s price could continue to rise\u200a\u2014\u200aor it could crash tomorrow and send the market tumbling, forcing regulators to react. Blockchain is the future\u200a\u2014\u200abut getting there may be a bumpy ride.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Breaking Down FLETA\u2019s Proof-of-Formulation", "author_name": "FLETA Blockchain", "link": "https://medium.com/fleta-first-chain/breaking-down-fletas-proof-of-formulation-2860c6cb7178?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 15", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "32K", "content": "Breaking Down FLETA\u2019s Proof-of-FormulationFLETA BlockchainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 15FLETA is a blockchain service platform designed for decentralized applications (DApps) that solves the underlying scalability issue plaguing the blockchain space, which includes balancing the trio of scalability, speed, and decentralization.One of FLETA\u2019s major innovations to the blockchain space is the new and novel \u201cProof-of-Formulation\u201d consensus algorithm that prevents forks by providing real-time confirmation of blocks and transactions. The Proof-of-Formulation consensus algorithm is currently undergoing the patent process through FLETA and the United States Patent office (Application Number: 62717695).What is a consensus algorithm?A consensus algorithm is a process used in computer science to reach agreement between multiple parties on a single data value throughout a distributed network. In blockchain networks, consensus is generally focused around block generation and confirmation.Bitcoin and Ethereum both use the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm for block creation and confirmation of transactions in their respective blockchain networks.PoW is impractical on a larger scale as it requires the entire network to come to majority consensus, which requires the use of excessive amounts of computing power and resources. As a result, Bitcoin is a slow system that manages only 7 transactions per second. Whereas Ethereum isn\u2019t much better with only 15 to 25 transactions per second.Proof-of-FormulationIn Proof-of-Formulation (PoF), mining and block generation is done differently compared with existing blockchain platforms. Formulators act as the block generators in the FLETA platform. Observers allow for real time confirmation of the blocks that are generated and prevent double spending.FormulatorsFormulators serve as the backbone of the PoF algorithm. Their ranking is based on a score which is calculated by the following formula:Score: uint64(Phase) << 32 + uint64(binary.LittenEndian.Uint32(hash[:4]))\u201cHash\u201d serves as the hash value of the previous block, and \u201cPhase\u201d is a time-related value which shows how many times the RankTable has \u201cturned\u201d or gone through all of the formulators for block generation.A new formulator in the system takes part in the RankTable with the Largest Phase+1 value.The purpose of this is to make sure that each Formulator has at least one mining opportunity during each phase and so a different formulator sequence (or ranking) will be made for each phase of block generation. This prevents the potential for attacks and collusion by any malicious Formulators.ObserversIn simple terms, the main role of the Observers is to prevent DDoS attacks and to maintain the security of the entire blockchain network.To maintain the systematic sequence and process of the system, each formulator will access the observer node in order to hide and mask their IPs. This prevents any form of targeted DDoS attacks on formulators.Main features of observer nodes include:5 observer nodes for each Formulator group, 3 of which are required to sign off on a generated block for it to be confirmedReal-time information being received about Formulator\u2019s activitiesNode status and structure information is revealed to formulators and other users to increase the overall transparency of the networkFork Prevention under PoF#1 Discarding Flawed BlocksIf a block generator sends an incorrect block, recipient nodes will discard the block and prepare to receive a new one. In this case, the generator has 1 second to produce a normal block, otherwise the second-ranked formulator will begin creating a new block that will be propagated after 3 seconds if the initial formulator still does not propose a new block.The observer node will acknowledge that the initial generator failed to create a block within 3 seconds and thus proceeds with the signing process of the block from the second-ranked formulator.#2 Fork PreventionAs we have seen with the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, as well as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV splits, forks can be quite detrimental to a blockchain network. The PoF algorithm recitifies this anomaly by making forks impossible to occur.As 3 out of 5 observer nodes are required to sign off on a block in order to confirm it, forks are simply not possible because the first block with 3 out of 5 signatures will be confirmed as the next block in the chain.ConclusionFLETA\u2019s Proof-of-Formulation consensus is not only fast, however it is highly secure as well due to the added layer of protection between Observer nodes, formulators, and the synchronization group.Unlike PoW consensus, PoF does not require excessive computing resources or depend on the amount of \u2018stake\u2019 that someone possesses. Because of this, it reduces the competition about who mines and creates blocks as everyone gets a turn. PoF also has built-in mechanisms to prevent the possibility of any kind of forks.

Right now, that catalyst is the \u201ctoken sale\u201d or \u201cInitial Coin Offering (ICO)\u201d phenomena.ICO vs IPO: The wild west of investmentWhat the heck is an ICO anyway?\u00a0\u00a0You may have heard of an \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d (IPO)\u200a\u2014\u200awhen a company goes public by selling some of its shares to institutional investors, who in turn sell to the general public on the securities exchange. The public gets excited about IPOs because they let anyone with a brokerage account purchase shares of companies like Snapchat.\u00a0\u00a0Are ICOs the same thing? Yes and no. IPOs and ICOs are both used by companies to raise capital. The main (and really important) difference is regulation. IPOs are regulated by the SEC and have a set of legal requirements and a formal process for how they\u2019re carried out. ICOs are currently unregulated and more of a \u201cwild west\u201d practice.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, there seems to be a lot of confusion and uncertainty when it comes to ICOs. Some argue that they have turned into a \u201cperverse and unsustainable Keynesian beauty contest.\u201d Supporters are optimistic and claim that it\u2019s a new form of Venture Capital.\u00a0\u00a0With drastically opposing viewpoints like this dominating the conversation, most of us are left on the sidelines scratching our heads.Necessary background knowledgeYou can\u2019t understand ICOs without understanding the underlying digital asset sold in an ICO.\u00a0\u00a0If you already know the basics of crypto, feel free to skip this section. For the rest of us\u2026 let\u2019s start from the top!The Cryptocurrency technology stackCryptocurrency technology stackBitcoinBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses a peer-to-peer technology.\u00a0\u00a0Peer-to-peer essentially means that there isn\u2019t a central authority issuing new money or tracking transactions. Instead, these operations are managed collectively by the network. The transactions happen between users directly and are recorded on the blockchain (more on that below).\u00a0\u00a0The Internet is filled with great Bitcoin explainers, so I won\u2019t delve much farther down the rabbit hole in this post. Instead, here are some starting points to get you up to speed:Bitcoin Wiki, Wikipedia, What is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Magazine, Why Bitcoin matters.BlockchainA blockchain is a decentralized public database that keeps a permanent record of digital transactions.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, it\u2019s a logfile storing an immutable record of all the digital transactions. This decentralized database is not controlled by a central administrator, but instead is a network of replicated databases (meaning each node in the network stores its own copy of the blockchain) that is shared and visible to anyone within network.\u00a0\u00a0Every \u201cblock\u201d in this blockchain contains a record of recent transactions, a reference to the block that came immediately before it, and an answer to a difficult mathematical puzzle, among other things.A blockchain is collectively maintained by \u201cminers\u201d, who are members within the network that compete to validate Bitcoin transactions in each block by solving the complex algorithmic problem associated with the block.\u00a0\u00a0They do this by buying or renting lots of computing power to run these complex algorithmic problems on. The incentive for them to use their computing power to verify transactions is that they are rewarded with Bitcoin if they solve the problem and validate a Bitcoin block.\u00a0\u00a0The power of such a decentralized network is that economic value and governance are distributed among the network\u2019s stakeholders (i.e. miners and consumers) rather than concentrated in a single organization (e.g. banks, governments & accountants). Thanks to this setup, anyone can own and transfer assets digitally without the need for a third party.Blockchain technology isn\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. It can be used to create any other cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum and Litecoin, which utilize their own blockchains.\u00a0You can read more about bitcoin and blockchain at Wikipedia or watch this great explainer video.Protocol layerNext, we have the protocol layer. In general, a protocol is the special set of rules that nodes in a network use when they transmit information. These rules specify the interactions between the communicating entities.One example of a protocol used in telecommunications is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is a set of rules for exchanging messages at the information packet level on the internet. TCP guarantees that the data packets will be delivered and that they will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent. Another example of a protocol is Internet Protocol (IP), which is a set of rules to send and receive messages at the Internet address level\u200a\u2014\u200ait essentially specifies the format of the data packets on the internet and the addressing scheme.TCP/IP ProtocolWhen discussing blockchains, the term \u201cprotocol\u201d refers to the \u201ccryptoeconomic rules\u201d that are enforced by a blockchain in order to maintain distributed consensus across the blockchain\u2019s peer-to-peer network.Cryptoeconomic rules are rules that govern a decentralized digital economy that:(i) uses public key cryptography for authentication(2) has economic incentives to ensure that the rules are followedFor example, in the case of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, it has financial incentives that are provided to the miners for validating every Bitcoin transaction and in turn, securing the network.What exactly are these financial incentives?TokensEnter tokens.The financial incentive for miners comes from the native token built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin. The coin serves as a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aminers who use their computing power to validate transactions are rewarded with a certain amount of coin.In general, when you hear the term \u201ccryptocurrency tokens\u201d or simply \u201ctokens\u201d, they are referring to tokens such as Bitcoin that are built on top of a blockchain and represent a digital asset which you own and can transfer to someone else.There are various ways to create tokens on top of a blockchain. For example, the simplest tokens to understand are intrinsic tokens like Bitcoin, which is directly built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Or you can choose to fork the Bitcoin blockchain and build tokens on top\u200a\u2014\u200asome examples include ZCash, Litecoin, Monero, and others. Or you can build an entirely new blockchain technology and build a token on top of that\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is what Ethereum did. The token on top of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is \u201cEther\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u2026you can even build tokens on top of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain itself. Gnosis (GNO) and Augur (REP) are examples of this. Perhaps confusing since \u201cEther\u201d is the intrinsic token built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. I\u2019ll explain later in the post. For now, just accept the fact that it\u2019s possible to build other tokens besides the intrinsic token on the Ethereum Blockchain.There\u2019s a helpful analogy here with traditional currencies\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can think of tokens as the currency itself (e.g. USD, EUR, etc.) and the blockchain protocol as the monetary policy.\u00a0\u00a0The main takeaway here is that every token is based on some underlying blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200awhether it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, or some other forked/new blockchain.Regardless of the cryptocurrency in question, tokens are valuable because the blockchain provides a backbone for asset manipulation that is immutable, decentralized, and impossible to counterfeit.The application layerSo far, we\u2019ve learned about Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain that enables it. We\u2019ve also learned about the protocol that determines the rules of the blockchain, and the tokens built on top of it.Together, these technologies have made us rethink our definition of money as something that is digital, easily transferrable, secure, and decentralized.But the important part to realize is that money is just one application of the blockchain. Besides money, the reason so many of us in the crypto-world are nerding out about the blockchain is because it has revealed a potential future for (1) protocols and (2) applications in general.(1) ProtocolsThe ultimate dream of cryptocurrency developers is that we can take advantage of this blockchain technology to build new and improved communication protocols from the ground up. Protocols being developed for cryptocurrencies have the potential to solve problems with centralization that have plagued the Internet since the first dial-up modem whirred and beeped into action.\u00a0\u00a0What are examples of such protocols?Well, they could include protocols for payments, identity, domain name systems, cloud computing, reputation systems, and much more. Many of these systems today are highly centralized (e.g. Stripe, Paypal, Google, Amazon) and there\u2019s no such thing as defaults or standards for these things on the Web.\u00a0\u00a0Hence, in the long term, our hope is that the blockchain technology will enable decentralized, open, and secure protocols to be built with use cases far outside cryptocurrency.(2) ApplicationsBlockchain enables what we call \u201cdecentralized applications\u201d.\u00a0Decentralized application, or \u201cdApp\u201d, is an application built on top of the blockchain. How does that work?Let\u2019s consider the Bitcoin blockchain as an example. Bitcoin uses a scripting system for transactions that occur on the Bitcoin blockchain. A script is a simple list of instructions. So the Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language enables us to write a script that is recorded with every transaction. The purpose of the script is to define the requirements the recipient must meet to gain access to the Bitcoins being transferred.For a typical Bitcoin transfer, the script will define what the spender must provide:a public key that, when hashed, matches the destination address included in the scripta signature to show evidence of the private key corresponding to the public key just providedBut the neat thing is that there\u2019s some flexibility in the parameters we can send with each transaction. For example, we can write a script that says \u201cthis transaction is only valid if it has two private keys\u201d. So essentially, this scripting language now lets us encode rules for how to move money, or more generally, any piece of information, around, without requiring us to trust some third party to follow a set of rules we care about. We simply trust the code and all is well.Because Bitcoin has this scripting language, it\u2019s possible to use this language to build certain types applications that transact on the blockchain. In other words, we can build applications that use Bitcoin transactions to communicate.For example, let\u2019s say we want to build a blockchain-based crowdfunding application. You might have a set of rules for how funds are transferred (or communicated) between one party to another which you encode in the scripting language. Then users of the application can run a crowdfunding event that is governed by the blockchain.This is the main idea behind dApps: a decentralized set of rules that define a specific application. This set of rules sits on a public and decentralized blockchain (instead of a central server owned by some large entity, such as Facebook or Amazon). This enables it to governed by autonomy and be resilient to censorship.\u201cWhere are the apps?\u201d\u00a0dilemmaMany of us in the crypto world were under the impression that developers would immediately hop on the bandwagon and use Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language to build decentralized applications on top.\u00a0\u00a0But fast forward eight years (Bitcoin was released in 2009), and Bitcoin has yet to become more than simply a store of value and a speculative investment.\u00a0Sure, we\u2019ve seen a handful of wallets and exchanges built. (Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex, and GDAX, to name a few.)\u00a0\u00a0\u2026And of course, we can\u2019t forget Silk Road, the digital anonymous drug marketplace that processed over $1 billion in sales in 2.5 years and was shut down by law enforcement in late 2013.\u00a0\u00a0In some ways, Bitcoin could be considered the first decentralized application since it runs on blockchain technology, is fully open-source, and runs without a central authority.\u00a0But seriously, a lot of us are here still looking around and wondering, \u201cWhere are the killer apps?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Sadly, almost no one I know uses blockchain-based applications in their day to day.\u00a0Here are some factors holding these applications back from popularity (note: these are my personal opinions):1. Lack of developer friendliness and\u00a0toolingProgramming applications using Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is not easy. Why?\u00a0\u00a0For one, the scripting language is too limited. A scripting language is a programming language where you can write code to perform some actions. An example of a scripting language widely used on the web today is JavaScript.const greeting = (name) => \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";const add = (a, b) => a + b;const subtract = (a, b) => a - bCompare this to Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language:OP_DUP OP_HASH160 62e907b15cbf27d5425399ebf6f0fb50ebb88f18 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGThe JavaScript on top reads pretty much like English. Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language, on the other hand, looks like machine code. Most developers are used to writing in expressive languages like JavaScript, Ruby or Python\u2026 not machine code. Bitcoin script is daunting for most developers.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, developer tooling and great documentation goes a long way in gaining adoption among developers. Take React, for example, which is one of the most popular front-end libraries today. One of the biggest reasons that React became so popular is because of how much effort the community has put into building a strong set of developer tools (e.g. IDEs, Babel, Webpack, boilerplates, Create React App, etc), documentation, and tutorials. Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem, on the other hand, is the opposite of user-friendly.\u00a0Lastly, Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is not turing complete. A turing complete programming language is one that can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine. In other words, it can be used to solve any computation problem that a Turing machine can run given enough time and memory. (for more on this, read this Stackoverflow discussion). By not being turing complete, Bitcoin script restricts what you can do.\u00a0Overall, Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language has historically been limited, difficult to use and lacked adequate tooling and documentation. As a result, it didn\u2019t encourage a developer community to form, which is the prerequisite to killer applications.2. Building a decentralized application with strong network effects isn\u2019t\u00a0easyMany of the applications we use in our daily work (marketplaces, exchanges, social networks, etc) derive their value from their strong network effects. A network effect is when a product or service increases in value as more people use it.\u00a0\u00a0A classic example is Facebook. Every new user connecting to other users on the platform non-linearly increases the number of connections. Similarly, Venmo is useless if you\u2019re the only person on the platform. For every new friend that joins, the value of the product goes up because you can now pay and/or receive payment from this friend.\u00a0Network effects help build better products and services. However, building up this network is one of the hardest parts of building a successful product, classically known as the \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problem.\u00a0\u00a0So even if a developer were to make the effort to build a decentralized crowdfunding platform on top of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, getting users on both side of the platform (i.e. investors and product-builders) is an incredibly hard challenge.\u00a0\u00a0The blockchain provides the technological underpinnings to create decentralized applications, but it doesn\u2019t provide the framework or tools necessary to drive adoption of the network.3. Decentralization alone doesn\u2019t provide a 10x improvementWhen we talk about decentralized applications built on top of the blockchain, we might think of transaction-based platforms, such crowdfunding, remittances, payments, coupons, etc. It might be a neat technical feat to have a decentralized version of these types of services, but the reality is, we already have existing apps that work perfectly fine for each of these use cases.\u00a0\u00a0For crowdfunding, we have Kickstarter. For remittances, we can use TransferWise. For payments, we can use Credit Cards, Paypal, Venmo, Square, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Peter Thiel\u2019s 10x rule is important to think about when we\u2019re considering how to get users to substitute existing solutions with the new decentralized ones. As of now, it\u2019s unclear what dimension these 10x advantages come from, so far as users go.\u00a0\u00a0Take WeiFund, for example, which is a decentralized crowdfunding platform. As a user, WeiFund's interface and user experience seems similar to conventional crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe. The main differences seem to be that they claim to have lower costs and that they use smart contracts to run the crowdfunding, allowing for more complex agreements. Is this enough to get users to make the effort to switch over (especially when the costs aren't that much lower)?\u00a0By no means do I believe that decentralized applications have no benefits. In fact, I foresee a future where applications are 10x more secure, 10x cheaper, 10x more efficient, or 10x more on some dimension than the current ones.\u00a0\u00a0The point is that these benefits have not been proven yet, so there's little reason for users to consider using a decentralized application today.The rise of decentralized applications\u2026 maybe.Enter Ethereum.Ethereum is a cryptocurrency launched in 2015 and built from the ground up using its own blockchain technology. It was designed to be a more generalized protocol than Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, with the explicit goal of doing more than just creating and recording transfers of a blockchain network\u2019s native tokens.As written in the Ethereum white paper:\u201cThe intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions.\u201dEthereumIn essence, Ethereum is simply a transaction-based state machine: we begin with a \u201cgenesis state\u201d and incrementally execute transactions to transform it into some final state. The final state is what we accept as the canonical version of the current state of the world of Ethereum.Ethereum transactionWhile Bitcoin is the intrinsic token for Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, Ether is the intrinsic token for Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain contains a log of transaction-like events. Users send Ether to one another using the \u201clog,\u201d and miners are incentivized to verify and secure these transactions within the network.But it can also go way beyond that\u200a\u2014\u200athe Ethereum blockchain can be filled with a wider variety of event information coming from any sort of computer program.Let\u2019s look at a few of the core concepts that underly the Ethereum blockchain to understand why this is possible:Ethereum basicsFirst is accounts. There are two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts and Contracts Accounts. Both account types have an Ether balance.The main distinction is that contract accounts have some piece of code associated with them, while externally owned accounts do not. Contract accounts, therefore, have the ability to perform any type of computation when its associated code is executed.Next we have what are known as transactions, which are cryptographically signed data packages that store a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain. When a transaction is sent to a contract account, the code associated with the contract account is executed by the \u201cEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u201d on each node (more on that below).Finally, there are messages. Messages allow contract accounts to call one another. When a contract account send a message to another contract account, the code associated with the account is activated. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it\u2019s produced by a contract account rather than an external account.Let\u2019s quickly explain the concept of the \u201cEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u201d. Remember how we learned that the protocol for the Bitcoin blockchain determines how transactions on the network get verified? Well, in Ethereum\u2019s case, every node that is participating in the Ethereum network runs the EVM as part of this verification process.Source: Coinspace.ioLet\u2019s say we have a set of transactions that were started by some external accounts. These get accumulated into a block, and then the nodes in the Ethereum network go through the transactions listed in the block and run the code associated with these transactions within the EVM. It\u2019s important to note that every node in the network runs the code and stores the resulting values. As you might guess, this tends to be computationally very expensive. To compensate for this expense and incentivize the nodes (or miners) to run these computations, the miners specify a fee for running these transactions. This fee is referred to as \u201cgas\u201d (you can read more on gas here). This is similar to how fees work in Bitcoin, where any fees attached to a bitcoin transaction go to the miner who mined the block that included the transaction.Note: This is a very high level description of how the Ethereum blockchain works and it certainly skips a lot of details for purposes of brevity. I\u2019ll write more in-depth articles in the future.Lastly, we have Ethereum\u2019s programming language for writing executable distributed applications and contracts. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s programming languages (Solidity which is similar to JavaScript\u00a0, Serpent which is similar to Python) don\u2019t look like machine code. It has the expressive power and functionality of languages that programmers are accustomed to developing on, like JavaScript or Python. Moreover, it lets you do pretty much anything an advanced programming language would let you do. Hence, it is \u201cTuring complete\u201d.The key takeaway from all this is that Ethereum stepped into the crypto-world and provided us with a generalized framework for running any type of code on the blockchain more easily. Because Ethereum\u2019s language is turing complete, stateful, and developer friendly, the hope was to open up the benefits of the blockchain beyond just enforcing one particular ruleset (e.g. how digital money gets transferred) and enable a safe, open, highly available, autonomously governed, efficient, trustable and reliable mechanism to build any ruleset on top. This would enable developers to develop any type of application imaginable.An example of an application that is incredibly simple to build on Ethereum is a \u201csmart contract\u201d. A smart contract is a distributed contract that is represented in code and basically says \u201cif this happens then do that\u201d. They can accept and store Ether and data, and can send that Ether to other accounts or even other smart contracts. Just like regular contracts (e.g. a property lease or an employment agreement), they are used to form agreements with people or entities, but unlike regular contracts, they act like autonomous agents that run entirely on the blockchain and remove the human out of the loop, making them automated, open, secure and trustless.Another example of an application is a decentralized organization. A decentralized organization is a programmatic organization that runs based on rules encoded within smart contracts. So instead of the typical hierarchical structure of an organization that is managed by humans, a decentralized organization encodes all its rules into a smart contract and then is completely managed by a blockchain.Despite the fact that Ethereum has made it easy for us to now build applications on the blockchain, let\u2019s admit it, most of us, even including us crypto-nerds, are still living in a world where we don\u2019t use decentralized applications in our day to day.Why is that?\u00a0\u00a0To explain, let\u2019s go back to my earlier hypothesis on why we ended up at the \u201cwhere are the apps\u201d problem, and see how Ethereum addresses each one.Problem #1: Lack of developer friendlinessAs we described above, Ethereum solves this problem by design through its expressive programming language and strong developer tooling.Problem #2: Building up network effects is hardWith or without Ethereum, seeding and spinning the network effects is still a huge roadblock. Replacing existing network businesses who\u2019ve built up huge networks effects is\u2026 as we said before, really HARD. If someone builds a decentralized Airbnb, they still need to convince both sides of the platform, the users and hosts, to come on board.Problem #3: Doesn\u2019t provide 10x improvementWe learned earlier that most users wouldn\u2019t be willing to switch to a decentralized platform unless it\u2019s 10x better than an existing solution on some dimension.Just because it\u2019s easier to build a decentralized application on Ethereum, doesn\u2019t mean it provides the 10x experience we\u2019re looking for. And so, the question we might ask is, are we still right back to square one? still stuck in the trenches?Well, not really.Because although Ethereum doesn\u2019t directly solve the network effects problem, nor the 10x problem, what it does do is enable the creation of a whole new set of applications that were never possible before. The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. I believe Ethereum makes inventing something completely new possible by making it easy to build smart contracts.The rise of protocols, tokens, and applicationsWhy the big deal about being able to build smart contracts?ProtocolsWell, the beauty of being able to easily build smart contracts on Ethereum is that it enables anyone to easily build a new protocol on top of Ethereum. Remember that a protocol is simply a set of rules that nodes in a network use when they to transmit information. Smart contracts allow us to do exactly this\u200a\u2014\u200acreate an automated trustworthy set of rules between two or more parties.Earlier, we mentioned how blockchain protocols have a intrinsic \u201ctoken\u201d associated with it, which is a digital asset that can be transferred between two users in the network without requiring the consent of a third party. In the case of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, the intrinsic token is Bitcoin and in the case of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, the intrinsic token is Ether.But just because the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchain protocols have intrinsic tokens associated with it to drive the network, doesn\u2019t mean a protocol built on Ethereum using a smart contract must have a token associated with it. Remember that the purpose of a protocol is simply to specify rules for communication between nodes.So essentially, there\u2019s two types of protocols:Ones which have a intrinsic token associated with it that help create economic incentives that drive a networkOnes which don\u2019t have a token that drives financial incentives and are simply used as a communication protocol between nodes (Note: these types of protocols CAN still have a token associated with it\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g. to represent membership in the network, shares on an open market, etc. The difference is that they are not used to drive some economic incentive.)For lack of better names, I\u2019ll call the first kind \u201ccrypto-token-protocols\u201d and the second kind \u201ccrypto-protocols\u201d.TokensNow onto tokens.Just like Ethereum makes it possible to build new protocols on top of its blockchain, it also makes it possible to use smart contracts to build new tokens on top of its blockchain. Let\u2019s call these types of tokens \u201cnon-intrinsic tokens\u201d.In this regard, broadly speaking, we can think of a token system as just a database with one operation: subtract X units from A and give X units to B, under the condition that:\u00a0 (i) A had at least X units before the transaction(ii) The transaction is approved by AEthereum makes it especially easy to implement such token systems. More specifically, ERC20 token interface provides a standardized way to develop a token that is compatible with the existing Ethereum ecosystem, such as development tools, wallets, and exchanges.What\u2019s more, these non-intrinsic tokens can exist as:Standalone tokens built on Ethereum (as shown in the above diagram)Be associated with any new underlying crypto-token-protocol built on EthereumBe associated with any new underlying crypto-protocol built on EthereumProtocols? Tokens? Protocols + Tokens? Why does this matter?\u00a0\u00a0Let\u2019s take a look.Token sale (i.e.\u00a0\u201cICO\u201d)Launching a new cryptocurrency blockchain is not easy\u200a\u2014\u200ait requires a massive bootstrapping effort in order to assemble the resources needed to get it up and running. But in the case of Ethereum, its intrinsic tokens were used to spin up their blockchains\u200a\u2014\u200ain order to kickstart a large network of developers, miners, investors, and other stakeholders, Ethereum created some Ether tokens and launched a presale of these tokens to the general public. It then used these funds to develop its blockchain.Ethereum was not the first to do this. In 2013, when Ripple started to develop it\u2019s Ripple payment system, it created around 100 billion XRP token, and sold these tokens to fund the development of the Ripple platform.This concept of fundraising via a token sale is sometimes referred to as an \u201cInitial Coin Offering\u201d, or ICO. But the structure of this token can vary significantly (as we just saw in the previous section), whereas the term \u201cICO\u201d makes it sound a lot more official and like an investment security, so let\u2019s stick to \u201ctoken sale\u201d.A token sale is when some party offers investors some units of a new cryptocurrency (i.e. token) for a certain price, that can then later be exchanged with other cryptocurrencies (i.e. tokens). The idea is that investors buy into these tokens, and the units of the token are fungible and transferable on cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g. Bitfinex, GDAX, Liqui, etc.) if there is demand for them.While most token sales in the past have been restricted to building a new cryptocurrency (e.g. Ethereum, Ripple, etc), the smart contracts of Ethereum are now enabling startups to also to use token sales to fund development of various protocols and applications built on top of existing blockchains.Before moving on, one important distinction to make is the difference between an application and protocol.Application vs. protocolAn application can be built on one or more protocols. One example is Augur, which is a decentralized prediction markets application that is built on top of two protocols:Decentralized oracle protocolExchange protocolThe decentralized oracle protocol is a \u201ccrypto-token-protocol\u201d that has financial incentives to drive the network to form consensus around the outcomes of real-world events using Augur\u2019s reputation tokens (REP). The exchange protocol, on the other hand, is a \u201ccrypto-protocol\u201d and does not have a token associated with it to drive financial incentives, but instead is a set of rules defined between buyers and sellers in order to move tokens between each other.But neither of these protocols need to be tied to a single application. Any application can in theory build on top of these underlying protocols.Token sales for protocols vs. applicationsEarlier, I mentioned how token sales can be used to drive development of a new protocol and/or to drive development of a new application.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So in essence, a team can use an token sale to fund:a blockchain (e.g. Ripple)a cryto-token-protocol built on top of an existing blockchaina crypto-protocol built on top of an existing blockchainan application built on top of a cryto-protocolan application built on top of a crypto-token-protocolan application built on top of crypto-protocol(s) and non-crypto-token-protocol(s)an applicationSo, pretty much anything\u00a0:)The last one is interesting, because to do a token sale, the application doesn\u2019t even need to be built under a protocol. I can build non-profit organization and use tokens as a mechanism to fund the project. In this sense, a token sale simply becomes a new way to fund a traditional centralized application. A plain old crowdsale.Okay, so investors buy these tokens and then what happens?Depends. When a token is tied to a cryto-token-protocol, they look much more like intrinsic tokens like Ether and Bitcoin and are used to drive the development and network of a protocol. But when they are not, tokens simply represent something much more general. In fact, these tokens are flexible enough to represent a lot of different things.For instance, let\u2019s say I want to build a decentralized storage service. I can build a storage protocol using smart contracts which serve as agreements between a storage provider and their client, defining what data will be stored and at what price.I would then build a token for this protocol and do a token sale. If the protocol becomes widely used, then the protocol becomes more valuable, which in turn could increase the value of the token. Moreover, as a developer of this service, I could choose to make the tokens represent purchase rights to the services provided in the application.What\u2019s important to note is that, broadly speaking, the mechanism for creating tokens are so flexible that they can represent lots of different things:Paid credits/membership within the decentralized applicationEntitlement to a share of profits and/or losses, or assets and/or liabilitiesOwnership or equity interest in the protocol (or project)Voting power in the companyNo function other than mere existence\u200a\u2014\u200asimply a digital asset that can be freely traded on cryptocurrency exchangesetc..There\u2019s a handful of projects which have successfully raise funds via a token sale, including as Augur, Antshares, Melonport, Gnosis, Antshare and many more. I\u2019d suggest you read their respective white papers if you want to learn more.Protocols, tokens, token sales, now\u00a0what?We\u2019re at a point where Ethereum has made it easy to not only build protocols that can power decentralized applications, but also to help get a network off the ground. Ethereum does this in two ways:\u00a01. MoneyThis one is obvious. As we already saw, a token sale now enables developers to easily release tradable tokens to raise funds for building a protocol and/or application. Using this money, the team could choose to invest in sales, marketing, etc. to drive the network.2. UsersThis is the more interesting piece of the puzzle. Protocols and decentralized applications can solve the network effects problem by using a token sale as a mechanism to get early contributors and adopters. Early adopters who believe in the protocol or application have an incentive to buy the token because there is potential for that token to be worth more in the future.So in essence, tokens could help bootstrap a network of early adopters because the incentives of the early adopters and the development team line up perfectly.Let\u2019s say you want to build a new file sharing protocol. You can launch a token sale through which you gain some early adopters, investors, and entrepreneurs who become interested in \u201cbuying in.\u201d They might be simply speculating or they might truly believe in the product. At that point, they become stakeholders in the protocol itself and are financially invested in its success. Then some of these early adopters either become users of the products built on top of the protocol or build products and services around the protocol themselves, with the incentive to drive the success of the protocol further in order to increase the value of their tokens. As the protocol gains adoption, it increases the value of the tokens, which further draws more attention from more investors, application builders and users, which leads to more applications, and so on.What Ethereum has done is create an incredibly flexible system to innovate at the protocol level and application level. We\u2019ll likely see a lot of experimental and innovative protocols and applications being built over the coming years. Many of these will fail, just like a lot of startups fail. But over time, it\u2019s likely that some core set of protocols and associated networks will successfully drive mainstream adoption.Finally, once the protocols begin to take shape and standardize, we\u2019ll see a whole host of decentralized applications being built on top.It\u2019s not a happy ending\u00a0yetToken sales are providing the fuel needed to drive development of protocols built on top of the blockchain, and to further drive developer interest in building applications on top of these protocols.Of course, this isn\u2019t the perfect happy ending.For one, getting a bunch of early adopters isn\u2019t enough. You also need to work hard to sustain the growth of the network effects, just like traditional businesses do. That means putting in years of hard work to building a useful application and driving adoption.Secondly, another trend I\u2019ve noticed is that most of the token sales we are seeing today are being used to drive network effects around specific applications rather than open and decentralized protocols. Since tokens are so flexible, dApp developers are creating tokens that are coupled to the dApp, instead of a standardized underlying protocol that can be shared among applications. This could lead to fragmentation in protocols.Third, the initial growth of the token value is mostly driven by speculation (since it takes some time for the platform being built to become valuable). Hence, there will likely have high volatility. It\u2019s unclear if and how we can mitigate this, and if we can even figure out a mechanism to get token prices to stabilize over time. Overall, there\u2019s a lot of open questions around the viability of a token\u2019s value over time. Ideally, we want the token\u2019s value to be tied to the value of the protocol or application, similar to how a public company\u2019s stock is tied to the company that issued it, or to represent some valuable digital right to a service. But as of today, the value of these tokens is still mostly speculation.Fourth, the market for token sales incredibly frothy right now. Because securities regulations makes it difficult to sell tokens (which are unregistered securities) as equity (remember that a token can represent anything, including equity within the protocol or application), developers are not doing it. Instead, they are structuring them as crowdsales. While there are some highly respectable projects raising much needed capital in this manner without the hassle of regulation, there\u2019s a long tail projects that are simply taking advantage of the high demand in the ICO market to raise millions of dollars in capital with very little to show for it\u200a\u2014\u200asome of which have even turned out to be outright scams that absconded with the funds collected during the process. We want these crowdsales to benefit the groups of people gathering together to build a common public good, but not the scammers. How do we achieve that?Besides these issues, there are still lots of unanswered questions that need to be figured out before token sales become a viable form of funding:What is the right design and structure for a token sale?In what cases does it make sense to structure tokens as an investment security? How should such token sales be regulated?What criteria should an individual investor use to evaluate token sales? (team, business model, etc)How is an investor guaranteed that the sale process in being managed in a safe and legal manner?Does there need to be a mechanism for distributing a portion of the liquidation value of the company among the token holders? Dividends?Can the token holders exercise control in the protocol or application via voting rights?How will the money be spent after the funds are raised?What metrics can an investor use to gauge trust that the team building the protocol or application will execute on the long-term plan and vision?Could it be more efficient to port the smart contracts of a token to use Ether directly, instead of creating a new token per protocol?What are the tax implications for the investor\u2019s gains or losses?If selling tokens become a new way to raise capital for startups, what happens to traditional Venture Capitalists?\u2026 and SO MUCH MOREIf these questions interest you, you\u2019re in luck\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ll write about some of them in upcoming posts!ConclusionI\u2019ve tried my best in this article to articulate my views on token sales and clear up some of the confusion around blockchain development in general.Talking about cryptocurrency and blockchain development is like trying to take a picture of a running cheetah. The space is moving at breakneck speed, and any attempt to pin it down results in a blurry picture. Regardless, I still believe it\u2019s important that we educate the broader community on cryptocurrency topics.If you feel that I\u2019ve made any overreaching assumptions in this walkthrough, please share commentary below!

This can assist businesses in streamlining their operations, deliver faster services, and massively reduce their costs by applying this disruptive technology. Here are just a few of the perks that come with it.Improved Sales ProcessesIn the B2B world, the sales process is mainly based on responsibility and solid relationships. Business-to-business relationships are continuous and, compared to B2C ones, have a much longer lifespan. As such, they require a longer sales cycle.Hence, trust is absolutely critical when it comes to the B2B sales success, and this is blockchain\u2019s party-piece, the place where it steps into the picture just as it does in P2P or fintech applications. Blockchain is a tool that creates complete and utter transparency and immutability beyond what current technologies or systems can deliver.Speed and ConvenienceOne of the essential value propositions of distributed ledger technologies is that they manage to successfully take the intermediary out of the transaction. This enables engagements which are more autonomous, efficient, and cost-effective.By doing so, the technology eases and escalates the overall speed of transactions and it manages to completely and successfully replace banks, credit card processors, and, for example, checking. This reduces the cost to both B2B vendors and customers, and remember successful B2B relationships are all about saving money.Safety and\u00a0SecurityCodes have been cracked and hacked before; there\u2019s no denying that. However, it\u2019s easier to hack one computer than one million computers simultaneously. One of blockchain\u2019s main benefits is that it puts wrongdoers against a wide range of entry points, hence making it theoretically impossible to breach the distributed system\u2019s security.If we circle back to the first point we\u2019ve made about trust\u200a\u2014\u200ablockchain handles this with flying colors. In fact, blockchain brings a completely new architecture of trust\u200a\u2014\u200aa seamless system where users don\u2019t have to deal with questionable authorities, institutions, or intermediaries, and where they have total network transparency.Measurable SavingsB2B merchants need the cost savings provided by blockchain technologies. Right off the bat, it will speed up the purchase process by moving the customer payment immediately to the vendor. It also enhances the supply chain efficiency, improves the overall user experience, and of course, their satisfaction.Furthermore, this technology is capable of facilitating and improving distribution, as well as logistics, which increases overall efficiency down the entire B2B line. Last but not least, the price of the service itself will be discounted because of the lack of intermediaries and third parties.AERUM: Making All of This\u00a0PossibleIt\u2019s safe to say that there are quite a lot of solutions aiming to bring the above benefits to businesses. However, the majority of them, including the industry\u2019s forerunner Ethereum, are dealing with issues that prevent them from being widely adopted\u200a\u2014\u200anamely, scalability, speed, and cost.Most of the existing solutions are simply unable to scale up to the challenge and the demand that actual, real-world, enterprise-grade applications demand. Furthermore, there are no current solutions which provide on-demand scalability tailored to the actual needs of businesses, because, as you know, no two businesses are the same.AERUM\u2019s network solves all of this.First of all, it\u2019s blazing fast. But speed aside, AERUM delivers something that differentiates it from the rest of the herd\u200a\u2014\u200aon-demand scalability. In other words, businesses will be able to adjust the throughput of the network depending on their current needs\u200a\u2014\u200asomething which guarantees fully fledged efficiency. AERUM\u2019s network can handle 500 to 100,000+ transactions per second and it is completely compatible with Ethereum, making it particularly easy to implement.This end-to-end Ethereum integration is also what guarantees secure and easy transfers thanks to cross-chain atomic swaps.You can read more about the AERUM network on its official website, and stay tuned on the project\u2019s Facebook or Twitter page.

Blockchain and other cryptocurrenciesGuide for beginnersAlexandr NellsonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 9, 2017People keep asking me how to properly invest into the crypto-economy. What do I need to know? How not to lose money? How should I choose the right cryptocurrency for my portfolio, which will skyrocket in the future?In this guide you will find an exhaustive list of answers to many of these questions. But first, before giving you an explanation on how to invest, let me address the question: why should you even need to invest your hard-earned money? I\u2019ll try to explain this as simply as possible.Invest because it is\u00a0growing.Over the last 20 years with the invasion of the Internet, many people have earned amazing amounts of money on one simple thing - the Network Effect. What the hell is that? In the 70-s there was an engineer Robert Metcalfe. He invented what we now call the Ethernet. In order to make a profit on this invention, he began selling network cards. At that time people didn\u2019t understand why computers needed connect to the network. Robert realized that it was necessary to find a reassuring argument to prove that his network card was just the right panacea for all their illnesses. Robert said:The network\u2019s value is proportional to the square of the number of users in this network.Well, you buy 10 computers without a network card, their conditional costs are equal to 10. However,with network cards the conditional costs of 10 computers will increase to 45! This is 4.5 times more profitable! \u201cWow\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200acorporate workers said and then they began buying Robert\u2019s network cards.It turned out that Robert\u2019s idea is quite reasonable! You can use it to assess Telecom companies which have rolled out across the globe with redoubled force. The capitalisation of Telecom companies depends on the number of its users. The dependence is not a straight line but a quadratic. At the dawn of the social networks, venture capitalists quickly remembered the cherished formula and applied it to such things as Facebook, Twitter, Skype, etc. So the Metcalfe\u2019s law was proven correct and gave us millions of Ethernet grids which evolved into what we now call the Internet.Simple truth\u200a\u2014\u200aif the number of network users is steadily growing, the exponential growth of your investments is expected to grow with it. Thus, Facebook was worth more than $ 300 billion. The formula is simple. Looking for a network which is growing steadily at the very beginning => put money => wait => profit! The question is\u200a\u2014\u200awhy Bitcoin? Because it\u2019s the same network and it\u2019s growing. Is growing quickly. Check for yourself:2010\u201310 thousand users2012\u2013100 thousand users2014\u20131 million users2016\u201310 million usersOf course, these figures are very approximates, because there is no way to determine the exact number of users. The numbers listed above are my own assessment. To make it look more convincing here is a graph of Blockchain.info walletsQuestion: How long it will grow and when the growth will slow down?Answer: Blockchain technology refers to a class of technologies \u201cNo Way Back\u201d. This is when Homo sapiens starts to use something and could not imagine how they lived without it. Here\u2019s a graph in the case of TV, electricity and other technologies:Growth will be carried out at the S curve until saturation occurs.There are about 3.5 billion people who use the Internet, and about 20 billion connected devices or just bots. Considering that the Bitcoin network has properties that are not offered to us by any Government or Corporation, we can assume that there is a high probability that the majority of connected people and machines will use this network. What are these properties?No taxesFree opening of accounts. They are simply calculated from your private key\u00a0:-)Low transaction feesPredictable and transparent clearing. You always know what is the status of any transactionThe transaction cannot be rolled backNobody asks the personal identification informationNobody can write off your moneyNobody can block the accountNo stupid limitsSuitable for all forms of property, not just currency.A complete history of all transactionsPossibility of privacy and anonymityThe list of benefits can go on and on, but you get the idea. This is a kind of manna from heaven, which is better money in comparison with paper dollars. But most importantly:It\u2019s just the economic miracle of mathematics, cryptography and computer science.Investment in the blockchain as the best investment opportunity since the start of the InternetInvest to not be\u00a0cheated.In the current economic circumstances the deception is carried out in 3 ways:Disguised theft.The part of inflation caused by the \u201cprinting press\u201d. Watch movie \u201cThe Big Short\u201dTrivial racket.\u00a0It is not enough for Government to steal you money secretly. They openly steals from people by adding value to taxes. According to my estimates, at least half!\u00a0HALFNo warranties.\u00a0Banks may go bankrupt. They simply tell you \u201csorry, there is no your money\u201d. The point is that any of your assets at any time may not be yours. The state does not guarantee the safety of your money. The Government requires you to keep your money in the banks, and your right of property in the public registers. People naively believing that there is no any alternative.I believe, in the future, blockchain technology will become an immutable mathematical guarantor of the preservation of property and economic freedoms.Foreseeing the collapse.There are so many predictions of the collapse of the American financial system. Even billionaires already say this openly. Let\u2019s say that it will not happen. But if it happens, we will not go back to the existing world order. Such events in retrospect are called Black Swans. Nobody thought that the Second World War will happen, that the Internet will appear, that Trump will become a President. But in retrospect, all these events are obvious, and have a rational explanation. The collapse of the Fiat system would be the same. If the American economy collapses, the world will literally be in chaos. Our history in this regard is even more interesting because if the US economy collapses, other economies collapse even more. The mortgage crisis of 2008 proved this clearly. But it didn\u2019t teach anything.What\u2019s surprising here? How this bubble can burst if there is no alternative? For some reasons no one admits the idea that an alternative to the \u0441urrent outdated system is already there. Which is great! That suggests that a Black Swan is not such an unlikely event. In the case that a negative event has at least some probability, smart financiers are recommended to hedge risks. Let\u2019s guess\u00a0, what\u2019s the alternative?Right\u200a\u2014\u200ais Bitcoin.Investments in the blockchain as the protection from fraud of Governments and Central banks.Look in The\u00a0FutureThere is another argument in favor of the Blockchain: robots and artificial intelligence. The reality is that we don\u2019t know exactly when computer algorithms will be able to solve all the problems that we can, including creativity.Today is 2017. The computing power of the device which cost $1000 approximately equal the computational abilities of the mouse. In accordance with Moore\u2019s law in 2025 (and perhaps earlier, e.g., in 2022) the cost of computing by humans biological brain will be compared with the cost of computing by computers.Let me give you some real live examples from different areas:The Future of gaming is in DubaiComputers for Autonomous robotics made by 21.coAlphaGo victory over Lee SedolThe algorithm that broke one of the strongest players of Go is available on Github and it is called \u201cTensor Flow\u201d. Any school student can click on the \u201cFork\u201d button and make everything that comes into his mind. This accessibility of really smart technologies will inevitably lead to the emergence of a new generation of smart devices. Autonomous robots will be able to earn money and consequently make economic decisions. And as soon as the first striking example occurs\u200a\u2014\u200athe Homo sapiens may get nervous. His job may be under threat.There are more Bots than humans. This amount will increase and Bots will become smarter. Thus, the risk of devaluation of your (and my) intelligence is real. And the longer you deny it, the faster your brain will depreciate in value. The point is that the blockchain is convenient for a robot economy\u00a0. It is understandable, it is reliable, and it is easy to integrate. The Blockchain for the Internet of Things is a new megatrend. It is obvious that without the blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200arobot\u2019s economy simply impossible. The solution is right here:Investments in the blockchain as a hedge against the depreciation of your own intellect.In addition to the von Neumann architecture, there will be quantum computers in the future. The Moores law for quantum computers will work in the square.So, you have some incentive ideas in your head and you already want to buy Bitcoins. Your blood starts to boil. The brain anticipates an incredible profit. All the free energy is concentrated on the sources of investment.Calm down! Turn ON your BrainThe blockchain is a really cool technology and it is growing rapidly. But there is no guarantee that you will be able to make profit. I will list some necessary conditions that must be followed to increase the probability of a profitable outcome.Before invest-improve your technical competence.A mandatory condition for safe investments in the crypto-economy is a basic computer literacy. If you don\u2019t know how computers works, then think twice before putting your wealth. Then the question arises: How do you I know if I have this basic computer literacy? These bullet points will help you understand a little bit more about it:You have the same password for almost all services.Length of your passwords is less than 20 characters or it is copied phrase from the book.Do you use anti-virus software and believe that it will protect you.You don\u2019t backup your data.You have no idea about what is data synchronization and why it is needed.You don\u2019t know what is \u201ctrust a website\u201d, what is \u201coperating system and hardware security\u201d.You can\u2019t generate a mini-lecture for at least 10 minutes when you ask the question: what actually happens when a browser is driven google.com and then pressed Enter?If you answered \u201cYes\u201d to even one question\u200a\u2014\u200ayour computer literacy want to be better, and you need to take this into account when investing in the crypt-economy. Otherwise, you have a high probability that something will go wrong.Check my tutorial to know how to store Bitcoins and altcoins in a secured way.Define strategyYou have already realized that there is no freebies, and risks, in fact, are more than you thought! You need some time to determine how much to put down for investment. General recommendation: from 1% to 10% of an available financial assets you currently have. If you have confidence in your own computer literacy, then the percentage can be increased up to 30% and even 50%.It is very important to start from amount of your financial assets. An appropriate financial assets are currency, stocks, bonds, shares. Property, cars and other things that can be touched, are not included here. Although, I\u2019ve heard a story about one guy who sold his apartment and bought Ether on all the money. Heroes must be known in person, so let me know if you read this!So, if financial assets are greater than $100k\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re lucky:). Buy cryptocurrency in the amount of from 1% to 10%, depending of your risk appetite.If your financial assets are in a range of $10k-$100k\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have something to lose. You are neat, consistent and purposeful. Allow yourself a little risk and roll up to 3%-20%. Your well-being is not significantly affected in a case of losses, but it can teleport you into the category above sooner than you would want to leave your current work.If financial assets you have are up to $10K\u200a\u2014\u200ayou are still ahead. The amount is already nice, but it is not enough to feed itself. When there is a stable source of income, start from 5%, and when you will be confident\u200a\u2014\u200araise the rate up to 40%. Think about your strategy: 5% for retirement. When you got paid\u200a\u2014\u200aput 5% on the blockchain. If you maintain schedule within 1\u20132 years you will be pleased with your investments.If you do not have anything, then best suited strategy is \u201call-in\u201d, because you have nothing to lose. With such financial discipline\u200a\u2014\u200ahardly something will help you! So is there any chance that something will changes in your life\u00a0.But I\u2019m still a kid!Great! Bitcoins are for you! Governments, banks and even your parents think that you can\u2019t have something for possessions, without their permission. Prove to them that this is not true. If you are reading this article, probably your computer literacy is much better than most of the people around you. So don\u2019t believe them. They are stupid. By the time you finish school, banks may disappear altogether, Governments may become autonomous code, your parents may lose their job in connection with the invasion of artificial intelligence, and your kettle might be richer off than your entire family. But if you\u2019ll have a few bitcoins and tens of Ether, your coevals will look at you differently. Girls will love and parents will be proud. Look at Vitalik Buterin. His first bitcoins appeared when he was 16 years old. It was interesting. He began to write and study. Then he didn\u2019t go to University, but created Ethereum. Now, professors of the world call him Mr. Vitalik Buterin. If you will start to accumulate anything from 6, 8, 10, 12 years you will have a good future.Prepare to wait a long time.If you\u2019re not ready to freeze your money less than for 3 years\u200a\u2014\u200aclose the tab and move on. There is nothing for you. Blockchain market is in the embryonic stage. It may be rocking back and forth. The clear strategy is Buy & Hold. Bought and keep. I recommend to plan it as a long-term investment with some simple strategy of fixing. For example, detecting 10% each time when the net asset valuation increased 5 times from the previous commit. Well, it\u2019s simple! But this strategy will only work if you define the investment horizon in a radius of 3\u201310 years.Find entry\u00a0pointHere\u2019s what is thing about. There are all sorts of technology is growing unevenly. The guys from Gartner explained it very simply:New technology occurs and all at once are amazed from the new technology. This is called the peak of inflated expectations. But the technology is still not working as it should work. Therefore, the technology comes at some point of disillusionment. And then it either disappear or becomes productive.This principle works for all technologies.So. In our history, all looks the same.Any blockchain system grows very similar. I am telling this in order to give you one simple idea:Do not buy when everyone amazed.If you see that in the last month something has increased several times, this is a great reason to look at buying, study, and find a more optimal time to enter when the market goes down.Strategy \u201cBuy & Hold\u201d also means that if you find an interesting asset, it is the time to start buying when it falls, and purchasing until it starts to grow.What is crowdsales or\u00a0ICO?Previously, I have discussed about assets that already existed and were traded on the markets. But where did they all appear? After all, it\u2019s better to be at the forefront of \u201csomething great\u201d. Essentially there are two options:Some Satoshi Nakamoto or John Connor appears on some forum and says:\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cHere is the soft, let\u2019s do mining.\u201dSome Vitalik Buterin or Den Larimer appears on some forum and says: \u201cHere is the code. Let\u2019s chip in together.\u201dBoth approaches in different cases makes sense. Sometimes, these two approaches should be combined. But in the second case, we have the opportunity to participate in the creation of something which is risky. Thus was created Ethereum, and many more.Question: how to determine that this is something where I put the money is great, but not some sort of regular wiring?\u00a0Answer: Behold the root. We look at three things:A Coherent Whitepaper.\u00a0Real science should stand up for such projects. The people who create such things should be able to clearly express their thoughts on paper. Otherwise, the probability that the project is successful goes to zero. Here are two whitepapers: Concept and Protocol that were at my disposal (when I took the decision to invest in Ethereum). I saw these guys with a head on his shoulders. Here are a few papers (Steem.it, Augur, Digix) where I have issued a positive decision. Here\u2019s, an example of a paper of the project which took off. Do you ask why? Because it is natural for the question arise in your head regarding the competence of the creators. In General, there is a need of serious thoughtful approach and the ability to analyze all kinds of stuff.Source code.\u00a0It has to be open source. No code, no proof that you are generally able something to develop. In the case of Ethereum PoC v0.5 it was on C and v0.6 on Go. Theorists have no place here. You also must understand that in the end you need to trust the code that will work, but not the people. A story with TheDAO confirms this.Strong team.\u00a0It\u2019s not important whether you have anonymous team or not. People should make a good things. Everyone makes their own research here.If at least one item has not converged, then don\u2019t risk. Of course, there are a lot of additional factors:The Consensus Algorithm.\u00a0Let me just say that this is a complex topic which makes me passionate about this story. It is hard to explain in one line. But you should pay attention to it, yeah.Economic model.\u00a0This is an interesting area, due to which this industry will grow very quickly. Also it is the subject for a whole separate book. In General, the economic model needs to be effective, the system must have all necessary economic incentives to achieve the desired goals!The structure of the distribution.\u00a0If founders want to own 90%, that is a centralized thing, and the risks increase. The norm in ICO is the reward of the team in the amount of 10% -20%.A technological approach.\u00a0Some comrades are trying to create their own independent network of one feature. Or on the contrary try to implement over an existing network, which requires an independent network. Here it is necessary to pay attention, since architectural mistakes in the design of the blockchain system very quickly kill a potentially interesting project.Generally, all these criterias are not exhaustive. However it is enough to understand that making such decisions requires analysis and understanding of whole picture.Guys from cyber.fund collect significant ICO in their radarAbout \u201cpseudo Blockchain investments\u201dYes, there is such a thing. Recently a lot of my friends sent me a project in the field of bitcoins and blockchain with a question: Look? What do you think?99% of them are not the Blockchain investments at all. Basically, there are different companies registered in different jurisdictions and they provide variety of services. Here an example of such company. If the property is not registered on the blockchain and has its ends on paper in some jurisdictions, it is not a blockchain investment at all. Such an organization will never be more marginal than organization consisting of a code and not paying a bribe to all sorts of crooks. Of course, there are many situations where this approach is needed. Especially in the services at the junction with the Fiat economy, because the Government learned very well how to keep the ball of money holders.This article is NOT about investing in such kind of companies. It is highly recommended NOT to invest your hard-earned bitcoins in such enterprises because risks are much higher.It is a time to buy your first\u00a0BitcoinsAnyway, a journey to the blockchain investments begins from buying Bitcoins, as all existing cryptocurrencies and assets are traded primarily to Bitcoin. Of course, you can start from mining. But this article is not for those guys who are willing to wrestle over how to buy hardware to solve problems with electricity, cooling, to suffer with the software, and then monitor it around the clock. Such guys are not needed in this article. They\u2019ll figure it out. This article is for the lazy you. You want to make a decision, press the button (alone and green), and immediately get incredible profit.If you are lucky and your country do not prohibit the purchase of bitcoins (e.g like in Russia) you can buy Bitcoins by credit card or Paypal.But at first\u200a\u2014\u200aknow how to store your money! Start from this article.So, go to Localbitcoins. This is such a great global Bazaar where everyone can handle Bitcoins for the national currency. Vendors have build great reputation. So of course you can be cheated, but traders do value their reputation and the whole thing works quite well.Sign up. Go to the Security tab and go through the quest to get the \u201cStrong\u201d title.You can skip this step, of course, but I have warned you. Yeah. By the way, remember that the password must be unique and long. Next, select the seller. Not all sellers are good for you\u00a0. The amount may be not suitable for you or a transaction method. Sometimes seller can be muddy. Your task is to find a guy who has a large number of transactions, faster transaction processing, good rating, etc. Have a good time.Once the ad has attracted, go into it and look for seller\u2019s terms which are written on the right. Read them carefully! If you agree, enter the quantity you wish to purchase and write a short message. For example\u00a0:I\u2019m here for the first time. I can be blunt. But I\u2019ll try not to be blunt. And Yes! I will use bank transfer from \u201cname of the bank\u201d.And here the solemn moment! Big green button! Press. After a while you will get the answer. Send money according to specified details.After payment go to the ad and click on the \u201cI paid\u201d button. The seller may wait for while, and after some time, from 1 minute to hours, you will see updated balance in your account, and the transaction is deemed closed. If you like it, feel free to give good feedback to the seller. They love it and you can get feedback in return. You will be back, right?Congratulations! But it is early to rejoice. While bitcoins are stored in Localbitcoins it\u2019s not your bitcoins, but their. So we go to the next step.Thus, we assume that you successfully create secured wallet and your private key is only you and no one else.Well, you copied the address from your local wallet and now we return to the section Wallet on Localbitcoins. Paste the address from clipboard in the address box, then enter the amount of bitcoins\u200a\u2014\u200aevery last Satoshi. And click \u201cSend from wallet\u201d.You can see the address where money were sent, and the most valuable information is txid or transaction id. By this ID you can very easily check Localbitcoins, if he is lying to you or not. Copypaste this ID. Next, go to the website of any block explorer and enter this ID in the search. For example, here or here. By the way, it is the first historic transaction that Satoshi started.I should mention a little about block explorer. One of the sweetest pieces of blockchain technology is the ability to overlook this database (it\u2019s called the blockchain or chain of blocks) in real time to any person and robot on the Earth! It has nothing to do with auditor. Every last bit can be seen and proven. The government and banks do not want to give you such openness, because all the crooks will immediately light up.What next?So, you look in your wallet and get proud of your bitcoins. But, intuition tells you that it can\u2019t be actually so great. There is must be a catch. The source code of the bitcoin nodes (they confirm a transaction) is open-source, the entire historical database is available and verifiable, the source code for the wallet is opened. There must be a catch. The catch is that your bitcoins exist only as digital recording and this fact is accepted by all other users of Bitcoin network. For proving the right of ownership you can only provide a digital signature calculated using your unique private key. It turns out that this is the nature of digital ownership of new generation. We have to live in this digital illusion, in which the key religion and science is math, not even physics. That\u2019s the trick.Enough sentimentality. Now you have your bitcoins, but the path only begins, because the blockchain technology, which made the Bitcoin has spawned with a lot of interesting things.Where to invest bitcoins?This section generally worthy to write a separate book\u00a0. I will not stoop to the recommendations exactly where to invest, but just go through some areas to plant ideas.Decentralized infrastructureAny computer in any network does three things: (1a) receives some data, then (2) makes some transformation, i.e. calculates, then decides that (3) save for longer, and that (1b) forwards in response to the request. Our brain works identical. From this you can make the assumption that all decentralized infrastucture will move in three directions:Decentralized computing. Ethereum is the leader here. This is the most potentially powerful segment.Decentralized storage. In this segment there are 5 teams. Ethereum Foundation, Storj Inc, MaidSafe, Neboulos Labs and Protocol Labs.Decentralized transport. Motivated mesh networks are inherently complex, so in this segment there is no working solutions. We are waiting for it. I am really looking forward to. While the Internet traffic is so easily controlled by all sorts of crooks, the story is not so beautiful.Blockchain apps.And here the fun begins:Organizations. There are about 1 billion legal entities.\u00a0The capitalization of the public organizations\u200a\u2014\u200aabout $100 trillion. Evaluation of private is a mystery, but probably no less than 3\u20135 times more than the public. All of them can be transferred from paper to the blockchain. My bet is 10 years. All organizational artifacts, such as stocks, debts, rights, votes, etc are there.Robots. The blockchain allows (1) people to reliably control different robots using cryptographic keys, (2) organizations to coordinate the robots owned by organizations or leasehold, (3) robots to possess themselves, i.e. to be Autonomous, Independent, Free. When I say \u201crobots\u201d, I mean not only humanoid robots with AI, which we used to see in movies. I mean, all the electronic objects to which we have become accustomed to: phones, computers, cars, drones, machines, locks, sockets, and even light bulbs. Absolutely anything which will be powered by electricity.Currencies. Capitalization of M0 now is around $70 trillion.Bets. The capitalization of the derivatives is not less than 20 times bigger than M0 and is equal to more than $1 quadrillion. Just a crazy amount of money.Real estate.\u00a0I could not estimate. I think that a lot. All rights\u200a\u2014\u200ain the archaic registries. Draw your own conclusions.Products. In the future, the manufacturer will create digital token on every produced item that will reflect the property to him. This token will move from one organisation to another during their entire life path.Temporary law. Tickets to cinema, planes, trains, parties, events. It is also a large market that I don\u2019t know how to evaluate.Passports.\u00a0There about 50 billion passports in the world. I\u2019m not talking just about humans. Every technical object has its own passport. It is pointless to evaluate this market, because it\u2019s priceless.Titles.\u00a0Here goes a variety of academic diplomas, certificates, badges, reputation points, awards, and other bullshit that is attached forever to a digital ID and cannot be zeroed by the holder.Digital content.\u00a0Books, images, VIDEO. A very large market of copyrights for digital content.Governments.\u00a0Guess on your own. About 50% of the economy is controlled by these entities. Do not be surprised if they will be dematerialised in a computer code, and they will lose a substantial part of this share.Virtual worlds.\u00a0There are about 2 billion gamers. Every game has its own economy.It\u2019s time to make a\u00a0decisionAfter reading this point, dear reader, you hopefully realised that investing in cryptocurrencies is interesting, cool and really promising, but it seems difficult. So you need to decide (1) to invest your bitcoins independently or (2) to entrust this task to someone. Each approach has its pros and cons. Let\u2019s see them in order.Pros:Full control over the process. No need to trust someone your money.A lot of stuff to learn. Really interesting process.Cons:Labor-intensive. Will take a lot of time and effort for training.Difficult. You need to understand the economy, business, engineering, code, and whatnot.Responsability. You can lose everything because of the lack of computer literacy.Where to invest?So, you weighed all the \u201cpros\u201d and \u201ccons\u201d and decided to do it yourself. This is commendable decision. My initial idea was that all people can and want do it themselves. Today, unfortunately, this is not quite true. At this stage, such projects like cyber\u2022Fund may help you.Roughly speaking, it is possible examine the state of the economy in one place. Cyber.fund adjust the price and number of tokens in all significant blockchain systems. But the most important is cyber\u2022Rating. The complete methodology is disclosed in this paper.Transfer money to the\u00a0exchangeOnce you realised where to invest, you need to send bitcoins to the exchange, where the target asset is being traded\u00a0. In our case it will be Poloniex. The truth is that Poloniex may disappear tomorrow and we will got a new meme in the Internet.Therefore, you make these operations at your own risk. I estimate the probability of closing for each particular exchange during the year is 10%. In this series, and Coinbase and Poloniex and all sorts of banks like Xapo.But now we use Poloniex because there are a lot of currencies and good liquidity. Decentralized trade is one of the most promising areas, but it is still at the very beginning. I think with the development of projects such as BitShares and BitSquare for one year or two years it will be a worthy alternative to Localbitcoins and Poloniex with good liquidity.If Poloniex for some reason do not satisfy you, there are still a lot of other exchanges. Have fun choosing them. The process is the same everywhere:Go to the siteRegister. If you have a lot of money, verify the passports and photosTransfer bitcoins from wallet to the exchangeChoose the traded pairBuy at the current price or place orderWithdraw what your bought to your walletsKeep in mind that all serious. Exchanges are real.Install wallets and\u00a0clients.Here comes the fun part. This step depends entirely on what you decided invest. Without this step, you will not be able to guarantee the long-term safety of your investments. I can say that on every official website of every blockchain system there are links to different wallets. Which trust or not to trust\u200a\u2014\u200ait is your decision. I will list the tools that I use myself:Mist. Official Ethereum client. For many things.OpenLedger. Official client for BitShares network. For many things.CounterWallet. The official web client of the Counterparty Protocol. For Storj tokens and others.OmniWallet. Official web Protocol Omni. For SafeNetwork, Synereo and others tokens.This is not an exhaustive list, but may cover 80% of the needs for a beginner. Each of these software requires that you saved the private key. Do it.I have described in details the best way for storing Bitcoins and Ether in this articleAfter all of these procedures, you need to withdraw assets from Poloniex to your wallets. Save the private key as closely and carefully as you can. After these steps, the property becomes yours. Next you are faced with the task of monitoring the value of your portfolio.You can use such Google Spreadsheets with API integration or use such systems like cyber.fundThat\u2019s all. Still have questions? I will answer them with pleasure!Please, write your comments and questions below. And one more thing: let\u2019s spread the knowledge. Recommend and Share this article.

This is the world of ultimate competition as every business, big or small tries to outdo its competitors to stay ahead, maintain market share, or for new ones, disrupt the status quo to carve out their niche. With such fierce competition that does not forgive laxity and wasting of resources, it has become a tradition for businesses to find every single way to cut their costs and maximise their profits. Even the big multinationals are not left out. Every single one of them is busy trying to be able to report good quarterly earnings. As for small businesses, maintaining high profitability, and importantly making sure every dollar spent is maximised and has a high return on investment, is a matter of life and death.Now, up until 2018, the supply chain and procurement industry remain one of those areas businesses face the most significant challenges which seem intractable.And if a publication by Harvard Business Review titled \u201cNo business is an Island\u201d is to go by- (which is, by all means, true in every case) then, no matter how big or small a company or organisation might be, it still relies on others for their services, expertise, and products to survive. The exchange can only take place when a working supply chain is in place. And the supply chain cannot be complete without a functioning procurement system.Procurement is undoubtedly essential in the supply chain system. Companies spend more than 75% of their revenue on this part of the supply chain.Although this rich industry spans over trillions of dollars in market share, the whole process is marred with painful and expensive experiences capable of dissolving a company if not adequately managed.The common problems that currently cause all the unfortunate experiences in the procurement industry include legacy systems, manual processes, disorganised contracts, inefficient B2B remittance, zero incentive mechanism and rigid organisational silos, high and fraudulent invoice discounting mechanisms.Blockchain + supply chain and the Planport\u00a0networkState of the art cryptography means the Blockchain doesn\u2019t need a central authority to manage data transactions based on the fact that Blockchain provides a distributed digital ledger technology that cannot be hacked or manipulated.The Blockchain technology holds enormous potential for the supply chain industry, with networks and applications like Planport, IBM Blockchain pushing for the overall ecosystem to adopt the Blockchain technology. This is an area where Blockchain will undoubtedly flourish and become mainstream with real-world use cases being a central point.Smart contractsThe Ethereum blockchain-based distributed computing platform has been making great strides in the Blockchain space with smart contracts being one of its most significant innovations. ERC standards Identity (ERC725), Loans (ERC1068), Digital collectible products(ERC721), Tokens (ERC20), Deleware Corp (ERC884) standards are pushing the Ethereum blockchain to new levels which will be an essential part of the supply chain problem-solving process within Planport.Smart contracts for Trade finance marketplace means a network that uses the blockchain ledger can verify the invoice and make sure that invoices are not duplicated for multi-financing and other fraudulent activities. (see below)Contract managementSmart contract will help to eradicate problems with current contract life cycle in the supply\u00a0chainThe smart contracts allow the creation of multi-party terms and agreements that can self-execute when different conditions are met in the procurement process and eventually have a fully decentralised procure-to-pay process which will dramatically change the supply chain management process currently marred with contract disputes among other notable problems.The challenge of ReconciliationFor consumers, execution of payments is at the point of sale, but in the B2B world, business payments mostly take place weeks or months after delivery of goods and services. This creates a problematic vacuum between the funds released and the information that is around the payment. This same issue is affecting cash-flow.This vacuum is created due to a likely mismatch between the data and payment. When this happens, suppliers cannot easily reconcile their payments which directly impacts on their collection timing and receivables metrics. Suppliers then must contact their buyers for payment information and status to get to the bottom of the remittance data or post-payment invoice disputes.This is the reason why suppliers, most of the time, refuse to be paid electronically because paper checks make a better option but they come with limited and no advance visibility into the coming payments.Planport\u2019s contract managementSmart contracts will automatically execute pre-determined payments when projects and agreed terms are completed in the procure to pay life-cycle with all the data available within.Utility TokensTokens will unlock many areas of the supply chain, from farmers and suppliers to supply chain experts. The supply chain experts will add real value to the process, making sure everything is correctly incentivised and can generate different revenue streams. The supply chain is more like a chain of people who are working on their own, where values are locked away because no incentive mechanism exists today.Example of Decentralised utility tokens how they can shape the future of the supply chain industry that is built of trust and mutual\u00a0benefit.1)Decentralising Firm based consultancyOne of the features of the Planport network is the On-Demand Consultancy. This means that the current system of having consultants advice enterprises on different aspects of procurement is done within the PlanPort system on a pay-per-use model instead of months of contracts and huge fees that need be locked in in the traditional pattern. Procurement heads will easily connect with experts in the different categories, needs, and transact without any hassles as is typical of procurement advising firms. This means there are no substantial upfront investments or long terms contracts, and users can scale it up or down, or even turn it off as simple as users can turn it on.2)Fairer Return: incentive mechanismSuppliers want to monetize their ideas. The internal works and contributions suppliers are bringing to the table for enterprises are all promoted whenever an incentive is in place.Currently, there is no mechanism to solve this issue, so ideas and improvements that could change how organisations work and drive for a better outcome are locked away. The Plan token is designed for this purpose.Planport token use case example: incentive mechanism3)Security Deposit and\u00a0StakingPort Tokens can be staked for proposals issuing, submitting new proposals, launching an RFP, and launching contracts. The number of tokens required to stake can be designed dynamically depending on the number of projects, the value of the project and other factors like reputation and rating of the entity.Traceability and visibilityOne of the Blockchain core values is that an entity can\u2019t manipulate data as they wish. This is a valuable feature that Blockchain will bring to the supply chain to ensure authenticity and traceability throughout the procurement lifecycle. The result is greater value to users. Audit trails of goods that are verifiable, supplier verification and the authenticity of credentials, qualifications and other necessary documents will no longer be fraudulently presented in the supply chain process.Planport Trade finance marketplace1.1 Working capital solutionsOne of the problem that suppliers face today is dealing with fees as high as 20% on their receivables due to third party organisations, at the same time there is also a problem of duplication of invoices and fraud within the $3 trillion worth industry. The blockchain technology eliminates the need to have a middleman to verify and execute invoices and allows borderless trade finance marketplace where Sellers and Funders meet with trust and mutual benefit. Businesses can also Control their organisation\u2019s trade finance operations using the transparent and intuitive financial dashboard.Planport: Product One\u00a0ExampleThe core design behind the Planport first product is its core idea of creating a single, feature-filled platform that touches and solves all the problems that the procurement departments face on a daily basis. At the heart of this platform is a seamless RFI, RFQ, and RFP solutions portal that is made intuitive and utterly transparent unlike the very manual and fragmented process that currently exist with spreadsheets, emails, and very inefficient payment systems. On a single platform, and with little or no hassle, a company can issue RFXs, invite suppliers and run a simple reverse auction that cut their cost down, accept and conduct business with zero inefficiency and minimal waste of time or resources. In effect, they save millions and build a strategic relationship in the process.Join our community!official Social Media Channels:We will be frequently releasing information on Medium blogs going forward to our token sale.

What is there to gain? Does it really matter?The one sure thing is that demand for Blockchain Developers (often called Blockchain Engineers) exceeds the supply by far, and this demand is increasing over time:Blockchain and Bitcoin were 2 of the top 3 fastest-growing skills on Upwork\u2019s Quarterly Skills Index in\u00a02017.In this article, we\u2019re going to look at similar historical growth of innovative platforms, and some ways you can start making money as a blockchain developer as you develop your skillset.Lessons from the past: Google Play and Apple\u2019s App\u00a0StoreLet\u2019s take some data from the two biggest app stores of today, Google\u2019s Google Play and Apple\u2019s App Store.In March 2009 the Google Play store (called Android Market at the time) had 2,300 apps available. By the end of October 2010 that number had increased to 100,000[1]. In February 2017 the amount of apps on Google Play store was around in the range of 2.7 million.App Store exhibited similar growth:App Store growth 2008\u20132017 | source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/263795/number-of-available-apps-in-the-apple-app-store/Will history repeat\u00a0itself?If blockchain really is analogous to the internet in the early 90s, then DApps are in an analogous stage to the early-days of the app stores. We are going to see massive growth in DApp software developers over the coming years.I will take a phrase from Wikipedia\u2019s App Store (iOS) page,The term app has become a popular buzzword; in January 2011, app was awarded the honor of being 2010\u2019s \u201cWord of the Year\u201d [1]\u2026and make a bold prediction and adapt it to the DApp ecosystem:The term DApp has become a popular buzzword; in January 2019, DApp was awarded the honor of being 2018\u2019s \u201cWord of the\u00a0Year\u201dWhat actually matters here is not if the above happens. It is when.Should you really look into\u00a0this?If you are excited by:DecentralizationWorking with brilliant passionate mindsInnovationCutting-edge technologyHigh salaries (this happens mainly due to demand being much higher than available supply)\u2026then you should get familiar with blockchain development. Currently individuals, startups and even larger companies[2][3] are gradually joining the blockchain industry with their own products and they are actively looking for more employees to join their projects.Ways to make money as a blockchain developerThere are a number of ways you can start making money building DApps, depending on your current skill level.1. Build your own DApp and monetize\u00a0itTaking CryptoKitties as an example, you can build a monetized DApp. There is huge potential here\u200a\u2014\u200aCryptoKitties did over $12 million USD in sales in its first month after launch.If you look on DappRadar, you can see the volume of transactions different DApps are doing, with CryptoCountries currently topping the list at almost $40,000,000 in sales over the past 7 days. The developers take 2\u20135% of every transaction, so you can do the math and see what a profitable opportunity building your own DApp-based game can be.In our next article, we\u2019ll be covering in-depth the different business models you can use in your DApps to generate profits.2. Get paid for contributing to open-source projectsGitcoin aims to \u2018push open source forward\u2019 by attaching bounties denominated in Ether for solving github issues. Currently, there are more than $8.000 attached among 20 bounties, waiting to be claimed!All you need to do is solve an issue, and if the bounty submitter approves it, you will get paid in Ether via a smart contract.How does Gitcoin work? | https://gitcoin.co3. Create your own own Startup / CryptocurrencyLaunching an Ethereum token that is secure and can be used to trade value is as trivial as writing a few lines of code, thanks to OpenZeppelin. After you develop the coin, you can raise capital through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).MVP of GustavoCoin in 10 lines of Code | https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/how-to-create-token-and-initial-coin-offering-contracts-using-truffle-openzeppelin-1b7a5dae99b6Of course, your project must have some kind of value in order to raise the required capital. (Or not, as has been the case with many high-profile ICOs\u200a\u2014\u200abut that is another discussion).4. Work at a\u00a0startupIf building your own startup isn\u2019t your thing, you can get hired as a developer on someone else\u2019s. There are a number of new projects springing up all the time that are looking for developers. Many of these projects raise millions of dollars via an ICO, and have a large budget for hiring skilled developers.You can take a quick look at AngelList and apply for a position that interests you.https://angel.co/blockchains/jobsBecause blockchain developers are in such high demand, many of these offer working remotely, which is a big plus for many.5. Work as a freelancerIf you prefer flexible and on-demand gigs, popular freelancing sites such as upwork.com or freelancer.com have job listings on potential projects that you can work part-time or on a per-project basis.You can search for positions such as Solidity Developer or Blockchain Engineer at these sites to grasp an idea of what positions are available.6.

The current generation is enjoying playing video games on devices with lightning fast processing and the graphics quality is also incredibly crystal clear and more realistic. Our grandparents never had this luxury when they used to play video games. From games with boring black and white graphics being played by one gamer on one device to cloud based multiplayer games seducing gamers of all ages from all over the world, we can say that more than two generations have witnessed this unbelievable evolution of the gaming industry.Now, cyber game tournaments are being organized and there are professional gamers participating in these tournaments. A decade ago, the prize money at the World Cyber Games 2008 was $470,000. 800 gamers from 78 countries participated in the tournament. Age of Empire, Asphalt, Counter Strike, FIFA, Need For Speed and StarCraft, we all play these games at home. These are some of the games gamers played in the tournament. Today, these tournaments are streamed live and millions of individuals watch these games online.It\u2019s 2018 now and the prize money is in billions. These tournaments have a massive audience consisting men and women of all age groups cheering their favorite gamers or team of gamers. Online gaming, gambling and eSports industry is a big thing. With virtual reality games being the new trend, the industry has also targeted mobile in past few years.Though the processing speed and internal memories of Smartphone impedes a great gaming experience, still companies are investing in mobile games as this is the most used device. Moreover, the Smartphones of the current and next generation will have sufficient internal memories and processing powers to play games with the best graphics and features. Though professional gamers who are making money by playing use high-end devices, still the number of individuals playing games on mobile phones is huge. It is an opportunity with an exceptional return on investment. So, mobile gaming is also the future.However, the question remains unanswered. How Is Blockchain technology going to change the way online gaming and eSports industry will work? Well, the question will remain unanswered unless we look into the current challenges that are acting as barriers to the growth of the industry.Following are the issues we can address using Blockchain technology:Lack of One Common Platform for All Games and ServicesLack of Interaction between Gamers and OperatorsInefficient and Unregulated revenue an Reward NetworkPrivacy and Safety Concerns Due To FraudWhat Is The Benefit Of Operating All Games And Services Through One Common Platform?With data being siloed to individual companies, it is not possible for one service to learn about the good or bad reputation of a gamer working with some other service. If data of one service is made available to another service, this will help in preventing issues such as fraud and also addressing privacy and safety concerns. And, data can be analyzed and used intelligently. This also helps in enhancing the online gambling and gaming experience. Making all games and services available at common platform allows gamers and operators to draw more revenue opportunities.What is in BigBang Ecosystem for Operators and Gamers?BigBang Ecosystem is being developed to take care of the interests of all actors.Here is how the BigBang Ecosystem is advantageous for operators:With Blockchain eliminating the need of intermediaries, the total amount of money to be forked out for a transaction is reduced and profit is increased.This system enables game operators to acquire and retain more gamers resulting in a higher turnover.They can join the BB Ecosystem absolutely free of cost.Here is how the BB Ecosystem is advantageous for the gamers:Smart contracts, immutability and other features of the Blockchain technology make the BB Ecosystem trustworthy for gamers.

This distributed ledger technology keeps track of all the changes ever made to it, virtually eliminating the possibility of fraud and providing unparalleled transparency. These two factors create inviolable trust between the opposite parties in a transaction and does so without the need for an expensive third party. It is this inherent feature of trust that makes blockchain a radical disruptor of FinTech and P2P applications.Peer-to-Peer ReinventedBlockchain technology disrupts many traditional industries by offering a faster, cheaper, more secure, and more effective transactions between peers. What used to require expensive intermediaries or third-parties can be now carried out easily through blockchain thanks to the implementation of smart contracts.Smart contracts are the idea behind the so-called blockchain 2.0 concept. They represent a covenant between two parties which is written and secured using a programming language. The contracts are automatically executed as soon as the specified triggers are pulled.This dramatically reduces the need for third-party moderation throughout a broad range of different industries. Hence, blockchain\u2019s disruptive capacity for the P2P economy, and FinTech in general.A Few\u00a0ExamplesWhile, in theory, any industry can benefit from blockchain technologies, there are certain fields which can be positively, even radically transformed.Money TransferHaving to send a certain amount of money to a distant relative halfway across the world is a situation that many of us are familiar with. The process takes an uncomfortable amount of time and imposes annoying fees for a task that should be simple: sending money to another person.Blockchain technology takes away all the hurdles when it comes to transferring money. Parties are now able to send funds without having to use the services of third-party intermediaries (banks or other financial services providers) at little to no cost and in little to no time.And as mentioned above, the blockchain keeps a record of all transactions, which allows users to be completely certain of the movements of their money.Transportation & LogisticsBlockchain technologies can also dramatically empower the transportation and logistics industries. The technology is already being picked up by traditional institutions in the field, including major players like Maersk and Walmart. In Australia, for example, the Commonwealth Bank recently shipped 17 tons of almonds using blockchain technology.This enabled them to track important factors such as the cargo\u2019s current location, temperature, and humidity within the containers, and other values in real time.Insurance PaymentsBlockchain technology can also reduce the costs of operating P2P insurance networks. This is because it has the potential to increase transparency, cut down administrative costs, and reduce fraud.What\u2019s AERUM\u2019s Role in All\u00a0This?Blockchain technology, despite its undeniable disruptive potential, is still quite new, and relatively untested in real-world applications. Much of the reason for this is that the majority of existing networks are unable to support the number of transactions needed to cater to the requirements of widespread public and enterprise-grade adoption.Take Ethereum, for example\u200a\u2014\u200athe industry leader in terms of deployed solutions. It can currently handle only 20 transactions per second. When it comes to enterprise applications on a global scale, it goes without saying that this is not nearly fast enough to be a practical, day-to-day solution.This is where AERUM comes in, as a reliable and fast blockchain platform which is free for the end user. It is still 100% compatible with Ethereum while offering 25x better throughput.The network provides on-demand scalability from 500 to 100,000 transactions per seconds depending on the needs of the application. It has a modern and comprehensive consensus mechanism, as well as a mobile, web, and desktop multi wallet which connects AERUM to Ethereum thanks to petal chains and Atomic Swaps.AERUM is the leading solution capable of fulfilling the true disruptive potential of blockchain technology, which itself has already started to transform the P2P economy.You can read more about the AERUM network on its official website or stay tuned on the project\u2019s Facebook or Twitter page.

In a very short time, the theoretical concept of decentralized currency has evolved so much that now it has become a segment of the global economy. Cryptocurrency first emerged to the scenes in the year 2009 when Bitcoin, an electronic currency was launched by an anonymous group or individual known as the Satoshi Nakamoto. In the recent times, the Bitcoin value is skyrocketing, and 14 million Bitcoins already in circulation.What Laid Ground for Bitcoin\u2019s Global Success?\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin Owes Its Triumph to BlockchainMany experts around the globe mention that the Blockchain Technology is the secret that helped Bitcoin to gain the trust of investors worldwide. Bitcoin and Blockchain both took a plunge into the mainstream as a combo, and now both of these are doing wonders to our digital society. The Blockchain is typically the new age digital ledger technology. This technology is changing the dimensions of the financial service industry with its high-end security and transparency. The basic principle of this technology is, an entry once made into this digital ledger cannot either be deleted or edited by any member of the network. And, this perhaps is drawing the attention of people associated with diverse industries such as the banking ecosystem, the education sector, and many others.Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency Are Here To the Change the Industry for Better and For GoodBB Token is one-of-its-kind venture worldwide virtual gaming & loyalty program, specially created for casinos and gamers. The aim of this network is to revolutionize the virtual gambling & betting industry with the technology, which is creating a lot of hype recently, Blockchain technology. This technology establishes a synchronized and shared network that promises safe and secure gaming experiences for gambling freaks.BB Token is a network which brings the virtual gambling industry and Blockchain technology on one platform to offer loyalty rewards, BB Tokens for e-sports and online gambling players.Why BB Token Is Being Considered the Trustworthy Future of Virtual Gambling and eSports?Apart from being powered by the Blockchain technology, the BB Token venture comes with a mechanism to confront any sort of hacking or fraudulent threats. This, in turn, ensures privacy and safety.Benefits of the gaming network to the gamblers include reduce transaction costs, quick transaction processing, and joining the BB Ecosystem free of cost.Perks of this gambling platform to the people in the business of betting & gambling includes implementation of the automated marketing strategies, customer retention via the reward program, and enhanced transparency.How to Register With BB Token?The procedure to get yourself registered over the BB Platform is easy-peasy.

For example\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can exchange BTC to LTC with the fixed and small fee for any amount without centralization exchanges. The commission does not depend on the amount.What is Atomic Swap?In Greek language \u201catomos\u201d means \u201cindivisible\u201d. \u201cSwap\u201d means trade and finance exchange operation in the form of exchange of different assets. Atomic Swap is the operation, which either implemented entirely or cannot be implemented at all.It has essential meaning for the future of crypto: unlimited cross-blockchain exchange will open up a brand-new world of possibilities for the market.https://twitter.com/satoshilite/status/911328252928643072ImplementationAtomic Swap has two sides\u200a\u2014\u200aInitiator and Participant. For example look at BTC-LTC Atomic Swap:Initiator creates something like \u201cdeposit box\u201d which contain funds in the process of Atomic Swap.This is like \u201ctransparent\u201d box: recipient can check what\u2019s inside, but cannot take the funds out without the initiator\u2019s key.When recipient checked that everything is fine, he makes the same box with the same lock, but with his own assets. Initiator checks this box, open it and leaves the key in the lock. Then the recipient takes the key and opens the initiator\u2019s box.The key is called the \u201cSecret\u201d and box it is the Contract. In other words, initiator sends to recipient hash of his Secret and now recipient can make a similar box, which will be opened by the same secret.And although initiator owns the lock and the key, he can\u2019t open his box and take his coins back, because the assets blocked for 24 hours by Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC) protection. It\u2019s designed to prevent each side from frauds and cheating (when initiator already received participant\u2019s coins, but didn\u2019t sent his own).Atomic Swap execution processIn picture above you can see a full Atomic Swap process, it looks complicated isn\u2019t it? But not for Atomic Wallet user:All of this proceeds automatically and there is no need for any actions by users in the process.

Bitcoin was created as a \u201ctrustless\u201d money system because the governance structures in control of the world monetary system abused their power to exercise undue influence over world governments and their populations.If we are to understand the value of decentralized blockchain governance, then we must first understand what problems with central bank governance that blockchains were created to solve.Unpredictable Monetary PolicyUncontrollable Government SpendingInstability of Debt-based MoneyFraudulent use of Bank DepositsCapital ControlsIdentity TheftMoral Hazard of BailoutsThe global population is powerless to prevent world governments from consuming our capital base so long as we rely upon their currencies. Through limitless money printing, governments and the banks that fund them can confiscate the majority of the world\u2019s resources without a tax revolt. It isn\u2019t until years later when the economy slumps under the burden of prior capital consumption that people notice what happened.With Bitcoin and early smart contract platforms came the concepts that \u201ccode is law\u201d and \u201chash power makes right\u201d. This combined with the belief in censorship resistance gave people a new level of \u201ctrust\u201d in the monetary governance. The big idea is that we should remove all of the potentially corrupt people from the equation. With no one in charge the rules can never change and we can be free of corruption, confiscation, inflation, and capital controls.Has Bitcoin & Ethereum Improved\u00a0Things?For the past 10 years we have had the opportunity to observe a live experiment in the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of blockchains in protecting people from loss of funds. I have created a list of all the ways people lose money under existing governments and under code-is-law.Losing Money & Freedom on BlockchainForget Password / Lost KeysKeys CompromisedPhishing ScamsExchange HacksBugs in CodeDouble Spend Attacks (multiple chain reorgs)Mugging / Kidnapping / ExtortionSocial EngineeringCapital Gains TaxesGovernment Seizing TokensSupply GrowthFeesFalse Sense of Privacy from AllDenial of Service by SpamSend to wrong AddressLosing Money & Freedom in\u00a0BanksSeizing Bank Accounts by Court OrderBank Defaults not covered by Deposit InsuranceIdentity TheftSupply GrowthFeesCapital Controls / Denial of Service by AML / KYC ComplianceLoss of Privacy to Government, Private from neighbors.Credit Card Fraud passed on to MerchantsFor the average man, their money is far more vulnerable in cryptocurrency than it is an bank account. This is especially true for the vast majority of people who manage to stay on the right side of the law. Like it or not, the AML / KYC rules combined with insurance on credit cards and bank deposits protect people from many crimes because it is harder to hide your identity and move money. If your bank password is compromised the bank eats the loss, not you. If your bank loses all of its money, insurance backed by inflation covers the losses. If you lose your password the bank can validate your identity and give you your money back. If the bank makes a mistake in authenticating a withdraw, the bank is liable for the losses.What we can conclude from this is that despite corruption in the monetary policy, individual users are far more secure in the existing banking system than in the existing blockchain systems. This is because the existing banking system socializes most of the losses. The negative externalities of the corruption in monetary governance are imperceivable for the individuals, but the failures of blockchain security to individual accounts is well documented.I don\u2019t have exact numbers to prove it, but I suspect that the loss of funds due to smart contract bugs and hacks is greater than the loss of individual funds due to bank failures/hacks/corruption as a percentage of the respective dollar/token economies.Making Blockchains Safe for\u00a0UsersThe primary cause of loss of funds is losing passwords and/or transferring funds by mistake. The next most common problem is the use of software keys which get compromised. Hardware wallets can mitigate the loss of funds due to compromised software keys, but they are powerless against losing the physical keys or forgetting the pin that protects the device. Hardware keys also do little to protect users from attacks that attempt to trick people into signing the wrong thing. Furthermore hardware devices can fail or be stolen. All of this together means that relying on hardware alone is like losing a physical key to an impenetrable home safe.One thing that the existing banking system does is make people safer from physical mugging and/or home invasions. Thieves know that people don\u2019t carry cash on them and that they cannot easily get away with forcing someone to log into their bank and transfer funds. With cryptocurrency, the only way to protect yourself from similar situations is to rely on a trusted party to co-sign your transactions. This might prevent the mugger from getting your tokens, but it doesn\u2019t stop you from being mugged in the first place. In order to minimize risk of mugging, the vast majority of people must adopt multi-sig accounts with trusted 3rd parties (e.g. banks). This is similar to the concept of herd immunity.The Code is Law\u00a0MythThere is widespread belief that there is no \u201cgovernance\u201d of Bitcoin or Ethereum and that these protocols are decentralized. There is further a belief that the code should be law. In reality all blockchains have human governance processes that reveal themselves in emergencies and when the protocol upgrades. All code has bugs; and bugs in the law create injustice and violation of expected property rights.Ethereum\u2019s shadow-government hard-forked to fix the DAO hack. Bitcoin mining pools voted on which fork to support when a software upgrade introduced a long unintended fork. The Ethereum foundation has used Trademark law to define the official version of the chain that exchanges are allowed to list. Segwit was accepted due to a summit of community leaders who voted on a compromise that included increasing the block size only to be betrayed due to the phased-rollout plan that later abandoned big blocks.Large miners have cornered the market on ASIC with the benefit of economies of scale. Mining pools have cornered the market on block production (2\u20133 pools control Bitcoin and Ethereum). Fees (aka producer bribes) have risen to be higher than bank transfers. Lightning networks create new bank-like-intermediaries and are vulnerable to censorship attacks by mining pools and ASIC cartels.Every blockchain that has a \u201cprocess for upgrading\u201d has a governance structure that is capable of changing the rules, rolling back stolen funds, etc. It is the good-old-boy network of Github admins, exchange connections, and mining pool operators. The problem is that these processes are informal and less predictable and even less accountable than the governmental structures we hope the blockchains would replace. Insiders take stealth control of these informal processes while the masses perceive coordinated governance chaos.EOS Solution to Decentralized GovernanceEOS is taking a new approach to solving the problems with centralized governments that doesn\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater. In this case, the baby is civilized dispute resolution among consenting adults along with the broader concept of peer to peer community enforced contracting.The EOS community constitution aims to establish a set of principles which differentiate it from existing centralized governments and from all prior blockchains. For starters, it makes a commitment to non-violent governance. All parties agree that disputes may only be resolved by appending to the blockchain. If world governments had this clause they couldn\u2019t throw you in jail or start wars. If you didn\u2019t like their taxes, their policies, their regulations, you could just leave. This is a FUNDAMENTAL difference in how a global community can govern itself without repeating the mistakes of existing governments.The EOS constitution also establishes a formal process and basis of authority by consent. Those who do not consent can take the open source code and start their own community with their own rules. Unlike traditional governments which have monopolized the livable land area, there\u2019s always a new frontier for freedom loving people to experiment with new governance structures. All it takes is a large enough group of like-minded individuals to bootstrap a new community and compete against any corrupted community.This free market competition in community governance introduces market forces to the governance equation. A blockchain that is operated by a corrupt dispute resolution system will see its currency sold in the market as people leave in droves seeking safe haven in new communities that better protect their rights. Only the most universally competent dispute resolution systems and blockchains will survive. Communities that enact unpredictable monetary policies contrary to their constitution will see their tokens fall in value rapidly in favor of more responsible communities.Blockchains create a far more efficient market because there is no captive population forced to use the currency at gunpoint. Furthermore, there is no geographical constraints that force a person to use the same currency as their neighbors.Enforcement of ContractsBlockchains are designed to execute objective and deterministic contracts. Arbitrators are designed to be oracles for subjective evaluation of non-deterministic contracts. EOS combines these two concepts with the goal of minimizing the opportunity for dispute, maximizing the quality and transparency of evidence of agreement, and creating the technical tools to allow human intervention to correct bugs in execution or violations of subjective agreements.In this sense, EOS is the first contracting platform focusing on formalizing, automating, and clarifying agreements among consenting well-intentioned adults. This is far broader and more powerful than blindingly enforcing bug-ridden contracts without any respect to the intention of the parties.Baby StepsEOS is a new community building the tools necessary to achieve this vision of a global community governing itself without the use of violence. Over time the community will formalize arbitration processes, constitutional amendments, division of power, and limitations of liability. In the meantime the community is using the tools it has today to enforce its contracts and combat the blatant fraud & theft so prevalent in the cryptocurrency industry.If everything develops as I hope, the EOS community will be the safest place to hold tokens without fear of unjust rulings, identity theft, token hacks, lost passwords, etc. It will have stable monetary policy with civilized dispute resolution.There will be bad actors and communities will live or die based upon how quickly they identify and removes them. All other blockchains are incapable of removing bad actors because they are not based upon the premise of contractual cooperation for a common good, but instead upon the premise of the law of the jungle where technical might makes right. Brains are the new brawn and nerdy cavemen are arguing that they have the divine right to whatever property they can hack. When hacks do occur, people resort to violence at the hands of governments they ask to track-down and punish the hackers and scammers. EOS is fundamentally different from other governments and blockchain communities in that its community wishes to operate at the highest possible ethical standard of voluntary consent and non-violence.Where as other blockchain communities rely on existing governments to get retribution, EOS is the first blockchain to take responsibility for its own community and not depend upon the corrupt, violent, legacy dispute resolution systems. EOS is designed to focus on restorative restitution rather than punitive retribution.It is my hope that the EOS community can level the playing field and secure life, liberty, property, and justice for all.", "responses": "53"}, {"title": "BLOCKCHAIN:", "author_name": "BIGBANG LOYALTY TOKENS", "link": "https://medium.com/@bigbangtoken/blockchain-d3890762b6db?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 27, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "904", "content": "BLOCKCHAIN:BIGBANG LOYALTY TOKENSBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 27, 2018A Breakthrough Technology for Online Gaming and Esports\ud83d\udd25(credits to the\u00a0owner)2017 was definitely the year for cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology, but people around the world are still not very clear about it.

The second and third are game-changing innovations on the path to significant adoption\u2026 which are nonetheless essentially evolutionary.A useful mnemonic is to remember three \u201cTs\u201d: Trust-minimizing, Tracking, and Trading.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Popular Use Cases of Blockchain Technology You Need to\u00a0Know", "author_name": "Febin John James", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/popular-use-cases-of-blockchain-technology-you-need-to-know-df4e1905d373?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 31, 2018", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "7.5K", "content": "FilmGrabPopular Use Cases of Blockchain Technology You Need to\u00a0KnowApplications of BlockchainFebin John JamesBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 31, 2018I am the Blockchain! I am invincible because I replicate myself on multiple computers. Yea like the Ultron. You cannot corrupt me. Though Bitcoin and Ethereum were my first applications. My true power is yet to be unleashed.Credits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdIdentityLet me start with identity cards, badges, and things. Fancy designs can be replicated. You know about 3D printers right? How do you verify them? Some organisations provide online verification service. You can scan the card or punch in the number and verify if it\u2019s authentic. But, this can be costly, you need to pay for the cloud. With Blockchain you don\u2019t have to build your own identity infrastructure, you can use Ethereum\u2019s open Blockchain to store the identity details. Anyone who wants to verify just has to query the open Blockchain.NotaryMost of your ownership records are stored in paper ledgers. These can be tampered. The data on Blockchain cannot be altered. On a Blockchain there are two things. A block and a chain. At a very high level, it is just a chain of blocks. Since it\u2019s inside computers, we can rule out the physical stuff. Here digital information is divided into blocks and linked together. For example consider the following blocks, each represent a country. Each of them contains the city names of the respective country.Wait, there is something more. Each of these blocks has something called a hash. A hash is a set of characters (eg. \u201c1hi515AHA5H\u201d ). Hash is derived from the information contained in the block. The block of U.S.A has cities New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. So the hash would be something like \u201cNYLAC\u201d (Technically that\u2019s not the case, but you get the idea).Every successive block will contain the previous block\u2019s hash. This is what binds them together (The force). If someone tampers the first block to add the city Boston. The new hash becomes \u201cNYLACB\u201d. However, the succeeding block of India has already stored the hash as \u201cNYLAC\u201d. This mismatch will break the chain. So the purpose of hash is to make sure no one tampers it. The point I am trying to say is you can\u2019t tamper my records. If you do, I will know.Digital AssetsI hope you have heard about ICOs(Checkout TravelChain). It\u2019s a new way to raise investment. Anyone anywhere can now become an investor. When someone invests in your company you should give them something back right? Like stocks or shares? ICOs offer a digital asset called token. These tokens will be stored on your Blockchain wallet (Checkout Coinbase). You will be able to use these tokens to pay for the company\u2019s services or even exchange them at a later date when its value increases.Smart ContractsCredits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdMark and SaraMark hasn\u2019t paid his rent for five months. When Sara questions he promise to pay later. She is helpless. She can\u2019t afford a lawyer. Courts take eight months to almost a year to enforce action. The only option is to persuade Mark.Joe\u2019s businessJoe is a businessman. He does business with different corporates on a frequent basis. A few months ago he signed a contract with a retailer. Though the conditions of the contract were met. The retailer refused to pay. These people take advantage of the legal system and persuade Joe to settle for less pay. Joe had such experiences before. In some cases, he went to court. The time and money he spent there cost him his profits.How do we help Sara and Joe?Have we solved this problem elsewhere? In Sara\u2019s case, we need to make Mark pay the rent every month. A time-based trigger. Your calendar app uses such trigger to give you notifications of predefined events.In Joe\u2019s case, once terms of the agreement is met the party needs to pay. It\u2019s a condition based trigger. Consider the last time you purchased an ebook from Amazon. Amazon will only deliver it once the payment is confirmed.The point is computer programs execute such instructions consistently. It did when you clicked on this article, scrolled down, etc\u00a0. In order to help Sara, we need to convert the agreements of the contract into code.Pseudo code of the smart contract between Sara and MarkIf today\u2019s date is 30th and rent is not paid thenTransfer $500 from Mark\u2019s account to Sara\u2019s accountBut where do we deploy this code? It should be deployed on computers of all parties involved. Sara\u2019s and Mark\u2019s bank will be part of a private Blockchain network. Joe and Sara will sign a coded contract(a.k.a smart contract). Then it\u2019s deployed on the network. Both Mark\u2019s and Sara\u2019s bank will have a copy. On 30th of every month when the clock ticks 12.00. The agreed amount gets transferred from Mark\u2019s account to Sara\u2019s account. Joe started using smart contracts to enforce his clients to pay the agreed amount.Sara is happy because she doesn\u2019t have to trust Mark\u2019s consent to transfer rent. Joe\u2019s glad because he doesn\u2019t have to go to a court for justice. Instead, he can spend those efforts to grow his business.Digital VotingRemember the last time you stood in a queue to vote? What if you can do it at home? The biggest problem with online voting is its security. Votes can be tampered or hackers can find out who you voted for. Blockchain can make your vote anonymous and provide better security. Since voter turnout in America is low, digital voting can bring in more participants.Distributed StoragePresently you use services like Gdrive, Dropbox to store your files. The problem is you have to trust them that they won\u2019t peep into your data. Governments can force them to disclose data if required. On Blockchain data is decentralised its stored on different computers on the network with high encryption. This can reduce costs. If you have excess storage on your computer, you can rent your excess storage capacity. Storj is an example. Yea, Airbnb or an Uber for digital storage.How to Validate If Your Ideas Need a Blockchain medium.comClaps Please \ud83d\udc4f\u00a0, Thank You \ud83d\ude0a.

(\u2026 And I promise I won\u2019t describe it as \u2018a type of distributed ledger\u200a\u2014\u200abecause what the heck is\u00a0that?)SHA-256: Not M.

Most of us just peg it down to \u201ccomputer stuff\u201d.But it\u2019s so much more than that. It\u2019s a program created by the NSA called Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA-256). Why SHA-256? Keep reading\u2026Think of a fingerprint.A fingerprint is a unique identifier for you. We all know that. In a simplified way, if you put something through this impressive-like SHA-256 program (it could be two words, a 10,000 page essay, an image, etc.), it will give you this so-called \u201cdigital fingerprint\u201d (i.e that extra long number I scared you with above). Pretty cool, right?So, imagine if somebody was messing with that 10,000 page essay that you worked so hard on. To verify it wasn\u2019t changed\u200a\u2014\u200ayou would have to go through all those pages, making sure there wasn\u2019t even a comma out of place. Or\u2026 If you had run this original essay through the SHA-256 program, you would have got one \u201cdigital fingerprint\u201d, and if someone had changed even a single space\u200a\u2014\u200ayou would have got an entirely different \u201cfingerprint\u201d.This is a very long way to describe what is known as cryptographic hashing. The hash (not that kind of hash) is the \u201cdigital signature\u201d. Which brings us back to your initial head-scratching question: what is a blockchain?Now that you\u2019re experts in cryptographic hashing, it gets much easier from here.Let\u2019s start with block. Take a bunch of transactions, and hash them i.e. give that whole \u2018block\u2019 of transactions a unique fingerprint! Done.Chain. You had your first block you just made. Your next block of transactions has the new transactions\u200a\u2014\u200aplus that hash from the previous block.Get it? Block\u200a\u2014\u200achain (technology is hilarious).Pretty cool, right? Now you understand what these images are actually saying.(P.S. It\u2019s near impossible to break that SHA-256 algorithm.)256 means there are 2\u00b2\u2075\u2076 possibilities2\u00b2\u2075\u2076=115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936\u2026 yeahBear in mind that a hash is just one way. You can\u2019t take that fingerprint and get that essay back\u200a\u2014\u200ait just validates it. This means that if someone wanted to change your blockchain, they would have to go back and edit every single thing in each one of your blocks and create them all over\u2026 And so it goes on. Trust me, once we go down this rabbit hole\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a long, long way down.This is my first go at explaining this in a simplified manner.

Blockchain technology has the potential to solve issues in the financial sector by making both internal processes and processes involving multiple parties faster, cheaper and safer. Almost all major banks are experimenting with utilizing blockchain and countless startups are working on innovative solutions to inefficiencies as old as banking itself.Not only will the implementation of blockchain in Fintech result in increased security for end users, but it will also reduce costs for the institutions, with expected savings between $15\u201320 million by 2022, according to a report from Santander. Blockchain can reduce a bank\u2019s interaction with parties and intermediaries, reducing costs for maintaining and executing contracts, as well as reducing the cost of interbank (bank-to-bank) transactions for users.Utility Settlement CoinUBS partnered with Clearmatics to create Utility settlement coin, a blockchain venture aiming to make interbank currency transfers more efficient.

Then something odd started happening over the last 4 months. A handful of blockchain-based projects have raised a combined $250m+, but none of that money has come from venture capitalists. So what the heck is going on?Blockchain tokens.These projects are raising money by creating and then selling their own tokens through crowdfunding on a blockchain. At first glance this just looks like a new way to raise money, much like how a normal company issues and sells stock to raise capital. At second glance it goes far beyond that.There are a few key components to these tokens:They are the currency that is used in the app itself.Contributors to the app are directly paid for their contributions in tokens. This can be extremely granular.The tokens are easily converted to any local currency since they are on the blockchain.As an example, let\u2019s take Storj. Storj is a system for decentralized file storage. Like Bitcoin or Ethereum, there is no central operator of the network. The project raised $500k of Bitcoin through a crowdfund of their token, Storjcoin, on the blockchain. Storjcoin allows you to buy storage space on the Storj network, and conversely, you earn Storjcoin if you contribute your own computer\u2019s storage to the network. If you buy or earn Storjcoin, you can purchase storage on the network, hold them if you think they will go up in value, or convert them to your local currency (1 Storjcoin is about $0.11 right now).This is where the phenomenon goes beyond just a new way of raising money. It is projects creating their own economic ecosystems to make the entire thing tick. More precisely, it is about an entirely new business model that is being created and tried for the first time: a decentralized business model. In this model there is no central controlling company, and has shared contributions and ownership by all involved. This business model is uniquely enabled by the combination of the internet and cryptocurrency.Other projects using this model include:Steem, a decentralized Reddit where people are paid to contribute news and content.Augur, a prediction market where people are paid to contribute the outcome of events as \u201coracles\u201d.IPFS, a decentralized file storage system with a native token called Filecoin.Even Ethereum and Bitcoin themselves, where people are paid to contribute their computing power to process transactions. Ethereum originally raised $18m in Bitcoin in a crowdsale.You\u2019ll notice one other thing about these \u201cprojects\u201d or \u201capps\u201d: they are really decentralized software protocols. A protocol is a fancy technical term that means: a standard language that lets a bunch of people on the internet work together on a specific problem. Popular internet protocols that have existed for a long time include HTTP (protocol that defines how information is transmitted over the web), SMTP (protocol your email app uses for sending and receiving email), SSL (protocol your browser uses for secure data transfer, the little green key in your browser when you are making a credit card payment).Historically it has been difficult to incentivize the creation of new protocols as Albert Wenger points out. This has been because 1) there had been no direct way to monetize the creation and maintenance of these protocols and 2) it had been difficult to get a new protocol off the ground because of the chicken and the egg problem. For example, with SMTP, our email protocol, there was no direct monetary incentive to create the protocol\u200a\u2014\u200ait was only later that businesses like Outlook, Hotmail, and Gmail started using it and made a real business on top of it. As a result we see very successful protocols and they tend to be quite old.Now someone can create a protocol, create a tokens that is native to that protocol, and retain some of that token for themselves and for future development. This is a great way to incentivize creators: if the protocol is successful, the token will go up in value. What if the creators are too greedy and keep too much of the tokens for themselves? Since this is all open source code, people can just copy all of the code (called \u201cforking\u201d) and start the exact same network over again.In addition, tokens help solve the classic chicken and the egg problem that many networks have. To illustrate this problem, consider the beginning of Twitter. The value of being one of the first few users on the network was low\u200a\u2014\u200ano one else was using it, so there was no content! Now millions of people are on Twitter so people find a lot of value in it. In other words, the value of a network goes up a lot when more people join it.So how do you get people to join a brand new network?You give people partial ownership of the network. Just like equity in a startup, it is more valuable to join the network early because you get more ownership. Decentralized applications do this by paying their contributors in their token. And there is potential for that token (partial ownership of the network) to be worth more in the future. This is equivalent to being a miner in the early days of Bitcoin.These two incentives are amazing offsets for each other. When the network is less populated and useful you now have a stronger incentive to join it.This system has been used by startups for years to attract employees to a young company, and now decentralized apps are using it to incentivize all potential users around the world to join the app early on.This will make it much easier to get a network going. Networks have tried all sorts of things to bootstrap past the chicken and the egg problem in the past: Reddit generated their own content before users sustained the platform with their own content, Facebook ripped Harvard\u2019s student directory to seed the network, amongst other examples.Bitcoin and Ethereum were the first to use this decentralized model, and they used it to bootstrap currency/transaction networks. The same model is now being used to bootstrap other networks.Network with a centralized company as the\u00a0operatorImagine if this had been the model from the start for projects like Twitter, Wikipedia, Facebook, Reddit, or Uber. Instead of a central company making money by owning and extracting rent from the network they created, a software protocol replaces the central operator, and all of the creators and contributors to the network mutually own it. Contributors to networks (like drivers for Uber) look less like worker bees and more like mutual owners in the network they are creating value in.Network with a decentralized protocol as the\u00a0operatorThis decentralized business model can be described as: X without the need for the central network operator X. Uber without the need for Uber as a company controlling the network of drivers and riders. Reddit without the need for Reddit as a company centrally hosting and creating the platform. Facebook without the Facebook. There will still be businesses which support these networks through value added services (e.g. auto financing or driver background checks for Uber); just not one company who \u201cowns\u201d the network.It is very early, but tokens and this new decentralized model can mean a number of other things for the world:Businesses that are based on network effects will start to be built \u201cdecentralized first\u201d.This will look much like how some businesses started to be built \u201cinternet first\u201d in the late 1990s or \u201cmobile first\u201d in the late 2000s.Access to capital will be more equal, as anyone globally can contribute to a project. The project started in Africa is on the same network (a global blockchain) as a project started in Silicon Valley.On the flip side, investing will get a lot more equal globally. Everyone has access to the same set of investments.Thus, blockchains first gave us the Internet of Money, now they are starting to give us the Internet of Assets.The future of corporate law looks like a hybrid lawyer/coder.It\u2019s worth noting this phenomenon is not exclusive to any single blockchain. Some projects have created their own blockchain (Steem). Others have been created on top of one of the major digital currency protocols (Colored Coins on Bitcoin, Augur on Ethereum). However, it\u2019s likely we will increasingly see tokens being built on the major existing blockchains like Ethereum. This will be driven by developer tools being concentrated on these blockchains, much in the way we saw lots of web apps be built on Ruby on Rails as they made it much easier to spin up a web site. Some of the most important work still to do is to make it as easy to create a decentralized app and corresponding tokens as it currently is to build a web application from a developer standpoint.The growth in the number of tokens is likely to mimic the growth of apps in the App Store: it will start slow and then grow exponentially.Like web apps and mobile apps, there will be thousands of tokens, eventually millions. And like all apps, many will never amount to anything, some will be moderate successes, and a few will be huge hits.This coming wave of decentralized apps will have its share of massive failures as with Internet companies. There will be many more painful learning experiences like The DAO. Some of the projects I listed in this article may very well fail. Some people will myopically focus on the financial elements of this wave, calling it Stock 2.0 or maybe Wall Street 2.0 if they extrapolate, but it is so much more.This is the biggest and most important trend we have seen in digital currency in a few years. It will likely be the underpinning for the first killer apps it feels like we have been talking about forever.One only needs to think about the few major protocols that exist in the world today to see how much common good they create: HTTP gives us data across the internet, SMTP gives us email, SSL gives us secure data transfer online. Decentralized protocols and the tokens that make them tick are the beginnings of a mechanism to create more of these. This means more global equality and opportunity, mutual ownership in the networks we contribute to, more innovation in the world, and better options for consumers and businesses.Regulators like the SEC will certainly want to learn more. My hope is that they see how tokens have fundamentally different properties than what we currently think of as securities and enable them to grow like any software protocol. By doing so, they would enable protocol innovation that has the potential to be an equalizing force for the economy like the internet had on information.EDIT: I think most of the core concepts of this post are still true\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever, app coins is a poor term. Protocol tokens is more appropriate. Fundamentally protocols should be as basic and modular as possible. As mentioned in my subsequent post, we will see decentralized applications which are built atop a series of many different protocols. \u201cApp coins\u201d is unclear because it makes you think one app has one token, when in reality there will be one token for one protocol, and apps will be constructed by a series of base protocols.Thank you to Chris Dixon, Fred Wilson, Brian Armstrong, Dan Romero, and Juan Suarez for reading and providing feedback.", "responses": "43"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "", "link": "https://medium.com/@nic__carter/blockchain-is-a-semantic-wasteland-9450b6e5012?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 5, 2018", "readtime": "11 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "\u201cBlockchain\u201d this, \u201cblockchain\u201d that. It\u2019s a concept so momentous that it has even managed to shed its article. Proponents don\u2019t speak of \u201cthe\u201d blockchain or \u201ca\u201d blockchain. Instead, they reverently preach Blockchain: the solution to all enterprise needs (in particular, supply chain management). The brute, unassailable, self-evident concept has disrupted not only the rules of commerce but those of grammar. Question it and you\u2019ll be exposed as a hopeless rube and a Luddite. Use it sincerely and you\u2019ll be lumped in with the hype men and techno-utopians.It\u2019s impossible to avoid. Ads for IBM blare promises about revolutionizing tomato-tracking with blockchain. The U.K. finance minister recently asserted that blockchain may be a solution to Britain\u2019s Brexit woes. At a recent conference held by Ripple, former U.S. President Bill Clinton said of blockchain, \u201cthe permutations and possibilities are staggeringly great.\u201dThe word \u201cblockchain\u201d is satire-resistant. It\u2019s such an obvious target that it\u2019s no longer funny, and blockchain proponents are almost totally immune to ridicule. Nothing can check their indefatigable enthusiasm: There are press releases to be written, conferences to attend, and corporate R&D dollars to waste. Blockchain represents both the glittering future and the dismal present\u200a\u2014\u200aalmost all touted use cases are obvious nonsense.The ICO mania of 2015\u20132017 that is now unwinding was premised, in large part, on the ability of blockchains to disrupt markets. In simpler terms, the idea was to Uber-ize every conceivable service and replace the intermediary with a magic database detailing who is doing favors for whom. Some of those pitches invoked trillion-dollar (yes, trillion with a T) total addressable markets.Today\u2019s soulless corporate blockchains and opportunistic, ICO-based blockchains have both endured scorn and ridicule. Yet the term persists, an empty semantic husk, kept alive by a thousand press releases, conveying as little meaning as possible. The term is used to refer simultaneously to projects, structures, and databases that have virtually nothing in common. As a consequence, attempts to define it are usually hopeless failures.Here, I\u2019ll try to explain the origin of \u201cblockchain\u201d and what we should do about it.Where did \u201cblockchain\u201d come from,\u00a0anyway?Most histories of the term \u201cblockchain\u201d will mention that Satoshi Nakamoto created the first one. Except, that\u2019s not accurate. Nakamoto never referred to bitcoin as a blockchain, calling it instead a \u201cchain of hash-based proof-of-work,\u201d a \u201cchain of blocks,\u201d and even a \u201ctimechain\u201d (in an early comment within the original codebase). Imagine: We were so close to living in a world of \u201centerprise timechains\u201d and \u201cstrawberries-on-the-timechain.\u201dNakamoto was careful to emphasize that the chain was a set of proofs of work, each linked to the hash of its parent. (See for yourself!) The proof of work is absolutely essential to the concept. It is proof that anyone proposing a block has, well, worked for it. It enables the system to achieve Sybil resistance and to come to convergence (the longest chain\u200a\u2014\u200aunder the same ruleset\u200a\u2014\u200ais the correct history, by definition) without any single arbitrator.This data structure, with its inclusion of hashes of previous blocks, ensures that the past is preserved and the database is consistent. Replicating the database to every node in the network ensures that it can\u2019t be shut down or altered unilaterally.The reason \u201cblockchain\u201d is such seductive marketing\u2026 is the subtle implication that the data structure alone\u200a\u2014\u200aabsent proof of work or open validation\u200a\u2014\u200acould convey the same benefits as\u00a0bitcoin.The entire system was built with an adversarial context in mind. Hostile governments had shut down all previous attempts at e-cash. They certainly would have shut down bitcoin if they could have. Thus, it was built for a purpose. To clarify: Nakamoto may have created the first popular, widely used linked-list structure\u200a\u2014\u200anot the first of its kind\u200a\u2014\u200abut the innovation was in merging that linked list with the computational hardness of adding new entries to the chain.Does this sound like what any of the enterprise blockchains are trying to accomplish? Of course not. There is no shadowy organization dedicated to forging strawberry provenance records that might seek to interfere with IBM\u2019s supply-chain blockchain. Thus, IBM\u2019s blockchain does not need to be built to the same standard as bitcoin. The kinds of records preserved on enterprise blockchains do not need the kinds of protections that Nakamoto consensus ensures. They do not need or want open validator sets. Some trusted organization could just vouch for the database, or a consortium of interested parties could share records between them.For more on the failures of private blockchains, I recommend this post from a reformed private blockchain consultant.Why is the term so\u00a0popular?From what I can tell, people witnessed the success of bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200awhich relies in part on an ersatz, expensive database\u200a\u2014\u200aand wanted to generalize it to other uses. Even early bitcoin developer Hal Finney mused about disaggregating the data structure from the monetary system.It also might be possible to refactor and restructure Bitcoin to separate out the key new idea, a decentralized, global, irreversible transaction database. Such a functionality might be useful for other purposes. Once it exists, using it to record monetary transfers would be a sort of side effet and might be harder to shut down.\u2014 Hal Finney in his January 24, 2009 Cryptography Mailing listHowever, to the best of our knowledge, these systems only really work if the reward is internal\u200a\u2014\u200athat is, if well-behaved validation is rewarded with the \u201cnative\u201d token. If bitcoin miners were paid in U.S. dollars, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily have any incentive to mine on top of the longest chain. The value of their hardware depends on the continuing existence and flourishing of the chain they\u2019re building on top of. But private, permissioned, or enterprise blockchains do not have native currencies nor do they issue monetary units to validators, as the validator set is permissioned and thus has Sybil resistance and good behavior built in by design.\u201cBlockchain\u201d is such seductive marketing, I believe, because the data structure alone\u200a\u2014\u200aabsent proof of work or open validation\u200a\u2014\u200acould convey the same benefits as bitcoin without the token or costly anti-Sybil protection.Patri Friedman put it well in a tweet:Bitcoin is a monolith that colors the way investors and corporate R&D offices think about similar projects. Would Ripple have been as popular without bitcoin having been invented? What about Corda and Hyperledger? Litecoin? ICOs generally? Ethereum? It is hard to even imagine the alternate history, but I suspect the answer is no in all cases. Bitcoin is a juggernaut that carried with it a set of assumptions that were ported over to projects with a passing resemblance, rightly or wrongly.Consequently, I would be suspicious of anyone who routinely uses \u201cblockchain,\u201d especially if they are trying to sell you something. Overuse of the term, especially in a general context and without qualifiers, most likely reveals one of three things about a person:They are well-meaning but forced by convention to use subpar linguistic tools.They are a bit muddled and trying to mask their ignorance with technobabble.They are trying to posture as an expert in an industry which realistically has no experts.I firmly believe the misuse of the term traces back to a desire to create (or market) systems that are intended to be bitcoin-like without the unsavory bits. That, however, misses the point: Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is just a part of it, not its essence.Bitcoin and its blockchainReferring to bitcoin as a blockchain is like referring to a car as a transmission. A transmission is a key element of the system, but it doesn\u2019t represent it in totality. Blockchain is a metonymy\u200a\u2014\u200aa part used to refer to the whole. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, intrinsically. The conceptual tangle comes when one decides that the blockchain is bitcoin\u2019s essence and is owed credit for its success.Bitcoin relies on a linked list, indeed. But it also relies on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, an open source and leaderless project, a replicated database, a self-supporting incentive system, a heaviest chain consensus rule, and a proof-of-work scheme that gives block proposals unforgeable costliness. (Unforgeable costliness in simple terms: It\u2019s impossible to fake a block submission; you would have to have allocated a good chunk of computing power, or energy, to the task. It is therefore hard to create new bitcoins but easy for anyone to verify that you worked hard at it.)These inputs combine nicely to create a system that has certain qualities: provable scarcity, an ability to be audited, tamper-resistance, fair-ish distribution, almost perfect supply inelasticity (rising the price does not\u200a\u2014\u200acannot\u200a\u2014\u200acause production to accelerate), free participation (no one can stop you from broadcasting a bitcoin transaction), and so on. These qualities make bitcoin a unique relative to, say, Paypal or Visa. They are its differentiators. Without the P2P nature, the open-source collaboration, the voluntarist developers, and, crucially, the proof of work block proposal method, bitcoin would not exist. The below chart, created by David Puell based on ideas from Pierre Rochard, is an attempt to capture bitcoin\u2019s essence. Notice that the chain of blocks, while necessary to make the system work, is not sufficient on its own. Bitcoin relies on more.David Puell\u2019s laudable attempt to characterize bitcoin\u2019s essence in one\u00a0chart.I can\u2019t tell you exactly what the essence of bitcoin is, but to limit it to a chain of blocks is reductionist in the extreme. The soul of bitcoin is not the blockchain. But if you pull the blockchain out of bitcoin, you get something rather empty.Why rail against \u201cblockchain\u201d?I believe better conceptual frameworks will lead to better outcomes. Author George Orwell believed that the words we use directly affect the way we see the world. He even intimated that scrubbing words from popular usage could eliminate their referents, the very concepts they sought to represent:The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of IngSoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought\u200a\u2014\u200athat is, a thought diverging from the principles of IngSoc\u200a\u2014\u200ashould be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words.Eliminate the word \u201cfreedom\u201d from popular use and you\u2019ll eliminate the desire for freedom entirely, so the theory goes. Additionally, Orwell strongly felt that sloppy language was indicative of muddled thought and used as a way to sneak indefensible assertions past an unwitting reader.My point here is that in elevating the linked list to the exalted status of \u201cblockchain,\u201d we overrate it. In insinuating that bitcoin is just a blockchain or simply the origin of the more interesting underlying technology, we do bitcoin a disservice. By constructing the blockchain artifice in popular consciousness, we enable sloppiness of thought and do away with rigor. \u201cBlockchain\u201d dilutes the importance of a tremendously important and valuable innovation\u200a\u2014\u200aa trust-minimized monetary system\u200a\u2014\u200aand abases it by putting it to work to generate efficiencies, real or imagined, in enterprise supply chain management.The path forward requires\u00a0honestyTo the permissioned or enterprise blockchainers: Be honest about what you\u2019re building. If you\u2019re building a database controlled by a consortium of pre-permissioned entities, don\u2019t claim or imply it will have similar reliability characteristics to systems designed to live in far more adversarial environments. Imagine how you would market your system had bitcoin not been invented.Let public blockchains be. You aren\u2019t competing with them. Your systems have totally different goals. If you do want to persist with the blockchain moniker, I encourage you to very carefully define what you mean by \u201cblockchain,\u201d and be sure to distinguish your system from open, public blockchains. Lastly, for god\u2019s sake, give \u201cblockchain\u201d back its article (refer to \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d blockchain, please).To the computer scientists: Stop mocking nontechnical people for using \u201cblockchain.\u201d You\u2019re missing the point. They aren\u2019t really referring to the data structure, so it\u2019s beside the point to say, \u201cJust use MySQL.\u201d \u201cBlockchain,\u201d for better or for worse (definitely for worse) has become a term of art that is typically used to refer to the whole system\u200a\u2014\u200aeconomic and social\u200a\u2014\u200arather than just the data structure.To regulators: Please do not try to define \u201cblockchain\u201d or create blockchain regulation. You will fail, not due to your lack of astuteness but because the term \u201cblockchain\u201d is so semantically dispersed as to be undefinable. Definitions need to be specific and useful and also general enough to encompass all of the members of the set. However, these tensions tear \u201cblockchain\u201d apart. It is used too generally to be useful.Instead, disaggregate. Recognize that legislation covering cryptocurrency probably cannot cover security tokens, \u201cutility tokens,\u201d and permissioned blockchains too. Private or enterprise blockchains aren\u2019t just \u201cbitcoin in a suit\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re totally different. The two really have nothing in common.To everyone else: Please join me in spurning the use of \u201cblockchain\u201d at every opportunity. Let\u2019s try and devise new terms that are specific enough to be useful and do justice to their referents. I currently use \u201cpublic blockchain\u201d to describe permissionless, open networks like bitcoin and Ethereum, but I would love to use a different term that doesn\u2019t rely on the b-word. If you do insist on using it, I like Peter Todd\u2019s definition best: \u201cA blockchain is a chain of blocks.\u201dUsing it in a minimalist, direct way removes some of its conceptual weight. This eliminates its ability to implicitly promise amazing consistency, reliability, and uptime. The more honest your definition of \u201cblockchain,\u201d the less it lends itself to exciting press releases. The blockchain, in Todd\u2019s definition, is really just a way to arrange data. And that is supremely unsatisfying given how it\u2019s used today.If you want to read more about disaggregating these systems, I recommend Distributed Ledger Technology Systems: A Conceptual Framework, published by an interdisciplinary set of practitioners and academics under the aegis of the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.I believe that in five or 10 years, we will look back at the popularity of \u201cblockchain\u201d and be slightly embarrassed.Canny readers will notice that I co-founded a firm that invests in blockchain startups. This is true. I am humiliated. But our use of the term is a matter of practical reality. The term has proliferated widely enough to become a Schelling point\u200a\u2014\u200aan easy meeting place where technologists and allocators can communicate. Out of convenience, and so that we are understood, we use the term. But we\u2019d love to abandon it. It encompasses many distinct concepts, some of which we love and some of which we hold in contempt.I believe that in five or 10 years, we will look back at the popularity of \u201cblockchain\u201d and be slightly embarrassed. The term will seem as archaic as \u201csurfing the world wide web\u201d or using the \u201cinformation superhighway.\u201d Consider this an open solicitation for replacements to the term.

Additionally, the Company has added eight new members to its advisory board.GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES CORP. announces that it has incorporated a Cayman-based subsidiary, named Laser Inc., as part of its recently-announced project, the Laser Network (\u201cLaser\u201d). To date, Laser has received considerable attention from throughout the blockchain sector, as well as from the broader technology industry as a SWIFT-like protocol to interconnect thousands of existing blockchain networks, thus allowing inter-chain transactions, and enabling blockchains to operate without borders.The purpose of this subsidiary is to manage the initial servicenode network that underpins Laser\u2019s blockchain network and supports its defining features. The crowdsale will entail an equity sale in the subsidiary Laser Inc., with the network\u2019s proprietary Photon cryptocurrency (\u201cPhotons\u201d) allocated proportionately to equity purchased. A block of 6,300,000 shares will be made available in the crowdsale, with a minimum purchase of 100 shares. Pricing and forms of payment are to be announced.For parties who are interested in operating a servicenode, a minimum of 1,000 shares in Laser Inc. must be purchased. Servicenode operators will each have one vote to accept new members and maintain existing members on Laser. As the servicenode network evolves to become decentralized and anonymous, the requirement for operators to be shareholders will be discontinued, though it will remain a firm requirement in Laser\u2019s initial stages.On completion of the crowdsale, the subsidiary Laser Inc. will become a for-profit consortium with a co-op structure.

SpencerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 12, 2018The blockchain platform with the most utility, developers and the dApp framework that is the most scalable, will win and take over the mantle from Bitcoin, as the heir apparent of blockchain innovation.It would be hard to argue that in 2018, that\u2019s not Ethereum. Its spawned countless ICOs, and has the most developers by far globally working on it. As of October 2017, according to CNBC it had at least 35,000 developers. In 2018, some believe that number is closer now to 200,000. That is according to Kevin Rooke, a cryptocurrency researcher and YouTuber.Ethereum: the Handmaid of DecentralizationFew blockchain projects embody the spirit of decentralization as soundly as Ethereum and Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum is built on a newer generation of blockchain technology and is optimized for software engineers. With advances in sharding and plasma it has a decent chance of overcoming its scalability issues sooner rather than later.A reported 94 out of the top 100 blockchain projects have launched on top of the Ethereum network. Ethereum as of mid 2018 has a market cap of $52.3 billion USD, but that doesn\u2019t properly show its ubiquity as the leading dApp platform for developers and blockchain startups.The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that\u2019s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\u200a\u2014\u200aSatoshi NakamotoEthereum: the Blockchain Platform Devs Want to Work\u00a0OnEthereum\u2019s commitment to a scaling strategy and decentralization, likely most resonates with developers as the first-mover dApp platform of choice. While Bitcoin over the last decade evolved into a digital store of value, it didn\u2019t scale in terms of a payments option for various reasons.However Ethereum has increasingly established itself as the leading decentralized application platform. A landscape of competitors has emerged but without posing any immediate threats to changing this, which include among others: EOS, NEO, Cardano, Stellar, Qtum, ICON and now likely Tron have gained significant market valuation and presence in the global market, with their focus set on decentralized applications.Who will blockchain startups and developers trust?The list of those who are on Ethereum is too long to list, however even the most pragmatic solutions such as $2 billion China-based IoT blockchain network VeChain, exist on the Ethereum network. Tron is migrating to build a competitor to NEO, often referred to as the \u201cEthereum of China\u201d. It\u2019s uncertain if Cardano or EOS will have the technical superiority they claim to threaten Ethereum in the immediate future, or the next few years.You will notice also Ethereum has substantial partnerships with enterprise level companies, including Amazon (AWS) in the cloud.Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly. - Vitalik\u00a0ButerinAs blockchain evolves, how it intersects with the Cloud, and how smart contracts become implicated in services, accessibility, the sharing economy and decentralization of utilities is collectively relevant. A Swiss town will pilot voting on the blockchain using Ethereum-based IDs. All the applications of blockchain on our lives isn\u2019t even fundamentally clear yet, but adoption has accelerated and is accelerating.With it, the interest of software engineers, developers and coders is also at an all-time high. If hacks and BTC manipulation probes devalues Bitcoin\u2019s price, Ethereum is free from being such a pioneer, it can be a first-mover at the intersection of enterprise and decentralization and blockchain startups. While ICO regulatory pressure has decreased their total funding in 2018, if we discount EOS and Telegram which are basically anomalies, Ethereum is pivoting to more practical use-cases.Blockchain may not be the future of business quite like artificial intelligence and the cloud are, but it\u2019s certainly becoming an important protocol with added ROI and obvious benefits.In the concepts of open-source projects and decentralization, developers are attracted to the dynamic innovation of the space. Even Wall Street is seeing an exodus of financial talent teaming up with software engineering to start new exciting projects. It\u2019s not because of crypto, it\u2019s largely because of Ethereum.If ICOs fueled crypto hype in 2017, enterprise adoption of blockchain is changing how we collectively see blockchain tech in 2018. Blockchain is now ahead of quantum computing and super-computing in how this nascent tech is impacting innovation and the variety of new blockchain startups is astounding.The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.\u200a\u2014\u200aSatoshi NakaomotoWhile Bitcoin remains somewhat of a relic and a symbol, Ethereum is dynamic and must evolve to meet the demands of the times and as the dApp platform that\u2019s the current leader.Ideology and Trust Matters to DevelopersVitalik Buterin is also a respected figure whose clear idealism contrats much of the profiteering vibe of other crypto projects and altcoins. Ethereum doesn\u2019t feel like a Microsoft of a Facebook, because of Vitalik\u2019s youth and vision.If we look at Google trends, and eliminate the big three of San Francisco, Seattle and New York, in what U.S. cities do you suppose searches for Ethereum are taking place in the last year?AustinL.ASan DiegoBostonDenverMiamiWashingtonChicagoSo basically a who is where of where young developers are at. That some of the most talented developers and entrepreneurs are attracted to the blockchain space is exciting. However globally, China by far rules the number of Ethereum searches. You must therefore conclude that a lot of important work of blockchain startups is actually occuring in China.In a world of increasing complexity, the blockchain\u2019s biggest unique value proposition may be how to handle and solve the problem of trust, accountability and security at the intersection of myriad industries and their sub-verticals. Let\u2019s be realistic, these issues are intensifying and have a nearly universal application across value chains.As society becomes more and more complex, cheating will in many ways become progressively easier and easier to do and harder to police or even understand.\u200a\u2014\u200aVitalik ButerinYoung people and consumers and citizens require another level of trust in the system, in apps, in services, in government, in politics, in corporate sustainability. Greater decentralization can manifest on the blockchain. Ethereum can be a vehicle for that.Wealthy societies around the world are facing a growing crisis of confidence in established authorities. Stagnating economies, mounting inequality, political corruption and the increasing monopolization of technology for the benefit of elites have provoked a populist backlash.\u200a\u2014\u200aVitalik\u00a0Buterin.The biggest company with a crisis of trust Facebook, has even announced that it will integrate blockchain into its business model. Coinbase is scrambling to secure the popularity of its app and to secure its future viability. Stronger Asian led blockchain and crypto solutions are also inevitable. TRON is exceedingly ambitious, and NEO claims many advantages over Ethereum. China can accelerate blockchain projects and will likely do so immensely in the 2020s. However can they attract developers away from Ethereum\u2019s platform?If Bitcoin is shrouded in controversy, Ethereum is bathed in possibility. In a way they are the Yin and Yang of cryptocurrencies. On a Web 3.0 running smart contracts with 5G, what will be possible? In an IoT of everything, what kinds of blockchain systems will be in place?

Some have compared it to SkyNet, the distributed artificial intelligence of the Terminator movies. Others once suggested the entire thing is a pipe dream. The network has been up for a few months now, and is showing no signs of hostile self-awareness\u200a\u2014\u200aor total collapse.But if you\u2019re not terribly technical, or technical in a different field it\u2019s easy to stare at all this stuff and think \u201cI\u2019ll get around to this later\u201d or decide to ignore it until the Guardian does a nice feature (e.g., Imogen Heap: saviour of the music industry? article).But, in truth, it\u2019s not that difficult to understand Ethereum, blockchains, Bitcoin and all the rest\u200a\u2014\u200aat least the implications for people just going about their daily business, living their lives. Even a programmer who wants a clear picture can get a good enough model of how it all fits together fairly easily. Blockchain explainers usually focus on some very clever low-level details like mining, but that stuff really doesn\u2019t help people (other than implementers) understand what is going on. Rather, let\u2019s look at how the blockchains fit into the more general story about how computers impact society.As is so often the case, to understand the present, we have to start in the past: blockchains are the third act of the play, and we are just at the beginning of that third act. So we must recap.SQL: Yesterday\u2019s best\u00a0ideaThe actual blockchain story starts in the 1970s when the database as we currently know it was created: the relational model, SQL, big racks of spinning tape drives, all of that stuff. If you\u2019re imagining big white rooms with expensive beige monoliths watched over by men in ties, you\u2019re in the right corner of history. In the age of Big Iron, big organizations paid big bucks to IBM and the rest for big databases and put all their most precious data assets in these systems: their institutional memory and customer relationships. The SQL language which powers the vast majority of the content management systems which run the web was originally a command language for tape drives. Fixed field lengths\u200a\u2014\u200aa bit like the 140 character limit on tweets\u200a\u2014\u200aoriginally served to let impatient programs fast forward tapes a known distance at super high speed to put the tape head exactly where the next record would begin. This was all going on round about the time I was born\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s history, but it\u2019s not yet ancient history.At a higher, more semantic level, a subtle distortion in how we perceive reality took hold: things that were hard to represent in databases became alternately devalued and fetishized. Years passed as people struggled to get the real world into databases using knowledge management, the semantic web, and many other abstractions. Not everything fit, but we ran society on these tools anyway. The things which did not fit cleanly in databases got marginalized, and life went on. Once in awhile a technical counter-current would take hold and try to push back on the tyranny of the database, but the general trend held firm: if it does not fit in the database, it does not exist.You may not think you know this world of databases, but you live in it. Every time you see a paper form with squares indicating one letter per box, you are interacting with a database. Every time you use a web site, there\u2019s a database (or more likely an entire mess of them) lurking just under the surface. Amazon, Facebook, all of that\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s all databases. Every time a customer service assistant shrugs and says \u201ccomputer says no\u201d or an organization acts in crazy, inflexible ways, odds-are there\u2019s a database underneath which has a limited, rigid view of reality and it\u2019s simply too expensive to fix the software to make the organization more intelligent. We live in these boxes, as pervasive as oxygen, and as inflexible as punched cards.Documents and the World Wide\u00a0WebThe second act is started by the arrival of Tim Berners-Lee and the advent of the web. It actually starts just a hair before his arrival. In the late 1980s and early 1990s we get serious about computer networking. Protocols like Telnet, Gopher, Usenet and Email itself provide a user interface to the spanning arcs of the early internet, but it\u2019s not until the 1990s we get mass adoption of networked computers, leading incrementally to me typing this on Google Docs, and you reading it in a web browser. This process of joining the dots\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cthe network is the computer\u201d as Sun Microsystems used to say)\u200a\u2014\u200awas fast. In the early 1990s, vast numbers of machines already existed, but they were largely stand-alone devices, or connected to a few hundred machines on a university campus without much of a window into the outside world. The software and hardware to do networking everywhere\u200a\u2014\u200athe network of networks, the internet\u200a\u2014\u200atook a long time to create, and then spread like wildfire. The small pieces became loosely joined, then tightly coupled into the network we know today. We are still riding the technological wave as the network gets smarter, smaller and cheaper and starts showing up in things like our lightbulbs under names like \u201cthe Internet of Things.\u201dBureaucracy and\u00a0machinesBut the databases and the networks never really learn to get on. The Big Iron in the machine rooms and the myriads of tiny little personal computers scattered over the internet like dew on a cobweb could not find a common world-model which allowed them to interoperate smoothly. Interacting with a single database is easy enough: forms and web applications of the kinds you use every day. But the hard problem is getting databases working together, invisibly, for our benefit, or getting the databases to interact smoothly with processes running on our own laptops.Those technical problems are usually masked by bureaucracy, but we experience their impact every single day of our lives. It\u2019s the devil\u2019s own job getting two large organizations working together on your behalf, and deep down, that\u2019s a software issue. Perhaps you want your car insurance company to get access to a police report about your car getting broken into. In all probability you will have to get the data out of one database in the form of a handful of printouts, and then mail them to the company yourself: there\u2019s no real connectivity in the systems. You can\u2019t drive the process from your laptop, except by the dumb process of filling in forms. There\u2019s no sense of using real computers to do things, only computers abused as expensive paper simulators. Although in theory information could just flow from one database to another with your permission, in practice the technical costs of connecting databases are huge, and your computer doesn\u2019t store your data so it can do all this work for you. Instead it\u2019s just something you fill in forms on. Why are we under-utilizing all this potential so badly?The Philosophy of\u00a0DataThe answer, as always, is in our own heads. The organizational assumptions about the world which are baked into computer systems are almost impossible to translate. The human factors\u200a\u2014\u200athe mindsets which generate the software\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t fit together. Each enterprise builds their computer system in their own image, and these images disagree about what is vital and what is incidental, and truth does not flow between them easily. When we need to translate from one world model to another, we put humans in the process, and we\u2019re back to processes which mirror filling in paper forms rather than genuinely digital cooperation. The result is a world in which all of our institutions seem to be at sixes and sevens, never quite on the same page, and things that we need in our ordinary lives seem to keep falling between the cracks, and every process requires filling in the same damn name and address data, twenty times a day, and more often if you are moving house. How often do you shop from Amazon rather than some more specialized store just because they know where you live?There are lots of other factors that maintain the gap between the theoretical potential of our computers and our everyday use of the\u200a\u2014\u200atechnological acceleration, constant change, the sheer expense of writing software. But it all boils down to mindset in the end. Although it looks like ones and zeros, software \u201carchitects\u201d are swinging around budgets you could use to build a skyscraper, and changing something late into a project like that has similar costs to tearing down a half-made building. Rows upon rows upon rows of expensive engineers throwing away months (or years) of work: the software freezes in place, and the world moves on. Everything is always slightly broken.Over and over again, we go back to paper and metaphors from the age of paper because we cannot get the software right, and the core to that problem is that we managed to network the computers in the 1990s, but we never did figure out how to really network the databases and get them all working together.There are three classic models for how people try and get their networks and databases working together smoothly.First Paradigm: the diverse peers\u00a0modelThe first approach is just to directly connect machines together, and work out the lumps as you go. You take Machine A, connect it over a network to Machine B, and fire transactions down the wire. In theory, Machine B catches them, writes them into its own database, and the job is good. In practice, there are a few problems here.The epistemological problem is quite severe. Databases, as commonly deployed in our organizations, store fact. If the database says the stock level is 31 units, that\u2019s the truth for the whole of the organization, except perhaps for the guy who goes down to the shelf and counts them, finds the real count is 29, and puts that in the database as a correction. The database is institutional reality.But when data leaves one database and flows into another, it crosses an organizational boundary. For Organization A, the contents of Database A are operationally reality, true until proven otherwise. But for Organization B, the communique is a statement of opinion. Consider an order: the order is a request, but it does not become a confirmed fact until after the payment clears past the point of a chargeback. A company may believe an order has occurred, but this is a speculation about someone else\u2019s intentions until cold hard cash (or bitcoin) clears all doubts. Up until that point, an \u201cordered in error\u201d signal can reset the whole process. An order exists as a hypotheses until a cash payment clears it from the speculative buffer it lives in and places it firmly in the fixed past as a matter of factual record: this order existed, was shipped, was accepted, and we were paid for it.But until then, the order is just a speculation.The shifting significance of a simple request for new paint brushes flowing from one organization to another, a statement of intention clearing into a statement of fact, is not something we would normally think about closely. But when we start to consider how much of the world, of our lives, run on systems that work much like this\u200a\u2014\u200afood supply chains, electrical grids, tax, education, medical systems, it\u2019s odd that these systems don\u2019t come to our notice more often.In fact, we only notice them when something goes wrong.The second problem with peer connection is the sheer instability of each peer connection. A little change to the software on one end or the other, and bugs are introduced. Subtle bugs which may not become visible until the data transferred has wormed its way deep into Organization B\u2019s internal records. A typical instance: an order was always placed in lots of 12, and processed as one box. But for some reason, one day an order is placed for 13, and somewhere far inside of Organization B, a stock handling spreadsheet crashes. There\u2019s no way to ship 1.083 of a box, and The Machine Stops.This instability is compounded by another factor: the need to translate the philosophical assumptions\u200a\u2014\u200ain fact, the corporate epistemology, of one organization into another organization\u2019s private internal language. Say we are discussing booking a hotel and car rental as a single action: the hotel wants to think of customers as credit card numbers, but the car rental office wants to think of customers as driving licenses. A small error results in customer misidentification, comedy as customers are mistakenly asked for their driving license numbers to confirm hotel room bookings\u200a\u2014\u200abut all anybody knows of the error is \u201ccomputer says no\u201d when customers read back their credit card details with no idea that the computer now wants something else.If you think this is a silly example, the Mars Climate Orbiter was lost by NASA in 1999 because one team was using inches, and the other, centimeters. These things go wrong all the time.But over a wire, between two commercial organizations, one can\u2019t simply look at the other guy\u2019s source code to figure out the error. Every time two organizations meet and want to automate their back end connections, all these issues have to be hashed out by hand. It\u2019s difficult, and expensive, and error prone enough that in practice companies would often rather use fax machines. This is absurd, but this is how the world really works today.Of course, there are attempts to clarify this mess\u200a\u2014\u200ato introduce standards and code reusability to help streamline these operations and make business interoperability a fact. You can choose from EDI, XMI-EDI, JSON, SOAP, XML-RPC, JSON-RPC, WSDL and half a dozen more standards to assist your integration processes.Needless to say, the reason there are so many standards is because none of them work properly.Finally, there is the problem of scaling collaboration. Say that two of us have paid the upfront costs of collaboration and have achieved seamless technical harmony, and now a third partner joins our union. And now a fourth, and a fifth. By five partners, we have 13 connections to debug. Six, seven\u2026 by ten the number is 45. The cost of collaboration keeps going up for each new partner as they join our network, and the result is small pools of collaboration which just will not grow.Remember, this isn\u2019t just an abstract problem\u200a\u2014\u200athis is banking, this is finance, medicine, electrical grids, food supplies, and the government.Our computers are a mess.Hub and Spoke: meet the new\u00a0bossOne common answer to this quandary is to cut through the exponential (well, quadratic) complexity of writing software to directly connect peers, and simply put somebody in charge. There are basically two approaches to this problem.The first is that we pick an organization\u200a\u2014\u200aVISA would be typical\u200a\u2014\u200aand all agree that we will connect to VISA using their standard interface. Each organization has to get just a single connector right, and VISA takes 1% off the top, and makes sure that everything clears properly.There are a few problems with this approach, but they can be summarized with the term \u201cnatural monopoly.\u201d The business of being a hub or a platform for others is quite literally a license to print money for anybody that achieves incumbent status in such a position. Political power in the form of setting terms of service and negotiating with regulators can be exerted, and over all an arrangement that might have started with an effort to create a neutral backbone rapidly turns into being clients of an all-powerful behemoth without which one simply cannot do business.This pattern recurs again and again in different industries, at different levels of complexity and scale, from railroads and fibre optics and runway allocation in airports through to liquidity management in financial institutions.In the database context, there is a subtle form of the problem: platform economics. If the \u201chub and spoke\u201d model is that everybody runs Oracle or Windows Servers or some other such system, and then relies on these boxes to connect to each-other flawlessly because, after all, they are clone-like peas in a pod, we have the same basic economic proposition as before: to be a member of the network, you rely on an intermediary who charges whatever they like for the privilege of your membership, with this tax disguised as a technical cost.VISA gets 1% or more of a very sizeable fraction of the world\u2019s transactions with this game. If you ever wonder what the economic upside of the blockchain business might be, just have a think about how big that number is.Protocols\u200a\u2014\u200aif you can find\u00a0themThe protocol is the ultimate \u201cunicorn.\u201d Not a company that is worth a billion dollars two years after it was founded, but an idea so good that it gets people to stop arguing about how to do things, and just get on with it and do them.The internet runs on a handful of these things: Sir Tim Berners Lee\u2019s HTTP and HTML standards have worked like magic, although of course he simply lit the fire and endless numbers of technologists gave us the wondrous mess we know and love now. SMTP, POP and IMAP power our email. BGP sorts out our big routers. There are a few dozen more, increasingly esoteric, which run most of the open systems we have.A common complaint about tools like Gchat or Slack is that they do jobs which have perfectly great open protocols in play (IRC or XMPP) but do not actually speak those protocols. The result is that there is no way to interoperate between Slack and IRC or Skype or anything else, without going through hacked together gateways that may or may not offer solid system performance. The result is a degradation of the technical ecosystem into a series of walled gardens, owned by different companies, and subject to the whims of the market.Imagine how much WikiPedia would suck by now if it was a start up pushing hard to monetize its user base and make its investors their money back.But when the protocol gambit works, what\u2019s created is huge genuine wealth\u200a\u2014\u200anot money, but actual wealth\u200a\u2014\u200aas the world is improved by things that just work together nicely. Of course, SOAP and JSON-RPC and all the rest aspire to support the formation of protocols, or even to be protocols, but the definitional semantics of each field of endeavor tend to create an inherent complexity which leads back towards hub and spoke or other models.Blockchains\u200a\u2014\u200aa fourth\u00a0way?You\u2019ve heard people talking about bitcoin. Missionary chaps in pubs absolutely sure that something fundamental has changed, throwing around terms like \u201cCentral Bank of the Internet\u201d and discussing the end of the nation state. Sharply dressed women on podcasts talking about the amazing future potential. But what\u2019s actually underneath all this? What is the technology, separated from the politics and the future potential?What\u2019s underneath it is an alternative to getting databases synchronized by printing out wads of paper and walking it around. Let\u2019s think about paper cash for a moment: I take a wad of paper from one bank to another, and the value moves from one bank account\u200a\u2014\u200aone computer system\u200a\u2014\u200ato another. Computer as paper simulator, once again. Bitcoin simply takes a paper-based process, the fundamental representation of cash, and replaces it with a digital system: digital cash. In this sense, you could see bitcoin as just another paper simulator, but it\u2019s not.Bitcoin took the paper out of that system, and replaced it with a stable agreement (\u201cconsensus\u201d) between all the computers in the bitcoin network about the current value of all the accounts involved in a transaction. It did this with a genuinely protocol-style solution: there\u2019s no middleman extracting rents, and no exponential system complexity from a myriad of different connectors. The blockchain architecture is essentially a protocol which works as well as hub-and-spoke for getting things done, but without the liability of a trusted third party in the center which might choose to extract economic rents. This is really a good, good thing. The system has some magic properties\u200a\u2014\u200asame agreed data on all nodes, eventually\u200a\u2014\u200awhich go beyond paper and beyond databases. We call it \u201cdistributed consensus\u201d but that\u2019s just a fancy way of saying that everybody agrees, in the end, about what truth (in your bank balance, in your contracts) is.This is kind of a big deal.In fact, it breaks with 40 years of experience of connecting computers together to do things. As a fundamental technique, blockchains are new. And in this branch of technology, genuinely new ideas move billions of dollars and set the direction of industries for decades. They are rare.Bitcoin lets you move value from one account to another without having to move either cash or go through the baroque wire transfer processes that banks use to shuffle numbers because the underlying database technology is new, modern and better: better services through better technology. Just like cash it is anonymous and decentralized, and bitcoin bakes in some monetary policy and issues the cash itself: a \u201cdecentralized bank.\u201d A central bank of the internet, if you will.Once you think of cash as a special kind of form, and cash transactions as paper shuffling to move stuff around in databases, it\u2019s pretty easy to see bitcoin clearly.It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that Bitcoin has stated us on the way out of a 40 year deep hole created by the limits of our database technology. Whether it can effect real change at a fiscal level remains to be seen.Ok, so what about Ethereum?Ethereum takes this \u201cbeyond the paper metaphor\u201d approach to getting databases to work together even further than bitcoin. Rather than replacing cash, Ethereum presents a new model, a fourth way. You push the data into Ethereum, it\u2019s bound permanently in public storage (the \u201cblockchain\u201d). All the organizations that need to access that information\u200a\u2014\u200afrom your cousin to your government\u200a\u2014\u200acan see it. Ethereum seeks to replace all the other places where you have to fill in forms to get computers to work together. This might seem a little odd at first\u200a\u2014\u200aafter all, you don\u2019t want your health records in such a system\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s right, you don\u2019t. If you were going to store health records online, you\u2019d need to protect them with an additional layer of encryption to ensure they couldn\u2019t be read\u200a\u2014\u200aand we should be doing this anyway. It\u2019s not common practice to apply appropriate encryption to private data, that\u2019s why you keep hearing about these enormous hacks and leaks.So what kinds of things would you like as public data? Let\u2019s start with some obvious things: your domain names. You own a domain name for your business, and people need to know that your business owns that domain name\u200a\u2014\u200anot somebody else. That unique system of names is how we navigate the internet as a whole: that\u2019s a clear example of something we want in a permanent public database. We\u2019d also like it if governments didn\u2019t keep editing those public records and taking domains offline based on their local laws: if the internet is a global public good, it\u2019s annoying to have governments constantly poking holes in it by censoring things they don\u2019t like.Crowdfunding as a test\u00a0bedAnother good example is crowdfunding for projects, as done by places like KickStarter, IndieGoGo and so on. In these systems, somebody puts a project online and gather funds, and there\u2019s a public record of how much funding has flown in. If it\u2019s over a certain number, the project goes live\u200a\u2014\u200aand we\u2019d like them to document what they did with the money. This is a very important step: we want them to be accountable for the funds they have taken in, and if the funds aren\u2019t sufficient, we want them returned where they came from. We have a global public good, the ability for people to organize and fund projects together. Transparency really helps, so this is a natural place for a blockchain.So let\u2019s think about the crowdfunding example in more detail. In a sense, giving money to a crowdfunding project is a simple contract:If the account balance is greater than $10000 then fund the project, and if I contributed more than $50, send me a t-shirt. Otherwise, return all the money.expressed as let\u2019s pretend code, that might be:See an actual example at https://ethereum.org/crowdsaleIf you represent this simple agreement as actual detailed code, you get something like this. This is a simple example of a Smart Contract, and smart contracts are one of the most powerful aspects of the Ethereum system.Crowdfunding potentially gives us access to risk capital backed by deep technical intelligence, and invested to create real political change. If, say, Elon Musk could access the capital reserves of everybody who believes in what he is doing, painlessly selling (say) shares in a future Mars City, would that be good or bad for the future of humanity?Building the mechanisms to enable this kind of mass collective action might be critical to our future. (e.g. See Coase\u2019s Blockchain youtube video)Smart ContractsThe implementation layer of all these fancy dreams is pretty simple: a smart contract envisages taking certain kinds of simple paper agreements and representing them as software. You can\u2019t easily imagine doing this for house painting\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cis the house painted properly?\u201d is not something a computer can do\u200a\u2014\u200ayet. But for contracts which are mainly about digital things\u200a\u2014\u200athink cell phone contracts or airline tickets or similar, which rely on computers to provide service or send you an e-ticket\u200a\u2014\u200asoftware already represents these contracts pretty well in nearly all cases. Very occasionally something goes wrong and all the legalese in English gets activated, and a human judge gets involved in a lawsuit, but that\u2019s a very rare exception indeed. Mostly we deal with web sites, and show the people in the system who help us (like airline gate staff) proof that we\u2019ve completed the transaction with the computers, for example by showing them our boarding passes. We go about our business by filling in some forms and computers go out and sort it all out for us, no humans required except when something goes wrong.To make that all possible today, companies offering those kinds of services maintain their own technical infrastructure\u200a\u2014\u200adotcom money pays for fleets of engineers and server farms and physical security around these assets. You can buy off-the-shelf services from people that will set you up an e-commerce website or some other simple case, but basically this kind of sophistication is the domain of the big companies because of all the overheads and technical skill you need before you can have a computer system take money and offer services.It\u2019s just hard and expensive. If you are starting a bank or a new airline, software is a very significant part of your budget, and hiring a technical team is a major part of your staffing challenge.Smart Contracts & the World\u00a0ComputerSo what Ethereum offers is a \u201csmart contract platform\u201d which takes a lot of that expensive, difficult stuff and automates it. It\u2019s early days yet, so we can\u2019t do everything, but we are seeing a surprising amount of capability even from the first version of the world\u2019s first generally available smart contract platform.So how does a smart contract platform work? Just like bitcoin, lots and lots of people run the software, and get a few tokens (ether) for doing it. Those computers in the network all work together and share a common database, called the blockchain. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain stores financial transactions. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain stores smart contracts. You don\u2019t rent space in a data center and hire a bunch of system administrators. Rather, you use the shared global resource, the \u201cworld computer\u201d and the resources you put into the system go to the people whose computers make up this global resource. The system is fair and equitable.Ethereum is open source software, and the Ethereum team maintain it (increasingly with help from lots of independent contributors and other companies too.) Most of the web runs on open source software produced and maintained by similar teams: we know that open source software is a good way to produce and maintain global infrastructure. This makes sure that there\u2019s no centralized body which can use its market power to do things like jack up the transaction fees to make big profits: open source software (and its slightly more puritan cousin, Free Software) help keep these global public goods free and equitable for everybodyThe smart contracts themselves, which run on the Ethereum platform, are written in simple languages: not hard to learn for working programmers. There\u2019s a learning curve, but it\u2019s not different from things that working professionals do every few years as a matter of course. Smart contracts are typically short: 500 lines would be long. But because they leverage the huge power of cryptography and blockchains, because they operate across organizations and between individuals, there is enormous power in even relatively short programs.So what do we mean by world computer? In essence, Ethereum simulates a perfect machine\u200a\u2014\u200aa thing which could never exist in nature because of the laws of physics, but which can be simulated by a large enough computer network. The network\u2019s size isn\u2019t there to produce the fastest possible computer (although that may come later with blockchain scaling) but to produce a universal computer which is accessible from anywhere by anybody, and (critically!) which always gives the same results to everybody. It\u2019s a global resource which stores answers and cannot be subverted, denied or censored (See From Cyperpunks to Blockchains video on youtube).We think this is kind of a big deal.A smart contract can store records on who owns what. It can store promises to pay, and promises to deliver without having middleman or exposing people to the risk of fraud. It can automatically move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past, like a will or a futures contract. For pure digital assets there is no \u201ccounterparty risk\u201d because the value to be transferred can be locked into the contract when it is created, and released automatically when the conditions and terms are met: if the contract is clear, then fraud is impossible, because the program actually has real control of the assets involved rather than requiring trustworthy middle men like ATM machines or car rental agents.And this system runs globally, with tens and eventually hundreds of thousands of computers sharing the workload and, more importantly, backing up the cultural memory of who promised what to whom. Yes, fraud is still possible, at the edge of the digitial, but many kinds of outright banditry are likely to simply die out: you can check the blockchain and find out if the house has been sold twice, for example. Who really owns this bridge in Brooklyn? What happens if this loan defaults? All there, as clear as crystal, in a single shared global blockchain. That\u2019s the plan, anyway.Democratized access to the state of the\u00a0artAll of this potentially takes the full power of modern technology and puts it into the hands of programmers who are working in an environment not much more complex than coding web sites. These simple programs are running on enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. That creates markets, registries like domain names, and many other things that we do not currently understand because they have not been built yet. When the web was invented to make it easy to publish documents for other people to see, nobody would have guessed it would revolutionize every industry it touched, and change people\u2019s personal lives through social networks, dating sites, and online education. Nobody would have guessed that Amazon could one day be bigger than Wal-Mart. It\u2019s impossible to say for sure where smart contracts will go, but it\u2019s hard not to look at the web, and dream.Although an awful lot of esoteric computer science was required to create a programming environment that would let relatively ordinary web skills move around property inside of a secure global ecosystem, that work has been done. Although Ethereum is not yet a cakewalk to program, that\u2019s largely an issue of documentation, training, and the gradual maturation of a technical ecosystem. The languages are written and are good: the debuggers take more time. But the heinous complexity of programming your own smart contract infrastructure is gone: smart contracts themselves are simpler than modern JavaScript, and nothing a web programmer will be scared of. The result is that we expect these tools to be everywhere fairly soon, as people start to want new services, and teams form to deliver them.The Future?I am excited precisely because we do not know what we have created, and more importantly, what you and your friends will create with it. My belief is that terms like \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d and \u201cWeb 3.0\u201d will be inadequate\u200a\u2014\u200ait will be a new thing, with new ideas and new culture embedded in a new software platform. Each new medium changes the message: blogging brought long form writing back, and then twitter created an environment where brevity was not only the soul of wit, but by necessity its body also. Now we can represent simple agreements as free speech, as publication of an idea, and who knows where this leads.Ethereum Frontier is a first step: it\u2019s a platform for programmers to build services you might access through a web browser or a phone app. Later we\u2019ll release Ethereum Metropolis, which will be a web browser like program, currently called Mist, which takes all the security and cryptography inherent in Ethereum and packages it nicely with a user interface that anybody can use. The recent releases of Mist showcase a secure wallet, and that\u2019s just the start. The security offered by Mist is far stronger than current e-commerce systems and phone apps have. In the medium term, contract production systems will be stand-alone, so nearly anybody can download a \u201cdistributed application builder\u201d and load it up with their content and ideas and upload it\u200a\u2014\u200afor simple things, no code will be required, but the full underlying power of the network will be available. Think along the lines of an installation wizard, but instead of setting up your printer, you are configuring the terms of a smart contract for a loan: how much money, how long, what repayment rates.

In a little while\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re talking a year or two\u200a\u2014\u200aEthereum Serenity will take the network to a whole new level. Right now, adding more computers to the Ethereum network makes it more secure, but not faster. We manage the limited speed of the network using Ether, a token which gives priority on the network etc. In the Serenity system, adding more computers to the network makes it faster, and this will finally allow us to build systems which really are internet scale: hundreds of millions of computers working together to do jobs we collectively need done. Today we might guess at protein folding or genomics or AI, but who\u2019s to say what uses will be found for such brilliant software.I hope this non-technical primer on the Ethereum ecosystem has been useful, and as soon as we have a user friendly version of the system available for general use, you\u2019ll be the first to know!If you are interested in learning more about Ethereum, you should come to https://devcon.ethereum.org in London on November 9th.byVinay Gupta@leashlessConsenSysLayout by Eva Shon, along with icons from thenounproject.com", "responses": "55"}, {"title": "Understanding Blockchain Fundamentals, Part 1: Byzantine Fault Tolerance", "author_name": "Georgios Konstantopoulos", "link": "https://medium.com/loom-network/understanding-blockchain-fundamentals-part-1-byzantine-fault-tolerance-245f46fe8419?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 30, 2017", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "7.2K", "content": "Understanding Blockchain Fundamentals, Part 1: Byzantine Fault ToleranceGeorgios KonstantopoulosBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 30, 2017Articles in this Understanding Blockchain Fundamentals series:Part 1: Byzantine Fault Tolerance \ud83d\udc48Part 2: Proof of Work & Proof of StakePart 3: Delegated Proof of Stake", "responses": "14"}, {"title": "Creator.ai \u2014the World\u2019s First Content Creation Protocol on Blockchain", "author_name": "Creator.ai", "link": "https://medium.com/@creatorai/creator-ai-the-worlds-first-content-creation-protocol-on-blockchain-a96399cc2003?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 4, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "4K", "content": "Creator.ai \u2014the World\u2019s First Content Creation Protocol on BlockchainCreator.aiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 4, 2017We are happy to announce that the world\u2019s first content creation protocol on blockchain is on its way to become a real platform!\u00a0.How the idea was born?

What was once science fiction has now finally become reality, and when paired with blockchain technology it is no surprise that AI is making leaps and bounds. But the question that always comes to mind when a new technology comes to light is \u201cCan I make money on it?\u201d When looking at blockchain technology infused with artificial intelligence, the answer could be positive indeed!Thanks to agency.howtotoken.com for support in creating this topic (First platform with proven ICO contractors)Why bother combining AI and blockchains?You\u2019ve probably heard about world chess champions losing to computers, or perhaps you\u2019re familiar with self-driving cars\u200a\u2014\u200aboth of these examples are fueled by artificial intelligence. We create AI to enable computers to solve problems for themselves, essentially giving them the ability to write code in response to new problems they encounter. When paired with blockchains, AI is able to be better understood by humans, operate more efficiently, and make blockchains in general more efficient.In order for machines to learn, they need massive amounts of data to analyze, just like humans. The difference is that humans analyze their data passively, we use our five senses to take in the world and we store it away to create our belief in how the world functions. Trent McConaghy explains in his article on Medium, \u201cBecause blockchains introduced three new characteristics:decentralized/shared controlimmutable/audit trailsnative assets/exchanges.People inspired by Bitcoin were happy to overlook the traditional database-centric shortcomings, because these new benefits had potential to impact industries and society at large in wholly new ways.\u201d He continues by adding, \u201cThese three new \u2018blockchain\u2019 database characteristics are also potentially interesting for AI applications.\u201dRemember, machines don\u2019t have senses, they need data, and blockchains can help them acquire that data faster and more cleanly (thanks to decentralization/shared control). Some AI may learn better than others, and by sharing IP/testing models on an exchange, there is the potential for faster growth (and profit for developers). Once AI starts learning, it becomes far easier for us to trace the path it took to a solution if that path is stored on an immutable trail. Considering that one of the primary reasons we are creating AI in the first place is to make the lives of humans easier, one such obvious avenue is being explored by using AI and the blockchain to create both active and passive income streams.What exactly are we doing with AI + Blockchain?Blockchain technology provides users with the ability to create a trustless system on which they can run smart contracts, track a ledger, and more. AI and machine learning allows for hands-off programs that are designed to become smarter and more efficient over time. As Tshilidzi Marwala and Bo Xing explain in their University of Johannesburg paper, there are eight key ways where AI can help blockchains; four of which are pertinent to our discussion:\u201cScalability\u200a\u2014\u200aAI can perform collaborative learning without a centralized dataset.Security\u200a\u2014\u200aAI can detect blockchain application layer intrusion issues.Privacy\u200a\u2014\u200aAI can improve the performance of hash functions.Efficiency\u200a\u2014\u200aAI can predict the likelihood of a node to fulfill certain mining tasks.\u201dIt\u2019s obvious to see how much of an impact AI will have on blockchains, and companies that are getting a headstart in the industry will almost certainly benefit greatly from such foresight. From increased scalability, enhanced security/privacy, and greater efficiency, AI will make it cheaper, safer, and easier to operate blockchains in general. There is a collection of examples where we can currently see AI and the blockchain working together on specific problems, such as:Cryptocurrency TradingTrading cryptocurrencies is a risky market in the same way that the stock market can be dangerous, and one of the worst ways to increase this danger is by involving emotions. If the market starts crashing you may have a panic attack and quickly sell, only to watch the market bounce back higher than it ever was, leaving you at a loss. One simple way to prevent these emotional mistakes is by using an AI-based cryptobot to trade for you, such as Cryptohopper or Autonio. Crypto bots are built on four principles: algorithms, market prediction, stop losses, and AI. Through these companies it is common for users to subscribe to \u201csignals,\u201d or external services that provide trading strategies based on the data they\u2019ve collected and analyzed using AI. If the average trader removes themselves (and their emotions) from the equation, and instead base their trading on strategies generated by artificial intelligence, they are far more likely to succeed.Music StreamingAs we\u2019ve mentioned before in a different article, musicians in today\u2019s market struggle to earn their keep. Musiclife is a company that is working hard to change that by using blockchain technology infused with artificial intelligence. On the Musiclife platform, artists are automatically paid through smart contracts every time their music is streamed. This alone helps to ensure that the artists make more money for their work compared to traditional streaming platforms. But the real kicker here is Musiclife\u2019s pricing model. Using an AI pricing method, the music price through the platform automatically adjusts based on current market playback data, so the more popular a song is the more money the artist will make.Given the potential of the AI + blockchain music streaming industry, it comes as no surprise to see big names like Spotify throwing their hat into the ring and buying Niland, a startup focused on using AI for user-preference predictions.For those of us that aren\u2019t musicians or professional cryptocurrency traders, however, these technologies may feel a bit detached from our daily lives. Luckily, there is a third option for making money in this industry, both during our lives and even potentially long after we\u2019ve passed.Creating an Avatar-based LegacyA legacy used to be something that only the rich and powerful could afford to think about, but as decentralization technology helps to disrupt the status quo the possibility of creating lasting change is opening up to everyone. Whether your goal is to provide for your family after your death, or to have the work you\u2019ve dedicated your life to carry on after your passing, avatars may be what you seek. Created by EverLife, avatars are created using a combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology that gives you a platform where you can create your digital legacy. By harnessing a combination of machine learning, smart contracts, teachable skills, and secure avatar-to-avatar communications, there are a few key things you can do with your avatar:Passive income\u200a\u2014\u200aAvatars can be taught to perform specific tasks (that will earn you EVER tokens), to trade cryptocurrencies using your trading strategies (utilizing potential Skills Marketplace features), and to even seek new skills and tasks to add to their repertoire.Personal legacy\u200a\u2014\u200aYour avatar can interview you, recording your answers while compiling the story of your life in order to give future generations of your family the chance to interact with you (through your avatar) long after you\u2019ve died.When creating avatars, EverLife chose to implement AI into their systems to ensure growth and that expansion would continue long after user input ceased. They understood that blockchains alone wouldn\u2019t be sufficient, which is the same conclusion that Tshilidzi Marwala and Bo Xing come to: \u201cThe DNA of the 4IR (Industrial Revolution) is AI, while blockchain represents one of the most disruptive technologies that may transform the whole economic system. Though blockchain holds various promises, this technology is still in its infancy.\u201c What EverLife, Marwala, and Xing are saying is that although the blockchain may be a groundbreaking technology, only by intertwining it with artificial intelligence will we truly see its full potential.What the future\u00a0holds\u2026As Matt Turck points out in his article, the last 15 years was defined by social, mobile, and cloud-based services. Turck then goes on to say that \u201c[t]here\u2019s a rationale for making the argument that AI, the blockchain, and the Internet of Things is the new social, mobile, and cloud. Those trends are still very much emerging, but their potential impact is massive.\u201d In the same way that social, mobile, and cloud development spawned many huge companies that exist today (Spotify, Airbnb, Twitter, Facebook, Uber, etc), one could speculate that the next 10\u201315 years will see a surplus of AI, blockchain, and IoT-based companies succeeding.Will our lives benefit from this? The better question would be to ask if our lives benefitted from all of the companies created during the last 10\u201315 years. We find ourselves currently standing on the precipice of change\u200a\u2014\u200aa shift in the major industries is coming before us that has the potential of leading to sweeping innovations across a wide spectrum of our lives. The only question left is whether or not you, the average crypto-enthusiast, will seize the opportunity to make a profit during these changing times.About the\u00a0author:Kirill Shilov\u200a\u2014\u200aFounder of Geekforge.io and Howtotoken.com.

Every day, we\u2019re learning new ways how we can integrate blockchain technology into contemporary society, making it easier and safer for businesses to send and receive money across the world. But in spite of all of this, blockchain still faces a huge obstacle in its path: its reputation.Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Why Onboarding Investors Is a ChallengeSince its inception, the blockchain community has struggled to shake its lawless image. Between 2011 and 2013, Bitcoin was used to buy and sell illegal goods online. And while facilitating illegal transactions is not what Bitcoin was designed for, the uninformed public still associated the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency with the black market.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The unfortunate truth is that the actions of a few have tarnished the image of cryptocurrency, causing uninformed members of the public to view blockchain technology as dishonest or illegal. Some examples of this that have drawn public attention include:The Bitconnect Crash: A Ponzi scheme marketed as a lending service, Bitconnect went from being worth $2 billion in market value to a total value of $9,200 as it quietly decided to shut down\u200a\u2014\u200awiping out life savings for some investors.The BTC Global Scam: Nearly 30,000 people, mostly from South Africa, Australia, and the United States, were scammed out of $50 million by scammers pretending to be an investment management company.ICO Scams: There have even been a few cases of fake businesses taking the time to build legitimate websites, create fake employee profiles, and establish an active presence on the internet, all so they can give the appearance of being a legitimate blockchain project so they can attract investors. After their ICO, they vanish without a trace\u200a\u2014\u200ataking investors\u2019 money with them.And those are just some of the more publicized scams. There are countless scammers on Twitter, as well as chat apps like Telegram and Twitter, who claim to be blockchain developers who promise you thousands of dollars of free cryptocurrency as long as you send them a small investment of $200 or $300 beforehand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These scams have become so prominent that Ethereum cofounder, Vitalik Buterin, has addressed the concern on Twitter countless times and has even changed his profile name to \u201cVitalik \u2018Not giving away ETH\u2019 Buterin\u201d as a reminder to people that anyone that the real Vitalik Buterin will never ask for donations in exchange for Ethereum.Cryptocurrency and VolatilityAlong with scams and Ponzi schemes, hints of insider trading and market manipulation have scared away many traditional investors who fear the risk of investing in blockchain projects isn\u2019t worth the reward.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Generally speaking, there has always been a higher level of volatility in crypto markets. But with recent talks of cracking down on exchanges in China and South Korea, as well as SEC probes into ICOs in the United States, cryptocurrencies have been especially volatile, with the overall market losing nearly $110-billon in just one day in January.Shifting the Focus from Investors to EntrepreneursThe problem with the current business model commonly used in blockchain projects is that it focuses on investors who\u2019re already involved in cryptocurrency. And many of these crypto investors aren\u2019t interested in what these projects can do, but rather how much money they can make buying and selling coins and tokens.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SuchApp believes that the future success of blockchain requires onboarding the people who stand to benefit the most from the various projects. For this reason, they have played a big role in promoting their services to entrepreneurs and traditional business investors that stand to gain the most from its services.Exclusive Country-Based RevenueOne of SuchApp\u2019s most successful strategies targeting investors outside of cryptocurrency has been its Exclusive License Program. This program grants one investor from each country 100% of all platform revenue generated in-country from:Advertisements.Group name purchases.Sponsorship agreements.4K media.The license runs for a year and can be renewed upon its expiration. Currently, entrepreneurs from all participating African countries and the UK have already been issued exclusive licenses.Premium Group\u00a0NamesSuchApp\u2019s premium group names allow businesses to establish themselves on the platform.

I know! Let\u2019s start by the most obvious\u200a\u2014\u200ablockchain! What the hell is a \u201cblockchain\u201d?Blockchain is basically just a decentralized database\u200a\u2014\u200aa ledger if you will.What is the difference between centralized and decentralized? Let\u2019s imagine you have two apples and you want to give one apple to your friend, William.Well, in a centralized world you would have to ask permission from Williams friend, Bill. First Bill will have to vet if you have the apple or not and if you do\u200a\u2014\u200aBill gives you permission to hand over the apple. Bill in this example is the bank.But with a decentralized\u200a\u2014\u200ayou actually don\u2019t have to ask permission from Bill, aka the bank. Blockchain will confirm if you have the apple and will proceed with the hand out.How we can visualize blockchainBut wait, did you notice something strange? We actually don\u2019t have physical apples on the internet\u200a\u2014\u200awe have ones and zeros, aka bytes.Those ones and zeros bundled together in a huge bag make up for what we call information. So instead of real world apples, we have information.I would give you a copy of a piece of information and we would both own it. A lot of energy is put in creating a \u201cthread\u201d of blocks (called the blockchain) that prevent you from creating false ownership of the information.Why do we even need this? Well, remember when we asked Bill for permission so can hand out the apple?We have to trust in Bill to make the right decision. Bill has the power to exploit this transaction\u200a\u2014\u200afor example\u200a\u2014\u200agrabbing the apple for himself.In a broad sense\u200a\u2014\u200ablockchain key feature is to eliminate trust in humans and put our trust into mathematics and computing\u200a\u2014\u200awhich are most likely less prone to errors.Here\u2019s a great Blockchain demonstration by Anders Brownworth.Blockchain in a nutshell: A world-wide computer that is formed by lots of computers talking to each other.Google server\u00a0rooms", "responses": "14"}, {"title": "Confirmed listing\u00a0partners", "author_name": "Nauticus Blockchain", "link": "https://medium.com/nauticus-blockchain/confirmed-listing-partners-5a2c6357b30c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 4, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "25K", "content": "Confirmed listing\u00a0partnersNauticus BlockchainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 4, 2018Nauticus will offer 100 cryptocurrencies, including some very impressive new coins that are still in their ICOs.

It has failed, they say, and has no future. In fact, since around 2011, it has died 249 times.Yet the Bitcoin Blockchain doesn\u2019t know this. It is quietly and consistently collecting, compiling, and verifying transactions in its ledger, creating new blocks every ten minutes or so, practically non-stop. It has an uptime of 99.992044937 % since its inception in January 3rd, 2009, to be exact.By the time I finish this article, it would have issued new bitcoins as a reward to the miners who added the latest block, just as it has done since 2009 without fail.Ten minutes after the price of Bitcoin \u201ccrashed\u201d to $8,500 (as of this writing), it also added a new block to the chain and it will keep doing so until, well, until it doesn\u2019t. Transactions were made, bitcoins were sent, bitcoins were received.The Blockchain doesn\u2019t care. There is no plug to pull. It has no feelings. But every ten minutes, it takes a step forward. Every ten minutes, it increases its value and the strength of its network. No person or institution can stop this. Every ten minutes, it trudges forward. Every ten minutes, the ledger is verified and updated. It does what it set out to do, no more, no less.As Bitcoin and the Blockchain moves forward, so does the industry behind it.

It seems that most people agree that a chip optimized for blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a very good idea. Readers also seem to see the value in an infinitely scalable blockchain platform and the integration of both concepts in an end-to-end solution.The idea of an interconnected world of intelligent IoT devices participating autonomously in a machine-to-machine (M2M) economy clearly seems intriguing to most. And let\u2019s not deny it, it may also scare some of us. However, one of the most common questions is about potential use cases for this technology. This is understandable, as the potentials of our vision are so wide-reaching and many of the benefits will become clear in a future we are only beginning to envision.But let\u2019s look at some of the many benefits and applications of the Skynet ecosystem.Intelligent IoT InterconnectivitySkynet is of benefit whenever interconnecting IoT devices is of benefit. A prime example of this are data intensive AI applications. Imagine a device collecting data to be used in an AI model. The amount of data a single device can process and the device\u2019s capacity of training the model are limited. However, imagine devices across the world joining forces to build an intelligent network capable of processing massive amounts of data in a distributed AI solution more powerful than anything we have seen so far.This could be achieved in various ways. Data crunching may simply be distributed across devices to for load sharing. Alternatively, federal learning models can be used on device-local data. In such a system, a network of devices could share a learning model, but each device uses its local data to contribute to training the model. Yet another alternative is devices engaging in a data marketplace. Individual devices can sell their data, in order to make it available for training models. In practice, we expect a combination of these three models to be used.The Skynet Open Network serves as the secure data bus for all this interaction. Devices can be identified, data sources verified, and the integrity of the data guaranteed. As a bonus, the network provides a micropayment and incentive layer to make such a concept viable economically. The integration of the hardware, transport, security and payment layers into one single end-to-end system is what makes Skynet special. We believe that this complete integration is what will make intelligent IoT interconnection work in practice and lead to adoption.This may sound very abstract, but let\u2019s look at concrete example of distributed IoT AI. Image a fleet of autonomous self-driving cars. Does this sound like science fiction to you? Well, it shouldn\u2019t. Self-driving taxis are already navigating the streets of Singapore and high-end Tesla and BMW cars have very capable production-ready auto-pilots.Imagine these cars sharing their sensor data to collaboratively train a federal AI learning model to improve their driving algorithms. They also share real-time data on weather conditions and traffic to feed their GPS routing calculations. These types of scenarios may seem far-fetched, but with the increasing improvement of technologies, an interconnected world like this may be possible.Another example is automating everyday tasks, ultimately allowing users to accomplish more tasks no effort. Instead of spending hours driving to and from the grocery store and pacing down aisles selecting what to buy, imagine having smart home devices such as your voice assistant or smart fridge work together to purchase groceries for you. Based on your previous habit data points collected by other devices you use, your AI assistant can build a behavioral model, tell your fridge to scan its compartments, understand what you want, cross-check what you don\u2019t already have, and send a payment to the grocery store cash register. The cash register, in turn, can direct an autonomous delivery vehicle to deliver those groceries to your door.This is all enabled by the Skynet Open Network system, which combines a blockchain chip for secure autonomous transaction signing devices and neural network matrix multiplication acceleration in IoT devices and a network platform enabling instant payments, secure node discovery, and exchanges of information. Scenarios like these are just a few of many possible examples of future but realistic intelligent IoT applications.Infrastructure Building\u00a0BlocksSkynet Open Network, combined with the Skynet Core hardware, acts as an enabler for this type of applications and their adoptions.The infinitely scalable high transaction throughput blockchain architecture provides a number of primitives that make development and deployment of complex applications possible. A root blockchain, called SON Fabric, acts as a hub to interconnect a number of blockchains. Individual applications may develop their own chains, but three initial sub-ledgers provide useful building blocks for the future M2M ecosystem:SON Nova is a smart contract platform compatible with Ethereum. The power of Ethereum compatible smart contracts should not be underestimated. Turing completeness of these contracts means they can implement anything and execute it in a transactional manner. Ethereum may be slow and expensive but it is the most popular smart contract platform nowadays. The existing know-how and tool support may just be a deciding factor when it comes to platform adoption.SON Idex provides the necessary building blocks to solve the device identity problem. Identity solutions can be implemented on top of smart contract but having a built-in mechanism for device discovery and identity management surely helps to get applications up and running.Finally, SON Singularity provides AI-specific primitives for constructing knowledge networks and includes its own data marketplace.As explained above, individual chains connect to each other through SON Fabric, which provides a protocol for cross blockchain communication. This protocol allows atomically interchanging assets from one chain for assets from another. In essence, this constitutes a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX). DEX\u2019s are a powerful concept on their own, as trading and exchanging assets without a centralized trusted third party is a secure, fast and powerful way of making tokenization of real-world assets work. However, having such a facility built-in to the core platform elevates interoperability to a new level. And let\u2019s face it: lack of interoperability is one of the main innovation killers in technology in general, let alone IoT.Adoption CurveIntelligent IoT interconnectivity is not Science Fiction any more. Skynet\u2019s end-to-end solution provides all the required building blocks to implement the applications visionaries are promising. The platform provides the missing pieces of the puzzle in one interoperable framework, including affordable and open hardware designs, secure communications, device identity solutions, legacy-aware smart contract platforms, decentralized exchange facilities and even high-level crypto-economic primitive, such as data marketplaces. Therefore, adoption should only be a matter of time, and we are bound to see an intelligent M2M ecosystem beyond our current imagination.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: THE MISSING LINK IN SUPPLY CHAIN\u00a0FINANCE", "author_name": "Planport", "link": "https://medium.com/planport/blockchain-technology-the-missing-link-in-invoice-factoring-invoicing-57ab820be829?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 21, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "3.9K", "content": "BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: THE MISSING LINK IN SUPPLY CHAIN\u00a0FINANCEPlanportBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 21, 2018In today\u2019s world of trade, financial institutions have created several innovations in a bid to provide for continuity in business and one such service is Invoice factoring. The aim is to help increase the buyer\u2019s working capital and to the suppliers, make better their liquidity. However, what exactly is invoice factoring and how does it work?Invoice FactoringInvoice factoring, also known as invoice financing, is a business service offered by financial institutions and agencies for small and medium businesses who are in urgent need of business cash. The industry is estimated at $3 trillion annually. In invoice financing, businesses looking for urgent cash sell off their invoices that are not paid yet to financial institutions in exchange for immediate cash but at discounted prices. The discounts can later be retrieved when the debtors pay the full invoices.The benefits of invoice financing cannot be ignored. By financing the invoices before the real debtors pay them, businesses can forge better relationships, achieve financial liquidity at critical times and for business continuity, and mitigate currency volatility.However, invoice financing just like the supply chain and procurement industry faces challenges at both ends and needs a solution that has the future in mind.Challenges in Invoice FinancingCustomer Creditworthiness complicationsThe factoring company must vet all your customers for creditworthiness. The process in itself is time-consuming due to the paperwork involved and may not yield the positive results the business is hoping for. Also, as a third party is undertaking the process, your business is left out to wait for the results. If the factoring company rejects most of the customers, the business may be left in a dire state.Invoice Exceeds Credit\u00a0LineEvery business has a credit score beyond which financial lenders may not be willing to exceed. If the invoices exceed the credit line, the business is left helpless and in a financial crisis.Customer Refuses to\u00a0ComplyIf the customers whose invoices are forwarded to the financing institution for factoring refuses to comply, the invoices will not go through. Some customers may also feel comfortable dealing directly with the suppliers which render the business in crisis.Incomplete OrderDepending on the principles of operations by the factoring company, the order must be complete to qualify for invoice factoring.Invoices that can\u2019t be\u00a0verifiedInvoice verification is the first test for all the invoices submitted for factoring. This stage is necessary for the protection of the customers, but some may decide to frustrate the verification process. In such cases, the factoring company may opt out of the engagement.Duplication and Human\u00a0errorDealing with duplications of entries and the invoices themselves is a big challenge. There\u2019s also the problem of human error. Just as it\u2019s possible to have duplicate entries and invoices, it\u2019s also possible to have omissions in the invoices due to human error.Blockchain Technology Providing the missing\u00a0linkThe most dreaded problem with invoicing is fraud. Assuming all invoice factoring related practices were decentralized over a distributed ledger technology, where all details relating to a transaction or invoice is spread across all nodes, the possibility or one defrauding the system or even faking a transaction is impossible.The problems highlighted above all point to a solution based on the blockchain technology. To get rid of these challenges, invoicing and invoice factoring must be done over the blockchain monitored system. Integrating blockchain technology ensures:Speedy processing of transactionsFraudulent entries and activities relating to invoicing and factoring are eliminatedElimination of all intermediaries for holding money in a contract to ensure that the money flows from end to end as intended by the transacting parties.Invoice financing is an excellent relief for businesses looking to cash their invoices urgently and is a fast-growing industry in modern economies. Integrating blockchain technology into its operation will bring relief to the businesses that utilize its abilities. The blockchain technology is undoubtedly the missing link.Planport eliminates the need to have a middleman to verify and execute invoices and allows borderless trade finance marketplace where Sellers and Funders meet with trust and mutual benefit.

But, with its simplicity came a few flaws. First, SnakeCoin only ran on one single machine, so it was far from distributed, let alone decentralized. Second, blocks could be added to the chain as fast as the host computer could create a Python object and add it to a list. In the case of a simple blockchain, that\u2019s not a problem, but we\u2019re now going to let SnakeCoin be an actual cryptocurrency so we\u2019ll need control the amount of blocks (and coins) that can be created at a time.From now on, SnakeCoin\u2019s data will be transactions, so each block\u2019s data field will be a list of some transactions. We\u2019ll define a transaction as follows. Each transaction will be a JSON object detailing the sender of the coin, the receiver of the coin, and the amount of SnakeCoin that is being transferred. Note: Transactions are in JSON format for a reason I\u2019ll detail shortly.Now that we know what our transactions will look like, we need a way to add them to one of the computers in our blockchain network, called a node. To do that, we\u2019ll create a simple HTTP server so that any user can let our nodes know that a new transaction has occurred. A node will be able to accept a POST request with a transaction (like above) as the request body. This is why transactions are JSON formatted; we need them to be transmitted to our server in a request body.pip install flask # Install our web server framework firstAwesome! Now we have a way to keep a record of users when they send SnakeCoins to each other. This is why people refer to blockchains as public, distributed ledgers: all transactions are stored for all to see and are stored on every node in the network.But, a question arises: where do people get SnakeCoins from? Nowhere, yet. There\u2019s no such thing as a SnakeCoin yet, because not one coin has been created and issued yet. To create new coins, people have to mine new blocks of SnakeCoin. When they successfully mine new blocks, a new SnakeCoin is created and rewarded to the person who mined the block. The coin then gets circulated once the miner sends the SnakeCoin to another person.We don\u2019t want it to be too easy to mine new SnakeCoin blocks, because that will create too many SnakeCoins and they will have little value. Conversely, we don\u2019t want it to be too hard to mine new blocks, because there wouldn\u2019t be enough coins for everyone to spend, and they would be too expensive for our liking. To control the difficulty of mining new SnakeCoins, we\u2019ll implement a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm. A Proof-of-Work algorithm is essentially an algorithm that generates an item that is difficult to create but easy to verify. The item is called the proof and, as it sounds, it is proof that a computer performed a certain amount of work.In SnakeCoin, we\u2019ll create a somewhat simple Proof-of-Work algorithm. To create a new block, a miner\u2019s computer will have to increment a number. When that number is divisible by 9 (the number of letters in \u201cSnakeCoin\u201d) and the proof number of the last block, a new SnakeCoin block will be mined and the miner will be given a brand new SnakeCoin.Now, we can control the number of blocks mined in a certain time period, and we can issue new coins for people in the network to send to each other. But like we said, we\u2019re only doing this on one computer. If blockchains are decentralized, how do we make sure that the same chain is on every node? To do this, we make each node broadcast its version of the chain to the others and allow them to receive the chains of other nodes. After that, each node has to verify the other nodes\u2019 chains so that the every node in the network can come to a consensus of what the resulting blockchain will look like. This is called a consensus algorithm.Our consensus algorithm will be rather simple: if a node\u2019s chain is different from another\u2019s (i.e. there is a conflict), then the longest chain in the network stays and all shorter chains will be deleted. If there is no conflict between the chains in our network, then we carry on.We\u2019re just about done now. After running the full SnakeCoin server code, run the following commands in your terminal. Assuming you have cURL installed.Create a transaction.curl \"localhost:5000/txion\" \\     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\     -d '{\"from\": \"akjflw\", \"to\":\"fjlakdj\", \"amount\": 3}'2. Mine a new block.curl localhost:5000/mine3. Check out the results. From the client window, we see this.With a little bit of pretty printing we see that after mining we get some cool information on our new block.{  \"index\": 2,  \"data\": {    \"transactions\": [      {        \"to\": \"fjlakdj\",        \"amount\": 3,        \"from\": \"akjflw\"      },      {        \"to\": \"q3nf394hjg-random-miner-address-34nf3i4nflkn3oi\",        \"amount\": 1,        \"from\": \"network\"      }    ],    \"proof-of-work\": 36  },  \"hash\": \"151edd3ef6af2e7eb8272245cb8ea91b4ecfc3e60af22d8518ef0bba8b4a6b18\",  \"timestamp\": \"2017-07-23 11:23:10.140996\"}And that\u2019s it! We\u2019ve made a fairly sized blockchain at this point. Now, SnakeCoin can be launched on multiple machines to create a network, and real SnakeCoins can be mined. Please feel free to tinker with the SnakeCoin server code as much as you\u2019d like, and ask as many questions as you need! In the next part, we\u2019ll discuss creating a SnakeCoin wallet, so users can send, receive, and store their SnakeCoins.Thank you very much for reading!Twitter, Github, Snapchat, Instagram", "responses": "53"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Little Phil", "link": "https://medium.com/littlephilnews/reduce-admin-costs-and-increase-transparency-with-blockchain-c895931afba9?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 17, 2018", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "31K", "content": "Little PhilBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 17, 2018How to use blockchain to reduce admin costs and increase transparencyBlockchain can decrease fundraising and operational costs, at the same time as increasing transparency, accountability and control over how funds are used.Photo by rawpixel on\u00a0UnsplashTrust in charities is on the decline. Unfortunately, lack of transparency means that we are left wondering \u201cWhere is my money going when I donate to charity?\u201d. There have been increased reports of scandals and misuse of donated funds from marketing intermediaries. We are worried how much of our money is going to administration costs and how much is left for those in need. We like to feel good when donating to charity, and something needs to change in the charitable giving industry so we can fix these trust issues and create emotional connections with the people we are donating to.Charity collectors call your house or ask you to put money in tins outside shopping malls; but you don\u2019t know where this money is going or how much of it is going to a \u201cfor-profit\u201d firm which is working for the non-profit charity. Blockchain technology can help to overcome these issues and help to increase transparency at the same time as lowering administration costs.The main administration cost of charities:The highest admin cost of a charity is raising the money. Usually charities outsource this by paying a marketing firm to find donors through methods such as cold calling, billboards and street canvassing. Marketing firms charge upfront commissions of between 800% to 1700% for monthly direct debit subscriptions to charities. This means if you continue with the monthly direct debit, it could take up to 17 months for the charity to break even! Donors who would like to contribute for shorter periods of time and then cancel their subscription can actually cost the charity substantial money upfront and make no impact on the cause they care about. This also means that this form of marketing is near impossible for smaller charities, who don\u2019t have the capital required to pay for these upfront commissions. Once the funds are raised, the international money transfer fees can be substantially high. Shipping medical supplies and food creates an admin trail, more money spent on admin means less money spent on the cause.Main problems with traditional donations to charitiesAside from the administration cost problem, trust is declining because people aren\u2019t sure if there\u2019s a genuine reason that someone needs their help. They also aren\u2019t sure of where their money goes after they\u2019ve given it. Think about the last time you gave to a charity. Your money left your bank account and now are you even sure what you contributed towards?Enter Little Phil + Blockchain:Little Phil is a platform which allows donation to charities with a level of transparency previously not possible. People can search to find a cause they are passionate about, then give small amounts of money. Donations are tracked and people can watch their money reach their intended destination so they experience the real joy of giving\u200a\u2014\u200awhich we call a #littlePhilgoodmoment. Like a true philanthropist, givers have full control over their money. Users are sure that their funds can only be used for the purpose they intended.Little Phil uses blockchain to solve problems:Proof of need\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cHow do I know the receiver genuinely needs help?\u201dWhen recipients register, our platform captures information unique to them, which allows support services to cross-reference their access to various charities. Givers have peace of mind knowing their funds are going to intended recipients with verified needs. Anyone can access the public ledger and be assured that the receivers are not creating duplicate claims (for more info, follow us for next week\u2019s article which will be about \u201cHow can blockchain reduce fraud using Unique Digital Identities\u201d).Proof of impact\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cHow do I know my money is making a difference?\u201dA Little Phil \u201csmart contract\u201d is created at the time of a transaction, giving you peace of mind that your funds can only be used as intended. The contract is embedded in the digital code and stored in transparent, shared databases. This allows the giver to see where their money has gone from the moment they give, all the way through to the receiver. It also only allows the money to only be released for the cause it was originally intended for and only to approved suppliers of goods and services. For example, if someone has donated money to go towards the building of a new wing in a hospital, the money will only be able to be released for that purpose. The contracts are unable to be deleted or changed, which means that every payment has a digital record and can be accounted for. When your funds are released for the use that you intended, you will immediately be notified of the positive impact you made. Anyone can access the public ledger to audit administration charges for each transaction, so givers know exactly how their money is spent.Marketing firms\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cWho knows how much money the marketing firm is taking before my charity sees a cent!\u201dUsing blockchain technologies leads to improved pricing. Instead of the typical 40\u201380% (Sometimes up to 83%) that other organisations retain when fundraising money for a charity, Little Phil only takes a 6% fee. The extra money saved on fees empowers charities to do what they originally intended. It will also help to decrease the fundraising and overhead costs of the charities and can ensure that each dollar given has the maximum impact for the cause. Monitoring costs should be low or nothing, as monitoring is built into the smart contract.Take this graph for example, which demonstrates the traditional model of the upfront payment of commissions to a charity vs Little Phil.Other admin costs\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cBut all my money is going to admin costs!\u201dBlockchain provides an opportunity to decrease fundraising and operational costs, at the same time as increasing transparency and accountability and control over how funds are used.Little Phil can decrease administration costs in many different aspects. Using Little Phil will mean that charities can save time, money and resources that they would have to spend developing their own solutions. They can integrate Little Phil into their own platforms using custom APIs. This gives smaller charities, who are lacking upfront capital, a chance to raise money in ways they normally couldn\u2019t.In the case of shipping medical supplies, those could potentially go through dozens of people and organisations between here and Africa. The blockchain solution not only makes these interactions transparent but also reduces the complexity of the administrative costs of tracking these transactions. Lower complexity means less administration costs and in turn, donors can track their donations from the suppliers through to the consumers they have intended to give to. International money transfers are expensive. Blockchain means lower international money transfer fees and faster transfer times.Little Phil is just the beginning. We believe that the technology will bring about change in the not-for-profit industry, where organisations will be able to cut down administration costs and report in a more transparent way.Register your interest at littlephil.org for updates about the LPC ICO.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "2018 Will Be The Year Blockchain Technology Goes Mainstream.

Here\u2019s\u00a0WhyNicolas ColeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 1, 2018If 2017 was the year of Bitcoin, then 2018 is going to be the year blockchain technology disrupts the technology world forever.Ethereum, the leading blockchain platform and catalyst for the rampant number of decentralized applications and blockchain-based platforms, has proven over the past 6 months that it is far from a fad. It is more than a trend. And it is everything the Internet always wanted to be: a fair and public way to store and transfer information.Especially in lieu of the escalating conversations surrounding net neutrality, there has never been a more poignant time for blockchain technology.Many compare today\u2019s blockchain revolution to the dot-com boom in the\u00a090s.In many ways, they are similar.Hardly anyone understood what \u201cthe Internet\u201d was back in the 90s, and despite all the media attention around Bitcoin and blockchain-based ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), very few people truly understand the purpose they serve\u200a\u2014\u200aor what sort of future they can create.A great example? Think about how many new companies in the 90s added \u201cdot com\u201d to their names solely for the purpose of perception.We\u2019re now seeing the same happen with the blockchain, with brands like Long Island Iced Tea changing its name to \u201cLong Blockchain Corp.\u201d The company saw an instant rise in its stock price of a whopping 200%, according to CNBC.These are the sorts of stories that perpetuate the belief that cryptocurrencies and \u201cthis blockchain thing\u201d are nothing but bubbles waiting to burst.Here\u2019s why they\u2019re not\u200a\u2014\u200aand why 2018 will be Ethereum\u2019s moment of maturity.If you look at how much money was raised through ICOs in 2017 alone, the $1.2 billion (reported in August) exceeded what was raised through conventional venture capital.This happened the same year that Ethereum was priced a mere $20, and it\u2019s big brother Bitcoin had yet to cross even $800.Compare that to where they both stand, and there\u2019s no sense in even citing their current price\u200a\u2014\u200abecause by the time you read this, the price will have gone up again. Ethereum especially is proving itself to be the network that is allowing for handfuls upon handfuls of decentralized applications to be created, many of which are raising funds through ICOs.As more platforms are built, more money will be raised. As more money is raised, bigger and better platforms will be built. And so on, and so forth, reinforcing Ethereum\u2019s value at an exponential rate.Why this is not the dot-com boom established financiers want to believe it to be is because of two major differences:First, you couldn\u2019t buy in and out of companies. You made an investment in an Internet company, and then you waited. But with Ethereum, you can buy in, you can buy out, and you can use your Ether to buy in and out of the decentralized applications built upon it. It\u2019s a marketplace, not a slow and rickety investment vehicle.Second, when people bought into Internet companies in the 90s, they were speculating on one company. One team. One horse in a much larger race. But when people buy into Ethereum, they are buying into the entire race itself\u200a\u2014\u200aand all the horses, all the teams, all the companies building on its technology. For every user gained, that\u2019s another person sitting at the table saying, \u201cI believe in this.\u201dThat\u2019s powerful.A decade from now we will call this \u201cthe blockchain boom.\u201dTrue momentum hasn\u2019t even begun yet\u200a\u2014\u200abut it\u2019s about to.For example: ShipChain is a blockchain platform aiming to disrupt the severely outdated world of freight and logistics shipping\u200a\u2014\u200aand already has a partnership formed with Perdue Farms. This is an industry that hasn\u2019t moved (pun intended) in decades, and is now poised for an unprecedented disruption by implementing blockchain capabilities and efficiencies.A different example is Dragonchain, a blockchain platform, incubator, and marketplace that acts as an open-source ecosystem for other blockchain projects, aiming to spark and further mass adoption. Think of Dragonchain is a catalyst for dozens upon dozens of other disruptive blockchain platforms, making the tools easier and more accessible to developers and innovative minds.If ShipChain is an example of a company that is using the blockchain to disrupt an industry, then Dragonchain is an example of the whole other slew of blockchain platforms that will be built solely for the purpose of making it easier for entrepreneurs and innovators to leverage the blockchain.In 2018, we will see both of these kinds of platforms\u200a\u2014\u200aindustry specific and blockchain adoption\u200a\u2014\u200aexponentially increase. And as they do, we are going to witness a tidal wave of innovation. The difference between now and the dot-com boom, however, is that at the end, there won\u2019t be a crash. There will be no bubble to burst at all.There will only be a long list of companies that failed to keep up.", "responses": "36"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Tina Fotherby", "link": "https://medium.com/@tinafotherby_29097/how-to-be-well-versed-in-blockchain-in-one-week-105a0d991415?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 14, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "2.7K", "content": "Tina FotherbyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 14, 2018How to be well-versed in blockchain in one weekSo, you are interested in blockchain technology, can see its potential for improving the world and want to know enough to earn a living from the subject.But how do you quickly gain confidence in such a relatively new subject area?You could hire a consultant to work with you one-to-one, but with charge-out rates of up to \u00a325k per day for the best in the business, you will need deep pockets.Alternatively, you could join a conference in Vilnius this summer (from Sunday July 15 to July 22 2018) organised by the team at Pillar Project, led by the visionary CEO David Siegel.You will get 50 hours of intelligent face-to-face learning, linked to blockchain, cryptocurrency and programming, which will be completely free of charge.This is the second year that the conference has run and last year\u2019s attendees in Poprad, Slovakia included Pillar community members and associates, blockchain startups running ICOs, cryptocurrency investors and traders, smart contract developers and blockchain enthusiasts.There\u2019s no risk of the content being dry because the event is an \u2018unconference\u2019 which means its unstructured and for the most part, the agenda is decided on a day-by-day basis.If anyone in the audience feels passionate about a subject, they\u2019re entitled to make their feelings known and if necessary, jump up and present their case. I did this and no one objected.You will meet a diverse audience from at least 30 different counties, of various ages and expertise but with a common passion for technology that is set to make the world a better place, as demonstrated by the Pillar Project.The unconference will be intense because at many times there will be a choice of sessions but there will be downtime too as the venue is \u2018family-friendly\u2019.

Yet it shouldn\u2019t, the concept is simple once you get your head around the architecture and theory of basic crypto economics. When you do have your \u201ca Ha\u201d moment, the world will never seem the same to you again.This blockchain basics guide is designed to deliver a clear, non-technical introduction to one of the most transformational & misunderstood technologies of our time. If you want to know what blockchain technology is, how it works, and it\u2019s potential impacts, without all the technical lingo, then this post is for you.A short History of Transacting MoneyHistorically, when it comes to transacting money or anything of value, people and businesses have relied heavily on intermediaries like banks and governments to ensure trust and certainty.[1] Middlemen perform a range of important tasks that help build trust into the transactional process like authentication & record keeping.[2]The need for intermediaries is especially acute when making a digital transaction. Because digital assets like money, stocks & intellectual property, are essentially files, they are incredibly easy to reproduce. This creates what\u2019s known as the double spending problem (the act of spending the same unit of value more than once) which until now has prevented the peer to peer transfer of digital assets.[3]But what if there was a way of conducting digital transactions without a third party intermediary? Well, a new technology exists today that makes this possible. But before we dive into the mechanics of this revolutionary technology, it\u2019s important to provide a little context.Blockchain Vs Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat\u2019s the connection?Bitcoin first appeared in a 2008 white paper authored by a person, or persons using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The white paper detailed an innovative peer to peer electronic cash system called Bitcoin that enabled online payments to be transferred directly, without an intermediary.[4]how the blockchain transfers valueVia (techliberation.com)While the proposed bitcoin payment system was exciting and innovative, it was the mechanics of how it worked that was truly revolutionary. Shortly after the white paper\u2019s release, it became evident that the main technical innovation was not the digital currency itself but the technology that lay behind it, known today as blockchain.Although commonly associated with Bitcoin, blockchain technology has many other applications. Bitcoin is merely the first and most well-known uses. In fact, Bitcoin is only one of about seven hundred applications that use the blockchain operating system today.[5]\u201c[Blockchain] is to Bitcoin, what the internet is to email. A big electronic system, on top of which you can build applications. Currency is just one.\u201d [6]\u200a\u2014\u200aSally Davies, FT Technology ReporterOne example of the evolution and broad application of blockchain, beyond digital currency, is the development of the Ethereum public blockchain, which is providing a way to execute peer to peer contracts.[7]Looking for a Bitcoin Alternative? Check out the Metabase ICOJoin the Metabase Telegram\u00a0GroupWhat\u2019s under the blockchain hood?Simply put, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or decentralized database that keeps continuously updated digital records of who owns what. Rather than having a central administrator like a traditional database, (think banks, governments & accountants), a distributed ledger has a network of replicated databases, synchronized via the internet and visible to anyone within the network.[8] Blockchain networks can be private with restricted membership similar to an intranet, or public, like the Internet, accessible to any person in the world.[9] [10]When a digital transaction is carried out, it is grouped together in a cryptographically protected block with other transactions that have occurred in the last 10 minutes and sent out to the entire network. Miners (members in the network with high levels of computing power) then compete to validate the transactions by solving complex coded problems.[11] The first miner to solve the problems and validate the block receives a reward. (In the Bitcoin Blockchain network, for example, a miner would receive Bitcoins).The validated block of transactions is then timestamped and added to a chain in a linear, chronological order. New blocks of validated transactions are linked to older blocks, making a chain of blocks that show every transaction made in the history of that blockchain.[12] The entire chain is continually updated so that every ledger in the network is the same, giving each member the ability to prove who owns what at any given time.\u201cA blockchain is a magic computer that anyone can upload programs to and leave the programs to self-execute, where the current and all previous states of every program are always publicly visible, and which carries a very strong crypto economically secured guarantee that programs running on the chain will continue to execute in exactly the way that the blockchain protocol specifies.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aVitalik ButerinBlockchain\u2019s decentralized, open & cryptographic nature allow people to trust each other and transact peer to peer, making the need for intermediaries obsolete. This also brings unprecedented security benefits. Hacking attacks that commonly impact large centralized intermediaries like banks would be virtually impossible to pull off on the blockchain. For example\u200a\u2014\u200aif someone wanted to hack into a particular block in a blockchain, a hacker would not only need to hack into that specific block, but all of the proceeding blocks going back the entire history of that blockchain. And they would need to do it on every ledger in the network, which could be millions, simultaneously.[13]Will the blockchain transform the Internet & the global\u00a0economy?Make no mistake about it. Blockchain is a highly disruptive technology that promises to change the world as we know it. The technology is not only shifting the way we use the Internet, but it is also revolutionizing the global economy.[14]By enabling the digitization of assets, blockchain is driving a fundamental shift from the Internet of information, where we can instantly view, exchange and communicate information to the Internet of value, where we can instantly exchange assets.[15] A new global economy of immediate value transfer is on its way, where big intermediaries no longer play a major role. An economy where trust is established not by central intermediaries but through consensus and complex computer code.[16]\u201cThe technology likely to have the greatest impact on the next few decades has arrived. And it\u2019s not social media. It\u2019s not big data. It\u2019s not robotics. It\u2019s not even AI. You\u2019ll be surprised to learn that it\u2019s the underlying technology of digital currencies like Bitcoin. It\u2019s called the blockchain.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aDon TapscottBlockchain has applications that go way beyond obvious things like digital currencies and money transfers. From electronic voting, smart contracts & digitally recorded property assets to patient health records management and proof of ownership for digital content.Blockchain will profoundly disrupt hundreds of industries that rely on intermediaries, including banking, finance, academia, real estate, insurance, legal, health care and the public sector\u200a\u2014\u200aamongst many others.[17] This will result in job losses and the complete transformation of entire industries. But overall, the elimination of intermediaries brings mostly positive benefits. Banks & governments for example, often impede the free flow of business because of the time it takes to process transactions and regulatory requirements. The blockchain will enable an increased amount of people and businesses to trade much more frequently and efficiently, significantly boosting local and international trade. Blockchain technology would also eliminate expensive intermediary fees that have become a burden on individuals and businesses, especially in the remittances space.Perhaps most profoundly, blockchain promises to democratize & expand the global financial system. Giving people who have limited exposure to the global economy, better access to financial and payment systems and stronger protection against corruption and exploitation.\u201cEvery human being on the planet with a phone, will have equal access. Expanding the total addressable market by 4X\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aBrock PierceThe potential impacts of blockchain technology on society and the global economy are hugely significant. With an ever growing list of real-world uses, blockchain technology promises to have a massive impact. This is just the beginning.Many of the most exciting applications and platforms haven\u2019t even been invented yet!If you want more information, that is friendly and easily accessible, please see the rest of our series here:How does the Blockchain Work? Part 2The top 5 things you need to knowHow does the Blockchain Work? Part 3What is Consensus and why does it matter?How does the Blockchain Work? Part 4What\u2019s the difference between private, public, and consortium blockchain?Join the Metabase Telegram\u00a0GroupI\u2019m always interested in meeting blockchain founders, academic researchers, and technologists who are working on challenging projects, so please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn\u00a0, or by email at collin@intrepid.venturesCollin Thompson is the Co-founder, and Managing Director of Intrepid Ventures, a blockchain startup studio that builds, and accelerates Blockchain powered companies.", "responses": "28"}, {"title": "50+ Examples of How Blockchains are Taking Over the\u00a0World", "author_name": "Matteo Gianpietro Zago", "link": "https://medium.com/@matteozago/50-examples-of-how-blockchains-are-taking-over-the-world-4276bf488a4b?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 30, 2018", "readtime": "12 min read", "upvotes": "5.1K", "content": "50+ Examples of How Blockchains are Taking Over the\u00a0WorldMatteo Gianpietro ZagoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 30, 2018When talking about blockchains, we commonly think of its applications in the future. \u201cBlockchain will solve this, blockchain will achieve that\u201d. It\u2019s easy to forget that blockchains are already deployed in the wild.Pick an industry, from automobiles to artificial intelligence, and odds are you\u2019ll find examples of blockchains in action. In all quarters and all circles, blockchains are making their mark. Even the US Treasury is in on the act, advocating for more pilot projects and test programs.The \u2018World Economic Forum\u2019 anticipates that 10% of global GDP will be stored on the blockchain by 2025. That means the global executives out there are preparing for this seismic shift, and are ready to completely back its implementation. The impact of distributed ledger technology could be as grand as the internet revolution itself.The use cases differ, but the benefits derived from using the technology remain unchanged: transparency, immutability, redundancy and security. In 2018, new blockchain initiatives are launched every day. Here are 50 examples of blockchains in use around the globe.GovernmentA number of governments have expressed an interest in blockchain technology to store public records on a decentralized data management framework. Essentia is developing an e-government pilot with Finland\u2019s Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners. Blockchain will enable urban and rural citizens throughout Finland to access records.Other use cases include government applications such as education, public records and voting.Waste ManagementWaltonchain\u2019s RFID technology is being used by a Smart Waste Management System in China. Using Walton\u2019s blockchain, the project will enable supervision of waste levels to improve operational efficiencies and optimize resources.IdentificationZug in Switzerland, known as \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d has developed a blockchain project in partnership with Uport to register residents\u2019 IDs, enabling them to participate in online voting and prove their residency.Border ControlEssentia has been meeting with the Dutch government to create a new system for vetting passengers traveling between Amsterdam and London. At present, passengers on the Eurostar train between the two countries undergo border control checks at multiple points. Essentia is studying a blockchain-based solution that would securely store passenger data, enabling the metrics recorded in the Netherlands to be audited by agencies in the UK. Blockchain would provide a means of ensuring that the data has not been tampered with and is verifiably accurate.HealthcareMedical records are notoriously scattered and erroneous, with inconsistent data handling processes meaning hospitals and clinics are often forced to work with incorrect or incomplete patient records. Healthcare projects such as MedRec are using the blockchain as a means of facilitating data sharing while providing authentication and maintaining confidentiality.EnterpriseClients of Microsoft Azure Enterprise can access the Ethereum Blockchain as a Service. This provides businesses with access to smart contracts and blockchain applications in a secure hosted environment.Google is also reported to be working on a proprietary blockchain to support its cloud-based business. Parent company Alphabet is developing a distributed ledger that third parties will be able to use to store data, believed to be in regards to Google\u2019s cloud services for enterprises, with a white label version for companies also in the works.MedicalMedical centers that have digitized their patient records don\u2019t distribute their data across multiple facilities, instead keeping them on-site on centralized servers. These are a prime target for hackers, as evidenced by the ransomware attacks that struck NHS hospitals in the UK. Even if security risks are overlooked, there is still the problem of fragmentation. There are currently more than 50 different electronic healthcare record (eHR) software systems that operate in different hospitals, often with dozens of different packages within the same city. These centralized systems do not interoperate with one other and patient data ends up scattered between disparate centers.In life-and-death settings, the lack of reliable data and sluggish interfaces may prove devastating. The Essentia framework addresses all these issues by using a blockchain-powered system that will store clinically relevant patient data and which can be immediately accessed, regardless of geographical borders. Patient privacy is maintained on a secure decentralized network where access is granted to only those who are medically authorized and only for the duration needed.MusicOne of the main benefits of blockchain technology is the way it removes intermediaries or middlemen. The music business is a prime example of an industry whose inefficiencies have seen artists poorly remunerated for their efforts. A number of blockchain-based projects have sprung up seeking a fairer deal for music creators, including Artbit, overseen by former Guns N Roses drummer Matt Sorum.Carbon OffsetsAs a heavily industrialised nation, China\u2019s environmental footprint is substantial. In March 2017, IBM launched the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain in conjunction with Energy-Blockchain Labs, as a means of tracking carbon assets in China. This creates a measurable and auditable system for tracking emissions, and facilitates a tradable market for companies seeking to offset their energy consumption whilst incentivizing greener industrial practises.Supply ChainsSupply chain management is seen as one of the most beneficial use cases for blockchain, as it\u2019s ideal for industries where goods are passed through various pairs of hands, from beginning to end, or manufacturer to the store\u00a0. IBM and Walmart have teamed up to launch Blockchain Food Safety Alliance in China. The project, run in conjunction with Fortune 500 company JD.com, is designed to improve food tracking and safety, making it easier to verify that food is safe to consume.China is proving to be a ripe test bed for blockchain projects, for it\u2019s also home to the world\u2019s first agricultural commodity blockchain. Louis Dreyfus Co, a major food trader, has set up a project with Dutch and French banks which are used for selling soybeans to China, with transactions settled quicker than traditional methods thanks to the use of blockchain technology.DiamondsThe De Beers Group, the world\u2019s most famous diamond company, now has its own blockchain up and running, designed to establish a \u201cdigital record for every diamond registered on the platform\u201d. Given concerns about the source of diamonds, and the ethics concerning their country of origin, coupled with the risk of stones swapped for less value ones along the line, blockchain is a natural fit. Because each record is indelible, it will ensure that data for each stone lasts as long as the diamonds themselves.Real EstateUkraine holds the honor of becoming the first nation to use blockchain to facilitate a property deal. A property in Kiev was sold by prominent cryptocurrency advocate and TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington. The deal was enabled with the aid of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, and is intended to be the first of many completed by Propy, a startup specializing in blockchain-based real estate deals.Fishing IndustryBlockchain is now being used to support sustainable fishing. Illegally caught fish is an endemic problem within the industry, and distributed ledger technology provides a means of proving where fish were caught, processed and sold. This \u2018net-to-plate\u2019 chain allows inspectors to determine whether fish had come from regions notorious for human rights abuses or from countries that are affected by economic sanctions.Fine ArtSimilar to the diamond trade, the art industry is dependant on the provenance and authenticity of artworks. While blockchain cannot authenticate a painting to determine whether it is an original or forgery, it can be used to prove the piece\u2019s previous owners. In addition, blockchain is now used as a means of acquiring art. It\u2019s another example of how blockchain technology can be used to make tangible objects easily tradable and exchangeable from anywhere in the world, without the need to physically transfer them from secure storage.Public UtilitiesIn the Australian city of Fremantle, an ambitious project focused on distributed energy and water systems is using blockchain technology. Solar panels are being used in the sun-blessed region to capture electricity, which is then used to heat water and provide power, and the data recorded on the blockchain.Chile\u2019s National Energy Commission has begun using blockchain technology as a means of certifying data pertaining to the country\u2019s energy usage. Sensitive data will be stored on a blockchain as part of an initiative to help modernize and secure the South American nation\u2019s electrical infrastructure.LGBT RightsBlockchain can be helpful in building the \u201cpink economy\u201d, as well as helping the LGBT community to fight for their rights without revealing people\u2019s identities. The latter is an extremely important issue since hate crimes are a recurring problem within the gay community, especially in countries notorious for human rights abuses and where homosexuality is outlawed or at least frowned upon.Cat BondsCat bonds can be the only hope for people who have been victims of earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural disasters. Blockchain allows for quick and transparent settlements between parties, and creates certainty that the system will remain operational even without human operation. Blockchain has now successfully been used as a cat bond settlement mechanism.TourismBlockchain is being researched as a means of improving Hawaii\u2019s economy by giving tourists an opportunity to pay for local goods and services with bitcoin and other currencies. This way the state\u2019s government hopes to attract tourists, especially from Asia, to spend more money and eventually help Hawaii to develop economically.National SecurityIn 2016, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a project that would use blockchain as a means of securely storing and transmitting the data it captures. Using the Factom blockchain, data retrieved from security cameras and other sensors are encrypted and stored, using blockchain as a means of mitigating the risk of data breaches. The project is still ongoing.ShippingBlockchain\u2019s suitability to recording shiping data is self-evident. A number of projects have distributed ledger technology to work in this domain, using it within the maritime logistics industry to bring transparency to the unavoidable bureaucracy in international trade. Maersk, one of the largest global shippers, was the pioneer to make use of blockchain and now ZIM have picked up the torch.TaxationAs one of the world\u2019s most technologically advanced countries, it\u2019s no surprise China has become one of the first and most prominent adopters of blockchain and everything it offers. It has decided to use the technology to facilitate taxation and electronic invoice issuance in a project headed by Miaocai Network in conjunction with the State Administration of Taxation.Mobile PaymentsCryptocurrencies with its underlying blockchain technology is being used to facilitate mobile payments in a wide range of projects. One of the latest initiatives announced, scheduled to launch in the fall of 2018, will involve a consortium of Japanese banks. They\u2019ll be using Ripple\u2019s technology to enable instant mobile payments.Land RegistryBlockchain once again proves that it\u2019s not just applicable in the crypto space and by small companies. The government of Georgia uses it to register land titles. They have created a custom-designed blockchain system and integrated it into the digital records system of the National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR). Georgia is now taking advantage of the transparency and fraud reduction offered by blockchain technology.ComputationAmazon Web Services have collaborated with Digital Currency Group (DCG) to improve their database security with the help of blockchain. They will provide a platform for DCG\u2019s startups to work, as well as technical support for their projects.InsuranceBlockchain in the insurance industry is often talked about, but many don\u2019t know the technology has already been implemented. For instance, Insurer American International Group Inc, in partnership with International Business Machines Corp, has completed a pilot of a so-called \u201csmart contract\u201d multi-national policy for Standard Chartered Bank PLC and plans to manage complex international coverage through blockchain.Endangered Species ProtectionA man is a wolf to another man, and an even bigger wolf to animals. \u2018Care for the Uncared\u2019 is an NGO that is working with leading developers to find a way to preserve and protect endangered species using blockchain technologies.AdvertisingNew York Interactive Advertising Exchange in partnership with Nasdaq is using blockchain to create a marketplace where brands, publishers and agencies can buy ads. The process is simple, though as secure as it can potentially be, using an open protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.JournalismPermanence is now a hot topic in the journalism trade. One wrong move and years of hard work and research could go down the drain. Blockchain is one smart solution to the problem. Civil, a decentralized journalism marketplace, apart from obvious blockchain benefits, offers an economic incentive model for quality news content, coupled with the ability to permanently archive content, which will remain accessible at any time in perpetuity.Smart CitiesSmart cities are not the stuff of science-fiction anymore. Taipei is attempting to position itself as a city of the future with the help of Distributed Ledger Technology. It has announced a partnership with IOTA and they are already working on creating cards with light, temperature, humidity and pollution detection.Oil IndustryOne of the leading players in the commodity market, S&P Global Platts, is trialling a blockchain solution that\u2019s being used to record oil storage data. Weekly inventories will be stored on the blockchain, reducing the need for manual data management and minimizing the chance of human error.RailwaysIn Russia, rail operator Novotrans is using blockchain technology with a goal to improve the speed of its operations. The company, which is one of the largest rolling stock operators in the country, will be using blockchain to record data pertaining to repair requests, inventory and other matters pertaining to their operations. The idea is that blockchain records will be more resistant to tampering and data corruption..GamingOne of the most influential companies in the gaming industry, Ubisoft, is researching on how to implement blockchain into its video games. Specifically, it\u2019s focusing on the ownership and transfer of in-game items such as rewards and digital collectibles. These have already been successfully demonstrated in action using the Ethereum blockchain.Car LeasingBlockchain\u2019s distributed ledger technology is ideally suited to registering records of any kind in a secure and unalterable manner. One such use case being developed by Essentia is the vehicle rental industry. Major rental companies will be able to utilize Essentia\u2019s blockchain protocol to store customer data, fully encrypted and shareable on a permissioned basis with relevant parties.Energy DistributionOne of the biggest challenges facing the energy industry, companies in the habit of trading surplus supply need infallible record keeping. Tracking energy allocations in real time, and ensuring efficient distribution through the supply chain requires multiple data points, and also mandates close cooperation between all entities. Essentia is developing a test project with a number of major energy suppliers that will help them track the distribution of resources in real time, whilst maintaining data confidentiality at all times.Every day, the number of blockchains used in real world scenarios grows. From logistics to fine art, it\u2019s hard to find a sector that hasn\u2019t been touched by this transformative technology. We have reached a point where the technology has proven itself to be superior than the current modus operandi.The \u2018WEF\u2019 predicts that by 2025 the world will see mainstream blockchain adoption. But after examining the use cases already in the implementation stages we have to ask, we have to ask, will it really take that long?There\u2019s only one small kink in the chain holding everything back. That kink is known as interoperability.Think of a river that has peacefully flowed along for the past 15 years, then all of a sudden a storm appears and it rains for weeks on end, turning the river into a raging torrent, sweeping away everything in its path. That river is the Web 2.0 and the storm of blockchains have already changed the internet landscape. So what remains? When the rain stops and the floods subside, with the old foliage swept away, a vast swathe of fertile land awaits to be farmed.The river, which facilitated the flow and interoperation within the natural ecosystem is gone. And the same goes for the Web 3.0, we can see growth in various sectors but they are still largely incompatible with each other. But \u2018hey presto\u2019 there\u2019s already a solution in the works for that.It\u2019s called Essentia, and it\u2019s like a farmers tool for building new decentralized ecosystems on this fertile land. It\u2019s job is to create connections and facilitate interoperations to create a cohesive blockchain environment. This could mean health-care blockchains are compatible with insurance chains, or international rail working with with cross-border customs chains.Essentia is the vehicle that the digital world needs in order speed up the blockchain adoption process. Some suggest that we could see it happen 50% sooner than originally estimated, that means by around the year 2020 the internet ecosystem could go regain its interoperability, while decentralized blockchains fill in the void of privacy, security and data ownership.Disclaimer: *Im the CEO of Essentia One.", "responses": "43"}, {"title": "Creating Your First Blockchain with Java.

The first use case, Bitcoin, has managed to bring forward the concept of decentralization, and in the meantime distributed ledger technology has exploded in popularity thanks its massive potential, causing multi-industry disruption.Nevertheless, an entirely peer-to-peer internet definitely still sounds like a far-fetched reality. At the present time, the web relies on a range of centralized servers and platforms, making basic peer-to-peer transactions, regardless of the field, virtually impossible. However, blockchain makes it possible to go around those intermediaries, solving a range of issues and revitalizing the main purpose of P2P transacting\u200a\u2014\u200aefficiency.So far we\u2019ve looked at how the technology is transforming the P2P economy, the field of gaming, B2B solutions, and P2P lending.This time we skew the focus toward some actual, real-world applications and use cases. Perhaps the best sign of actual widespread adoption of this emerging technology is its reception by traditional financial institutions.Traditional Institutions Foray into BlockchainEarlier in 2014, investment banking giant JP Morgan Chase & Co filed a patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a blockchain-enabled P2P payments system between its banks. Not only this gesture, but the patent application itself outlines the issues that are currently riddling the conventional banking system and how blockchain technology could solve them:\u201cA number of messages must be sent between the banks and clearing houses involved in processing the transaction\u2026 and clearing intermediaries in the payment flow [\u2026] [this may be] expensive [\u2026] [and] real-time settlement of payments is not possible [\u2026] transactions may be risky as there are counterparty and settlement risks associated with [the] correspondent banking network.\u201dAround the same time JP Morgan filed its patent application, MasterCard Labs, the payment card company\u2019s innovation section, filed a patent of its own, seeking protection over a system designated to increase the speed with which blockchain nodes are being verified.Successful Use\u00a0CasesWhile many institutions have already avidly expressed their interest in the technology, some have already used it and proven its capabilities.In Commonwealth Bank of Australia successfully shipped and tracked around 17 tons of almonds in collaboration with five domestic as well as international supply chain leaders.Speaking on the matter was Chris Scougall, Managing Director of Industrial and Logistics in Client Coverage at CBA, who said:\u201cOur blockchain-enabled global trade platform experiment brought to life the idea of a modern global supply chain that is agile, efficient and transparent. We believe that blockchain can help our partners reduce the burden of administration on their businesses and enable them to deliver best-in-class services to their customers.\u201dMore recent examples of successful blockchain implementation includes the British banking giant HSBC which executed its very first overseas financial transaction using blockchain-based technology. The transaction was between India\u2019s Reliance Industries (RIL) and a US-based client and included a blockchain-enabled Letter of Credit which managed to facilitate a shipment between both companies.Srikanth Venkatachari, CFO at RIL noted,\u201cThe use of blockchain offers significant potential to reduce the timelines involved in exchange of export documentation from the extant seven-10 days to less than a\u00a0day.\u201dAERUM: Making it\u00a0PossibleThat blockchain has massive potential was never really in question. But thanks to technological advances it is finally being implemented successfully by leading institutions around the world, albeit in specialized applications. If blockchain is to be integrated into general, day-to-day usage, it needs to improve its speed and scaleability.This is where AERUM steps in, providing a fast, scaleable blockchain platform that is free for the end user. The network is fully compatible with the industry\u2019s forerunner Ethereum while offers 25x more throughput.AERUM provides on-demand scalability from 500 to 100,000 transactions per second, thereby introducing unparalleled efficiency and flexibility based on the needs of the application.It also has a modern and comprehensive consensus mechanism, as well as a web, mobile, and desktop multi wallet which connects AERUM to Ethereum through Atomic Swaps.You can read more about the AERUM network on its official website or stay tuned on the project\u2019s Facebook or Twitter page. You can also join the live discussion at the official Telegram group.Do you think blockchain-based technology can reinvent the P2P industry? Or perhaps it has already started?

However, I\u2019ve come to realize that the term \u201ctrustless\u201d is ambiguous, confusing, and most importantly, inaccurate.Blockchains don\u2019t actually eliminate trust. What they do is minimize the amount of trust required from any single actor in the system. They do this by distributing trust among different actors in the system via an economic game that incentivizes actors to cooperate with the rules defined by the protocol.Let me explain in more detail.A truly trustless transactional system would look something like this:Two people who are interested in transacting with one another change hands directly. They are physically present, and therefore can easily verifyAuthenticity: the actual sender is handing over the money, andNo double spending: the money is not fake, it\u2019s a real $10 billWhile theoretically flawless, this transactional system is limited. Consider: two individuals may trade with one another only when they are in close physical proximity. For economies to function at scale, a transactional system should enable transfers with anyone in the world, regardless of distance.So, what we really want is this:As you can see from the diagram above, the way we achieve this aim is by having an intermediary who can facilitate the transfer of value to make sure that the actual sender is sending the money and the money is real.This begs the question: who serves as the wholly trustworthy intermediary?In modern day transactional systems, the intermediary can be a bank (e.g. Chase Bank); a payment provider (e.g. Paypal); a remittance company (e.g. Western Union); a credit card (e.g. Visa), and so on.In this centralized model, the bank authenticates you, and guarantees the recipient that they are getting real money.In other words, unless there is a direct physical transfer of value from one individual to the other, there must be some intermediary that exists that we \u201ctrust\u201d.Blockchains are no different.Blockchains define a protocol that allows two individuals to transact with one another in a \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d manner over the Internet. When you digitally transfer value from one account to another on the blockchain, you\u2019re trusting the underlying blockchain system to both enable that transfer and ensure sender authenticity and currency validity.In a \u201ccentralized\u201d system, we trust a single third party (e.g. Chase Bank) to act as the intermediary who guarantees those two properties; in a \u201cdecentralized\u201d system, our trust is placed elsewhere, namely in public-key cryptography and a \u201cconsensus mechanism\u201d that allows us to determine the truth.Public-Key CryptographyPublic key cryptography (or asymmetrical cryptography) uses:a set of public keys visible to anyone, anda set of private keys visible only to the ownerThe private key generates a \u201cdigital signature\u201d for each blockchain transaction that a user sends out. The signature ensures authenticity by:confirming that the transaction is coming from the user, andpreventing the transaction from being altered by anyone once it has been issuedChanging the transaction message in any way will cause verification to fail.Okay, so we\u2019ve figured out that public-key cryptography helps us authenticate users in a peer-to-peer system. But to ensure no double spending, we need to keep track of who has what so that we can know whether someone is sending real digital money or fake digital money.This is where the \u201cconsensus system\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awhich allows us to preserve a digitally shared truth\u200a\u2014\u200amust come into play.Machine Consensus (The Cryptoeconomic Protocol)Blockchains have a shared ledger that gives us the absolute truth of the state of the system. It use mathematics, economics, and game theory to incentivize all parties in the system to reach a \u201cconsensus\u201d, or coming to an agreement on a single state of this ledger.Let\u2019s take Bitcoin, for example. The Bitcoin protocol has a consensus algorithm called \u201cProof of Work\u201d that holds the system together. For a transaction to be settled between two consumers, the algorithm requires that a set of nodes (called \u201cminers\u201d) compete to validate transactions by solving a complex algorithmic problem. In other words, Bitcoin \u201ceconomically incentivizes\u201d miners to purchase and use compute power to solve complex problems. These economic incentives include:miners earning a transaction fee that users pay for carrying out a transaction, andminers earning new Bitcoins for successfully solving the puzzleBecause of these economic incentives, miners are constantly watching the network so that they can gather a new set of transactions to fit into a new \u201cblock.\u201d Then they use their computing resources to solve the complex algorithm in order to \u201cprove\u201d that they did some work.The first miner to solve the algorithm adds the proof and the new block (and all the transactions in it) to the blockchain and broadcasts it to the network. At that point, everyone else in the network syncs the latest blockchain because it\u2019s a \u201ctruth\u201d everyone believes in.Since miners are competing to run computations, there are times when multiple blocks get solved at the same time. This then creates a \u201cfork\u201d of multiple chains:When there are forks like this, the network\u2019s \u201ccanonical\u201d chain is the one which is the \u201clongest\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe one which the most amount of miners trusted and continued to work on.Every new block that\u2019s added to the blockchain in this manner adds more security to the system because an attacker who wants to create new blocks that overwrite a party of history would need to consistently solve for the puzzle faster than anyone else in the network. This is practically impossible to do, making it\u2019s impossible to reverse engineer or alter the data inside these blocks. This is why users trust continue to trust the system.So when we transact with one another on the blockchain, we are anchoring our trust in the miners who are giving up their resources to do some work to ensure no double spending.Social Consensus (Governance)Of course, even if the machine consensus works perfectly, we can never guarantee a 100% probability of reaching consensus on other important aspects required to maintain trust in the network. For example, when the underlying network needs to be upgraded, improved, or repaired, we need some way to trust that the network and all its constituents can appropriately handle the changes. In such cases, it\u2019s very much a coordination effort amongst constituents, or what I would call a \u201csocial consensus\u201d (e.g. governance).For example, if the blockchain requires an improvement (e.g. better transaction logs), we need a governance mechanism that coordinates the interests of all parties involved (users, developers, investors, etc.) in coming up with the best solution. Or if there\u2019s a controversy on the best path forward (e.g. a contentious fork), then a community needs to form a consensus on what to do next. If an agreement can\u2019t be reached, the network forks, and people are forced to choose one side over another instead of everyone believing in a shared truth. Users would lose trust in the system because they would be unable to reasonably determine which chain was the \u201cvalid\u201d chain.As I described in a previous post (bullet #6), there are many different models for blockchain governance and it remains an area of active research in the community. Blockchain governance is an incredibly tricky problem and finding a balance between centralized and distributed control will be essential to maintaining everyone\u2019s trust in the system.ConclusionWhen we say blockchains are \u201ctrustless,\u201d what we mean is that there are mechanisms in place by which all parties in the system can reach a consensus on what the canonical truth is. Power and trust is distributed (or shared) among the network\u2019s stakeholders (e.g. developers, miners, and consumers), rather than concentrated in a single individual or entity (e.g. banks, governments, and financial institutions).Perhaps a more accurate way to describe blockchains is not as \u201ctrustless,\u201d but as built on the basis of distributed trust: We are trusting everyone in aggregate.Of course, this assumes that we trust that a majority of the power held in the system belongs to stakeholders who share similar values. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think we can claim\u200a\u2014\u200aat least, not yet\u200a\u2014\u200ato have figured out exactly what those shared values consist of. Hence the proliferation of blockchains and contentious forks in the past year\u00a0\u2026 but that\u2019s a long-winded topic for another day! \ud83d\ude0a", "responses": "22"}, {"title": "Facebook will Accelerate Blockchain Adoption", "author_name": "Michael K.

SpencerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 10The future of blockchain is still mysterious, there\u2019s simply so much going on. Don\u2019t let the blockchain hype fool you, we\u2019re still in very early days where mainstream adoption only occurs in the decade ahead.With Facebook\u2019s massive pivot into becoming an in app communications & privacy leader, a lot of this will depend on the blockchain. Therefore it comes as no surprise that Facebook is hiring for blockchain positions.As of early March sources spotted at least 20 new positions:Facebook Vacancies for Blockchain Division\u00b7 Two Product Managers for different locations\u00b7 Community Media & Web Manager\u00b7 Business Operations Manager\u00b7 Growth Product Manager\u00b7 Software Engineer\u00b7 Threat Investigator\u00b7 Technology Communications Director\u00b7 Data Engineer\u00b7 Qualitative UX Researcher\u00b7 Quantitative UX Researcher\u00b7 Data Scientist\u00b7 Brand Marketing Manager\u00b7 Software Engineer\u00b7 Two Mixed Methods UX Researchers also for two different locations\u00b7 Security Engineer\u200a\u2014\u200aThreat Detection and Response\u00b7 Brand Strategy and Insights Manager\u00b7 Product Designer.Facebook is thus showing an era where centralized Blockchain acceleration in adoption will significantly change the future of cryptoeconomics that is starting to intersect with payments.Facebook recently hired the researchers from University College London behind blockchain startup Chainspace.While it appears Mark Zuckerberg wants Facebook\u2019s apps to centralize in a privacy conscious ecosystem somewhat like everything-app WeChat, that\u2019s the complete opposite of its open-sharing 3rd party data sharing model that made it so profitable with digital ads up until now. Analysts and the public are extremely skeptical.For Facebook\u2019s reputation to be salvaged it will have to invest hard in blockchain to improve trust in its commitment to privacy. I\u2019d even go so far to say that it\u2019s crucial to its future business model.Facebook\u2019s Future is the Blockchain (not privacy itself per\u00a0se)In a recent blog post on Facebook, Facebook\u2019s CEO detailed how he plans to make Facebook upgraded: A Privacy-Focused Vision for Social Networking. This happens to be the specialty of distributed ledger technology and blockchain\u2019s incredible performance enhancement merging public and private networks and making transactions more efficient.With this narrative of PR impacting the future of technology, the enterprise adoption of blockchain will be stimulated not just for the tech but for branding benefits of adopting the tech that\u2019s popular among Millennials and younger consumers.The pivot to privacy as Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s trump card is seen widely as an empty pledge, considering what we now know about Facebook\u2019s M.O. The truth is Facebook will never be WeChat and it will never give fair value back to consumers for the data it harvests actively from them (whether or not they are \u201cFacebook users\u201d).Still Facebook may play a considerable role in accelerating enterprise adoption of blockchain solutions and centralized stablecoins. The fact that both a bank (JP Morgan) and a major tech company are both taking this approach is no coincidence. The future is subscriptions and private business ecosystems and thus the future of blockchain is private, not public blockchains.Friending Blockchain is The Reality of the \u201cPivot to\u00a0Privacy\u201dInstagram will be hacked for the 2020 elections and WhatsApp for all of its active users hasn\u2019t been monetized well. With Blockchain both of these things could eventually change.The future of blockchain technology no longer depends on Bitcoin or even the future of cryptocurrencies. It depends on adoption in the cloud and by leading apps and the kind of R&D the likes of Alibaba, Huawei and Facebook are doing with it among others.It\u2019s simply fascinating then to see Facebook\u2019s careers website now lists 20 job openings related to the technology in a wide range of areas, including: technology communications director, threat investigator, data scientist, two product managers and a product designer, brand strategy and marketing managers, community, media and web manager, engineers, various UX researchers and other roles (Coindesk).We must applaud all progress whether private or public, centralized or decentralization, in the end the markets will decide the innovation that\u2019s truly disruptive. If Facebook gets this wrong, it could jeopardize its future in advertising. If it gets it right\u200a\u2014\u200ait could kill cryptocurrency tokens as we know them.", "responses": "14"}, {"title": "TRON and Trip.io reached a strategic partnership to jointly build a new world of blockchain travel", "author_name": "TRON Foundation", "link": "https://medium.com/tron-foundation/tron-and-trip-io-reached-a-strategic-partnership-to-jointly-build-a-new-world-of-blockchain-travel-47b784198cb0?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 6, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "2K", "content": "TRON and Trip.io reached a strategic partnership to jointly build a new world of blockchain travelTRON FoundationBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 6, 2018Recently, TRON announced to reach a strategic partnership with Trip.io, the world\u2019s first traveling block chain project.

This along with internal stablecoins from the likes of Facebook and JP Morgan. There is every reason to believe that in the 2020s, a thriving Token economy will complement the global economy in ways that will give blockchain and crypto a remarkable place in the next stage of the internet.It\u2019s highly probable that if and when Samsung develops a public blockchain in the future, then Samsung Coin could be traded publicly on cryptocurrency exchanges just like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). On platforms like Bakkt.Samsung Pay upgraded with Stablecoin LikelySamsung\u2019s blockchain task force has been in active development for at least a year, and is working on a number of projects. The intersection of payments and stablecoins is very bright, and Samsung Pay could be incorporated. Chat and stablecoins is another area of innovation where Telegram, Line and WhatsApp are all likely to have skin in the game among others.Samsung recently also invested 2.6 million euros ($2.9 million) into crypto hardware startup Ledger. In March, Samsung officially revealed the cryptocurrency wallet, which is compatible with ether (ETH) and ethereum-based ERC20 tokens, although notably not bitcoin in early glimpses.Samsung Coin\u2019 is currently in development but the timing and direction of the new product has not been confirmed.

Ethereum is in this sense still the heart of crypto innovation, if not the soul of a digital asset the way Bitcoin is.Ethereum provides a platform for firms and startups to gain access to blockchain technology without building theirs from scratch. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Samsung announced that its Galaxy S10 phone will support Ethereum (ETH). As we watch the evolution of altcoins and stablecoins mature, bigger companies are getting into the race.Samsung joins a wider list of corporate and financial giants reportedly eyeing bespoke crypto. More properly most of them will be stablecoins. The hype is real when major technolgoy companies on-board crypto and blockchain products in new ways.

Source: Mike Blake/ReutersThe community ballooned in size, and veterans have been inundated with promises and claims that blockchains are revolutionizing major industries, from finance to supply chain management, to identity management and voting. As explained by Cornell Computer Science professors and IC3 founders Rafael Pass and Elaine Shi, \u201cfinancial firms have announced intentions of using the blockchain to lower transactions costs, remove geopolitical barriers to transferring assets, and reconcile differences between systems.\u201dBut the harsh truth is that blockchains haven\u2019t achieved these things yet. They don\u2019t yet work.One day they will, but because of their scalability failures, they cannot in their current form. Try to send even small sums of money with Bitcoin, and you could run into confirmation latencies of over an hour, and transaction fees over $20. Bitcoin is practically unusable for its original purpose. How can this be ready to become the world\u2019s currency?It\u2019s not just \u201cdigital gold\u201d that has these problems. Even Ethereum, the groundbreaking smart contracting platform with the potential to change the world, is not without flaws. At the moment, however, Ethereum\u2019s main draw to the public has been to trade smol catz.Smol CatCryptokitties, touted as a demonstration of Ethereum \u2019s viability, actually illustrated its failure. The application\u2019s just 14,000 daily users were enough to double gas prices, contribute to a 6x increase in transaction latencies, and slow the network to a halt. Due to network issues, simple actions like creating (\u201cbreeding\u201d) a new cat increased from an already high $1 to an astounding $8. (This fee doesn\u2019t even include the siring fee charged by Axiom Zen\u200a\u2014\u200ait was only the fee paid to Ethereum miners). Can you imagine the cost for more complex games and applications?Ethereum had a hard time keeping up. Atlas, from Etherscan DataWhy have all these killer apps, genius ideas, and viable business strategies so far failed? Why are the top 50 Ethereum DApp lists littered with bunk ICOs and ponzi schemes?Because blockchains don\u2019t yet scale.To fulfill their promise as large-scale transaction networks, blockchains must actually be able to handle a large-scale of transactions. Today\u2019s blockchains pale in comparison to comparable transaction networks outside of the cryptocurrency sphere.Bitcoin, designed to be the currency of the internet, is limited to 7 transactions per second. Ethereum manages fewer than 50 transactions per second. Now compare these to Visa\u2019s 24,000 tx/s.Sources: Visa, PayPal, Ethereum, BitcoinWhat does that mean for real world performance? Due to a lack of fast, intuitive supporting technology, something as simple as making a payment is a long, arduous path for anyone but the most advanced computer users.Blockchains were supposed to be the answer to fundamental large-scale human questions. They were supposed to foster a new era of democracy by allowing for decentralized, trustless, and fault tolerant voting. Many of the most exciting applications of blockchain technology are simply infeasible at the moment.What if a real election were to be held today on chain? Take everybody\u2019s favorite election, the 2016 US Presidential Election, as an example. With 129 million voters participating, assuming every vote used the same amount of gas as a money transfer, Ethereum\u2019s daily throughput of 75,000 transactions would mean this election would take 173 days to be held on Ethereum. That\u2019s nearly 6 months for the election to even take place!Imagine if we had to deal with this for 6 months\u00a0longer.As a result, very few applications are seeing mass adoption. According to Dapp Insight Ethereum has just 8,000 daily active users (DAU) and all but 2 applications (both exchanges) have more than 1,000 DAUs. This is because it\u2019s not possible for blockchains to scale to public demand. As long as blockchains cannot massively scale, their revolutionary potential remain a distant dream.That is why 2018 is the year of blockchain scaling.It is out of necessity that scalability solutions have become a paramount topic for blockchain researchers, developers, and entrepreneurs. As a result, much progress is being made in terms of blockchain scalability research. Plasma, state channels, sharding, alternative consensus, DAGs, asynchronous fast paths\u200a\u2014\u200athese are becoming more and more real every day.There are valiant and vital efforts to enhance the technology in other ways. zCash and Monero prove that privacy-focused chains can excel, employing the most advanced cryptographic techniques to build chains and ecosystems that are thriving.Cryptoeconomics research will usher in a new era of optimal incentive designs underlying blockchains, bringing further security and resilience against collusion. Chain-based governance research will provide a forum by which individuals can settle philosophical disputes about the function and details of chains they use. Interoperability research will allow a number of different chains, each with different uses, to coexist, creating a decentralized internet. Smart contract research will allow for safer and more precise contracts that people can use in their daily life.These research areas are extremely important if blockchains are to fulfill the promises envisioned, and we fully support research efforts in these areas.. However, they still do not address the fundamental challenge of scalability.Until blockchains can handle the scale that large-scale decentralization entails, then, by definition, they can\u2019t work for everybody. Solving the scalability problems of today\u2019s blockchains is the key to bringing about a transparent, fair, and secure internet of the future.Thunder ResearchThunder: A Storm is Brewing.

We also explore how we could finally decouple the dual role of store of value from medium of exchange from common currency in the future and why bitcoin and cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity to break the debt cycle created by fiat and banks. Read Part II on the role blockchain will play in trying to avoid an environmental tipping point.Once in a millennia opportunityReforming the capital markets will be the first step for blockchain technology but this is an incremental step when we look at the role cryptocurrencies will play in the move from a world operating beyond capacity in the pursuit of exponential growth to a steady-state of growth and greater financial independence.Although currently going through an identity crisis, cryptocurrencies do have the power to \u201cdemocratize money\u201d and \u201cunbank the banks\u201d as bitcoin intended but not in the way that most people are expecting.It won\u2019t be through the proliferation of speculative instruments or ETFs for digital assets, nor central bank-issued digital currencies. Instead, cryptocurrencies will change our world by expediting our way out of the \u201ccredit epoch\u201d that has been prolonged by expanding government balance sheets and inflating assets to keep GDP rising to an epoch of lower growth and less consumption.Click here to open\u00a0graphicFor centuries, money\u2019s dual role as a store of value and medium of exchange has been dichotomous as the labour class use money to survive and the financial class use it for economic rent by lending it to the workers. This conflict has led to a perversion in government policy and left the working class beholden to interest rates that they want kept low so to afford servicing their debts while the moneyed class want them high to earn the best return on their idle capital.This dual role has also made national currencies toys for colossal speculation with economic and humanitarian consequences every year. Over $1.3 trillion is traded per day in currency markets, dwarfing the value of the world\u2019s stock markets combined, and 96% of those transactions are purely speculative. This has led to the infamous \u201cSoros\u201d style attacks on weaker currencies that has precipitated several of the recent credit crisis in developing economies from Argentina to Mexico.Crypto: The next stage for\u00a0moneyOver the centuries currency has undergone different stages of debasement in what some define as Gresham\u2019s Law whereby the incumbent (good quality) currency is replaced by the new form of money (lesser quality) coming into the economy at the same face value. People would rather spend the lower quality new currency and save the old so its velocity accelerates until the old is squeezed from the system.This process has led to the dilution of currencies from commodities like cattle, grains etc to metal coins (silver, gold, nickel etc), which in turn were diluted in metalic content to create more of them, then to \u201cworthless\u201d fiat paper and eventually to fractional reserve and credit that is merely bits on a computer.The pursuit of the crypto \u2018holy grail\u2019 is the stablecoin\u200a\u2014\u200athe ultimate low-volatility transactional currency that can withstand speculative attacks and debasement. This is still in the exploration phase but there are dozens of projects trialling different methods to do this: from physically-backed stablecoins, crypto-backed and decentralized algorithmic central banks.With cryptocurrencies we have a historic opportunity to decouple money\u2019s dual mandate as a store of value and medium of exchange and dilute, if not reverse, the importance of national fiat currencies to create millions of more tangible local and regional currencies backed by physical assets and common natural resources (minerals, metals, air, land). These sorts of currencies have been tried before but never with the power of blockchain.I. How we got here: From industrial to finance capitalismCredit has been around for millenia since the first farmers extended it in a form IOU between harvesting cycles. A credit/debt cycle is created any time a person or country borrows money and, like any cycle, it gathers momentum with each completion.Former US economic adviser and independent economist, Michael Hudson, points out that \u201cmost debt in today\u2019s economies is taken on to buy real estate (commercial and private) and financial securities. Within the industrial sector, most corporate debt is taken on for leveraged buyouts of smaller or impaired competitors.\u201dOur current version of \u2018casino\u2019 credit has inflated asset prices since the 80s and is the antithesis of the founding industrial capitalist vision of bringing prices and incomes in line with their cost-value.Industrial capitalism replaced the feudal landlord system of the middle-ages in the 19th and 20th centuries by taxing away \u2018unearned income\u2019 from the commonwealth such as land (ground-rent) and natural resoures. However, this same rentier system has re-emerged as finance capitalism, where one class is renting out excess capital out to another to work for their return on investment.How banks amplified the business cycle with a debt\u00a0cycleBanks make their money in the margin between the rate they borrow money and rate at which they loan it out, known as the interest rate spread, and they have amplified the effect of business cycle booms and busts by extending credit and expanding \u201cmoney\u201d in the system during good times and contracting in bad times.John Maynard Keynes observed the perversion of the credit model when he remarked in Economic Consequences of Peace that the fiat credit system is designed with the intent of growing an economic cake that is never intended to be eaten.In other words, we haven\u2019t been eating our share of the \u201ccake\u201d but putting it towards the rest of the collective mix so when we do actually need it we take an even smaller slice as we delay retirement later and later.As the average age of retirement in the US keeps rising it has also assisted in GDP growing year-on-year.A corollary to the rising retirement age, GDP growth which for years has moved in tandem with household income has decoupled since the mid-1980s and grown while wages have stagnated.The breakdown of the traditional correlation circa 1986 between US income and GDP growth has been dubbed the \u201cGreat Decoupling\u201d. Source: World After Capital.This GDP \u2018growth\u2019 is a euphemism for debt and it is only growing because people are taking on more debt to service old and buy more, growing exponentially since the 1980s. Until recently Ireland held the mantle for the most indebted households at over 115% of GDP, fuelled by the real estate boom and bust, but Australia has blown that away with household debt of over 120% of GDP, again fueled by property speculation and the most lenient credit conditions for decades.Household debt globally has taken off since the mid-1980s. Source: Bank of International Settlements data, chart Prof Steve\u00a0Keen.To get itself into such a position, Australian banks have manipulated credit terms in all sorts of ways to expand credit/debt such as the short-term \u201cinterest-only loans\u201d to fantasy accounting that budget the cost of raising a child in Sydney at $7 a day.However, since the Royal Commission into Australian banking practices uncovered rampant malpractice ranging from racial predation to charging dead customers for financial advice, the banks have reigned in their credit and Australian house prices are plummeting, down 10% alone in Sydney this year.How much debt is there? Look at the monetary\u00a0baseTo put it in context, U.S. households have about $8 trillion in mortgage debt, over $1 trillion in auto loans, over $1 trillion in student loans and nearly $1 trillion in credit card debt. U.S. business debt is a total of $25 trillion, of which about $15 trillion is in the financial sector and $10 trillion in non-financial businesses.M1 is the money supply that includes physical currency and coin, demand deposits, travelers checks, the most liquid portions of the money supply. M2 is a calculation that includes all elements of M1 as well as \u201cnear money\u201d such as savings deposits, money market securities, mutual funds etc. Source: St Louis Fed\u00a0ReserveIn the US the government has stopped tracking the larger monetary aggregates, such as M3 and only using narrower measures, such as M2, making it hard to gauge the actual growth of the monetary base. Nonetheless, by the M2 measure alone the monetary/credit base has been growing by about $1 trillion annually over the last decade, and the actual amount of money created in the economy by quantitative easing is likely to be much greater.A similar expansion of the monetary/credit base has happened throughout the world. Globally, there is $250 trillion in outstanding debt and four times that amount in unfunded liabilities, not to mention the massive amount of tangled financial derivatives roughly the same size as both those debts and liabilities put together.II. Where we\u2019re going: Money \u2018for the people\u2019 and digital sovereigntyBitcoin and cryptocurrency\u2019s original cypherpunk ethos was to \u201cunbank the banks\u201d with an alternative currency to the debt edifice our economy has become in the age of credit and fiat.One way digital currencies could obviate the banks is by filling the gap between the needs of the lendee and that surplus of the lender\u200a\u2014\u200athe traditional staples of banks, car and home loans, will be in less demand as the economy becomes more decentralized. We\u2019ve experienced the first stages of decentralization with Uber and Airbnb but this trend will only continue as the sharing economy grows and people earn on their own terms bartering with hundreds of different types of cryptocurrencies outside the remits of income tax or interest.Currently, we are all chasing one deonomination of currency for all different uses and this is what drives banks\u2019 (and central banks) margins. In the near future we will have an ecosystem of many cryptocurrencies for applications existing on digitally sovereign decentralized platforms on the internet and outside the jurisdiction of governments and central banks. These currencies will diminish the power that central bank deposit rates have on our lives and even more so squeeze the margin of commercial banks from the current positive risk-free interest rate to lend at even lower negative rates that we\u2019ve seen before (think -2 or -3%) as central banks are forced to charge for money kept on deposit.Crypto and digital banks will disrupt banks\u2019 positive interest rates among young\u00a0saversThe cultural obsession of saving money with banks has been waning with younger generations as all they\u2019ve known in their lifetime is a falling interest rates and paltry returns on their deposits.For those in the Baby Boomer generation, who at times enjoyed double digit interest rates, there was reason to believe in the miracle of compound interest but for the millennial generations, who have the lowest rate of savings of any generation for their age in history, the wealth-building strategy of saving a portion of your income to earn ~1% interest is anachronistic.According to one piece of research, 67% of \u201cyoung millennials\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athose between 18 and 24 years old\u200a\u2014\u200ahave less than $1,000 in their savings accounts and 46% have $0. Older millennials, those between 24\u201335 didn\u2019t fare much better, 41% of whom had no savings.The secular downtrend in interest rates since the early 80s also marks the point when credit-fuelled economic growth started to replace real growth. The interest rate fell to a historic low during the GFC in 2012 and 2016 at just above 1% (and lower for many banks\u2019 own interest rate) and knowing that it has run out of rope before the next recession hits the Federal Reserve has been hiking rates rapidly this year to get to them to a point where they can be effectively lowered again\u200a\u2014\u200aironically this is what many \u201cexperts\u201d believe will trigger the next recession.The interest rate of the Ten-Year Treasury (shown by the TNX ETF) that has the most impact on short-term interest rates at banks has been in a secular downtrend for\u00a0decades.Automation will compound secular deflation and bring interest rates back to negative territoryThe internet has for the first time in history created the possibility of zero-cost marginal production\u200a\u2014\u200agoods that require no staff or overheads to produce\u200a\u2014\u200awhich will have a hugely deflationary effect on the world going forward.For the past century the natural level of short-term US interest rates (effected by the Fed) has been equal with nominal GDP growth\u200a\u2014\u200acritical to keeping the amount of debt in the world growing at least as fast as the rate of debt servicing. But when the yield spread between the short-end of the interest rate curve and the long-end starts to invert, it tends to presage a recession in a self-fulfilling prophecy of lower future growth expectations as investors pile into longer dated bonds for a long-term safe return, driving their prices up and yields down.Although the most closely watched \u201crecession indicator\u201d is the spread between the 2\u201310 year bonds the spread between the 3\u20135 year recently inverted (went below 0) for the first time since 2006/7. This inversion is taken as a harbinger for recession. Source: BloombergAccording to Hudson, over the years \u201cthe Federal Reserve was able to inflate asset prices by flooding the economy with enough credit to lower interest rates, enabling banks to capitalize a rental or corporate income at a higher multiple in lending to new buyers.\u201dCentral Banks across the world \u2018expanded their balance sheets\u2019 creating massive price inflation over the past years in stocks, bonds and real estate. Source: Lion Crest\u00a0Capital.With the money the central banks paid them for bad assests, commercial banks didn\u2019t pass it on by lending to people who would actually spend the money (middle and labour classes) they instead lent mainly to other financial institutions with a better projected rate of return, not to finance new capital formation or employment but to make capital gains by debt-leveraged speculation.Interest rates were forced into negative territory (below a risk-free rate for banks) in recent years to combat recession, however, with each completed debt cycle central banks\u2019 ability to spur economic growth through monetary policy has diminished.When the next recession hits it will be compounded by the deflationary forces of automation and technology that are already long underway replacing workforce jobs and, consequently, consumer demand.A renaissance of local currencies in digital\u00a0formLocal currencies and currencies that depreciate with time may sound like a radical idea but in fact have a long history. They were used widely in the US and Europe in the form of scrips during the Great Depression when local governments and jurisdictions issued their own alternative currency as the nation\u2019s banks ran dry.Depreciating currencies (known as a demurrage rate) incentivize the circulation and velocity of money instead of hoarding it by encouraging people to spend without using credit or getting into debt. Modern demurrage currency originates from the Swiss town of Worglwhich created its own local currency, also known as Freigeld (\u201cFree Money\u201d in German), that decreased in value at a rate of 1% per month and stamped every time it was spent. The experiment was inspired by economist Silvio Gesell\u2019s concept of Freiwirtschaft (\u201cFree economy\u201d) where money free is from speculation.The Worgl currency worked to acclaim in the during the Great Depression and was dubbed \u201cthe miracle of Worgl\u201d as it lifted the town from its nadir, although it is very unlikely that it would have been sustained.The oldest alternative currency still in existence is that of the Swiss WIR Bank which has endured since the 1930s. The WIR currency, or note, was also introduced in response to the Great Depression when money and credit markets dried up and the bank lends specifically to small and medium-sized businesses which has allowed them to sell their inventory even when the velocity of Francs in the wider economy plummets\u00a0.Founded in 1934 with 16 members it now has over 62,000 and the WIR is used as a business-to-business currency insulated from the vagaries of the wider business cycle and currency fluctuations.The alternative Swiss credit market using the WIR currency shows it moving countercyclical to the Swiss economy, its velocity, or turnover, expanding as the real economy, GDP, contracts. Source: Research\u00a0GateTurnover, or velocity, of WIR and Swiss imports as a percentage of GDP (representing economic growth and by extension velocity of Swiss Francs) has been negatively correlated, especially from 1990 onwards after a severe recession. Swiss GDP and money supply growth is pro-cyclical\u200a\u2014\u200aincreasing as the economy grows and vice versa\u200a\u2014\u200aand the WIR moves countercyclically, in opposition to economic growth.This data shows the WIR is most used when the Franc (CHF) is in short supply\u00a0, especially during recession when it\u2019s most needed. The WIR caters to a niche market, the small and medium enterprises in Switzerland, as an alternative source of funding outside of the banking system.The previous cycles for bitcoin\u2019s price based on Brave New Coin\u2019s BLX Index, which shows the peaks and trough between cycles getting longer and the next cycle is predicted to last 1,158 days, or over 3 years.

Already there have been four 80\u201390% recessions in the market during one of the longest business cycles and bull runs in the stock market.Source: Brave New\u00a0CoinSimilar to the Swiss WIR, cryptocurrencies serve a niche market within national economies and also serve as an alternative to the banking system (the \u201cbe your own bank ethos\u201d). So we would hope to see it continuing to move countercyclically as it has done.Source: Brave New\u00a0CoinBrave New Coin\u2019s BLX price of bitcoin, which leads prices for the entire crypto market, has seen the days between the peaks and troughs of its market protract with each cycle as more participants come into the market. The next cycle is predicted to last 1,158 days, or over 3 years. As the market matures in the next few years we could expect to see the price of other crypto assets and sectors become less correlated and even invert with the price of bitcoin.Colu\u200a\u2014\u200abuilding local cryptocurrenciesColu is one blockchain startup that aims to \u201cchange the face of your local economy\u201d and has already issued community currencies in the UK aimed at boosting a community\u2019s economic activity. It also plans to create city currencies with incentive systems to boost positive behavior among residents by rewarding social actions such as volunteering, participating in civic activities or spending their digital currency on local products.Kintetsu Harukas Coin\u200a\u2014\u200acorporate community coinThe listed Japanese conglomerate Kintetsu which operates a railway connecting major cities and tourist destinations issued its own pilot community currency earlier this year.The Kintetsu coin was adopted in over 400 locations across the Kintetsu Group, including a department store chain and the Harukas observatory atop the 300 meter high Abeno Harukas tower (Japan\u2019s tallest building\u200a\u2014\u200alocated in Osaka).The pilot results were so positive that the company will be adopting the digital currency for 2019.Coffee Coin\u200a\u2014\u200amicroeconomy/artesanal coinMiddlemen services like Fair Trade or bodies that certify products will be also made redundant through microeconomy crypto coins.The organic/Fair Trade premium has long created a conflict for consumers: paying extra for staples has made \u2018eating ethically\u2019, or just eating non-chemically, a luxury. The cost of certifying as an organic grower or fair trader with the governing body shifts the cost to the customer but when supply chains issue their own currencies they can save the cost of certification and perhaps we\u2019ll just have to trust in its provenance.CoffeeCoin (COF) is one such utility token function within its blockchain ecosystem, CoffeeChain, as a nominal representation of 1kg of green arabica coffee on the Waves blockchain with a total supply of 40m COF.It is connecting producers of speciality coffees in Indonesia with end buyers as well as a coffee trading platform for those in the entire chain from farm to cup. The value of the currency could be interpreted as the trust of the provenance of the goods in the system.Blockchain is the technology to finish historic mission to create autonomous currencyThe pursuit to create a currency as a medium of exchange decoupled from a store of value has been a long road and economist John Maynard Keynes was one of the earliest proponents. He asserted that the dual role of money creates conflict of interests between the \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave nots\u201d and has attributed to inequality. He frowned on the speculative use of common currency and interest rate arbitrage and was an advocate of negative interest rates in certain cases.In the 1940s, Keynes proposed a supranational global reserve unit of account called \u2018the Bancor\u2019, a sort of precursor to the IMF\u2019s Special Drawing Rights. While not conceptually a currency it was to be used purely as a non-speculative unit for international trade settlement\u200a\u2014\u200aindividuals could not hold or trade in Bancor. The US had intended to adopt it but after WWII and Bretton Woods the USD was made the defacto global reserve.Contemporary iterations in the vein of Keynes\u2019 Bancor have also been proposed. Economist Bernard Lietaer\u2019s Terra Trade Reference Currency (or TRC), was designed in 2000 as a supra-national complementary currency initiative, intended to work in parallel with the current international monetary system that was free of geopolitical and speculative vagaries of national currencies.It is designed to counteract the booms and busts of the business cycle and stabilize the global economy. Most importantly, it will resolve the conflict between short-term financial interests and long-term sustainability\u200a\u2014\u200aTerra whitepaperTRC is a demurrage currency that depreciates 4% per annum to avoid hoarding and inventivize its use as a standardized \u201ccountertrade\u201d unit of account for international trade.Lietaer is a former currency trader, voted \u201cthe world\u2019s top currency trader\u201d by Business Week in 1992, and renowned as the \u201cArchitect of the Euro\u201d which he intended to be used as a pan-European common currency and not intended to replace national currencies.\u201c[Terra is] a global complementary currency designed to provide an inflation-resistant international standard of value; to stabilize the business cycle on a global level; and to realign stockholder\u2019s interests with long-term sustainability.\u201dBoth Keynes\u2019 and Lietaer\u2019s proposals have literally taken on a new life in blockchain through eponymous cryptocurrency projects the Bancor Protocol (BNT) and the Terra stablecoin. Ironically, Bernard Lietaer is the chief monetary architect for the Bancor Protocol Foundation.DAO\u2019s will create the first digitally native economiesTerra MoneyWhile the recently abandoned Basis project was the most famous (perhaps now infamous) of \u2018algorithmic central banks\u2019, stabilizing currencies with decentralized assets, the endeavour to create a stable fully autonomous currency continues.Perhaps taking inspiration from Lietar\u2019s physical proposal, the stablecoin Terra aims to be the first non-speculative global cryptocurrency by focusing on being a medium of exchange and not a store of value to be used as the primary currency in e-commerce in Asia.It proposes a two-token economy in which Terra is the stable coin initially pegged to a basket of currencies that reflect the IMF\u2019s Special Drawing Rights (currently U.S. dollar 41.73%, Euro 30.93%, Renminbi 10.92%, Japanese yen 8.33%, British pound 8.09%) with additional commodities to be added to the basket such as metals, grains and decentralized assets.It envisions a decentralized economy similar in essence to the recently defunct Basis stablecoin where its second currency \u2018Luna\u2019 is the incentive token for users to maintain Luna \u2018deposits\u2019 with the Terra foundation and rewarded with the transaction fees generated from Terra.Terra is envisioned to become the native token for a whole ecosystem of Dapps and DAOs to use in the future as a method of payment online or at merchants point of sale.AragonWhile not a necessarily a stablecoin endeavor Aragon is attempting to create the world\u2019s first digital jurisdiction purely for digitally native organizations (or DAOs) to operate in the same way physical organizations do, with legislation and contractual agreements. It could be described as a modern-day Hanseatic League, a supranational trade association for digital companies.Aragon lets you freely organize and collaborate without borders or intermediaries. Create global, bureaucracy-free organizations, companies, and communities.\u200a\u2014\u200aAragonIts ERC-20 token, ANT, will be the native currency of the economy and its value kept stable (but not pegged) in a similar way to Basis or Terra, by algorithmically adjusting the supply from its stability reserve.Aragon could play a large role as communities reclaim their commonwealth (land, air, water, natural resources) from corporations through the use of token-economics.ConclusionThe internet started the shift to a sharing economy with the open-source revolution and although it has been annexed by a few coroporate behemoths (FANG companies) it is returning to its decentralized founding vision.This open-source ethos also fits in with the classical vision of capitalism where the rent of internet landlords of Facebook and Google was taxed away from the ownership of open resources. This shift is also embodied by regulators across the world who are fining Big Tech companies billions and strangling their ad-based business models.The expansion of fiat-based debt has interrupted the flow of production and consumption which has led to economic shrinkage and will become more evident after the next recession hits. At that point it will be unavoidable for an entirely new economic, environmental and social order to re-emerge.Read Part II on the role blockchain will play in trying to avoid an environmental tipping point.", "responses": "5"}, {"title": "Blockchain Zero-knowledge Proof In A\u00a0Nutshell", "author_name": "Demiro Massessi", "link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/blockchain-zero-knowledge-proof-in-a-nutshell-f0684a669a68?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 22, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "895", "content": "Blockchain Zero-knowledge Proof In A\u00a0NutshellDemiro MassessiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 22, 2018Photo by Zhifei Zhou on\u00a0UnsplashToday we\u2019re going to talk about a cybersecurity idea in blockchain known as \u201cZero-Knowledge Proofs\u201d.Zero-knowledge proof is the ability to prove a secret without revealing what the secret is.Let\u2019s review an example:Let\u2019s say there are two toy cars, identical in shape and size, except, one is red and one is blue. Jimmy, who is color-blind, holds the toy cars behind his back. Jimmy then shows one of the cars to David. Jimmy then hides that car behind his back and shows David the other car. David can consistently detect the switch because the cars are different colors, but he never has to reveal the color of the cars to Jimmy in order to prove the secret.That is exactly what Zero-Knowledge Proofs is about, they allow me to prove to another party that I have a certain piece of knowledge without revealing what that knowledge is.Zero-Knowledge Proofs are often referred to as zk-SNARKs, which stand for \u201cZero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge\u201d, or zk-SNARKs for short, but, if you want to be simple, we can just call them Zero-Knowledge Proofs.A great example of a Zero-Knowledge Proof is what is called the cave door\u00a0analogy.Pretend that there\u2019s a circular cave, with only one entrance or exit and at the back of this circular cave there\u2019s a door which can be unlocked using a secret code entered onto a keypad.Yes, I am really bad at drawing! That\u2019s the best I could come up\u00a0with.If I want to prove to you that I know the unlock code without revealing that unlock code to you, all I need to show is that I can walk into one end of the cave, open the door, and come out the other end.If I\u2019ve successfully demonstrated that, then you know without a doubt I\u2019ve been able to unlock that door, but yet I haven\u2019t revealed that unlock code to you.This simple cave door analogy is a Zero-Knowledge proof, and if you can remember this cave door analogy, then you\u2019ll understand why Zero-Knowledge Proofs are so important in blockchain.For example, a user may make a request to send another user some money.The blockchain naturally wants to make sure, before it commits this transaction, that the user sending the money has enough to send.However, the blockchain doesn\u2019t really need to know or care who is spending the money, or how much total money they have.Being able to answer a question of \u201cDoes a user have enough money to send to another user\u201d without knowing who the user is, or exactly how much they have, is one of the primary use cases for Zero-Knowledge Proofs in blockchain.So from now on, when you hear about zk-SNARKs, don\u2019t get intimidated.It\u2019s not a complex idea. Just think of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and the cave door, think about how important it is in blockchain to be able to prove a claim without actually revealing the information behind that claim, and you\u2019ll understand Zero-Knowledge Proofs.Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum have the implementation of Zero-Knowledge Proofs under development.One of the blockchain-based system using Zero-Knowledge Proofs is ZCash.", "responses": "5"}, {"title": "Where does the money go for blockchain investments?", "author_name": "Fan Wen", "link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/where-did-the-money-go-for-blockchain-investments-dba74c028b15?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 28, 2018", "readtime": "10 min read", "upvotes": "1K", "content": "Where does the money go for blockchain investments?Fan WenBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 28, 2018tl;drSummaryIt has been a question for me for a while: where are the VCs investing into in the blockchain space? After this quantitative examination on 2,288 blockchain-related companies and 3,036 deals about these companies, it is clear that most VCs are still simply investing in cryptocurrency-related start-ups, since this is the relatively easiest/safest way to make money. However, VCs are also starting to look into the new cryptographic technologies and protocol designs, since it is still at the very early stage of blockchain and a better protocol is needed.Please feel free to click the link below images to see the interactive version of diagrams (or click here). All data comes from PitchBook.MarketMost funding has been directed to companies in the US and China.Geographically, most of the funding ($8,869 M) has been raised in the United States ($4,487 M), China ($1,512 M, excluding the Bitman IPO), and Canada ($628 M). Following these three markets, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Israel, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong have also attracted a notable volume of capital.Funding raised in different countries (By\u00a0Fan)As of October 2018, the US market has 933 blockchain start-ups that have raised $4,487 M, while China has only 61 companies that have raised $1,512 M. However, companies headquartered in China have a higher average valuation ($115.2 M) than companies in the US ($12.6 M).In terms of total raised funding, the Chinese companies also receive more money than companies in other countries. On average, the Chinese blockchain start-ups have raised $24.79 M, while the number is $4.81 M for US companies.Average valuation of blockchain start-ups (By\u00a0Fan)Therefore, it is obvious that there is a larger bubble as well as a higher capital concentration in China. To certain extent, this makes sense to me: most of the Chinese blockchain start-ups are cryptocurrency (issuance, trading, mining, etc.) companies that are actively targeting the Chinese residents. It is not difficult for them to sell the trash coins to millions of Chinese residents since (1) Chinese Yuan has been depreciating for a while and is expected to keep depreciating; (2) Chinese stock market has been a mess for a long time due to inappropriate management and lack of transparency; (3) Chinese residents lack alternative investment channels.Investment is doubling in this space, regardless of the weird performance of cryptocurrency market.Though the total market cap of cryptocurrencies has dropped dramatically in 2018, the number of blockchain deals has almost doubled from 2017. As of October 27, 2018, 918 deals have been made in this year, while only 547 deals were closed in 2017.Number of deals by year (By\u00a0Fan)Total investments by year (By\u00a0Fan)The total funding in 2018 has also doubled from 2017. As of October 27, 2018, $10,680 M have been raised (including ongoing IPOs), while only $5,623 M were collected in 2017.Moreover, deals have become bigger in 2018. The $50+M and $10\u201350 M categories have been growing the most rapidly. 9 deals with $50+M investments happened in 2017, while 30 such deals have been made so far in 2018. The number of deals sized between $10 M to $50 M has tripled from 26 in 2017 to 89 in 2018 (As of October 27).The rapid and stable growth of investments in blockchain start-ups indicates that the market did not lose its confidence about this technology due to the dramatic change in cryptocurrency market.Deals by size and by year (By\u00a0Fan)InvestorsThere are two types of investors in the blockchain space. One is the traditional VCs, such as IDG Capital and GV, that do not exclusively invest in blockchain but spend their money on all emerging technologies. The other type is the blockchain-dedicated VCs, such as Digital Currency Group and Fenbushi Capital, that are exclusively investing in blockchain projects. According to the deal data, most of the active investors (in terms of number of deals) are the blockchain-dedicated VCs.It is not difficult to understand why a lot of deals are made by the new and dedicated VCs, since (1) there is a high knowledge barrier in understanding the blockchain technology and its applications; (2) an ecosystem/network is needed to develop and implement the technology.Here is a list of the most active blockchain investors based on number of deals from 2002 to 2018:Digital Currency Group (75), Blockchain Capital (50), Pantera Capital (41), Digital Currency Group (Barry Silbert) (33), Boost VC (30), Fenbushi Capital (30), Plug and Play Tech Center (29), Hashed (Accelerator) (27), Individual Investor (25), NEO Global Capital (24), 500 Startups (23), Danhua Capital (21), Y Combinator (19), SV Angel (17), Naval Ravikant (Naval Ravikant) (17), Future\\Perfect Ventures (Jalak Jobanputra) (15), Andreessen Horowitz (15), Timothy Draper (Timothy Draper) (14), Barry Silbert (Barry Silbert) (14), FundersClub (14), Roger Ver (Roger Ver) (13), Draper Dragon (12), Techstars (12), Kindred Ventures (12), Bitmain (12), Fred Ehrsam (Fred Ehrsam) (12), Liberty City Ventures (11), ZMT Capital (10), Digital Finance Group (10), FBG Capital (10), ZhenFund (10), Paul Veradittakit (Paul Veradittakit) (9), IDG Capital (9), Union Square Ventures (9), GV (9), Abstract Ventures (9), RRE Ventures (James Robinson) (9), RRE Ventures (9), INBlockchain (9), FinForge (8), Hard Yaka (8), ConsenSys Tachyon (Kavita Gupta) (8), Draper Associates (Timothy Draper) (8), Coinbase (8), Ribbit Capital (Meyer Malka) (8), LINKVC (8), Lightspeed Venture Partners (Jeremy Liew) (8), Barclays Accelerator (8), Ceyuan Ventures (8), Ben Davenport (Ben Davenport) (8), Sean Percival (Sean Percival) (8), Node Capital (8), Elad Gil (Elad Gil) (8), Startupbootcamp (8), Block VC (8), Slow Ventures (8), AME Cloud Ventures (8).Most active blockchain investors (By\u00a0Fan)DealsAs of October 2018, most of the deals happened in the US (1,330 deals) with an average size of $5.04 M, followed by UK (269 deals/Average $2.37 M) and Canada (224 deals/Average $20.09 M). Unexpectedly, China has recorded only 94 deals while with the highest average deal size ($70.31 M), which further proves the concentration.Almost 3/4 of the deals are early stage investments in the blockchain space. Out of the 3,035 recorded deals, 2,271 (74.83%) deals are early stage investment (Angel/Early Stage VC/Seed Round/Grant/Accelerator/Incubator). In 2018, the number of Early Stage VC deals doubles from 92 (2017) to 205 (2018). The numbers of Seed Round investment and Angel also increase a lot from 77 (2017) to 131(2018) and from 47 (2017) to 112 (2018) respectively. However, the number of Later Stage VC investment has dropped slightly from 11 (2017) to 9 (2018).Deals by type (By\u00a0Fan)Early stage investment growth (By\u00a0Fan)The number of M&A deals doubles in 2018. With more M&A deals such as CBIX acquired by Bitbuy and Tobit Clicks acquired by Protect Pharmaceutical, the number of M&A deals increases from 40 in 2017 to 91 in 2018. Of the 91 M&A deals in 2018, 40 happened in the US, 28 in Canada, 3 in UK, 3 in Japan, and the rest come from countries such as India, Hong Kong, and China.M&A deals growth (By\u00a0Fan)Traditional financial institutions/corporate companies have not been heavily involved in M&As yet. 35 (38.46%) of the M&A deals were made by public companies. While the only traditional financial institution on the list is EY, which acquired Elevated Consciousness in July, 2018. The other acquirers are blockchain/cryptocurrency companies themselves or tech companies such as GoDaddy and Rakuten.See appendix for the full list of 91 blockchain M&A deals in 2018.BuzzwordsWith no doubt, since the invention of blockchain technology, most of the funding has flown to cryptocurrency-related start-ups (e.g. issuance, trading/exchange, mining, investment, crypto payment, etc.).Number of deals for buzzword-related start-ups (By\u00a0Fan)Total investments into buzzword-related start-ups (By\u00a0Fan)Two big deals (D+H acquisition and Bitmain IPO) have contributed to the abnormally high investment volume of some verticals in the graph above.After excluding the cryptocurrency-related (including mining) buzzwords and the general words such as blockchain technology, we can see the most invested \u201cbuzzwords\u201d in 2017 are: Blockchain Assets Trading, Digital Identity, Energy Storage System, Impact Investing Vertical, and Cyber Security. Following these buzzwords, some other verticals such as Enterprise Blockchain Platform, Fund Management Platform, and Invoice Financing have also attracted 4 to 5 deals in 2017. However, cryptocurrency-related investments are still the mainstream among the 547 deals closed in 2017.Most popular investment buzzwords in 2017 (By\u00a0Fan)Most heavily invested buzzwords in 2017 (By\u00a0Fan)In 2018, after excluding the cryptocurrency-related (including mining) buzzwords and the general words such as blockchain technology, we can see the most invested \u201cbuzzwords\u201d in 2018 include: Blockchain Security, Crypto Assets & Exchange, Financial Software/Services, Stablecoin, and Blockchain Games/Gaming Platforms. Besides these buzzwords, we can also see that VCs are bringing a large portion of their money to blockchain-based Health Care Platforms, Blockchain News Portals, Consensus Algorithm Developers, Insurance Platforms, and Logistics Platforms. However, most of the deals are still concentrated in cryptocurrency-related start-ups.Most popular investment buzzwords in 2018 (By\u00a0Fan)Moreover, by examining the volume of investments into different buzzwords in 2018, we can further discover that Consensus Algorithm/Protocol Development, Stablecoins, and Cyber Security have attracted the most money. This is understandable since (1) there has not appeared a perfect consensus protocol yet, a fact that will affect the wide implementation of the technology; (2) even for the most basic application as an exchange medium, no cryptocurrency has been widely accepted due to the high volatility.Most heavily invested buzzwords in 2018 (By\u00a0Fan)From 2017 to 2018, most of the investment growth goes to cryptocurrency-related start-ups, as expected. From the second graph below, we can see the new investment domains in 2018, which are quite similar to what we found in the above analysis, are primarily related to Cryptographic Technology (the base for security and protocol design), Stablecoins, and Assets Securitization/Management.Investment growth from 2017 to 2018 (By\u00a0Fan)New investment domains in 2018 (By\u00a0Fan)Conclusion74.72% worldwide blockchain investments have been made in three markets: US (50.59%), China (17.05%), and Canada (7.08%). The US market has the biggest number of start-ups (933) and deals (1,330), while Chinese companies have the highest average valuation ($115.2 M) and deal size ($70.31 M), which indicates a high investment concentration.Blockchain investment has doubled from 2017 to 2018 with more funding goes into cryptocurrency-related start-ups, regardless of the poor performance of the cryptocurrency market. As of October 27, 2018, $10,680 M have been raised (including ongoing IPOs), while only $5,623 M were collected in 2017. A large portion of the new investment goes into cryptocurrency platforms.The most active investors are those exclusively dedicated to blockchain investments since there is a high knowledge barrier in understanding the technology.~75% of the deals are early stage investments in the blockchain space. Out of the 3,035 recorded deals, 2,271 (74.83%) deals are early stage investment (Angel/Early Stage VC/Seed Round/Grant/Accelerator/Incubator).Technology integration is happening in the space. The number of M&A deals increases from 40 in 2017 to 91 in 2018. However, few of the deals were made by non-blockchain/traditional companies, indicating that the M&A deals are more about technology integration within the industry.As expected, most of the investment has been directed to cryptocurrency-related startups in 2017/18. These startups work around cryptocurrency issuance, exchange/trading, mining (hardware and software), wallet, payment, etc. The investment is still growing rapidly regardless of the poor performance of the cryptocurrency market.The most invested \u201cbuzzwords\u201d in 2018 include: Blockchain Security, Crypto Assets & Exchange, Financial Software/Services, Stablecoin, and Blockchain Games/Gaming Platforms.New investments are primarily made into: Cryptographic Technology (the base for security and protocol design), Stablecoins, and Assets Securitization/Management. Particularly, Consensus Algorithm/Protocol Development has attracted a large portion of money. The reasons is that all existing protocols have some flaws in design, and therefore a \u201cperfect\u201d protocol is still needed.This research project is completed through a collaboration between Fan Wen at Yale SOM and Josh Liggett at OurCrowd.Disclaimer: The article is not, and should not be regarded as \u201cinvestment advice\u201d or as a \u201crecommendation\u201d regarding a course of action, including without limitation as those terms are used in any applicable law or regulation.Appendix: a list of M&A deals in 2018", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "Update of the ESBC Blockchain.", "author_name": "ESBC", "link": "https://medium.com/@esbcbetting/update-of-the-esbc-blockchain-809e0cbe4580?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 24", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "4.7K", "content": "Update of the ESBC Blockchain.ESBCBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 24We recently launched the first Platinum Masternode and it doesn\u2019t look very attractive, since the rewards for it are only 2% of the block reward. In spite of this, the overall situation has changed for the better, since the number of coins used for masternotes has increased from 69.5% to 78.5%, this is a very important indicator in the masternode community.This article will tell you what changes will occur in with the rewards, after the mandatory update of the ESBC Blockchain.Our goals:1. To achieve a greater number of blocked coins in order to look even more attractive on the Masternodes market.2. To reduce total emission\u200a\u2014\u200aESBC will become more reliable for traders.3. Reduce the reward for PoS.The increase in the number of blocked coins is possible by reducing the reward for PoS, at the moment the reward for PoS is 18%.It is impossible to reach the figure of blocked coins to the level of 90% with such a high reward for PoS. Also from recent events, you should be aware that a big reward for PoS can have bad consequences.Detailed information and list of changes:Activation of the new protocol\u200a\u2014\u200aApril 8, 2019 18:00 UTC.With activation of the protocol distribution of awards will be as follows:PoS-10%Bronze-15%Silver-20%Gold-25%Platinum-30%Rewards distribution of ESBC BlockchainWith the activation of the protocol, the average time to generate new blocks will increase, by +10 seconds in each week, until it reaches an average value of 120 seconds, 6 weeks after the activation of the protocol.With the activation of the protocol, it becomes possible, if necessary, to enable/disable the commission for the development of the project (dev.fee), up to a maximum of 10% of the reward unit. All planed expences from developers side you will find in the Budget article.All PoS and masternode awards, with an active commission will be reduced by this amount in proportion.With the activation of the protocol, the recommended / minimum transaction fees increase, the possibility of sending small transactions free of charge, up to 1000 bytes, remains.All commissions for transactions included in the block will be added to the block reward, and proportionally distributed among the recipients of the block reward (PoS and masterodes)The minimum quantity for staking becomes 10 coins.What these changes mean for masternode owners:For some period of time, Platinum masternode will have the best performance in comparison with other levels. The total issue of coins it will be about 11 million, where \u22481,000,000 are not in the masternode \\ PoSThus, 10,000,000, according to our estimates, will be used in masternodes, since a 30% reward for the block size is allocated for the Platinum level, it will be more profitable than other Tiers until the Platinum masternode number reaches 12 (10,000,000 * 30%: 250,000)The most favorable conditions for launching other levels:Gold: if the network has less than 50 mastersnotes of this levelSilver: if the network has less than 80 masternotes of this levelBronze: if less than 300 master levels are running on the networkUsers and services that have more than 5 Gold levels will launch Platinum. Starting only 3\u20134 Platinum levels immediately makes the activation of the Gold level profitable, and the participants who used the Silver level for their coins (usually the most profitable one) will replace 2 of their Silver with the Gold level. For services that still use Bronze, it will be convenient to upgrade to the Silver level, in order to increase their own rewards and save resources, we are ready to provide them with a guaranteed amount for the instant node, if necessary. Thus, the entire distribution system will be built from scratch.Services that Platinum Masternodes will use:EvonodesProof of Stake Latinoamerica(discord)After the first increase in block time, ROI will decline when it reaches 120 seconds in 6 weeks, the release of new ones will be halved, which should favorably affect the price of ESBC.How to update:You just need to download and use the new version of the wallet.It will be available on GitHub, we will definitely announce this and you will have about 2 weeks to update.Plans for the future development of wallet and Blockchain:Short term:- Finalization of multisend- Implementation of services from an intranet p2p (peer-to-peer) data transfer based on the network of coin masternodesFuture of ESBC Blockchain:- Gateway to the betting platform inside the wallet on the basis of p2p network- The implementation of the wallet light mode, without the need to store the blockchain, using the masternodes as reference nodes for data processing. Additional commission from transactions of such wallets (integration of mobile wallets on top of this system is possible) will be charged- Avoiding generation of blocks on the basis of pos, on a model with a variable block timing and blocks on demand, based on the masternode network.We are glad to hear your opinion, leave your feedback on our work, suggestions and questions.\u00a0Best regards, ESBC teamLINKS:WebsiteGithubExplorerExplorer officialWhite paperWallets:WindowsLinuxMacSocial:DiscordTelegram news channel\u00a0, RU group, ES group, EN groupTwitterYouTubeInstagram", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "What the Fork is\u00a0Telos?", "author_name": "BlockchainKid", "link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/what-the-fork-is-telos-80c76b0efe2d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 26, 2018", "readtime": "10 min read", "upvotes": "906", "content": "What the Fork is\u00a0Telos?A Closer Look at this EOS Sister\u00a0ChainBlockchainKidBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 26, 2018IntroductionSeveral readers of my last article, in which I presented some concerns I have about the EOS Block Producer (BP) election process, responded with comments about the Telos Blockchain Network (Telos) and the steps that this EOSIO software fork is taking to address issues related to BP elections, among others.With its first go/no-go launch vote scheduled for the end of this week, I\u2019ve decided to take a closer look at Telos and summarize for tokenholders how and why Telos is different, and discuss the potential impact for the EOS and Telos communities. Please note that the rationale for Telos\u2019 approach is based on my own interpretation of Telos documents and various interactions I\u2019ve had with members of the Telos community during the research process. They may not necessarily represent the beliefs of the broader Telos community.Once the Telos network is \u201clive,\u201d EOS tokenholders with a registered account in the EOS Genesis Snapshot (taken on June 2, 2018) will be able to import their Telos tokens (ticker \u201cTLOS\u201d) into their Telos wallet using the their registered Ethereum or EOS address from the snapshot.A Little BackgroundTelos is being launched by a group of contributors known collectively as the Telos Launch Group (TLG). The TLG consists primarily of members of current and former EOS Block Producer candidates, as well as various other developers and blockchain enthusiasts. Many of the TLG were active participants in the EOS mainnet launch, and have remained active in EOS mainnet operations ever since.However, some members of the group have been quite vocal of their concerns regarding the current state and trajectory of the EOS mainnet. Douglas Horn\u200a\u2014\u200aformerly of EOS Americas, an early contributor to the TLG and drafter of the initial whitepaper\u200a\u2014\u200ahas gone on record saying that while he is a big believer in the potential of EOS and the EOSIO software, he has come to think that the EOS mainnet is on a bad path. And now, with the benefit of hindsight and experience, he and the rest of TLG see a unique opportunity for a \u201cdo-over\u201d and chance to launch a version of the chain with several key structural and governance amendments.So What is\u00a0Telos?Perhaps best described as a \u201csister chain,\u201d the Telos Blockchain Network is a fork of the open source EOSIO software which was developed and released by Dan Larimer and Block.one in June 2018.Like EOS, Telos will be a public platform for decentralized applications with incredible scaling potential owing to its advanced technology and delegated proof-of-stake (DPOS) consensus algorithm. Furthermore, it\u2019s being designed to provide EOS mainnet interoperability. At a very high-level, its governance structure will also be similar and Telos will have the same crucial ability to enact the \u201cintent of Code is Law\u201d concept to help avoid critical failures that led to incidents like the Parity wallet hack in 2017.If we dig a little deeper, however, we will find that a number of important differences exist at a structural and governance level which separate Telos and EOS. For a more complete discussion of these differences, I would recommend reading their whitepaper and also visiting their YouTube channel where you can find a lot of good information. However, for the purposes of this article, I am going to focus on what I consider to be the biggest differences between Telos and EOS, and what I think their respective communities are most likely to care about.How is Telos Different?(If you\u2019re short on time, feel free to skip to the graphic at the end of this section for a side-by-side comparison of Telos and EOS that may be easier to digest.)As mentioned above, the Telos Blockchain Network will be launched with a number of structural and governance changes versus EOS. In no particular order, here are what I consider to be the most significant changes that Telos is making:Token Distribution: Like EOS, Telos will rely on registered EOS Genesis Snapshot accounts to determine token distribution. However, Telos is also implementing a 40,000 TLOS token limit which may claimed by a single account. Eligible accounts may claim TLOS on a 1 TLOS\u00a0: 1 EOS ratio based their Genesis Snapshot account balances, subject to this limitation. According to Telos, the intent of this change is to more broadly enfranchise their community by giving meaningful voting power to more tokenholders. Telos says that change this will impact only 0.67% of all registered Genesis accounts and will remove ~865,000,000 tokens from the total token supply.Block Producers: Telos will launch with a maximum of 21 Elected BPs and 30 Standby BPs (SBPs). EOS also has 21 Elected BPs, but has 100 SBPs. Telos\u2019 rationale for this is that having fewer overall BPs enables the network the provide a higher level of baseline pay through Block Producer rewards. As a result, this will allow more BPs to maintain/optimize their equipment and retain key staff to a greater extent, while also providing enough BP depth to ensure network continuity.Top 21 BP Rotation: On EOS, rotation into the Top 21 BPs is entirely vote-driven. On Telos, however, there will be mandatory rotation of all SBPs into the Top 21 for a period of five hours every five days. Telos believes this will support network strength and security by requiring SBPs to regularly prove their readiness and competency.BP Rewards: BP rewards on the EOS mainnet are provided on a descending scale with a \u201cstep-down\u201d that occurs between BP 21 and BP 22 (it\u2019s essentially a fixed block rate plus, if you\u2019re in the Top 21, an amount based on the percentage of votes you have received). The reward ratio between the top and bottom paid BPs on EOS is currently around 8:1. Rewards on Telos will also step down between BP 21 and BP 22, although rewards above and below these positions are \u201cflat-lined\u201d to ensure that the ratio of pay between all Elected BPs and all SBPs is always 2:1. Telos believes their approach will more justly reward Elected BPs and SBPs for performing substantially similar work.Non-Producing BP Time Limit: On EOS, three hours of inactivity are required before other BPs may begin the process to remove a failing BP (this would involve running unregproducer on a failing BP and needs 15 of 20 votes to be approved, assuming one BP is out of commission). On Telos, however, non-producing BPs are simply removed from the Top 21 after 30 minutes of inactivity. Telos\u2019 rationale for this change is that faster rotation of non-performing BPs is important to reduce the likelihood of a network freeze which occurs if six of the Top 21 \u201cgo offline.\u201dToken Voting Power: Each token held on the EOS mainnet represents one vote and may be cast in equal measure for up to 30 BPs. Said differently, each voted token on EOS carries equal weighting. On Telos, voting will be inverse-weighted for up to 30 BPs, meaning that if you only vote for one BP, the strength of that vote is 1/30th of what it would be on EOS. The logic behind this change is to dilute the power of very large tokenholders which may vote (possibly selfishly) for less than 30 BPs.Available RAM: RAM has been one of the most heavily debated issues in the EOS community since the launch. The EOS mainnet launched with 64GB of RAM, and now adds 1kb of RAM to the network per confirmed block. However, Telos is proposing to launch with between 8GB and 16GB of RAM (precise number is TBD as of writing) and add 0.5kb of RAM per confirmed block. Telos believes that this amount of RAM is sufficient to support dApp development and also reduce the incentive for speculators to \u201cland-grab\u201d based on perceived future RAM demand. Telos is also introducing other measures to curb RAM speculation, including the Telos Foundation\u2019s ability to publish guidance on RAM prices and to buy or sell RAM in the open market to help moderate prices.dApp Development: All dApps built on the EOS mainnet are required to be open source. However, dApps built on Telos may be either open source or proprietary. Telos considers the option to develop proprietary software important for incentivizing commercial dApp developers to build on Telos by offering protection for their intellectual property.Annual Inflation: As it stands, annual inflation on EOS is 5% of the total token supply, with 4% going to the Worker Proposal Fund (WPF) and 1% going to BP rewards (although discussions around this are still ongoing). Telos will launch with 2.5% annual inflation with 1.5% going to the WPF and 1% going to BP rewards. Telos\u2019 rationale here is that they want to slow the rate of token depreciation but still provide sufficient funds for projects around code development, new account creation and promotional activities.Token Supply: EOS\u2019 total token supply stands at a fraction over 1 billion EOS. Telos will launch with a total token supply of somewhere between ~190 million and ~330 million tokens. The vast majority of the difference is due to the \u201chair-cutting\u201d of EOS mainnet accounts that hold balances in excess of 40,000 tokens. The precise total TLOS supply is unknown as the extent of cryptocurrency exchange participation, and their willingness to airdrop tokens to individual users on their platform, is still unclear and will impact this number. The lower token supply is essentially a byproduct of the structural changes that Telos has made to the token distribution model. However, it also means that, relative to EOS, each TLOS token will have somewhere between 3x and 5x the network equity value versus each EOS token.Constitution: For legal reasons, EOS was launched with an unratified interim Constitution which has complicated the network\u2019s ability to move forward with its governance responsibilities. The EOS Constitution remains a heavily debated item within the EOS community. Telos have said that they will launch with a valid and enforceable equivalent called the \u201cTelos Network Operating Agreement,\u201d which they believe will make legal and governance issues easier to deal with post-launch.For reference, I\u2019ve summarized each of the above items in this side-by-side comparison exhibit:So\u2026 This is Bad for EOS,\u00a0Right?Ultimately, it\u2019s up to each EOS tokenholder to decide how they feel about competing blockchains borne out of software forks, like Telos. I\u2019ve heard and can understand both sides of the argument. This said, in my opinion, I think it will be a very good thing for EOS in the long-run.When you think about market leaders in any industry, there are usually at least two entities which fiercely compete for market share: Coke and Pepsi, Apple and Samsung, Nike and Adidas, Visa and MasterCard, and Facebook and MySpace. Okay, well maybe not MySpace, but you see my point.Necessity is the mother of invention, and I think that strong but healthy competition between the two networks will spur innovation and creative problem-solving, and hold each network more accountable for the decisions that they make (or don\u2019t make).Wrapping UpHaving spent time researching and gaining a better understanding of what Telos is trying to do, I will say that the changes it is making, particularly to the governance structure, are very intriguing. Telos is undoubtedly in a position of strength having been able to see what has (and has not) worked for EOS so far, and now has the chance the \u201cstart afresh.\u201dWhile Telos doesn\u2019t have the financial resources or community size that EOS has, I could see it becoming a strong competitor to all smart contract platforms, assuming proper execution. However, if I had to pinpoint some areas of the Telos model that I\u2019m still undecided about, they would be the following:While no single account may claim more than 40,000 TLOS upon network launch, there\u2019s nothing to prevent accounts from building significant TLOS positions post-launch. Is this a bad thing? That\u2019s for you to decide. But one thing that we can be sure of is that if Telos is successful, it will experience the same influx of \u201cwhales\u201d that every other successful blockchain project has experienced. It\u2019s worth noting, however, some of the other governance changes that they have made, such as inverse-weighted voting, should help mitigate their impact.Having spent my career in compensation and governance, I understand the importance of providing similar pay for substantially similar work. This said, meritocracies are powerful and I wonder if the 2:1 ratio of Elected BP and SBP rewards is sufficient to attract and retain top BP talent. Like EOS, my perspective is that the primary differentiator for ranking BPs should be their ability to deliver value to the community through value-add projects and tools\u200a\u2014\u200aand the best way to do this is to incentivize out-performance. I am curious whether a 2:1 ratio of rewards between BP 1 and BP 51 is sufficient to achieve that, and would have perhaps considered a 3:1 ratio reserved for the \u201chigh-\u201d and \u201clow-end\u201d of the range.It\u2019s unclear to me how launching with less RAM necessarily reduces the incentive for speculators to buy RAM. Either the perception of future RAM demand is there or there is isn\u2019t, and so buying/selling will adjust accordingly. I also wonder how much the Telos Foundation can realistically impact RAM prices given their resources of scope of responsibilities.Overall, I think there\u2019s a lot of good things to be excited about with Telos and I look forward to seeing how they develop the network going forward. I\u2019d also be interested to hear others\u2019 thoughts about Telos, so please leave a comment below if you have any. Finally, please let me know if you think I\u2019ve misrepresented any of the technical or governance elements of the Telos network and I can update accordingly.

Progressive decentralization could be the\u00a0answer.Arthur CamaraBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 6When we released CryptoKitties a year ago, we opted not to fund it up front with an ICO but instead build it on a sustainable revenue model. That model is this: we collect a fee of 3.75% from every transaction in the game. Given that we\u2019d be unable to change the fee once we launched\u200a\u2014\u200aCryptoKitties is built on the Ethereum blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200apeople often ask how we arrived at that number.It sounds like a smart, well-reasoned choice. I could spin a compelling story about how we ran simulations with advanced prediction models to find the fee that would yield optimal returns.But that\u2019s not true.The truth is we made an educated guess. We picked a number that felt fair and we committed to it.Immutability is awesome and\u00a0scaryWe easily could have chosen wrong, and since you can\u2019t change something once you add it to the blockchain, that would have been cat-astrophic. Fortunately for CryptoKitties, our community is so passionate and the Kitties are so adorable that 3.75% worked just fine.Immutability, the inability to be edited, is at once the blockchain\u2019s greatest strength and its largest barrier to meaningful adoption. The pressures of immortal code paralyze developers: you can tinker in a test environment forever, but there will always be real-world variables you can\u2019t anticipate. Covering your eyes and hitting launch is no way to make breakthroughs. It\u2019s more likely to produce breakdowns.Our fee was just one decision among many: how long should breeding a Kitty take? At what rate should their breeding cooldowns slow? How much should a Gen 0 cat cost? On blockchain, even a seemingly minor choice can pose serious, even critical, consequences.Decentralization offers everyday people immense benefits: the fairness of permanent and universal rules and the transparency of code and behavior which, combined, create security. However, because it\u2019s often implemented with all-or-nothing immutability, blockchain makes agile development impossible and slows teams to a crawl.Agility requires iteration. Iterating quickly is key to building the best products, and the best products spark mass adoption.Enter Progressive DecentralizationWe encountered these barriers ourselves building CryptoKitties, which forced us to negotiate including decentralized features while building something that, ya know, works. Since then, we\u2019ve started exploring progressive decentralization in development, an idea we briefly introduced a while ago.Let\u2019s take a deeper dive now.Simply put, progressive decentralization advocates easing into decentralization in stages rather than diving in headfirst. What that looks like is building mechanisms into smart contracts that confer special powers to the creators up front, then incrementally lock those powers away in a transparent and systematic way.The critical condition is that the locking mechanisms must be public and immutable from the start. The creator can\u2019t decide to tweak the terms later and indefinitely extend their power. That balance is vital: done correctly, progressive decentralization allows creators the flexibility to repair their code without compromising the decentralized features of the contract.Progressive decentralization can take many\u00a0formsThere\u2019s no one right way to implement progressive decentralization. There are dozens of variables to consider, and the best approach will vary from project to project.Here are a couple ways developers could approach progressive decentralization:Author multiple contracts with appropriate separation of concerns and the ability to replace some of those contracts. Some decentralized apps (\u201cdapps\u201d) like Decentraland, which features upgradable contracts, are already using this.Configurable variables and permissions to change those values independently. Etheremon, for instance, grants special permissions to groups of users who become moderators.Incorporate a predefined set of ascending levels in the contract, each allowing the creators certain capabilities. The levels can only be increased, never decreased, so backtracking isn\u2019t an option. On level 1, for example, the contract owners can play around with all gameplay variables. At level 2, their capability to modify core variables ends. At the final level, the contract revokes all their special privileges.To die-hard decentralists, some of this probably sounds too centralized. But this is just the starting point. There are further measures to balance decentralization with iteration. The solution combines transparency of the purpose and the conditions and constraints in the contracts. These constraints could include:Selection: Not everything can be modified, only the specific items that we need to iterate.Range: For many of the questions around game economies, we may have a general idea but not know the precise answer. Limiting configuration to a certain range guarantees users that the iteration will land within a reasonable scope.Direction: Similar to the \u201clevels\u201d concept above, allow certain variables to move only in one direction, decreasing or increasing but never backtracking.Holding creators accountableAll this sounds great in theory. But how do we ensure creators stay true to their roadmap and reach the fully decentralized version of their contracts? How can users opt-in early with the guarantee that the system is an application of progressive decentralization? How can we know we won\u2019t end up with just another flawed, centralized system?Progressive decentralization includes tenets to keep creators accountable:Time- or block-based maturityLock certain configuration values, revoke the owner\u2019s capabilities or move to the next level of maturity past a certain time or block number. Once that point is reached, the contract automatically changes.Imagine, for example, that CryptoKitties had a runway of 360,000 blocks (around 60 days\u2019 time) from the moment it launched to adjust the Kitties\u2019 breeding cooldown variables. We could tweak the cooldown mechanics until that point, giving ourselves the breathing room to perfect the balance, while still guaranteeing players that we wouldn\u2019t have that power indefinitely.Usage-based maturityLock those capabilities once a certain number of users or transactions are completed. This option needs to be carefully thought out to avoid exploits, but we could have, for example, built configurable fees into CryptoKitties that would lock in after 10,000 transactions.Economic incentiveAlign the creator\u2019s incentives with increased decentralization. In this scenario, the creators profit more when the contract becomes more decentralized. Perhaps the fee rises with each level the developer ascends, locking in at the maximum fee when they reach full decentralization. Or, alternatively, perhaps they make no money at all until full decentralization is in place. This financial reward motivates the developer to reach decentralization at a reasonable pace.There\u2019s no best approach to building on the blockchain\u201cProgressive decentralization\u201d is really an umbrella encompassing many strategies, mechanisms, and tools to make building on the blockchain more viable. The best way to apply progressive decentralization will always depend on the project and use a mix of the concepts outlined above.Progressive decentralization is not perfect. The ideal smart contract is simple and straightforward, and these measures add complexity. How and how much to incorporate it is a trade-off that needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.Although it may anger hardline decentralists, we believe progressive decentralization is far better for users in the long run: by giving developers the flexibility to adjust, the consumer gets a more useful product. That means they\u2019ll actually use it, and once it brings value to their lives, they\u2019ll sing its praises to the people around them. That\u2019s how mass adoption starts.Authors: Arthur Camara, Dieter Shirley, and Grady Mitchell", "responses": "11"}, {"title": "Blockchain for Loyalty Rewards\u2753\u2753\u2753", "author_name": "BIGBANG LOYALTY TOKENS", "link": "https://medium.com/@bigbangtoken/blockchain-for-loyalty-rewards-fb6b66c6f809?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 3, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "958", "content": "Blockchain for Loyalty Rewards\u2753\u2753\u2753BIGBANG LOYALTY TOKENSBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 3, 2018(credits to the\u00a0owner)\u2014 Kenny Smith, principal and U.S. banking & securities leader and Eric Piscini, principal and global blockchain leader, Deloitte Consulting LLP; Tanmoy Jadhav, blockchain lab co-leader, Deloitte LLP; and Steve Fromhart, research manager, Deloitte Center for Financial ServicesBlockchain technology has the potential to streamline administration, reduce costs, and improve customer experience for loyalty rewards programs.Customer loyalty and engagement can make or break companies, and as such, loyalty rewards programs represent strategic investments for all types of organizations, including financial institutions, hotel chains, and merchants. Loyalty rewards programs come in many forms, from airline companies\u2019 tiered points programs, which involve partnerships with rental car companies, hotels, restaurants, and shops, to Amazon\u2019s upfront fee program, Amazon Prime, which provides free shipping and allows members to apply rewards points from participating companies toward purchases.Enrollment in loyalty programs across various industries reached 3.3 billion memberships in 2015 and has more than tripled since 2000. Despite this rapid growth, customer loyalty rewards programs are not realizing their full potential. According to the 2016 Bond Loyalty Report, North American consumers belong to 13.4 loyalty programs on average, but are only active in about half of those. Moreover, only 44 percent of consumers said they are \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the loyalty program experiences.Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that provides new ways to transact and maintain records in a secure, digitized, interlinked network, has the potential to eliminate some problems. Blockchain technology can bene\ufb01t di\ufb00erent types of loyalty rewards programs. At the same time, it can signi\ufb01cantly improve the customer experience by allowing consumers to access most, if not all, of their loyalty rewards programs in one digital wallet almost instantaneously.Why Blockchain Is the RemedyBlockchain allows loyalty rewards program providers, administrators, customers, and other parties to interact in one system without compromising privacy or competitive advantage. For loyalty rewards program providers, blockchain has the potential to streamline execution of their programs with near real-time transparency, resulting in savings in administrative and personnel costs.In addition, blockchain can be connected to social media and digital wallets and can interact with existing loyalty rewards program platforms through \u201csmart contracts\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aself-executing computer programs that automatically implement the terms of an agreement between parties when conditions are met.How Blockchain WorksBlockchain has the potential to allow near-instantaneous creation, redemption, and exchange of loyalty rewards points across programs, vendors, and industries in a secure environment. Through a rigorous online protocol, well-programmed building blocks, and smart contracts, blockchain has the capability to operate without intermediaries. Blockchain-enabled loyalty rewards systems incorporate:Loyalty network platform. The platform can connect multiple organizations\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as airlines, banks, and retailers\u200a\u2014\u200aand their loyalty programs. It facilitates their interactions, especially the converting and exchanging of points. The platform connects programs through blockchain nodes, which reach consensus about a transaction without the need for a middleman or clearinghouse.Rewards applications. Rewards applications, via a digital wallet, will contain identities in the form of digital signatures, which store value in the form of loyalty tokens. Loyalty program providers can set up rewards applications that connect to the loyalty network to execute transactions for customers. Program providers can control exactly how their customers access and redeem rewards.Loyalty tokens. On initiation of a loyalty transaction\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as the issuance, redemption, or exchange of a reward\u200a\u2014\u200ablockchain creates a computer-generated loyalty token, which is a base for all types of rewards, including points. The loyalty token\u2019s unique identi\ufb01ers can be updated on each participant\u2019s ledger and made available across the network. Several online protocol rules govern the way the points behind these tokens function.With blockchain technology, the customer experience would be greatly improved. Consider Alice. When she purchased an airline ticket with a credit card, the airline and credit card provider could immediately transfer loyalty tokens to her digital wallet. During her trip, she could access the loyalty points and redeem them with another network participant such as a large hotel. She could also make micropurchases\u200a\u2014\u200aa cup of coffee, for instance\u200a\u2014\u200aalong the way. The transactions would be instantaneous and secure, there would be only one user interface, and Alice could use the accumulated points in the manner she chose.Creating Unique Business OpportunitiesCreating an interlinked network will give loyalty rewards providers with well-developed programs unique opportunities to o\ufb00er value-added services to other businesses. For example, a bank that provides merchant banking and treasury management services to small businesses could offer those customers access to its loyalty rewards interlinked network. In addition, the bank could o\ufb00er its merchant customers the opportunity to join the overall interlinked network on the merchant\u2019s own terms through a tailored rewards application. This would enable the business to o\ufb00er its clients loyalty points that could be redeemed within a wider network.The bank would be adding a valuable service to its small-business client while the loyalty network gained another vendor that could interact with other loyalty rewards programs. For example, a local co\ufb00ee shop that was a\ufb00orded entry into the network by its bank could o\ufb00er its customers opportunities to use their coffee points toward accommodations at a hotel in another state in which it previously had little to no brand recognition.Getting to Blockchain ImplementationWhat is needed to develop a functional blockchain network for loyalty rewards program providers? First, a blockchain network needs critical mass. It is crucial to get buy-in from at least a handful of loyalty program providers that already have well developed loyalty rewards programs and scale. Their success in developing programs will open the gates for others. Second, accepted protocols and standardization should be part of the process.Hundreds of blockchain initiatives are already underway in various industries, particularly \ufb01nancial services, but standardization is far from a reality. One attractive feature of loyalty rewards is that they are not core to business revenue and operations, so companies may be more willing to join consortium e\ufb00orts. A best-case scenario would be a blockchain facilitator such as a technology company building a network on a solid protocol and obtaining enough buy-in to develop standards for blockchain in the loyalty rewards space.*****While blockchain technology is still in the early stages of adoption, it could prove valuable for loyalty rewards program providers. Companies willing to implement blockchain for customer loyalty programs could see benefits including lower administrative costs, improved customer experiences, and increased user engagement.Source: https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/2017/03/07/using-blockchain-for-loyalty-rewards/", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Reflections on the Best Blockchain Tweets Ever\u00a0Written", "author_name": "Daniel Jeffries", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/reflections-on-the-best-blockchain-tweets-ever-written-d488af960d4f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 15, 2017", "readtime": "15 min read", "upvotes": "3.3K", "content": "Reflections on the Best Blockchain Tweets Ever\u00a0WrittenDaniel JeffriesBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 15, 2017If you don\u2019t know Naval Ravikant, you should. When it comes to investing, he\u2019s the best of the best. He\u2019s backed over a 100 companies, including tech unicorns that went on to become runaway successes, like Twitter and Uber. He also founded AngelList, a kind of speed-dating resource for angel investors and entrepreneurs.But that\u2019s not really enough for me to give the man much credit. Unlike a lot of folks, I\u2019m not dazzled by success. You can be successful and be an idiot. As Eckhart Tolle once said \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be smart to make money, you just have to be clever.\u201dBut Ravikant is smart.And not just because his top books list matches up pretty closely with some of my favorites.I\u2019ve probably read Siddhartha (Hilda Rosner translation) about twenty times in my life. If you\u2019re surprised to see a bunch spiritual and philosophical books on an angel investor\u2019s list, that should be your first clue that you\u2019re in the presence of a unique mind. Most of the business school bros I knew at NYU thought Ayn Rand\u2019s The Fountainhead was the only book ever written.Flip through Ravikant\u2019s Twitter feed or listen to this interview and you\u2019ll quickly realize that more than anything the man knows how to think. Critical thinking is the most essential skill for today and tomorrow\u2019s world.Most recently he\u2019s been thinking about blockchain (along with the two other technologies that I see as the most world-changing, CRISPR and AI). A few weeks back he dropped an epic series of 36 tweets on blockchain and the markets of tomorrow. They\u2019re destined to go down as classics. I\u2019ve already read them dozens of times and I will read them dozens more. Every time I look at them they deliver deeper insights.They\u2019re a fractal that seems to go down forever.There\u2019s no way he tossed them out off-the-cuff. And if he did, God bless him, he\u2019s even smarter than I thought. But I doubt it. It\u2019s obvious they represent the crystal clear distillation of years of thinking about what the blockchain means for societies and the world.The blockchain revolution is coming like a tsunami that will remake every aspect of society but most folks don\u2019t see it yet. That\u2019s because their true impact is still to come. People often struggle to understand breakthrough technologies because they have no frame of reference for it. Imagine describing a web browser to an 18th century farmer. It won\u2019t even begin to make any sense.To this day, even many of the brilliant people I admire look at Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as:a Ponzi schemea tulip crazean evil plot by Libertarians to take over the worlda drug dealer currencynerd moneyCrypto coverage in the popular press is generally atrocious (it\u2019s been declared dead about a 1000 times even as it continues to grow and thrive), though it\u2019s getting better inch by inch. I did my best to knock down most of those arguments in my article \u201cWhy Everyone Missed the Most Important Invention in the Last 500 Years\u201d but of course most people don\u2019t let logic get in the way of a good knee-jerk reaction. In the end, cryptos and blockchains will need to follow an old writer\u2019s maxim to prove themselves to the world:Show don\u2019t tell.In other words, they\u2019ll have to start powering things other than day-trading for regular folks to get it. That\u2019s coming. But until blockchain\u2019s \u201cMozilla moment\u201d, when it becomes so easy that grandma can use it, we\u2019ll just have to gaze into our crystal balls to figure out where things are going.And that\u2019s what Naval\u2019s tweets are about. Where this is all going.We\u2019ll start at the beginning:\u201cBlockchains will replace networks with markets.\u201dWhat the heck does he mean here? To understand that, you have to understand what he means by networks.The dictionary defines a network as \u201ca group or system of interconnected people or things.\u201d Other definitions include, \u201cany net like combination of filaments, lines, veins, passages.\u201d There\u2019s also the idea of a \u201csystems perspective\u201d which is \u201ctaking into account all of the behaviors of a system as a whole in the context of its environment.\u201dBut really, a network is a metapattern. It\u2019s a web of connections across space, time and mind.Think of the crisscrossing streets in a big city or the maze of sewers under those streets. Your nervous system and the densely packed dendritic forest in your head are all networks, as are the winding rivers that surge across the land like the arteries of the Earth.But networks aren\u2019t just physical things. They\u2019re \u201cphysical, digital, and mental roads connecting us all.\u201d That means that seen from a different angle, almost everything is a network, from the tangled web of belief systems in our minds, to the verbal interplay of ideas between different people, to the way money and energy and waves of digital information flow around our planet.\u201cOverlapping networks create and organize our society\u2026Money is a network. Religion is a network. A corporation is a network. Roads are a network. Electricity is a network.\u201dSome of these are obvious and some not so much. Roads are easy but a corporation? That\u2019s a network of people all working towards a common goal. Religion? That\u2019s a web of people united by common beliefs.The world evolves through the push and pull of these different groups. People with common belief systems cluster together, forming complex chains of influence, economic and military power. The tribes and clans of early man never left us, they just expanded outward like ripples in a pond, becoming more intricate.These mega-clans battle it out with each other in an all-out bid to expand. As they convert more people to their way of seeing the universe, their web of influence grows. Each person they add increases their power.\u201cNetworks have \u2018network effects.\u2019 Adding a new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants. Network effects thus create a winner-take-all dynamic. And the Rulers of these networks become the most powerful people in society.\u201dThe more they expand, the more they shape the very fabric of reality. \u201cThe leading network tends towards becoming the only network.\u201d Their network becomes the network we all live and work in. If that network is good, then life is good. If that network is evil then life is miserable and filled with suffering.But how do we get to a good or bad network?Simple. There are two ways to achieve network dominance:Violence and controlOpenness and meritocracyIf you look closely, you\u2019ll see two very different belief systems at work here.The dark reality of closed systems like fascism and communism.One is a dark reality. Rage and anger are the guiding emotions. These belief systems see rigid hierarchies as paramount. Only certain people should control what everyone else does. Adherents to this philosophy worship status and power. Violence is their primary weapon.On the flip side of the coin, good networks are \u201copen and meritocratic.\u201d They are collaborative and inclusive. The best ideas win and they can come from anywhere. Class and hierarchy melt away and the ideal approach shines through and gets adopted by the network as a whole. This is a pragmatic philosophy, one that never seeks a fight, but will finish one if forced into it.The battle between these philosophies is eternal.Closed is darkness.Openness is light.The history of the world is a war between closed and open, between centralized and decentralized, between rigid and fluid.The pendulum swings back and forth, forever and ever.In North Korea, a powerful strongman seizes control and creates a closed system that warps reality into a sickening nightmare of fear and terror. In another part of the world, in an earlier age, the students of English Enlightenment philosophers toss tea into the sea and start an open system revolution that leads them to become the most powerful nation on Earth two hundred years later.These are not coincidences. They are fixed, deterministic results, as inevitable as night and day. Closed leads to decay and death, while open leads to growth and expansion.Each of these philosophies has branching possibilities that spring directly from their starting viewpoint.Some paths open up and some are absolutely closed off.For example, a violent regime is never creative other than in the use of torture and fear. The creative branch withers and dies. The possibilities close up like sealed doors. That\u2019s why North Korea delivers no new innovation to the world, no new ideas, no products. North Korea\u2019s only \u201ccreativity\u201d is with genocide, as they wipe out three generations of a family for even the slightest perceived insult. Instead, their focus is turned inward, paranoid, dark, constrained, like a tree bound with ropes that forces it to grow stunted.Every possibility is connected to the one before it like beads on a string.As Yoda said, \u201cFear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.\u201dOver time these branching paths expand ever outward, breeding either more despair or more joy and freedom. An object in motion tends to stay in motion. It either continues towards darkness and decay, or grows and flourishes, stretching to the light.Unless it\u2019s disrupted.Disruption leads to change and new possibilities.The Coming\u00a0RebirthWe need disruption now more than ever.For fifty years, the world has trended towards more and more centralization, control and inequality. The pendulum has swung too far. Now even networks that started out as open and meritocratic are starting to decay. They are over-centralized and overspecialized.\u201cOverspecialize and you breed in weakness. It\u2019s slow death.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aGhost in the ShellWe\u2019re seeing this on so many parts of the planet right now, as democratic nations give way to plutocracies and kleptocracies or outright authoritarian regimes, like in Turkey and the Philippines. These nations fall apart through mismanagement, insane economic policies, corruption, and warped views of reality, as we\u2019ve seen in Venezuela, where the worst people come to power, make terrible decisions and burn their own house down with everyone in it.What causes one system to fail and another to succeed?Belief systems.Your beliefs determine your reality.\u201cYour beliefs become your thoughts,\u00a0Your thoughts become your words,\u00a0Your words become your actions,\u00a0Your actions become your habits,\u00a0Your habits become your values,\u00a0Your values become your destiny.\u201d\u2014 GandhiEvery belief system thinks it has a complete picture of the truth.None of them do. Not yours or mine or anyone else\u2019s.Instead we\u2019re only moving closer to the Truth or further away from it. If we refuse to see what is right in front of us, our decisions can only fail because they started from a false premise. False beginnings lead to false endings.Each person and each group is like a point on a sphere, limited by what we can see from our particular angle, but imagining that we can see the whole sphere.The degree to which groups see reality as it actually is versus how they imagine it to be determines their level of suffering.If two groups have different dreams of reality, who wins?How do we decide?One of the most powerful systems we\u2019ve ever created is the marketplace. If I think I have a good or service people want, that is my belief system. It may be correct or incorrect. My product may be fantastic or terrible.Either way the market will let me know. If nobody buys it, I\u2019m likely doing something wrong. Maybe I\u2019m not selling it right or maybe the product just isn\u2019t that good after all and I need to go back to work to improve it?Markets are imperfect but they\u2019re constantly adjusting towards better and better answers, inching towards the truth. The best answers increase the wealth and value of the entire system, as well as the individuals. Players in the game work towards a positive Nash equilibrium, as detailed in the book and movie A Beautiful Mind.Eventually the market gets it \u201cright.\u201d The world may ignore the genius of Van Gogh in his lifetime, only to later realize just how incredible those swirling strokes of green and gold are and respond by shoveling out millions of dollars for each painting.Throughout history markets and networks were related but separate. Markets were nothing but a kind of network. They did little more than act as a way to exchange goods and services. The true power lay in the power of the clan, in the power of violence, coercion and scarcity.Until now.Today the era of violent clans is rapidly coming to a close because of a brand new kind of marketplace:\u201cMarket networks. Open AND meritocratic.\u201dBlockchains fuse the market and network into a brilliant, hybrid system.\u201cBlockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network to govern without a ruler and without money. They are merit-based, tamper-proof, open, voting systems. The meritorious are those who work to advance the network. As society gives you money for giving society what it wants, blockchains give you coins for giving the network what it wants.\u201dThese coins demand different kinds of work. Each blockchain has its own purpose. For example, \u201cBitcoin pays for securing the ledger. Ethereum pays for (executing and verifying) computation.\u201dThe chains often espouse a UNIX-like philosophy of \u201cdoing one thing only and hence one thing well,\u201d instead of trying to do fifty things and sucking at all of them. As the market-network evolves, we will see increasingly specialized networks, ones that do distributed, tamper-proof storage well, others that handle decentralized identities, another that executes smart contracts and more advanced legal frameworks, etc.But these networks will work far more efficiently than our current systems.In today\u2019s specialized networks power becomes concentrated in the hands of a few warlords, who become increasingly powerful and cut off from the hopes and dreams of the rest of the world. Eventually greed and stupidity lead them astray and they look to rig the game in their favor by backdooring and crippling the network. When one viewpoint manages to dominate all the rest, society begins to decay and collapse. The system becomes intolerable for the rest and eventually erupts.But decentralized blockchain systems can withstand attempts by hostile actors to corrupt them, to warp them to their own limited reality viewpoint. That\u2019s because no one group of belief systems controls the keys to the kingdom. Instead, every participant in the network holds the keys, effectively distributing power across the entire system.That leads to a new dynamic:Competing groups must cooperate to reach consensus or they crash the whole system and they all suffer.Contrast that to today\u2019s world, where a system can be rigged by a single powerful group, and because they have no empathy for other groups than themselves (a characteristic of clan-think), they do tremendous damage to the whole, causing widespread suffering, all while imagining they\u2019re doing good.We see that with the modern banking system. The banking system holds all the money and makes all the rules. They buy the influence and bend the rules of the commonwealth to their will. If they have their way, they\u2019ll build crippled blockchains they control, so they can continue to arbitrarily change the rules of the game to their advantage. These are elite and mob controlled blockchains: in short, broken and useless blockchains that are not blockchains at all.\u201cIt\u2019s nonsensical to have a blockchain controlled by a sovereign, a corporation, an elite, or a mob.\u201dThe reason is simple. Only when the bankers, the bank shareholders, the bank deposit holders and the regulators simultaneously hold the keys can we achieve true equilibrium. Because we all have divergent interests, different belief systems, and different pieces of the puzzle, we will have to come to an agreement that benefits the whole system or we crash it. And since nobody wants to crash the whole system, because we\u2019ll lose everything, we\u2019ll find a way to come to an agreement, against all odds.This is a bit like how Satoshi describe the \u201c51% problem\u201d in the original Bitcoin paper. If a miner or group of miners achieves 51% of the mining power they can\u2019t change historical transactions, but they can alter and reject current transactions. Yet Satoshi wisely saw this as a non-issue. If anyone actually commits the massive amount of time and money to build up that much mining power, they benefit much more from keeping the system running smoothly. By cheating the system, they make a tiny gain but undermine confidence in the system as a whole, which tanks the market and makes all their time and money spent worthless.\u201cMerit in markets is determined by a commitment of resources. The resource is money, a form of frozen and trade-able time\u201dNobody wants to burn up all of that \u201cfrozen and trade-able time\u201d so their energy is channeled from destructive behavior into behavior that benefits the entire system and keeps it running smoothly.The Fractal\u00a0UniverseThe possibilities of blockchains are endless, from transparent end to end verifiable voting, to stock and share issuance, \u201cto security, computation, prediction, attention, bandwidth, power, storage, distribution, content\u201d and more.I won\u2019t go into all the specifics here, because I\u2019ve already done that in a number of other articles that you can check out, if you like, but needless to say:Over time the possibilities will only expand and flourish, rippling into every aspect of life. Blockchains will spawn a burgeoning ecosystem of micro-economies stacked on micro-economies, connected in infinite regress by larger meta-chains.And that will change the world.Today our networks are governed by \u201ckings, priests, elites, corporations and mobs.\u201d Think of it as a game of thrones. It\u2019s a dark and brutal game.Blockchains flip that dynamic on its head forever. They will dramatically change the balance of power on the planet for the better.\u201cBlockchains\u2019 open and merit based markets can replace networks previously run by kings, corporations, aristocracies, and mobs.\u201dThe power of decentralization will start small and grow exponentially, following Kurzweil\u2019s \u201claw of accelerating returns.\u201d\u201cBlockchain based market-networks will replace existing networks. Slowly, then suddenly. In one thing, then in many things.\u201dThe transition will be bumpy and shocking to many.It may even be nasty, as dying clans struggle to hold-on to the past at all costs. But eventually, they will pass into the pages of history like the Trilobites.And when it\u2019s all over, nobody will mourn the loss of the old, broken, decaying, power hungry and violent networks of kings, queens, mobs, and corporations.############################################If you love my work please do me the honor of visiting my Patreon page because that\u2019s how we change the future together.

The ability to draw an unprecedented quality and quantity of insights from astronomical amounts of data and fine-tune business operations has proven to be a technological marvel in the modern economy. While big data is set to only get bigger, its pressing problems cannot be ignored.Data analytics is a fairly new discipline that has grown exponentially and evolved over the past five years with the advent of computer technology, namely machine learning. With the mass adoption and usage of smartphones and internet globally, vast amounts of data can now be tracked and collected. Yet, the data collection and analytics industry is currently functioning on outdated models that are unsustainable and non-compliant with today\u2019s regulatory demands.As it stands, the industry is centralized in the hands of a few large data brokerages and data trading networks who don\u2019t usually consider the user\u2019s rights or consent. Having our data in the hands of a few large corporations means they can abuse their access to our information through their roles as collectors or custodians. This can be seen through several high profile leaks and hacks of large databases containing millions of people\u2019s most intimate data.Those in charge of centralized databases have not proved to be the most competent in computer security procedures to protect the data they have in their possession. The Equifax hack, for instance, resulted in hackers obtaining 145 million Americans\u2019 Social Security numbers, birthdays, driver\u2019s license numbers, addresses, tax identification numbers, driver\u2019s license states and issuance dates, as well as some email addresses. Meanwhile, Singapore recently had its worst cyber attack in history, with hackers stealing the personal information of 1.5 million SingHealth patients.These massive data breaches have caused legislators to closely examine how companies collect, use, and store data, resulting in new sweeping data regulations. The most far reaching and important of these being the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) recently implemented by the EU.Major issues with the data industry in its current iterationData is now one of the most valuable resources for many companies across several leading industries. It has been called \u201cthe new oil\u201d as data collection and analysis has revolutionized the way successful businesses create their profit models. However, having vast amounts of data is a double-edged sword, as bad data can be catastrophic to a data-driven business model. In fact, bad data can cost between 10\u201325% of a business\u2019 revenue. The source of data and the way it is collected is essential to its quality. It has been said the way data is collected is as important as the data itself.Let\u2019s take a look at the effects bad data can have on businesses: (source: Integrate, Data Quality Index, 2015)25% of the average database\u2019s records are inaccurate60% of those surveyed rate the overall health of their data as unreliable80% of those surveyed say they have \u201crisky\u201d phone recordsA B2B quality index shows 40% of leads contain bad dataBad data costs the US alone, over $3 billion USD a yearHow data is collected, sourced, and handled varies and is typically undocumented. To resolve this, data governance should meet two very important requirements: it must take into consideration the way the data is sourced and collected, and it must address and document any changes or manipulations made to the data for analysis purposes. There should be a data specific \u201cchain of custody\u201d that should be adhered to whenever someone analyzes, processes or collects data.The blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that is used to record transactions occurring in a network, secured using cryptographic technology. Due to the immutable and cryptographically verified security of a blockchain network, it offers a way to remedy the issues currently present in the data industry.Blockchain startups are meeting the demand to provide this\u00a0solutionDue to the way the data market is structured as of now, it is ripe for disruption and blockchain is a logical way forward. The market always meets demand and recent blockchain startups have begun to tackle the issue head-on. A startup, SWIPECrypto (SWIPE), is building a blockchain-based data monetization platform, complete with a privacy and data sharing protocol and governance layers. It focuses on empowering user data privacy and building a data ecosystem where key stakeholders are adequately compensated for their efforts.The core method SWIPE is using for data collection is its suite of software development kit (SDK) tools that can be integrated by mobile app developers to collect user data. SWIPE\u2019S SDK also doubles as in-app marketing tools to help increase user engagement, usage, and retention, hence supporting data collection. All data collected through SWIPE is aggregated, anonymized and encrypted to protect user privacy but retain data buyers with the ability to audit and verify the provenance of the data through the blockchain. This SDK suite, with its data sharing protocol and decentralized data marketplace, forms the SWIPE network, where data providers and data purchasers can interact directly in an ecosystem without the data brokerages and data trading networks acting as 3rd party intermediaries with rent-seeking fees.SWIPE already has market research industry leaders in the Asia region on board as SWIPE data monetization partners, including Performars (South Korea), GMO Research (Japan), Paneland (China), and Acorn Asia (Singapore and Hong Kong)\u00a0, who are purchasing data collected in SWIPE network. The network also has a strong portfolio of major banks and FMCG brands as clients, such as DBS, Coca-Cola, Chanel, AXA, Aviva, Barclays Bank, Adidas, Tesco, and many more. The future goals of the SWIPE data infrastructure are to forge partnerships with other industry leaders to provide a next-generation blockchain platform that ensures data is collected in an ethical and responsible fashion that benefits all participants in the SWIPE blockchain infrastructure.\u201cThanks to the collaboration with SWIPE, Performars will now be able to obtain fair and transparent data analysis and marketing insights from Southeast Asia\u201d, said Richard Jo, Chief Customer Officer of Performars. \u201cWe want to ensure our efforts in analyzing marketing data for our clients, who wants to expand their business in Southeast Asia will be accurate and accountable.\u201dSWIPE\u2019s use of blockchain will enable a better solution for data purchasers, providers, and users, cutting out the middleman and allowing participants to transact directly through the SWIPE platform with auditability, accountability, and transparency as core features.Data breaches and privacy violations are not expected to stop if we continue to store and trade data using centralized service and platforms. Global opinion and regulations are demanding methods to safeguard and protect user privacy, and blockchain startups like SWIPE are actively taking a bold step towards securing the future of a fairer data ecosystem for all. SWIPE is attracting industry thought leaders and professionals to join their management and advisory team who are committed to solving this issue, including Rebecca Tan, the former Managing Director for the Nielson Company in Singapore.\u201cI specialised in digital and data analytics measurement during my 18-year stint as the Managing Director of SEA Media & Digital, Nielsen,\u201d said Rebecca Tan, Strategy & Data Analytics Consultant for SWIPE. \u201cAs such, I fully understand the issues of the current model of data collection and need for greater transparency. SWIPE has developed concrete plans, with the help of blockchain technology, to resolve these data leak and privacy issues, and I am excited to be part of this team!\u201d", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "Blockchain\u2019s Destiny: The Utility-Token", "author_name": "Game Loot Network", "link": "https://medium.com/@gamelootnetwork/blockchains-destiny-the-utility-token-8f7e4d48b626?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 2, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "3.2K", "content": "Blockchain\u2019s Destiny: The Utility-TokenGame Loot NetworkBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 2, 2018After massive gains, doomsday prophets dubbed the crypto market a bubble wrought by speculative hype. The pessimists are absolutely correct. Everyone in the space acknowledges the impending calamity, yet no one wants to admit that their chosen coin might fall away, float off like wayward vapor. The issue stems from the reason people purchase cryptocurrency. No one takes a genuine interest in proposed blockchain solutions or technological innovations; these developments exist as window dressing, mere signs a coin\u2019s price may go up. Too often no one intends to actually use the technology. They just eye the market ticker as the value of their stockpile increases.In December of 2017 none of this mattered. Newcomers perused some articles published by their chosen ICO, glanced at a Reddit page, and then watched investments skyrocket. You bought coins and made money. All the while you thought of yourself as an adept tradesman, profits sure to grow directed by your masterful hands. But now, the market-wide supernova, where coins arbitrarily shoot up 300%, is over. Enthusiasm wanes underfoot of a vengeful bear.So what\u2019s next? Bitcoin will be forced to innovate, gain adopters who actually want to use it, or it will crumble under the weight of avarice. The idea that the first and biggest crypto cannot fade to irrelevance is the oldest naivete; Rome fell, and the Titanic bit the bubbles. If unaddressed, ships with holes in the hull eventually sink. It just takes a while. The general market can never thrive tethered to the ever-changing health of Bitcoin.Soon investors will turn to utility-tokens for their market independence and incentivized use-cases. These currencies differ from other coins; utility-tokens are not bound by fickle hype. Users will buy them not for their speculative value but to actually use the token. The problem arose when no one wanted to exchange goods and services for cryptocurrencies. Speculation, the fickle mistress, cannot exist as the sole source of demand. Downward volatility shook the faith, and it will not return for a long while, if ever. Market movements will not affect well-crafted utility tokens because they generate value through use rather than storage. Meaning their design incentivizes users to exploit the token\u2019s functionality instead of exchanging the currency on the open market.For instance, let\u2019s say my utility-token allows you to crowdfund an indie developer\u2019s video game idea (more on this later). Instead of selling my cryptocurrency, I re-invest my tokens into a crowdfunding portal on the blockchain in order to sponsor the in-development game. When the hypothetical game gets fully funded and is later monetized, the finished creation pays me lifelong dividends corresponding to my earlier investment. Now I\u2019ve generated more from using the token than I would have from selling it. Currency of this nature promises to persist unhampered by the movement of Bitcoin. Properly engineered utility-tokens will exist within internal economies. Supply and demand can then be handcrafted to benefit all members of the token\u2019s ecosystem. These cryptocurrencies will not be subject to the overarching market, only the value of the services they offer.Unfortunately, creating benefits based internal economies does not appear on the average ICO\u2019s to-do list. Most companies rarely concern themselves with more than empty promises, saying the word \u201cdecentralization\u201d and gulping down your money. Game Loot Network has developed a gaming distribution platform, soon realizing that our proposed features required the blockchain and cryptocurrency.To develop our marketing strategy, we surveyed the ICO landscape. We quickly noted the fluff that everyone observes, ideas without any product behind them blissfully generating millions of dollars. The conmen behind these companies suckled money from money-eyed hopefuls like mosquitos at the vein. Everyone promised vague tech revolutions, but it seemed clear that nothing existed behind the facade. Yet these companies overflowed with cash, so how could we appeal to a space that preferred hollow buzz to authentic utility? The answer seemed obvious once it came. Forget the rules, abandon the ICO script, and leave the get-rich-quick crowd to their schemes. The community we build cannot consist of folks waiting to sell from the sidelines. True disruption requires a utile product and real engagement, or it\u2019s just hype masquerading as revolution.Our platform is transformative. It enables indie game developers and rewards gamers like nothing else yet created, and our LOOT utility-token functions exactly as I said utility-tokens should. And there\u2019s more than a roadmap. Call us crazy, but we were bold enough to create an actual product. We will forever alter the gaming industry. But it\u2019s possible that Game Loot Network has nothing to offer you. We don\u2019t want speculators. The time has come to take gaming back from the corporations and give it to the users. For that, you need revolutionaries.", "responses": "7"}, {"title": "Blockchain 101\u200a\u2014\u200aonly if you \u2018know nothing\u2019!", "author_name": "Ritesh", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-101-only-if-you-know-nothing-b883902c59f7?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 24, 2017", "readtime": "15 min read", "upvotes": "4.2K", "content": "Blockchain 101\u200a\u2014\u200aonly if you \u2018know nothing\u2019!RiteshBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 24, 2017Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Ethereum\u200a\u2014\u200ayou must have heard about these buzzwords.

The idea is pretty simple: if people start living in VR, its rules and systems will be just as important as the \u201creal\u201d world\u2019s.To illustrate why, imagine if everyone lived in World of Warcraft or the virtual world that Facebook is building. People\u2019s social lives, assets, and jobs will be tied up in this world. And that means that the central company running the world could take it all away on a whim should it suit them.This is the source of a massive plot hole in the recent popular novel Ready Player One. It describes a virtual world, OASIS, where people spend most of their time. A huge corporation called Innovative Online Industries (IOI) owns and runs the OASIS. A race to find a treasure in the world ensues. Normal people end up battling employees of IOI to find it. While the book is entertaining, since IOI owns and controls the OASIS\u2019 servers and databases, they could do whatever they want: delete other people, access any information, change the rules of the world, and print themselves infinite currency.So it\u2019s pretty clear that one company can\u2019t control the Metaverse\u200a\u2014\u200aotherwise it could take away everything you own, change who you are, or even delete you.Blockchains are an answer to many of these hard problems. If your assets are on a blockchain, no single operator of a world can take them from you. If your identity lives on the blockchain, you can\u2019t be deleted. Perhaps most interestingly, just like bitcoin provides the incentives for computers all around the world to run the most powerful computing network in the world\u200a\u2014\u200amore than 500 Googles or 10,000 of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers\u200a\u2014\u200awhat if the servers running the world were similarly decentralized or all that compute power went towards running the world?If all this sounds far fetched or too futuristic, World of Warcraft had 12 million players spend an average of 22 hours a week in their world\u2014 and that was in 2010! Once in, people go deep: 90% of players play more than 10 hours a week. For better or worse, I am speaking from experience. And these economies become very real. At one point over 100,000 people were making their living in World of Warcraft by earning and selling gold, the in-game currency.When people think about the \u201cMetaverse\u201d, they usually think about an immersive visual and sensory experience. The definition proposed for the Metaverse at the beginning of the weekend retreat was \u201ca traversable network of visually immersive, synchronously multi-user heterogeneous virtual worlds\u201d. However, the visually immersive part is the most superfluous. The most important part\u200a\u2014\u200awhat makes these worlds traversable and connected\u200a\u2014\u200ais the shared data layer between them. Without a shared data layer it\u2019d be impossible to travel around seamlessly as the same virtual \u201cyou\u201d. Since humans relate much more to crazy visual experiences than a data layer, this makes sense. However, I\u2019d argue the shared data layer is what makes the Metaverse the Metaverse. And that data layer will be blockchain-based.When you drill down, blockchains are really a shared version of reality everyone agrees on. So whether it\u2019s a fully immersive VR experience, augmented reality, or even Bitcoin or Ethereum in the physical world as a shared ledger for our \u201creal world\u201d, we\u2019ll increasingly trust blockchains as our basis for reality. The lines between these virtual worlds and the \u201creal world\u201d will blur quickly. If someone builds a peer to peer lending app on top of a blockchain so that people can lend money from the US to Brazil, that exact same app is immediately available in every virtual world because it all runs on the same blockchain.It will be interesting to see how virtual worlds develop. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if people start by building closed worlds, especially the large incumbents (ex: Facebook) who have big private databases and entrenched network effects around them to defend. Just like the walled gardens of AOL and CompuServe at the beginning of the internet, that could work well for a few years, but eventually will get steamrolled by open worlds the same way AOL and Compuserve got steamrolled by the open internet. If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s a huge opportunity to start by building with an open mindset.I suspect a successful business model to create these worlds will be the blockchain-based token model. The second largest crowdfund in history was for a virtual world\u200a\u2014\u200aStar Citizen\u200a\u2014\u200afor over $140m. Over $250m has been crowdfunded on the blockchain in the last year. Developers can fund the creation of their worlds this way, give people incentives to join their world through the token of the world, and use that native token for governance.I walked away from the weekend realizing virtual worlds are going to be one of the first killer apps for blockchains and perhaps the deepest users of them. I\u2019d guess blockchains will be the full blown backbone of virtual worlds\u200a\u2014\u200athe system for currency, assets, identity, even governance\u200a\u2014\u200abefore doing the same in the \u201creal world\u201d. Which is where I think we will end up in the real world eventually; it\u2019s just a matter of which goes first and how long until it\u2019s the case for both.Thanks to Brian Armstrong, Barry Schuler, Mike Capps, and others for contributing to ideas in this article.", "responses": "43"}, {"title": "Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts: 6 Benefits for Video Content\u00a0Creators", "author_name": "Creator.ai", "link": "https://medium.com/@creatorai/blockchain-technology-and-smart-contracts-6-benefits-for-video-content-creators-115604d8c64d?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 28, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "1.5K", "content": "Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts: 6 Benefits for Video Content\u00a0CreatorsCreator.aiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 28, 2018In a world of limitless connectivity and effortless shareability, one would think that the creator-to-consumer network would be a little less brokered. In such a world\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is, from the standpoint of creative industry, somewhat ideal\u200a\u2014\u200athe artists would be rewarded for their creative labour directly. But things are not always what they seem.The blockchain technology is changing this as we speak, bringing new and exciting opportunities for video content creators and their fellow artists to produce, protect, and monetize their creations.Here\u2019s how.What is Blockchain Technology?Photo credit: Pixabay.comNamed the new Web 3.0, the blockchain technology adds another layer of functionality to the internet. At the same time, blockchain serves as a public database and a data protector\u200a\u2014\u200abeing a decentralized version of the web, it guarantees both transparency and proper rights management.Developed to power Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain allows for digital information to be distributed across multiple locations. The data, hosted not by one, but by millions of computers simultaneously, is then accessible to all participants, yet safe from corruption, fraud, and digital theft.How Do Smart Contracts Fit\u00a0In?The main benefit of blockchain technology is that it cuts the middleman from the value chain, enabling non-brokered exchange of information and digital goods. In terms of monetization control, it uses smart contracts in order to make sure that all transactions are done in a safe, conflict-free way.Smart contracts, otherwise known as digital contracts, blockchain contracts, or self-executing contracts, are code-based and triggered by a predetermined procedure. Like everything else on blockchain, smart contracts are public and transparent; every participant in the network is an enforcer.What Does Blockchain Mean for the Creative Industry?The implications of both blockchain technology and smart contracts reach far beyond their original use in financial transactions. Speaking of the creative industry, blockchain offers an ideal solution for all video content creators, from YouTube stars and influencers to vloggers and podcasters to freelance reporters and marketing experts. Here are 6 ways video content creators are going to benefit from the blockchian technology and smart contracts.1. Better Digital and Intellectual Rights ManagementThe fact that blockchain serves as a distributed ledger, making content public and available to all network participants, doesn\u2019t at all mean that it operates on a \u201cfree-for-all\u201d basis. On the contrary, it accounts for its digital goods and transactions by regulating and managing the sharing economy.Creator.ai, for instance, acts as a blockchain-based platform that helps artists protect their intellectual property by time stamping and storing content with a unique ID. Once this metadata is saved, it cannot be changed by any other content user. Even if repurposed, your video creation is still marked as yours.2. Conflict-Free Transactions, Regulated by Video Content Creators ThemselvesPhoto credit: Pixabay.comNot only do smart contracts eliminate intermediaries, thus allowing video content creators full control over their compensation, but they also make transactions refreshingly transparent. This enables both the content creator and the stakeholder to track revenue and gain insight into the overall value of the creation.But, blockchain technology decentralizes the market as well. With supply and demand being more obvious, video content creators can set value to their work themselves, and make pricing far more dynamic. This leaves room for flexible pricing and discounts to benefit artists and consumers alike.3. Micro-metering and Micro-monetizingWhen digital and intellectual rights are properly managed, and pricing is in control of artists themselves, video content creators can choose to sell their work not in its entirety, but in snippets. The practice, called \u201cmicro-metering\u201d, enables \u201cmicro-monetizing\u201d as well, allowing artists to monetize even the smallest consumable units of their content and benefit from their work in more ways than one.4. Trackable Reputation SystemReturning back to digital rights management and non-brokered peer-to-peer transactions, the blockchain technology can change the creative industry for the better by establishing a reputation system as well. Just like metadata, reputations can be linked to specific participants in the blockchain.For the creative economy, this means two things. First, the video content creator could choose to sell or not to sell their work to another user after verifying their previous transaction behavior, and vice versa. Second, such a reputation system can encourage collaborations between artists themselves.5. Searchable MetadataThe blockchain technology seems like a hassle-free way to regulate the creative economy, but its implications go beyond technical issues like intellectual rights management and conflict-free monetization. While changing how content is distributed, blockchain slowly, but steadily changes how content is produced too. In a long run, the distributed ledger might transform the industry itself.More blockchain-based artists are starting to use metadata not only as copyright information, but also as super-specific creative work tags. In terms of video content, the work could be tagged with metadata that indicates all kinds of information that is typically not processed by other databases. It transcends typical keywords used for better discoverability, as well as usual info such as the genre.6. Dynamic Industry\u00a0FlowPhoto credit: ShutterstockBy allowing video content creators to attach particular tags to their work\u200a\u2014\u200ainformation on creative or cultural influences and collaborations, filming equipment and props, editing styles, montage directors, or sound engineers, for instance\u200a\u2014\u200ametadata certainly contributes to searchability, but not only that.It also actively participates in the exchange of knowledge, revealing the secret ingredients behind successful videos and disclosing just how intricate and diverse the creative process is. Dedicated artists can not only get in touch with new creative streams, but also build upon them, thus initiating new artistic schools and genres, all thanks to metadata and the blockchain technology that supports them.It\u2019s obvious then that blockchain will have a much greater impact on the creative industry than its creators initially intended to. Sooner rather than later, smart contracts could bring back the real meaning of the phrase \u201ccreative freedom\u201d, and spark changes that, we must all agree, are long due.", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "Creator.ai, Blockchain Technology, and the Future of the Democratic Content\u00a0Economy", "author_name": "Creator.ai", "link": "https://medium.com/@creatorai/creator-ai-blockchain-technology-and-the-future-of-the-democratic-content-economy-932b1988935?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 27, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "1.6K", "content": "Creator.ai, Blockchain Technology, and the Future of the Democratic Content\u00a0EconomyCreator.aiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 27, 2018In the world of digital marketing, content plays one of the most important roles. It is not only used to add value for the Internet surfers and online shoppers, but also to improve the position of a website in the search engine results pages.While from the perspective of end content consumers, middlemen and closed platforms there is no apparent problem, content creators are struggling in the current content economy\u200a\u2014\u200awhich, by the way, is currently a $300 billion dollar market.Creator.ai was developed with marketers and content creators in mind. Let\u2019s see what Creator.ai is, and how it can solve the common problems with the online content creation economy.What is Blockchain Technology?Blockchain technology was developed by a person who goes under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It allows distribution of digital information on a global scale, while at the same time preventing anyone from copying it or tampering with it.Simply put, it is a structure of data where each transmission of data over any given network gets digitally signed, so that nobody can change or manipulate it. Before any transaction is possible, all of the nodes on the blockchain network have to come to a consensus regarding a transaction\u2019s authenticity. This mechanism, along with powerful encryption, made blockchain one of the most prominent technologies of the 21st century.To sum up, this tech gives people the opportunity to be part of a transparent market, where each transaction is secure and verified before it gets settled and recorded.What is Creator.ai?Are you familiar with the Captiv8? It\u2018s one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise influencer marketing platforms. The team that built it is the same team that developed and designed Creator.ai. When they were making it, they were governed by the belief that content creators should be allowed to earn more, while marketers should get authentic content with real value.Creator.ai is the first content creation protocol based on blockchain technology. Without diving into the technical side of things, we can refer to it as a highly sophisticated marketing protocol, designed to connect marketers to the global pool of content creators and enable them to reach large audiences thanks to influencer marketing.It it designed to remove the middleman and closed platforms from the equation, and to reduce, if not completely remove the friction from this process. The Creator.ai protocol is completely built on Ethereum blockchain, thus enabling payments, contracts, content delivery and campaign creation.Why blockchain? Since the content economy already exists, the developers came to an idea to build a centralized marketplace where influencers and marketers can monetize their ideas, content, and large and trusting audience. The blockchain technology presented itself as the only viable solution that makes the entire platform easy to use and available around the globe.With access to decentralized global platform, influencers can become online sellers, while brands can get the biggest bang for their buck.The Main Problems in the Online Content Creation\u00a0EconomyPhoto credit: Pexels.comSocial media platforms have enabled individuals to become very popular and somewhat famous in the online community. However, even after 10 years, content creators and influencers are still unable to reap the financial benefits from their status and creations. This is because the current online content creation economy faces several major problems.In order to sell their social media popularity and get paid for the content, influencers and content creators need a transparent market. Today, the situation is quite gloomy. Marketers are unclear about whether they should use this or that platform to convey their specific marketing message to their target audience.At the same time, influencers can\u2019t migrate their audience. They have to stick with the platform on which they\u2019ve already built a presence. All this causes confusion in both influencers and businesses that are looking for them.Furthermore, marketers don\u2019t have access to a single platform to solve their influencer marketing problems. Instead, they are forced to juggle several influencer marketing campaigns and hope for the best. This doesn\u2019t give any control over the quality of the deliverables and the value they add for the end users.In the end, we have to address the problems surrounding payments. Content creators don\u2019t get paid immediately after they post the content. This is completely understandable, since marketers want to see the results before they pay content creators.The Benefits of Creator.ai and Blockchain TechnologyThanks to the transparency and verified trading, blockchain has a lot to offer to a centralized market such as the one Creator.ai has built. With blockchain technology, some of the seemingly unsolvable problems can be completely overridden. This includes supply and demand matching, transaction frauds, unstandardized catalogs of product information, fake product and seller reviews, and ungoverned settlement execution.With Creator.ai brands and influencers have access to a system that brings accountability back into the game and allows them to purchase the deliverables of the highest quality possible. What\u2019s more important, with a centralized platform marketers can not only identify potential influencers that suit their purposes, but also verify them and make sure that they are able to convey the desired brand message to the intended audience.Additionally, the Creator.ai content creation platform can calculate efficacy of the content and the impact it has on the overall campaign. As the data accumulates on the network over time, Creator.ai will be able to standardise the price for each type of content.When it comes to the payments, Creator.ai handles them in the following fashion: after an influencer accepts a proposal from a marketer, the funds are held in escrow. The funds get released after both parties agree. If the end result is of poor quality or is delivered after the deadline, the platform applies specific penalties.With Creator.ai, the future of the democratic content economy seems very bright. With it, content creators will be able to maximize their earnings while taking part in the first content creation platform based on blockchain technology.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "MEDIA Protocol, Marketing And Blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aPart\u00a03", "author_name": "MEDIA Protocol", "link": "https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsm/media-protocol-marketing-and-blockchain-part-3-ec9cfb8d1d73?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 23, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "2K", "content": "MEDIA Protocol, Marketing And Blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aPart\u00a03MEDIA ProtocolBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 23, 2018The team here at MEDIA Protocol are deeply committed to creating a more direct, transparent and secure ecosystem for content creators, publishers, and consumers through the revolutionary application of blockchain technology.

Now, we turn our attention to Variety.What Do We Mean By\u00a0Variety?Historically computers, particularly over networks, were used to transfer the kind of data that could readily be stored in a simple spreadsheet or database. These days, a quick glance at the internet, or even your own phone, will confirm how many more types of data we\u2019re all handling on a daily basis.Broadly, this breaks down into; text, audio, video, and graphics. Within these categories of data, there are countless file types and extensions, all of which may require particular software or conversions to be accessible and usable.How Does Marketing Currently Handle\u00a0This?Data is broadly divided into forms: structured and unstructured. By structured we mean the neatly contained, properly arranged, machine-readable data mentioned above, that is readily identified and stored as is.Unstructured data is more complicated. It\u2019s the stuff of human interactions. Emotive. Tangential. Messy. And often rambling. Not at all easy to systematically categorise and organise. And when coupled with the sheer volume and velocity of Big Data, processing unstructured data for valuable content is rapidly expanding beyond human capacity.What is more, this is set to become even more of an issue with the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the behavioural data gathered from that.At present this means that a lot of potentially valuable customer data is being discarded or ignored in favour of the most obvious and easily processed.How Does Blockchain Do It\u00a0Better?Blockchain is uniquely suited to large scale projects requiring an abundance of resources. Again, its decentralised nature is an asset, with the load of processing and storage spread across limitless nodes rather than held in one centralised location.It provides ways to automate processes with checks and balances built in at crucial stages\u200a\u2014\u200ausing digital signatures and smart contracts to verify the data it\u2019s processing (we\u2019ll cover more on this in the next part of this series).There\u2019s also great potential for deep learning processes on blockchain, whereby users are effectively teaching the computers how to think. This would allow for systems to be built around blockchain technology, enabling computers to spot patterns and identify useful data from the unstructured quagmire, effectively mining data that would otherwise be discarded for being too varied.What\u2019s Next?From Variety, we now look ahead to the fourth V and one of the most crucial overlaps between blockchain and Big Data: Veracity.Our next post in the Blockchain Marketing Programme will explore the ways in which blockchain verifies and validates your information.Read All Parts In Our Blockchain Marketing Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact Of Blockchain On Marketing: VolumePart 2\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: VelocityPart 3\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Variety (This article above)Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Veracity Coming SoonYou May Also Be Interested In Our Blockchain Education Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain: Is It Secure?Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Apply To Cyber Security?Part 3\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Create Transparency?Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Blockchain Ensures That No-One Can Impersonate The Owner Of An AddressPart 5\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Ways Of Handling Real-world Identity On The BlockchainPart 6\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat Sybil Attacks Are And Possible MitigationsPart 7\u200a\u2014\u200aImproved Confidentiality and Data IntegrityFor more information regarding MEDIA Protocol find us on our social channels below:Website: www.mediaprotocol.orgFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MEDIAProtocolTwitter: https://twitter.com/MEDIA_ProtocolLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/media-protocol/Telegram: https://t.me/Media_Protocol_Community and https://t.me/MP_AnnouncementsMedium: https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsmYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MEDIAProtocol", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "How Blockchain and Smart Contracts Are Going to Change Influencer Marketing", "author_name": "Creator.ai", "link": "https://medium.com/@creatorai/how-blockchain-and-smart-contracts-are-going-to-change-influencer-marketing-240875b11ca3?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 11, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "1.8K", "content": "How Blockchain and Smart Contracts Are Going to Change Influencer MarketingCreator.aiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 11, 2018Until now, influencer marketing was only affected by the changes coming from social media platforms and new trends in digital marketing. Not that long ago, there is a new factor in play\u200a\u2014\u200aCreator.ai\u200a\u2014\u200athe world\u2019s first decentralized content creation protocol that connects marketers and influencers.Creator.ai is the first protocol that truly aims to make influencer marketing on blockchain possible. How? By leveraging the blockchain technology Creator.ai team was able to bring smart contracts and blockchain content to this niche.If this is all Greek for you, here is some information to help you understand the full potential of Creator.ai and how it is going to change influencer marketing.Understanding Blockchain TechnologyUnderstanding blockchain technology is of vital importance when it comes to being able to see the full potential of Creator.ai. This ingenious invention of the 21st century goes beyond the very popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.Blockchain essentially allows digital information to be distributed over a network without it being copied. It is this huge ledger of data distributed across all the computers on the network, simultaneously updating in all of the places whenever any of the changes take place.This means that all changes are transparent and that all records are public and easily verifiable. What\u2019s more important, all these changes and updates take place in real-time and in very short time intervals.What team being Creator.ai did is make influencer marketing on blockchain possible. Just by utilizing what this cutting-edge technology has to offer, Creator.ai has created new opportunities for content creators to monetize their creative content and audiences.At the same time, it has empowered marketers to find and get in touch with influencers that are a perfect match for their needs and marketing goals.Furthermore, Creator.ai powered by the Blockchain tech has made it possible for influencers and marketers to overcome some of the obstacles and friction that have been around in the influencer marketing niche ever since it came into being.Some of these are supply and demand matching, fraud, overcomplicated settlements, no reviews on new content, no catalogs containing previous influencers\u2019 work, and more. Here are the three key factors that made the above-mentioned possible. The same factors are also going to change influencer marketing.Smart Contracts\u200a\u2014\u200aPayments Without\u00a0LimitsPayments processes in the traditional influencer marketing are too complicated and take too long to complete. In some instances, the influencer or content creator has to wait for weeks, sometimes even months, before everything is settled and the money transfer is complete.Not to mention the issues that come with different currencies. As you may already know, brands typically make payments in their own country\u2019s fiat currency, while the content creators and influencers only accept payments in their country\u2019s currency.Thanks to the Blockchain, Creator.ai comes with a complete traditional payment process workaround. With smart contracts, payments take as much as several minutes now. Blockchain tech really helps influencers monetize their content and audience.As a matter of fact, payments are automatically released and sent once the content has been approved. Cryptocurrency is there to make the payments possible across borders and with virtually no limits whatsoever.The problem with high fees is also resolved, as cryptocurrency payments are transferred at minimal, and sometimes no fees at all.Decentralized Protocols Enable True AutomationAll the processes in influencer marketing require at least one human to oversee them or take active participation in them. Beside human power, specific software tools are also required if brands want to get the biggest bang for their buck.This is why third-party agencies and outsourcing partners have high fees when they are intermediates between influencers and brands during campaigns.Influencer marketing on blockchain becomes quite a different story. By implementing a decentralized protocol, influencer marketing platforms powered by blockchain tech enable marketers to enjoy true automation.In addition, marketers get to choose which of the tools within the Creator.ai protocol ecosystem they want to use, as all of them can be used individually. The tools that we are talking about here are:Payment\u200a\u2014\u200arelies on smart contracts. It makes the payment process straightforward and ultra fast. Influencers on this blockchain-powered platform. This powers the search feature, which includes over 50 variables. Thanks to this, influencer marketing on blockchain can be planned and executed with surgical precision.Content review\u200a\u2014\u200aan Artificial Intelligence powered tool designed to review the blockchain content and check it against the brand\u2019s guidelines.Reporting\u200a\u2014\u200auses social media platform APIs to deliver insightful reports to marketing and content creators after a campaign. These reports contain engagement metrics, audience demographics sentiment, earned media value, and more.Insights\u200a\u2014\u200apowered by machine learning, it helps users draw powerful conclusions and actionable information by extracting deep analytics from data gathered by the APIs.Micro-transactions as IncentivesInfluencers and content creators need to create profiles before they can start using influencer marketing platforms. Sometimes these profiles are very detailed and they eat a great chunk of an influencers\u2019 precious time. Thanks to cryptocurrency, micro-transactions can be used to reward influencers and incentivize them to not only create profiles but stay loyal to one platform.One of the most important processes in influencer marketing is content review. With traditional methods, the content has to be manually reviewed and checked against the deadlines, and we all know how much time and effort that takes.With blockchain, marketers can put bounties on content reviews and make instant micro-payments to community content reviewers who get the job done.Except giveaways and contests promising attractive rewards, there are no other options for influencers to convert their audiences or spread the word about the brand. But when you have something with a high value, such as cryptocurrency, it can be used to incentivize people on social media to do exactly what you want them to do.Hopefully, now you understand the true transformative power behind the blockchain technology and smart contracts. Micro-transactions, decentralized protocols, and instant payments are just a few of the benefits that will change influencer marketing for the better.", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "Putting a commodity trading ecosystem in the realm of blockchain with our newest ICO client,\u00a0KRATOS\u2122", "author_name": "trade.io", "link": "https://medium.com/@trade.io/putting-a-commodity-trading-ecosystem-in-the-realm-of-blockchain-with-our-newest-ico-client-9196e9867c2d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 13, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "7.1K", "content": "Putting a commodity trading ecosystem in the realm of blockchain with our newest ICO client,\u00a0KRATOS\u2122trade.ioBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 13, 2018The FinTech wave has engulfed nearly every aspect of the financial industry, with incumbent institutions facing competition on all fronts by young and dynamic challenger startups.

Originally published on Quora.With over 83 million passengers traveling through Dubai International Airport, it was the world\u2019s third busiest airport in 2016. The city itself is booming, with an annual population growth of just over 10%.While it\u2019s the undisputed business hub of the Middle East, Dubai has set an ambitious goal: To be the first blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020.It\u2019s a bold transition for the city but one that might not be as far-fetched as you think. Blockchain-powered smart cities are more attainable than people imagine. The uses for blockchain within cities are nearly endless, but there are some major areas where blockchain will represent a dramatic improvement.Let\u2019s look at a few of those areas to see how blockchain can impact city life in the coming years. After all, if Dubai\u2019s experiment with blockchain-powered government works out, there\u2019s no telling who might follow suit.InefficienciesCities around the world are already working to become what we call \u201csmart cities.\u201d They\u2019re using IoT connected devices to do everything\u200a\u2014\u200afrom detecting gunshots to monitoring traffic and air quality.And guess what? All of those IoT devices can be registered on the blockchain.There are plenty of opportunities to add blockchain to city systems that are already connected. These systems gather plenty of data that could be placed on the blockchain. Upgrading to blockchain would make it easier for city governments to access and manage that data.Say, when the light in an IoT connected lamp post goes out, it could trigger an automatic message to officials in charge of replacing it.Right now, there are silos of data. Not every security camera or electronic lock is made by the same company. Not every parking garage uses the same parking sensors to determine capacity. If we could securely organize all of that data onto an interoperable backbone, then law enforcement (or government officials or whoever is allowed access to the data) would be able to get that access without going through multiple separate parties.Blockchain could help solve many city inefficiencies almost immediately.Public SafetyCommunication and data sharing can have a positive effect on public safety as well. Recently, I had a conversation with a company in Boston who is trying to use the blockchain space for public safety data in police departments. Their data is very loosely organized. Silos of data are inaccessible to police stations in different neighborhoods within the same city. The current system is very rudimentary, partly because there\u2019s no better way to share sensitive data between departments.Blockchain can provide a secure system for sharing sensitive data. Wires won\u2019t be crossed, and opportunities won\u2019t be missed due to a lack of communication. This still has to be weighed against a citizen\u2019s right to privacy and the government\u2019s limit to tracking individuals. But it\u2019s good to see people are talking about sharing data and working on preventative measures, such as analyzing crime statistics and planning police patrols around that information.Public TransportationMost major cities rely heavily on public transportation. Some of them can\u2019t operate without it. There are opportunities to put blockchain to work here.New York City recently awarded a $573 million-dollar contract to transition from their refillable MetroCard to electronic readers. Right now, New York commuters have to manually swipe the cards and refill with money as needed. In cities like San Francisco and London, you don\u2019t even need a card. You can scan your phone and deduct payment from connected accounts such as Apple Pay or PayPal.The next step would be to use a blockchain-based system for pay. If commuters have a blockchain wallet on their smartphone, they could pay for any transit pass, loyalty programs, or purchase without a card.And that may give extra incentive to take public transport.Smart IncentivesAnother interesting aspect of blockchain-powered cities is how they can incentivize citizens to make positive decisions.Here\u2019s a hypothetical:Say you decide to take public transportation to work every day this coming week instead of driving. When the wallet registers you\u2019ve used public transportation all week, you get a discount on your energy bill for that month. Or maybe you\u2019re credited for one free bus ride.Whatever it is, the incentive has to gently push people towards ethical, sustainable, and transparent ways of consuming and producing goods and services.This could lead to more sustainable, habitable cities with fewer issues and inefficiencies. At the end of the day, that\u2019s what blockchain can help us accomplish\u200a\u2014\u200asmarter, healthier cities. And if Dubai makes good on their goal in 2020, we may have an example to follow in just a few years.By Samantha Radocchia, Co-Founder at Chronicled (2015-present).

And while a diversity of participants and ideas is fantastic for the development of the blockchain ecosystem, many fail to grasp the original intention and core design of the technology.With yet another global financial meltdown in 2008, Bitcoin launched shortly thereafter to great fanfare from cryptoanarchists and libertarians who wanted to relinquish control of the monetary supply from the central banks.Satoshi Nakamoto and other cryptoanarchists understood the potential for blockchain beyond basic financial transactions. But it wasn\u2019t until Ethereum launched in 2015 that a Turing-complete solution became a reality.The distributed, decentralized, public and open design of blockchains are inherently anti-authoritarian; espousing protopian dreams of a free and decentralized society. But we\u2019ve been here before with the cyber-utopian idealists of the early internet and world wide\u00a0web.Just as the internet of today is now dominated by centralized monopolies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon; blockchain technology could just as likely result in a future crypto-authoritarian dystopia. But of all future possibility threads, I think the core design and economic drivers of blockchains will converge toward a positive, decentralized future for all of humanity.Corporate Status\u00a0QuoThe blockchain ecosystem is already dominated by traditional corporates, financial institutions and fintech startups seeking to leverage the technology to cut operating costs, reap profits and build new monopolistic empires.A consortium of over 80 of the largest banking and financial institutions have joined forces to build a private financial blockchain platform entirely under their control. Fortune 500 companies are forming an enterprise alliance to leverage Ethereum to pursue their own fiduciary duty to maximize profits for shareholders. Central banks in China, Russia, Canada, Denmark, England and Singapore are already exploring or developing ways to issue sovereign cryptocurrency while maintaining full control.Having started the Sydney Ethereum meetup in 2014, I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand the dramatic demographic shift from anarchist developers to corporate executives wearing suits. Ethereum meetups are rapidly devolving into investor clubs for speculators and recruiting pools for corporate executives.In the information era of today, the primary business models of corporations essentially boil down to a simple three step process:Capture, monopolize and privatize dataCreate artificial scarcity by restricting accessRepackage and sell that data in various waysGoogle and Facebook profit from capturing user data, monopolizing and restricting access, then repackaging and selling that data in the form of a targeted advertising service. At a fundamental level, this business model is the same for any company with a database.As we enter deeper into the era of big datasets being used to train artificial intelligence and machine learning, the monopolization of data will present tremendous competitive advantages resulting in further centralization and consolidation of wealth and power.The reason corporations are enthusiastically pursuing *private* blockchain technology is precisely due to the potential to:Automate business operationsCut human labor costsFurther monopolize data and market shareIncrease profits for shareholders", "responses": "35"}, {"title": "No More Unrewarded Content Creators: How Blockchain Technology Helps Monetize\u00a0Content", "author_name": "Creator.ai", "link": "https://medium.com/@creatorai/no-more-unrewarded-content-creators-how-blockchain-technology-helps-monetize-content-8dc06816a0bf?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 3, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "1.5K", "content": "No More Unrewarded Content Creators: How Blockchain Technology Helps Monetize\u00a0ContentCreator.aiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 3, 2018The rise of social media has paved the way for a number of influencers to earn quite a lot of money for their content, especially when they partner up with big companies and engage in their influencer marketing campaigns. According to Captiv8\u2019s analytics, YouTube influencers with more than 7 million subscribers can earn as much as $300000 per one post, Facebook influencers with the same number of followers can earn $187000, while Instagram and Snapchat influencers with the same following can command $150000.However, not all content creators are that lucky when it comes to content monetization. There are even many great influencers who are not able to monetize content that they create. What content creators usually end up with is investing in paid ads in order to get their message across and earn more revenue, which often doesn\u2019t seem to be enough to cover all their content creation and distribution expenses.Why is this happening? More importantly, can this problem be solved? The answer is yes, and the solution lies in blockchain technology. Before you delve deeper into this new technology that is rapidly building a huge momentum, take a look at the primary challenges that content creators currently face which represent the main roadblocks to their content monetization.The Main Challenges that Content Creators\u00a0FaceThere are three major problems regarding the available social media platforms that prevent content creators from monetizing their content. Those challenges include the issue of walled gardens, the inefficiencies in the current marketing ecosystem, and the problem of delayed payments.1. Walled\u00a0gardensWalled gardens refer to closed platforms that enable users to engage in third-party content without ever leaving those platforms. For instance, Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles enable you to read content from a number of publishers while staying on the Facebook platform. That way, Facebook keeps you happy, makes you stay longer, thereby learns more about you and delivers more paid ads to you.However, this is not a good thing if you are a content creator, because your target audience doesn\u2019t actually move with you across platforms. People stay on their preferred platform, instead of clicking through the links and coming to you, making it pretty difficult for you to monetize content.2. Marketing ecosystem inefficiencyMany marketers use more than one solution when it comes to their influencer marketing campaigns, which doesn\u2019t bring much value to their campaigns. They don\u2019t generate a high return on investment, which negatively affects both them and, naturally, the content creators they work with.3. Delayed\u00a0paymentsWhen you are a content creator, it really goes without saying that you expect to be rewarded for your hard work. You want to get paid as soon as you finish your work, so that you can move on to the next project and increase your revenue.However, you usually need to wait a lot of time to get paid (30, 60 or even 90 days). This is mostly because marketers usually want to see that your content provided them with certain results before compensating you for your work.Fortunately, blockchain technology can solve all of these problems and help content creators monetize content quickly and easily.What Is Blockchain Technology?Blockchain technology, or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), refers to a decentralized public database that stores content and all of the information about it, such as, for instance, who created it. After managing intellectual rights, it enables content distribution in an immutable way, so content creators can easily monetize content, without any centralized third-party platform intervening and acting as the middleman.Therefore, content creators can get full value for every piece of content they create, instead of waiting for marketers to see the value first and paying them only a small amount of the actual revenue. They can get truly rewarded for the hard work they invested, not to mention that they can have full control over their own creative content, that is, their intellectual property.How Can Blockchain Technology help Content Creators Monetize\u00a0Content?Since blockchain technology refers to a decentralized public network where every single piece of content is immediately certified and given a unique ID, as well as a timestamp, not to mention that it cannot be modified (only when it is downloaded can that content be changed), content creators no longer need to wait in order to monetize content.Photo credit: Pixabay.comGiven the fact that there are no intermediaries for distributing content, every single financial transaction is direct, with no brokers whatsoever. One of the greatest things about content monetization when it comes to blockchain technology is the fact that there are almost no transaction fees, as cryptocurrency is the main currency of blockchain.Speaking of transactions, they are all based on smart contracts, which are contracts based on codes. What content creators do is create particular smart contracts and set usage policies for every piece of their content. Whenever someone wants to download their content or repurpose it, they must choose a particular usage policy, that is, smart contract, set by the content creator, before they provide their payment.Everyone on the blockchain network can clearly see exactly who owns every piece of content, since blockchain technology creates full transparency. Creators of content can add metadata to their content pieces, helping their target audience find and share their content much easier. Adding the metadata in the blockchain technology network enables them to prove that they are the rightful owners of their content, which significantly increases trust and, of course, helps with generating more revenue.As you can certainly see, not only does blockchain technology help monetize content, but it also greatly increases efficiency and trust. If you are a content creator and you don\u2019t think you are rewarded for your content as much as you should be, you should seriously consider entering the amazing world of blockchain technology and finally getting fully compensated for your creative work.Creator.ai is the world\u2019s first decentralized content creation protocol on blockchain that is built with the purpose of helping content creators monetize content and maximize their revenue. It creates full price transparency, full authenticity, and increases trust, connecting content creators and marketers on a global scale.

So we\u2019re committed, not just to connecting them, but to creating a common understanding between them.This series of articles aims to explain the relationship between marketing and blockchain to help everyone\u200a\u2014\u200athe marketeers, the technologists, and the content consumers\u200a\u2014\u200aunderstand the principles behind this game-changing technology.We want to help educate by demystifying the potential applications of blockchain technology. The MEDIA Protocol team feel it\u2019s vital to highlight and clarify the potential of blockchain in the marketing world; how it provides transparency, efficiency, reliability and accuracy.Strap in, and welcome to the MEDIA Protocol Blockchain Marketing Programme.Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact Of Blockchain On Marketing: VeracityIn previous instalments, we\u2019ve looked at how blockchain has improved handling of the Volume, Velocity, and Variety of Big Data. When it comes to Veracity, the fourth of the 4 Vs, blockchain is especially useful.The Trouble With Current\u00a0DataCompanies need accurate and verified information to make the best possible decisions, particularly when it comes to marketing their products and services. Analytics are only as good and useful as the data they\u2019re operating on.Generally, Big Data Veracity has an impact on the confidence reposed by the marketer to their database. However, in a volatile Big Data environment, accuracy becomes an issue among digital marketers regarding the collected data for their business.\u200a\u2014\u200aBusiness2Community.comA considerable amount of data, as it\u2019s currently gathered and processed, is both inconsistent and incomplete. As we discussed when looking at Volume and Variety, huge quantities are left untouched because there isn\u2019t the computing, or human, processing power to handle them. Latency issues can render data irrelevant after just a short period of time, especially when real-time responses are needed.The biggest hurdle to Veracity in current systems is the scope for deception. Whether it\u2019s inaccurate information overwriting the accurate in the one, centralised save-point, or more malicious actors deliberately tampering with data, it can be very difficult to uncover.What Needs To\u00a0Improve?The problems outlined above leave companies with data they feel they can\u2019t rely on. They need to then take steps to turn the big data they receive into something they can trust to be accurate.These include:Not mixing data, and finding a way to keep related data together for analysisWorking in real-time: sorting and analysing data on delivery. That latency between receipt and action can cost leads and customers.Organising and triaging the data you have to work with. Not all data is equally important or valuable, so good sorting processes will make clear where your priorities and focus should be.The Blockchain SolutionPreviously, as part of our Blockchain Education Programme, we addressed the topic of blockchain and data integrity.The distributed ledger system that is the foundation of blockchain removes the risks and limitations of centralised data storage. To even attempt tampering, bad actors would have to try to gain control of multiple nodes at once, which is next to impossible.That ledger is also a public record of every transaction and change that\u2019s made to the data, going right back to its original state. With every action attributed to its owner, it makes life very difficult for anyone attempting to cover their tracks.This also helps with the organisation outlined above\u200a\u2014\u200aa transparent and logical system that stores data efficiently is one of the key features of blockchain. It reduces the opportunities to mix irrelevant data, keeping your information and processes streamlined.Users who need to have faith in their data will find this key feature of the technology of particular value: the way that blockchain verifies the data it holds.Blockchain verifies multiple copies of the same data, distributed over its network of nodes, by consensus. When there is no consensus, because the data has been tampered with or attacked at a particular location, the blockchain simply isolates and eliminates that bogus data. This saves the need for human monitoring and intervention.Blockchain Handles The 4 Vs For MarketingAs we\u2019ve seen over this series, blockchain allows marketing professionals to deal with this age of Big Data in new and productive ways. Whether it\u2019s handling the sheer Volume; processing data at the appropriate Velocity to match customer demands; handling a mind-boggling Variety of data types and files; or proving the Veracity of the data that you base your decisions on, blockchain brings security and transparency to the process.Read All Parts In Our Blockchain Marketing Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact Of Blockchain On Marketing: VolumePart 2\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: VelocityPart 3\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Variety\u00a0Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Veracity (This article above)Part 5\u200a\u2014\u200aComing SoonYou May Also Be Interested In Our Blockchain Education Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain: Is It Secure?Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Apply To Cyber Security?Part 3\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Create Transparency?Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Blockchain Ensures That No-One Can Impersonate The Owner Of An AddressPart 5\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Ways Of Handling Real-world Identity On The BlockchainPart 6\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat Sybil Attacks Are And Possible MitigationsPart 7\u200a\u2014\u200aImproved Confidentiality and Data IntegrityFor more information regarding MEDIA Protocol find us on our social channels below:Website: www.mediaprotocol.orgFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MEDIAProtocolTwitter: https://twitter.com/MEDIA_ProtocolLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/media-protocol/Telegram: https://t.me/Media_Protocol_Community and https://t.me/MP_AnnouncementsMedium: https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsmYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MEDIAProtocol", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Beginner\u2019s Guide to Blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aExplaining it to a 6 Year\u00a0Old", "author_name": "Sidharth Malhotra", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/beginners-guide-to-blockchain-explaining-it-to-a-6-year-old-86afa54a5fa8?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 22, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "5.4K", "content": "Beginner\u2019s Guide to Blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aExplaining it to a 6 Year\u00a0OldA Simple Guide to Understand Blockchain with a Real World Analogy\u200a\u2014\u200aPart\u00a0IISidharth MalhotraBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 22, 2018This article is the followup to \u201cBeginner\u2019s Guide to Blockchain: Explaining it to a 5 year old\u201d. If you haven\u2019t checked out the first part yet, you can do that here.Beginner\u2019s Guide to Blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aExplaining it to a 5 Year OldA Simple Guide to Understand Blockchain with a Real World Analogyhackernoon.comIn this article, we will continue with the example of parking garages presented in the part I to explain the concepts of Cryptocurrencies, Mining and Smart Contracts.Ethereum, Bitcoin or some\u00a0X-coinEveryone of you must have heard at least once about any type of X-coin whether its Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether or any other coin. What are these? These are cryptocurrencies, getting their names from cryptography\u200a\u2014\u200athe concept that powers the underlying technology of your favorite coin. But, why we need these digital coins? Apart from sending money to your friends or receiving some from them, these coins are used to incentivize the computers on a Blockchain network. Woah! To much of technical jargon!! Let\u2019s move back and bring in our parking garage example in to the picture.\u00a0:)Pay for the Garage vs CryptocurrencyIf you remember from previous article, we mentioned that garage owners will rent their parking spaces to those in need. Now, you might be thinking, how would a lessee pay the lessor? Simple! through the bank transfer. But why would someone share their bank details with a stranger in case they are renting their garage? That\u2019s a valid question.Let\u2019s solve this problem by using a Paypal (or any other digital Wallet). The garage owner uses their Paypal email address to receive payments. This way they don\u2019t have to share their bank details to strangers. Did you notice something in this situation except privacy? Yes! anonymity. By using an email address to receive payments, the garage owner can stay completely anonymous to the tenant and same goes for the tenants as they will also be paying from their Paypal accounts.Now, let\u2019s compare this with cryptocurrency. In crypto world, it's almost the same except with a small difference that instead of using an email address you use a Bitcoin or Ethereum or any other coin\u2019s wallet address, which is unique to you. You send the coins from your X-coin wallet to the receiver\u2019s X-coin wallet. Since, the network is full of strangers so revealing bank details for money transfer would be a big problem. Therefore, using wallet addresses facilitate the users to send and receive payment by staying anonymous to everyone on the network and this is also one of the reasons why some countries have banned crypto or why it is very popular in the illegal world.If you are with me till this point, I am sure you must be thinking that you can transfer money from bank to Paypal but how does that happen in crypto world? Let\u2019s look in to this!Genesis of the First Coin or New\u00a0CoinsJust like transferring money from your bank to Paypal, you can transfer money from your bank to you X-coin wallet by buying coins from some registered Exchange. But, the question here is, how the first X-coin came into existence or how new coins are added to the system? But before we answer this question, let\u2019s take a look at another familiar term \u201cmining\u201d.WTF is\u00a0mining?If you remember, in the previous article, we talked about computation (process to calculate lock-key pair) and validation (process to check if a lock-key pair is correct or not). Let\u2019s assume that all the garage owners participate in the process of calculation of a new lock-key pair, which requires lots of computing power (brain power) and time (Just like those tricky calculus questions you got stuck at during your high school). So, the rule of this game of computation is whosoever calculates the correct value first, wins! (Just like a quiz round in your high school you can say!). This entire process of computing the correct lock-key pair is termed as \u201cmining\u201d.But why would a garage owner spend time to work on computing a lock-key pair? We need to incentivize them! Let\u2019s assume that the winner gets a cash prize, similar to the cash prize you got after winning the quiz at your high school.Did you notice one thing here? The prize money is the money that wasn\u2019t with the garage owners before (or you can say it wasn\u2019t a part of the parking system before). It is the fresh or the new money that was introduced to the garage parking system after mining in the form of prize money. Now, let\u2019s use this analogy to understand the mining in crypto world.Crypto World\u00a0MiningAs you know from the previous article that all the blocks in blockchain are safeguarded by hashes, which are calculated based on previous block\u2019s hash and current block\u2019s data. Thus, binding all the blocks in a chain. This hash computation is resource intensive because it requires you to hit and trial every possible value to get a correct hash (just like what garage owners did). So, the more values you can try per second, the faster you will be able to compute the correct hash (This is why you might have seen your friends buying big machines to mine Bitcoin or any other X-coin).But the same question arises again, why would someone lend their computer to the X-coin network to perform these resource intensive computations? Correct! the same answer\u200a\u2014\u200aincentives. Any computer that is able to calculate the correct hash first is awarded with a new X-coin. This new coin wasn\u2019t a part of the system before. This is how the new coins come into the system.But why the name \u201cmining\u201d?Well, all the cryptocurrencies are considered to be digital assets or commodities just like the Gold or the Silver or any other metal or mineral. Since, the process of extracting these metals from their mines is known as mining, the cryptocurrencies computations also got the name \u201cmining\u201d because mining brings a new coin to the system.Now, let\u2019s move out of the cryptocurrency world and dive in to application development on Blockchain!Decentralized Applications (DApps) & Smart ContractsIf you remember, I mentioned in the part I of this article about researchers realizing the benefits of the underlying technology of Bitcoin (which is Blockchain) for different applications apart from just cryptocurrencies. This is where smart contracts can be useful. Before we dig in the technical side. Let\u2019s continue with our parking example. For a moment let\u2019s assume that there is no prize money included for mining winners (Why? we will discuss in the next section).Consider that, you have to pay for moving your vehicle into the garage. So, to simplify that, every garage has a fee collecting machine outside it which allows you to read a barcode using your phone and send in the payment from your Paypal. This machine collects the money and as soon as the garage is closed all the garage owners start computing the lock-key pair (mining) and once that garage\u2019s lock-key pair is generated, the machine sends that money to the garage owner who won the mining contest.The fee collecting machine in the above scenario is a smart machine because it figured out on its own, whom to send the collected money once lock-key pair was generated. And in case anything buggy happens like, a technical error, the machine refunds you the money and either you can pay again or can take your car out.Similarly, on Blockchain this smart machine is called smart contract\u200a\u2014\u200aa piece of code that does everything for you on blockchain. As all garages have smart machine, all the computers on the Blockchain have a copy of the smart contract. So, when you send money, it makes sure that you have enough money to send and the receiver gets the money and in case of any error, it just reverts the transaction.However, smart contracts are not just for money transactions, you can use them to store or modify data on the Blockchain which can be Youtube like model for videos (such as Viuly), or a dropbox type model for storing files (such as Storj.io or SiaTech) or even games like Cryptokitties. The list of use cases is endless!What Happens When No New\u00a0Coin?Do you remember that in the previous section, we assumed that there is no prize money to the winners for computing correct hash value. This gives birth to a new question\u200a\u2014\u200aWhy would someone rent out their computers in case they will not be rewarded with any new coins? Yes, you know the answer. Just like, the fee collecting machine outside the garage collected money and gave it to the winning garage owner, every transaction on the Blockchain costs a very small fraction of money. This small fraction is deducted from all the transactions. When a block on the Blockchain is mined ( its hash is computed by all the computers on the network), the computer winning the mining contest, gets the money deducted from all the transactions mined in that particular block (each block contains a fixed number of transactions) as a reward or incentive. This keeps the crypto model sustainable even after no new coins are issued. Now you know why your friends are buying big machines!ConclusionBravo! You finally acquired the basic knowledge about the Blockchain and its components. I hope this series of articles helped you strengthen your foundations in this emerging technology. From here on, if you are a tech person, you can start learning about developing applications on Blockchain or even setting up your own Blockchain.However, if you are a non tech person, you can start looking out for problems that can be solved using Blockchain. This will help you deepen your knowledge about the application part of this amazing technology.If you enjoyed reading this, please click and hold \u201cClaps\u201d below and help your friends find it by sharing it with them.

Examining past disruptions is a good place to start as it\u2019s been proven that all major disruptions follow a similar pattern.While writing the white paper for Inmusik about how blockchain is capable of changing the face of Music Industry forever, I saw some strikingly similar characteristics to the early DotCom days. That trend may be a good indication of what we can expect in the coming years. In fact, with some of the recent viewpoints from traditional financial establishments, I am reminded of the infamous quote by Robert Metcalfe, founder of 3Com, who in 1995 said \u2018I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse\u2019. Thank goodness he was wrong!Learning about the future from the\u00a0pastWhat does the future hold for cryptocurrency? Let\u2019s try to break it down and look at the patterns.The starting point is always a true disruption coming from groundbreaking technologies that enables a completely different business model. Let\u2019s\u00a0examine:Internet: A new technology can enhance an old way of doing things. Let\u2019s take physical music CD\u2019s which, when the internet became popular, were sold online. However, streaming music online gave us access to instant, more enjoyable way to listen to music, and along with the exponential growth in its adoption, this major disruption on people\u2019s lifestyle has since almost completely killed the CD business. It is not that CD\u2019s aren\u2019t working anymore, but music streaming instantly online gives a more satisfying outcome.Blockchain: Like the internet, Blockchain has become the technology from which new business models can be created. For example, what we are creating at Inmusik is a completely new business model and new approach to how we experience music.Streaming, as we say it, is a one-way street, you pay, and you listen to music. At Inmusik, with the help of blockchain and cryptocurrency, we are a multi highway infrastructure by comparison! Built on an actual business model, Inmusik\u2019s cryptocurrency $OUND tokens can be purchased and as you consume music you are effectively exchanging some of your currency for it\u00a0. But the biggest game changer is we can assign another value to that exchange, enabling rewards for everyone based on their measurable contribution to the community. To put it simply\u200a\u2014\u200aimagine you are the first person to listen to a new song, you like it and give a thumbs up. Thanks to your involvement (which is something you do anyway) that song is enjoyed by another user, they give it a thumbs up too and it eventually ends up being played 1 million times. The song earns $20,000 for the artist/writers but, your initial thumbs up helped, in a measurable way, in making that song a success. On Inmusik, you earn a percentage of that payout. Blockchain records all of these transactions, keeps them on a publicly distributed ledger which brings automatic trust to the system and ensures that everyone who contributes to an artists\u2019 or a songs\u2019 success, is rewarded for their help. In one line\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a rewards based community experience where everyone gets paid based on the work they do. A new approach and a new business model.The next is an underground movement which challenges the status quo. This group is the first to embrace the new movement and figure out ways to\u00a0utilize.Internet: Sticking to music as an example, the transition from CD\u2019s to a digital format involved people who used peer-to-peer torrent sites like Napster and Limewire to access all the music they wanted for free. It was this early and passionate adoption that evolved into online music streaming platforms like Spotify, SoundCloud and Gaana.Blockchain: The first group of people to jump on blockchain were independent artists who were sick of the meager payout they received from streaming platforms. They saw blockchain as a solution for better tracking and transparency of their music when few others believed. And, they were right! This viewpoint has led Inmusik to work on a database which manages all music publishing rights and licensing more effectively. The result will be fewer lawsuits, completely transparent payouts, mathematically fair payouts and making data available on every stream.The last tell-tale sign is questionable activities that negatively impact the space as some find ways to take advantage of the disruption.Internet: Music and movie piracy became widespread as the ease of access allowed some to profit from copyrighted content by selling bootlegs. Pornography and gambling were also some of the earliest uses of the internet which scared away some investors from getting involved.Blockchain: Digital currencies allow people to transfer money without it being detected by central banks or governments. This opened the door for activities like money laundering which has led, once again, to a push back from investors and larger institutions.So what\u2019s happening next?There are generally three phases of a disruption that have been common through history which will most likely repeat for the crypto space. They are:1. Creation\u200a\u2014\u200athe earliest days of the technology where new everything move fast and there is plenty excitement. In the DotCom days, website traffic dictated share prices more than anything else. Many of these companies didn\u2019t have a business model, just cool ideas. Similarly with Crypto, there are 100\u2019s of currencies out there which may have no real business model to fall back on. Still, the value continues to rise. It\u2019s likely that, now we\u2019ve reached the end of this phase.2. Retraction\u200a\u2014\u200aeveryone starts jumping on the bandwagon and the prices reach unsustainable levels of growth and \u2018pop\u2019, the bubble bursts. The DotCom bust of 2000 is extremely similar to the growth charts of bitcoin over the last 4 months. The only difference is that the speed at which crypto is changing is far faster than the DotCom days. Learning from the DotCom days, this kind of correction is healthy for the industry in the long run.3. Institutionalization\u200a\u2014\u200athis is where the best innovators create more sound business models based on revenue growth and best practices. For the DotCom disruption, this is the last phase that brought about the mega companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix and Facebook. I think we are just moving into this phase now and we are likely to see the emergence of the future mega businesses. Regulation kicks in, as does common sense, and more investors start getting involved as they search for the next big thing.This last phase is going to change the world as we know it and impact industries in ways we haven\u2019t yet imagined. That much I am certain of! Will Inmusik be one of the mega companies in the future? Well, we are giving it our best shot! Inmusik is based on a real, viable and sustainable business model discussed with economists, we have an incredible team and experienced advisors. We are also working with the major labels to build a community-focused form of self-regulation. An ecosystem based on a blockchain database that supports the music industry, streaming, and social interaction, with cryptocurrency rewards and a financial framework on which future music industry applications can be built.The future is bright!Inmusik Lightpaper | Inmusik Whitepaper | Inmusik WebsiteWant to speak with us?

Tone brought speakers from all over the world including Saifedean Ammous, Trace Mayer, Jimmy Song, Peter Todd, Johnny Dilley, Pavel Moravec, Stacy Herbert the one and only Max Keiser and several others. The conference and time was a wild success in my opinion. Great job Tone and Mike!In my interview with Max he spoke about several things including how he found his way into crypto, invented the worlds first digital currency, his thoughts on Central Banks, whether blockchain is needed beyond Bitcoin and what the ETF\u2019s and Futures markets could possibly do to Bitcoin and where Bitcoin is ultimately going and why it is so incredibly important.For me this was an incredible interview not just because of the incredible views and content but because this is the man who woke me up and introduced me and so many others to Bitcoin back in 2011. I was truly honored to hang out with this legend and hear his thoughts on so many things in and outside of the interview.For those who are going to watch the video interview, I must warn you there is an occasional curse word and as I mentioned Max can be controversial and wildly entertaining a great example was during the interview Max out of nowhere shouts Jamie Dimon is a bum. This was explained by Max due to Dimon\u2019s never having to work an honest day in Dimon\u2019s life as his sole existence is being a third party to transactions collecting the fee\u2019s.With Bitcoin, it\u2019s peer to peer and institutions like Dimon\u2019s are no longer needed to collect these fees. As we know in Bitcoin, the fees collected are by the miners for their actual work within the network. With the new Bitcoin Lightning Network, these fees drastically diminish to next to nothing as the bulk of the work is now done off the chain.I don\u2019t want to giveaway too many spoilers, so for anyone who wants to see and hear Max\u2019s views on a plethora of topics this is a can\u2019t miss interview.For those that want even more Max after this interview he hosts the Keiser Report on RT TV which is also wildly successful and thought-provoking, please make sure and check it out.It was a true honor hanging with Max, I hope you enjoy the interview and for those new to crypto make sure and drop by my YouTube channel, we do interviews all the time and I host a livestream every Monday 1PM PST on the channel where viewers can ask me anything and we do on-air live giveaways.

We\u2019ll also create this application\u2019s UI in Angular.I\u2019m super excited to share this step-by-step guide with you. So let\u2019s get started right away!Source: https://giphy.com/explore/excitedWhen I was first coding this out, I ran into errors. Lots and lots of them. But I think that\u2019s good, because it made me learn a lot of things. Errors are essential. I got to a point where I felt switching it on and off would make things better. It almost made me lose my mind, but it\u2019s an integral part in every hacker\u2019s life.Before getting started, you need to ensure that the machine you\u2019re using is equipped with the required configurations. You may need to download certain prerequisites and set up a basic dev environment. Below are the links to do that. Follow those steps before starting to develop an application, otherwise you\u2019ll definitely run into stupid errors.First install the Hyperledger composer. Then install the development environment.There\u2019s no need to start Playground while you\u2019re installing the environment.Make sure docker is running, and when you run\u00a0./startFabric.sh it\u2019s going to take a couple of minutes. So be patient.Now that your machine is all set, we can start coding!Source: http://www.forthebrokenhearted.net/170254395/4208888/posting/Step 1: Outline your Business\u00a0NetworkOur Business Network Definition (BND) consists of the data model, transaction logic, and access control rules. The data model and access control rules are coded in domain specific language (which is very simple to catch up with). The transaction logic will be coded in JavaScript.To create a BND, we need to create a suitable project structure on disk. We will create a skeleton business network using Yeoman. To create a project structure, open your terminal and run the following command:$ yo hyperledger-composerThis will shoot out a series of questions as follows. You\u2019ll be required to use your arrow keys to navigate through the answers.Open this project in your favorite text editor. I\u2019m using Visual Code. This is what the file structure will look like:Delete the contents of test/logic.js. We won\u2019t be using it at the moment.Step 2.1: Coding out our Business Network (models/test.cto)First, we\u2019ll define models/test.cto. It contains the class definitions for all assets, participants, and transactions in the business network. This file is written in Hyperledger Composer Modelling Language.namespace testasset Account identified by accountId {o String accountId--> Customer ownero Double balance}participant Customer identified by customerId {o String customerIdo String firstNameo String lastName}transaction AccountTransfer {--> Account from--> Account too Double amount}Account is an asset which is uniquely identified with accountId. Each account is linked with Customer who is the owner of the account. Account has a property of balance which indicates how much money the account holds at any moment.Customer is a participant which is uniquely identified with customerId. Each Customer has firstName and lastName.AccountTransfer is a transaction that can occur to and from an Account. And how much money is to be transferred is stored in amount.Step 2.2: Coding out the Business Network (lib/logic.js)In this file, we\u2019ll add transaction logic in JavaScript./*** Sample transaction* @param {test.AccountTransfer} accountTransfer* @transaction*/function accountTransfer(accountTransfer) {if (accountTransfer.from.balance < accountTransfer.to.balance) {throw new Error (\"Insufficient funds\");}accountTransfer.from.balance -= accountTransfer.amount;accountTransfer.to.balance += accountTransfer.amount;return getAssetRegistry('test.Account').then (function (assetRegistry) {return assetRegistry.update(accountTransfer.from);}).then (function () {return getAssetRegistry('test.Account');}).then(function (assetRegistry) {return assetRegistry.update(accountTransfer.to);});}@param {test.AccountTransfer} accountTransfer is the decorator we put at the top of the file to link the transaction with our JavaScript function. Then we validate if the account where funds are has enough money. Otherwise, an error will be thrown. Then we perform basic addition and subtraction on the account\u2019s balance.At this point, the most important step is to update this on the blockchain. To do this we call getAssetRegistry API of our assets which is Account. Then we update the retrieved assetRegistry for both the account doling out the funds and the account receiving the funds.Step 3: Generate the Business Network Archive\u00a0(BNA)Now that the business network has been defined, it must be packaged into a deployable business network archive (.bna) file.Step 3.1: Navigate into the test-bank app in your terminal.Step 3.2: Run the following command:$ composer archive create -t dir -n .This creates a\u00a0.bna file in the test-bank folder.Step 4: Deploy the Business Network Archive file on the\u00a0FabricStep 4.1: Install composer runtime$ composer runtime install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --businessNetworkName test-bankStep 4.2: Deploy the business network$ composer network start --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --archiveFile test-bank@0.0.1.bna --file networkadmin.card(Make sure you\u2019re in the test-bank folder).Step 4.3: Import the network administrator identity as a usable business network card$ composer card import --file networkadmin.cardStep 4.4: To check that the business network has been deployed successfully, run the following command to ping the network:$ composer network ping --card admin@test-bankSTEP 5: Expose a RESTful\u00a0APITo create a RESTful API from your command line, run the following command:$ composer-rest-serverThis will shoot a lot of questions.Now point your browser to http://localhost:3000/explorer.You\u2019ll see your beautiful blockchain API.Now let\u2019s add two Customers.Fist, let\u2019s add a customer named Niharika Singh:We get a 200 response code.Now we\u2019ll add customer named Tvesha Singh in a similar way.To check if you\u2019ve added them correctly, GET them.You\u2019ll see two customers in the response body.Now let\u2019s add 2 accounts linked to these two customers.Add accounts this way. Now, GET them to check if you\u2019ve added them correctly.Now let\u2019s transfer 75 from Niharika to Tvesha.Let\u2019s check if the balance is updated by getting the account information.Viola! It works. Niharika has 25 now, and Tvesha has 125.Step 6: Angular Front\u00a0EndTo create Angular scaffolding automatically, run the following command in the test-bank folder:$ yoThis will ask multiple questions.And it will take a couple of minutes.Navigate into the bank-app.$ npm startThis starts the Angular server.The Angular file structure is created as follows:Point your browser to http://localhost:4200. That\u2019s where the magic is happening! You\u2019ll see this screen:Now go to Assets in the top right corner and click on Account.These are the exact accounts we created.So now you can play around with this.You have your front end and your backend ready!All transactions that happen on localhost:3000 are reflected on localhost:4200 and vice versa. And this is all on blockchain.Source: https://giphy.com/explore/thats-how-its-doneRecently I wrote an article on blockchain\u2019s use cases. I listed and explained about 20 ideas.

One particularly impactful use case is making it easier for small suppliers to get more financing on better terms.Most of the blockchain applications emerging right now are effectively porting existing solutions onto the blockchain (Uber for the blockchain, Airbnb for the blockchain, etc.).While these projects are valuable, the \u201ckiller apps\u201d of previous technological transitions have not just been simply porting over an existing use case and making it more efficient. They reimagine how the new technology could transform the way the industry works in some fundamental way.Amazon was not just Walmart on the internet; it took advantage of the zero marginal cost of shelf space to offer a much wider selection than Walmart could ever stock in physical stores.Google was not a giant Dewey Decimal catalog of websites; it took advantage of the web\u2019s hyperlinked, crawlable nature to facilitate more efficient searches and information discovery.There\u2019s every reason to think that the same will be true of the blockchain. The killer applications will reimagine how the world works in a fundamental way.I don\u2019t pretend to know what these killer applications will be, but one of the most promising ideas I\u2019ve heard is applying the blockchain to the supply chain to tokenize existing assets. This would allow any business to place their existing assets (like real estate, physical inventory, etc.) on the blockchain and borrow against those assets at extremely low interest rates and fuel their growth.If it works, this blockchain supply chain use case has the potential to disrupt a multi-trillion dollar industry and dramatically shift the corporate landscape.We are years, if not decades, away from this application being mainstream, but it is the sort of use case which I think shows the true potential of the technology.We\u2019ll take a quick look at the history and current state of the supply chain industry then jump into how the blockchain could reshape it.", "responses": "26"}, {"title": "Trace Mayer on Bitcoin, Blockchain and\u00a0more", "author_name": "Robert Beadles AKA Crypto Beadles", "link": "https://medium.com/@cryptobeadles/trace-mayer-on-bitcoin-blockchain-and-more-43532de29c64?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 9", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "2K", "content": "Trace Mayer on Bitcoin, Blockchain and\u00a0moreRobert Beadles AKA Crypto BeadlesBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 9I recently had the honor and pleasure of interviewing Trace Mayer.

Decentralized protocols. Distributed ledgers. Cryptographic hash functions. Consensus algorithms. The sheer amount of terminology around cryptocurrencies can make you feel like someone transported in time from the 18th century. Not only are you trying to familiarize yourself with some of the more mind-bending concepts in computer science, but you also have to deal with a great dose of economics jargon.Blockchains are bringing together two opposites of the scientific mindset, which may initially seem to be at odds with each other. On one side of the ring, we have the extreme unforgiving rigor of cryptography: a math-heavy branch of computer science that used to be the exclusive domain of dusty academics. At the other side of the ring stands the brash superstar of social sciences, the economist; ready to pounce, competitive, possessing what some would describe as an abrasive personality. In this situation, however, opposites attract! When two such discrete sciences meet, there is unique opportunity in the air\u200a\u2014\u200abut also ample room for misunderstanding and misdirection by bad actors.So what is that makes the blockchain unique? A marriage of economics and cryptography, ok\u200a\u2014\u200abut is it all just about a technological solution? If you read online discussions, you may find that most participants are very caught up in high-pitch debates involving the merits of exceptionally specific details of blockchain implementations. Getting the big picture is not easy.Fundamentally the most important part of blockchains is not algorithms, nor cloud servers, nor user interfaces\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s people. More specifically: it\u2019s about accountability between people. This is a concept which is closely related to trust, yet narrower because trust comes in so many forms. For example, trust in a marriage is something that typically is not built on accountability\u200a\u2014\u200ayour wife, husband, or partner doesn\u2019t expect you to file precise reports of everything you did during an average day. Hence marital trust is not something that seems very amenable to a blockchain-based solution, or a technology solution in general. (Of course, if you think you have a viable project concept here, disregard this example and go for it! The market would certainly be enormous.)Accountability has sparked financial revolutions before. The modern accounting system of double-entry bookkeeping was widely adopted in Italy in the 13th century, and it became a crucial foundation of the economic and creative boom in Western Europe during the Renaissance. In Florence, a man named Giovanni de\u2019 Medici founded a bank on the rigorous principles of the double-entry bookkeeping system. His son Cosimo became the ruler of Florence, and three generations later one of Cosimo\u2019s great-grandsons became Pope Leo X, the highest office in Europe at the time. This is pretty good for a dynasty built on Giovanni\u2019s astute understanding of an accounting innovation!Most applications of modern information technology in corporations are evolved descendants of the medieval Medici Bank\u2019s operations: maintaining databases, recording transactions, and storing the details of who did what and how other accounts were affected. In accounting terms, these systems are ledgers. How is a blockchain different from what goes on in a corporation\u2019s IT systems already? How does a blockchain enable new forms of accountability between people?The keyword is decentralization. Whichever previous system you consider\u200a\u2014\u200athe Medicis\u2019 handwritten ledgers stored in volumes of books, a present-day bank\u2019s IBM mainframe, or even the cluster of replicated cloud servers you might find at a more forward-looking corporation today\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019ll discover that there is a single source of truth. Someone is authorized to perform operations on the accounts, and that \u201ctruth\u201d is stored in all copies of the information. No matter how many cloud servers are used to provide resiliency in case a system goes down, inputs to the system are centralized\u200a\u2014\u200athere\u2019s ultimately an authority that says, \u201cthis data comes from a reliable source, it\u2019s approved to be recorded in our system\u201d.The blockchain is not like those traditional ledgers with a single input for truth. It is a distributed ledger\u200a\u2014\u200aa term you will hear often in blockchain discussions. When there are multiple inputs, a single gatekeeper can\u2019t decide what truth \u201csticks\u201d in the permanent ledger, so there is the need for consensus\u200a\u2014\u200aanother term that you\u2019ll encounter frequently.To better understand distributed ledgers and consensus, let\u2019s step back entirely from the context of computers and digital systems, and look at a historical example. Imagine yourself in New York in 1750! You\u2019ve just stepped off a ship that brought you all the way from London, a three-week journey across the Atlantic. Rough seas, bad food, foul-smelling fellow passengers\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re happy to be back on solid ground.As it happens, you are a rich man. In your pocket you have a bill of considerable value: a money order for one thousand pounds from one of the most respected banks in London. The bank\u2019s name is well known even in the most remote English colonies, and your note carries the official stamp of their London branch. In New York, you immediately seek out a wealthy trader whose company has a formal association with the London bank. The bank provides the trader with a credit line back in England, and in exchange the trader has made a pledge that he will accept the bank\u2019s money orders in New York and cash them out.The trader never expected someone with your kind of wealth to walk in with a money order in hand, though. Cash is scarce in the colonies. The trader keeps perhaps 50 pounds\u2019 worth of gold in his office. Cashing out a thousand-pound money order is an operation that will take weeks, or even months, to execute. He\u2019d very much like you to just go away and take your money order somewhere else, but he\u2019s bound by the contract made with the London bank.How does this turn out? How can the trader know whether your money order is valid? How can you prove its validity in despite the trader\u2019s obvious desire to not give you the cash? It\u2019s a scenario that asks core questions about accountability between people. (By the way, it is also the plot of the novel \u201cGolden Hill\u201d by Francis Spufford. If you like the concept, check it out!)At the bank in London, there is a ledger that proves your account contains a thousand pounds. The trader doesn\u2019t have a copy of those books, though, and requesting proof across the Atlantic will take months. How to distribute the information in that ledger without having to send letters back and forth at every request? There are two ways.First, you could send the same information through multiple routes. In fact, this is what the bank and the trader have agreed to do. For any money order, the bank will send a second copy of the bill on another ship, entrusted to the ship\u2019s captain personally. When (or if) the second ship arrives and the captain appears at the trader\u2019s office to vouch for your bill with another stamped copy in hand, the trader will most likely accept its authenticity. In that case consensus has been achieved.Another way to distribute the ledger would be to send cryptographically verified bills. This was feasible\u200a\u2014\u200athough admittedly not common practice\u200a\u2014\u200aeven with 18th century technology. The bank and the trader could have shared a code book when they originally met in London. Using the code book, the bank would insert a message into your money order that could only be decoded by someone who has a copy of the code book.The problem with this approach is that you\u2019d have to trust the trader when it comes the verification of the money order. He doesn\u2019t really want to pay you the thousand pounds, so even if your order\u2019s coded message verifies, what\u2019s stopping him from lying to you about it?Ideally you\u2019d have both. The bank would use cryptography to make their money orders verifiable by the recipient, and they would also use consensus by sending a copy of the data by a trusted party\u200a\u2014\u200ain this case the second ship\u2019s captain who was paid by the bank to lend his authority to the order\u2019s copy.Flash forward 250 years. It doesn\u2019t take two months to send a message and get a reply across the Atlantic anymore, but the problems of sharing ledgers and trusting accounts haven\u2019t gone away. Now that sending messages themselves is nearly instantaneous even across oceans, the issue is the great number of participants, all busy with various trades. Our 1750 scenario had just four people\u200a\u2014\u200ayou, the bank, the trader, and the second ship\u2019s captain. The trader received only a handful of money orders a month, so he could dedicate time to resolving the transaction. Today we have billions of people each doing potentially hundreds of transactions daily. Who are the gatekeepers of all this? Who owns the ledgers and decides who gets an account in them? Who decides that, say, someone in a particular country is forbidden from participating in the global financial system due to political events that took place before the person was even born? What kind of alternative systems could we build without the previous set of assumptions?The blockchain allows an opportunity to explore those questions outside the structure of the established systems that have a single source of truth. It combines two features we already saw in the 1750 scenario\u200a\u2014\u200aconsensus and cryptographic verification\u200a\u2014\u200aand puts them together in a novel way to create a truly decentralized system where multiple actors can be sources of truth, and they have shared incentives to arrive at a single truth which then gets permanently recorded by everyone. Those \u201ctruths\u201d are stored in uniquely identified blocks, and the permanent, mutually agreed record is a \u201cchain\u201d where every block points to the previous one so the order can\u2019t be tampered\u200a\u2014\u200ahence blockchain.Although our examples so far have dealt with transferring money, remember that this is really about accountability between people. The accounts and values represented on the distributed ledger do not necessarily need to represent a currency transaction. They can consist of basically any situation where one party (or several) acknowledges a fact about another party on the network.In practice, the facts you\u2019d want to store on a blockchain divide primarily into two categories: ownership and promises. What exactly a particular blockchain supports depends on its protocol.The first widely deployed blockchains only concerned themselves with a single type of value (or asset), the accounts containing those values, and the records of transactions between those accounts. Bitcoin is the flagship example of this type of \u201cvalue-store\u201d blockchain. To put it another way: the Bitcoin protocol doesn\u2019t let you do anything with your account\u2019s Bitcoin balance except transfer it to another account. The Bitcoin ledger records ownership and that\u2019s it.There are many other blockchain protocols that are concerned with the second category mentioned above which we called \u201cpromises\u201d. Think of a simple non-monetary exchange: maybe you buy us coffee and we promise to clean your apartment later. (We\u2019re desperate for coffee!) That\u2019s not exactly ownership\u200a\u2014\u200ayou don\u2019t own a cleaned apartment\u200a\u2014\u200abut it is a promise that could be stored on the blockchain so that you can hold us to it. These kinds of simple promises are often tokenized, that is, turned into an asset category that can be traded and owned on the blockchain. If we gave you the same promise in the form of a generic \u201capartment-cleaning token\u201d, you could then sell it to, or trade it with, someone else on the blockchain and we\u2019d have an undeniable agreement that we are now obligated to clean the apartment of that third person instead.An advanced form of promises is called smart contracts. With these, you can essentially ask the blockchain deep questions and hold the participants to some behavior that is automatically applied by the blockchain itself. For example, we could promise to clean apartments for the first ten people who buy us coffee today. As coffee gets offered, our \u201capartment-cleaning token creator\u201d smart contract would get executed to generate up to ten tokens\u200a\u2014\u200abut no more than ten, and only today. Those limits are enforced by the smart contract definition which is automatically processed by the blockchain participants. Since the smart contract is encoded on the blockchain, the rules are visible to all and cannot be changed, so we can\u2019t later decide to make changes unilaterally even if we wanted to get out of this promise to clean ten apartments.There is also a special kind of ownership that can be represented on a blockchain which links other kinds of digital data into the blockchain\u2019s world of cryptographic truths. It revolves around the concept of a hash value. A \u201chash\u201d is like a fingerprint represented by a short sequence of numbers that is guaranteed to be unique, which can be computed for any kind of digital content. You could take this text and calculate its hash, or an entire Windows install disk, or a digitized copy of a Beatles album\u200a\u2014\u200aall those, and anything else in digital form, can be condensed down into a single hash. Hashes are \u201cone-way\u201d: you can\u2019t reconstruct the data from the hash, and neither can you come up with invented data that would fit a particular hash.This latter property of hashes turns out to be very useful. By computing a hash and publishing it, you can prove the existence of some data right now, without exposing any potentially proprietary details, so that you can refer to this record of the data later. A patent makes a great example because there could be legal disputes regarding who invented something first. When you\u2019re preparing to file for a patent, you could save a draft explaining the invention and publish that text\u2019s hash on a blockchain. If there is ever a dispute later, you\u2019d be able to prove your invention date by publishing the draft text and showing that it matches the hash that remains stored on the blockchain. It\u2019s not possible to forge a text later that would match the hash, so this is solid proof that you had the invention written down when the hash was published. Hashes are extremely important to how many aspects of blockchains are implemented, so you\u2019ll encounter the term in many contexts.Remember how it was mentioned earlier that the Bitcoin ledger just records ownership of the coins created on the network? Strictly speaking there is a \u201cloophole\u201d in the Bitcoin protocol for tucking small amounts of other data within transactions, and this loophole is just large enough to put a hash value there. So, you could even use the Bitcoin blockchain to save your digital ownership fingerprints. It is worth noting that you\u2019d pay the Bitcoin transaction fee each time, which currently equal to about $1 USD.In practice you\u2019d be better off using a different protocol, specifically one that\u2019s explicitly designed to store this kind of data cheaper and more efficiently. Still, this Bitcoin transaction loophole is an illustrative example of how a blockchain really is just a shared record of facts, and those facts can be anything that the protocol lets you store and access.There are two features that are commonly associated with blockchains, yet are actually implementation choices and not inherently required by the concept. They are mining and anonymity. Maybe you\u2019ve seen stories in the press about how Bitcoin mining now consumes more energy than the entire country of Denmark, or how Ethereum mining has fueled such demand for high-end GPUs that it\u2019s nearly impossible to buy a graphics card for your gaming PC. These are highly visible side effects of a choice that was made by the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain protocol designers. They both acquire consensus through \u201cmining\u201d, which means that blockchain participants will have their computers perform complex computations that are useless in and of themselves but verifiable by others, all while processing transactions, and for that work they get rewarded in coins on the blockchain.This kind of consensus-building is called Proof of Work (POW). It\u2019s a very clever way to ensure that a blockchain with an arbitrary number of participants who don\u2019t know each other can still reach consensus. As long as there\u2019s not a single party doing more than 50% of the mining, this approach guarantees fairness. Its downside is energy consumption due to the work which is useless in itself since each of those computations don\u2019t have any meaning other than verifying transactions. There are other approaches, in particular Proof of Stake (POS).To get better understanding of the issue, let\u2019s quickly refer back to the 1750 scenario: what kind of consensus was used there? The second ship\u2019s captain provided a copy of the money order and vouched for its authenticity on his honor, so we could call this approach Proof of Authority. It\u2019s an illustrative example of an \u201cold world\u201d way of solving the same problem, but the whole point of blockchains is to be independent of centralized authorities, so we don\u2019t commonly see Proof of Authority used there.The other feature mentioned above\u200a\u2014\u200aoften associated with blockchains but not inherently required\u200a\u2014\u200ais anonymity. Accountability between people is independent of whether those people can identify each other. Some blockchains are explicitly designed to hide participants\u2019 real-world identities which can be useful for a wide range of things from avoiding state censorship to selling illegal drugs. Others are explicitly designed to provide verified personal identities e.g. for storing real estate deals on the blockchain. Most blockchain protocols actually fall somewhere in the middle on the anonymity spectrum. For example Bitcoin seems anonymous on the surface, but tracing transactions back to real identities is often not as difficult as it appears. In other words, you probably shouldn\u2019t count on the IRS or your local tax office being totally ignorant of Bitcoin sales.\u2014This concludes the gentle introduction to blockchains. Admittedly there were a couple of unexplained terms like \u201ccomputer\u201d that, if you were George Washington, would probably confuse you. (But if you are George, go check out your monument in the American capital\u200a\u2014\u200athey put up a giant obelisk for you! Crazy, right?!)If you are not a time traveller and still found yourself confused, please write a comment and let\u2019s sort it out!

Blockchain ecosystems are in their infancy and currently they are battling it out, but one is bound to have a similar colossal impact as Microsoft\u200a\u2014\u200ait may not even exist yet. Today blockchain remains to grow up (it lies in pre Windows 1.0 territory). Of course, grow up it will, and fast because blockchain is to assets what the internet is to content\u200a\u2014\u200afor the first time in history you can move value instantly from one place to the other side of the world with no intermediary. Whilst today only a very small percentage of global GDP (0.025% or $20bn) is held in the blockchain, analysts at UBS estimate that blockchains could be a $300bn to $400bn global industry by 2027. So regardless of what people say about bitcoin, blockchain is here to stay.An Arm\u2019s\u00a0Race\u2026A whole new class of blockchains are sprouting and evolving\u200a\u2014\u200aones that will be increasingly more scalable, performant and have built in governance so decisions can be made without any malicious hard forks. These new generations of blockchains have decoupled the application from the platform behaving as general purpose platforms. So you could build a currency on top of them like a Bitcoin, or you could build a social network on top of them, a ride sharing app, a stock exchange or an identity management system.However, there is currently no brand loyalty in blockchain. So it\u2019s an arms race\u200a\u2014\u200awhomever can do something better, wins.All of the following platforms differ somewhat in terms of how they\u2019re governed, the services they offer and the size and strength of the community. It will be fascinating to see how this plays out. The internet is going to rapidly look very different and much of that is being determined by the battle that is currently unfolding.The ContendersSo who\u2019s in the race? The top contenders for the decentralized platforms are Ethereum, Stellar, EOS, NEO and NEM. Here\u2019s what you need to know\u2026EthereumVitalik Buterin\u200a\u2014\u200aCo-Founder and programmer from Toronto. He co-founded the online news website Bitcoin Magazine in the same yearGavin Wood\u200a\u2014\u200aCo-founder and former CTO. He went on to found Parity Technologies. Gavin also helped found or advise: GridSingularity, Blockchain Capital, Polychain Capital, MelonportEthereum is the first decentralized platform and it paved the way for the next generation. The crypto world got overly excited about Ethereum as it opened new realms of possibilities. Whilst Ethereum has a large community of supporters, enthusiasm has outpaced the technical development. Think of it as AOL or Bebo: gone to seed. Ethereum mimicked many of Bitcoin\u2019s design patterns such as Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm and therefore inherited many of Bitcoin\u2019s flaws; it is slow and consumes a horrendous amount of electricity. A single app, CryptoKitties, has recently been bringing the Ethereum network to its knees. Meanwhile miners of Ethereum are already using more electricity than a small country like Cyprus. Also like Bitcoin, Ethereum does not have a governance process built into the blockchain. This means that the Ethereum community does not have a good way to make enhancements to their protocol without hard forking (or splitting Ethereum into two separate blockchains, one with the enhancement and one without). Thus Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. This leaves a tremendous amount of weight on Vitalik Buterin\u2019s opinion, which does beg the question as to how decentralized Ethereum really is.If Ethereum can work through these problems and upgrade quickly, it can maintain a decent ranking, however it\u2019s likely it will have to compete more and more with newer technologies and it may get used only for minor niches like hosting ICOs or specific smart contracts.StellarJed McCaleb\u200a\u2014\u200aMost likely the only person who has built two crypto-currency companies at scale. Co-founded eDonkey in 2001 (a p2p file sharing company). Created Mt Gox. Founded Ripple.The Stellar team attracted prestigious advisors like Patrick Collison, (Stripe), Sam Altman (President at Y combinator) and Matt Mullenweg (Founder of WordPress).Stellar is significantly cheaper and faster than other protocols. It costs 1 cent to make 100,000 transactions on Stellar. It\u2019s more secure than Ethereum\u200a\u2014\u200aits expressive but purposefully limited system for smart contracts limits potential to write exploitable code. Its simplicity makes it ideal for applications that don\u2019t require the full generality of Turing-complete smart contracts (which applies to the vast majority of ICOs and more complex contracts). In short it\u2019s high performance, secure and the costs of transacting on the network are exponentially cheaper.The first ICO to happen on the Stellar blockchain was mobius.network. Mobius was co-founded by David Gobaud, it is a sort of middleware for app developers, enabling the creation of decentralized apps, these are called \u201cDApp\u201d, to avoid the GooglePlay and AppStore pay tolls and to also link easily to different blockchains. They define themselves as the Stripe for blockchain. For Mobius, Stellar offers a level of expressivity that\u2019s very practical with significantly greater security and lower attack surface compared to Ethereum, plus transaction speeds and cost are highly attractive. It closed its token ICO in just two hours.EOSThe project is developed by a company called BlockOne, which is run by CTO Dan Larimer (co-founder of Bitshare and Steemit) and CEO Brendan Bloomer.\u00a0Brock Pierce is a partner, a venture capitalist and an entrepreneur who pioneered the market for digital currency in games.EOS is a blockchain smart contracts platform that promises great advances in addressing some of the key challenges in current blockchain tech\u2019s performance, such as user experience and governance. The key here is the word \u2018promise\u2019 because EOS is still undergoing development and doesn\u2019t actually have anything concrete.What it does promise is to achieve huge performance improvements over Ethereum\u2019s by implementing a number of scaling techniques, such as Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), parallel execution, partial evaluation and other optimisations. It wants to be a real contender in the decentralized app (DApp) arena, lowering the barriers to entry for developers and co and build a platform that can securely and smoothly scale to thousands of transactions per second whilst providing a good user experience. To reduce latency and maximise performance it is looking to use parallelisation in the production of blocks. The whitepaper talks of a way of breaking blocks into threads that can run in parallel. Interestingly Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange, just announced a new exchange built on top of EOS\u200a\u2014\u200aEOSfinex. The announcement states its reasons for choosing EOS are its fast transaction process, its minimal fee and attractive confirmation times.NEODa Hongfei\u200a\u2014\u200aFounderZhang Zhengwen\u2014Core Developer. Backed by the company OnChain. OnChain\u2019s system, known as DNA (Decentralized Network Architecture) aims to work with Chinese businesses and government. NEO acts as the foundation of DNA. If OnChain can integrate with Chinese businesses and government, that will greatly spur its adoption.Nicknamed \u2018the Ethereum of China\u2019 due to the way it has been built around providing an underlying set of platform-centric functionality. Released in China in 2014. Formally known as \u2018Antshares\u2019.According to its white paper it\u2019s committed to \u2018the use of blockchain technology and digital identity to digitise assets, the use of smart contracts for digital assets to be self-managed, to achieve \u2018smart economy\u2019 with a distributed network.\u2019 What a mouthful! In short, it\u2019s designed to digitise the world\u2019s economic system by providing a decentralised infrastructure through which smart contracts can be pushed. NEO is building by learning from Ethereum\u2019s mistakes so NEO is developing their platform in anticipation of future demands. Meanwhile Ethereum is developing in response to new demands.NEO is embedded in the Chinese market, which could be massive especially if developed properly. Being embedded in China will give them a huge advantage. China\u2019s giant domestic market provides tech ventures with enormous network effects that are present at such a large scale. Not only are tech ventures in China great at scaling up fast but also the state protects its nascent tech industry from foreign competition. However in terms of its function as an ICO platform\u200a\u2014\u200ait has some hurdles to overcome; the ban by the Chinese government of ICO activity has a significant impact on its activity but its expected to pick up in other countries this year.NEMLon Wong\u200a\u2014\u200aFounding President of the NEM.io Foundation. His journey to NEM began when he decided to take a second look at blockchain technology in 2013, after having been introduced to Bitcoin mining in 2010Jeff Mcdonald\u200a\u2014\u200aVice President NEM has been on the market since 2015 and has a large following in Japan, a country at the forefront of the legislation movement. The so-called \u2018smart asset blockchain\u2019 is apparently capable of operating at 4000 transactions per second, ie. it can withstand a fair amount of workload.NEM is not mined, it\u2019s harvested. When an account has 10,000 or more NEM (XEM), the money will naturally become vested by NEM\u2019s algorithm. NEM has its own consensus algorithm. It uses proof-of-importance. This means when a user attempts to send coins, his transactions list is according to priority, and many factors decide the importance of each transaction that has to happen on the network. This could be the number of coins a user has, the number a user is trying to move and the number of frequent transactions a user has made in the past. The more POI you have by holding stake and transacting, the more POI you gain. The more that XEM is used, the higher the amount harvesters receive. This is an incentive to invest in XEM because it will pay for its own fees.How is it different? Its system allows enterprises to customise and differentiate its blockchain technology\u200a\u2014\u200ait aims to solve the issue of incorporating blockchain into existing networks. A feat considered costly and time-consuming. It\u2019s attempting to move beyond the confines of the financial industry by targeting retail. Its Smart Asset System can be configured to allow loyalty points to be turned into a form of money that customers could then use. It also offers the ability to act as an authentication service with cryptographic signatures.Funnily enough NEM started out as a fork of NXT, another open source cryptocurrency and payment network platform, but fixed its own codebase after the team decided to rebuild the system with a strong focus on scaling and speed; it has learnt from everyone else\u2019s mistakes.One of its major partnerships is with the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDECC), a government-owned institute that manages digital infrastructure and security and technology related laws in Malaysia. It\u2019s a good start for NEM.All of the above want to become the part of the dominant blockchain platforms for the internet: for decentralized applications, ICOs and smart contracts.The issue with all of these cryptocurrencies is that barriers to entry are low. New virtual currencies are cropping up each month left right and centre, many with their own proprietary versions of blockchain. A better version of each of these could appear at any time taking the Microsoft crown. Adoption of any however could take some time; blockchain has been around for a decade but it arguably only came into the limelight with Bitcoin\u2019s price surge\u200a\u2014\u200ain a way, Bitcoin is to Blockchain what Yahoo was to the internet.

I wonder why I myself didn\u2019t. It was in 2013 I first heard about Bitcoin (yea, too late). I was poor to purchase one, so tried mining it. If I had been successful, you wouldn\u2019t be reading this. Later, I thought of studying its underlying technology, the Blockchain. But, I was too busy with my startup (that didn\u2019t work out either).Credits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdSo what is this \u201cBlockchain\u201d?There are two things. A block and a chain. At a very high level, it is just a chain of blocks. Since it\u2019s inside computers, we can rule out the physical stuff. Here digital information is divided into blocks and linked together. For example consider the following blocks, each represent a country. Each of them contains the city names of the respective country.Wait, there is something more. Each of these blocks has something called a hash. A hash is a set of characters (eg. \u201c1hi515AHA5H\u201d ). Hash is derived from the information contained in the block. The block of U.S.A has cities New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. So the hash would be something like \u201cNYLAC\u201d (Technically that\u2019s not the case, but you get the idea).Every successive block will contain the previous block\u2019s hash. This is what binds them together (The force). If someone tampers the first block to add the city Boston. The new hash becomes \u201cNYLACB\u201d. However, the succeeding block of India has already stored the hash as \u201cNYLAC\u201d. This mismatch will break the chain. So the purpose of hash is to make sure no one tampers it.What if someone changes the contents of a block and update the hash of successive blocks? This is possible but there is one thing I didn\u2019t tell you. The data of the blockchain doesn\u2019t lie in one computer. It is replicated in the computers of every user in the network. If you join a blockchain network, your computer will download these blocks. If someone tampers his version, the network will consider what majority say is correct.One more thing, in a Blockchain network, not only data but the program is also replicated. Computers collectively execute the program. Most internet apps are centralised. Consider Facebook, its data and program lies on its servers. Your computer requests information from Facebook\u2019s server on a need to know basis. In case of blockchain, there is no central thing. It relies on its user\u2019s computer to host its program. Yes, this means if every computer in the blockchain network switches off, it\u2019s dead.Public BlockchainsCredits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdDoes this mean Blockchain is formed by a group of people who keeps their computers running for goodwill? What is the use of these tamper-proof blocks?Blockchain networks have one or more functionalities. Bitcoin is a digital currency and a payment system. Its tamper-proof blocks hold ledger of all transactions. The people who sacrifice their computers are called miners. They get rewarded in bitcoins\u00a0.Ethereum has an additional functionality. It can host your code. Developing a blockchain from scratch and building your own community would be very difficult (Remember people has to sacrifice their computers for you?)\u00a0. Ethereum takes care of the heavy lifting. You need to pay a fee depending on the computational costs.Blockchain apps don\u2019t have to be just payments systems or cryptocurrencies. It could be anything, like a social network, a learning platform like LiveEdu, etc.Private BlockchainsCredits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdBitcoin, Ethereum, etc are examples of the public blockchain. Anyone can be a part of it. What if we want to make a private blockchain network? Why would someone need a private blockchain for? Have a look at these stories.Mark and SaraMark hasn\u2019t paid his rent for five months. When Sara questions he promise to pay later. She is helpless. She can\u2019t afford a lawyer. Courts take eight months to almost a year to enforce action. The only option is to persuade Mark.Joe\u2019s businessJoe is a businessman. He does business with different corporates on a frequent basis. A few months ago he signed a contract with a retailer. Though the conditions of the contract were met. The retailer refused to pay. These people take advantage of the legal system and persuade Joe to settle for less pay. Joe had such experiences before. In some cases, he went to court. The time and money he spent there cost him his profits.How do we help Sara and Joe?Have we solved this problem elsewhere? In Sara\u2019s case, we need to make Mark pay the rent every month. A time-based trigger. Your calendar app uses such trigger to give you notifications of predefined events.In Joe\u2019s case, once terms of the agreement is met the party needs to pay. It\u2019s a condition based trigger. Consider the last time you purchased an ebook from Amazon. Amazon will only deliver it once the payment is confirmed.The point is computer programs execute such instructions consistently. It did when you clicked on this article, scrolled down, etc\u00a0. In order to help Sara, we need to convert the agreements of the contract into code.Pseudo code of the smart contract between Sara and MarkIf today\u2019s date is 30th and rent is not paid thenTransfer $500 from Mark\u2019s account to Sara\u2019s accountBut where do we deploy this code? It should be deployed on computers of all parties involved. Sara\u2019s and Mark\u2019s bank will be part of a private Blockchain network. Joe and Sara will sign a coded contract(a.k.a smart contract). Then it\u2019s deployed on the network. Both Mark\u2019s and Sara\u2019s bank will have a copy. On 30th of every month when the clock ticks 12.00. The agreed amount gets transferred from Mark\u2019s account to Sara\u2019s account. Joe started using smart contracts to enforce his clients to pay the agreed amount.Sara is happy because she doesn\u2019t have to trust Mark\u2019s consent to transfer rent. Joe\u2019s glad because he doesn\u2019t have to go to a court for justice. Instead, he can spend those efforts to grow his business.Private blockchain will be restricted to the parties involved in the business. Joe won\u2019t be a part of the Sara\u2019s and Mark\u2019s Blockchain network.The Way\u00a0AheadCredits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdNow that you have some idea, you should take this course on edX(It\u2019s free).

This article was the Hacker News hit that framed the Ethereum Project launch in 2015.Spanish versionBehold SkynetEthereum brings up strong emotions. Some have compared it to SkyNet, the distributed artificial intelligence of the Terminator movies. Others once suggested the entire thing is a pipe dream. The network has been up for a few months now, and is showing no signs of hostile self-awareness\u200a\u2014\u200aor total collapse.But if you\u2019re not terribly technical, or technical in a different field it\u2019s easy to stare at all this stuff and think \u201cI\u2019ll get around to this later\u201d or decide to ignore it until the Guardian does a nice feature (e.g., Imogen Heap: saviour of the music industry? article).But, in truth, it\u2019s not that difficult to understand Ethereum, blockchains, Bitcoin and all the rest\u200a\u2014\u200aat least the implications for people just going about their daily business, living their lives. Even a programmer who wants a clear picture can get a good enough model of how it all fits together fairly easily. Blockchain explainers usually focus on some very clever low-level details like mining, but that stuff really doesn\u2019t help people (other than implementers) understand what is going on. Rather, let\u2019s look at how the blockchains fit into the more general story about how computers impact society.As is so often the case, to understand the present, we have to start in the past: blockchains are the third act of the play, and we are just at the beginning of that third act. So we must recap.SQL: Yesterday\u2019s best\u00a0ideaThe actual blockchain story starts in the 1970s when the database as we currently know it was created: the relational model, SQL, big racks of spinning tape drives, all of that stuff. If you\u2019re imagining big white rooms with expensive beige monoliths watched over by men in ties, you\u2019re in the right corner of history. In the age of Big Iron, big organizations paid big bucks to IBM and the rest for big databases and put all their most precious data assets in these systems: their institutional memory and customer relationships. The SQL language which powers the vast majority of the content management systems which run the web was originally a command language for tape drives. Fixed field lengths\u200a\u2014\u200aa bit like the 140 character limit on tweets\u200a\u2014\u200aoriginally served to let impatient programs fast forward tapes a known distance at super high speed to put the tape head exactly where the next record would begin. This was all going on round about the time I was born\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s history, but it\u2019s not yet ancient history.At a higher, more semantic level, a subtle distortion in how we perceive reality took hold: things that were hard to represent in databases became alternately devalued and fetishized. Years passed as people struggled to get the real world into databases using knowledge management, the semantic web, and many other abstractions. Not everything fit, but we ran society on these tools anyway. The things which did not fit cleanly in databases got marginalized, and life went on. Once in awhile a technical counter-current would take hold and try to push back on the tyranny of the database, but the general trend held firm: if it does not fit in the database, it does not exist.You may not think you know this world of databases, but you live in it. Every time you see a paper form with squares indicating one letter per box, you are interacting with a database. Every time you use a web site, there\u2019s a database (or more likely an entire mess of them) lurking just under the surface. Amazon, Facebook, all of that\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s all databases. Every time a customer service assistant shrugs and says \u201ccomputer says no\u201d or an organization acts in crazy, inflexible ways, odds-are there\u2019s a database underneath which has a limited, rigid view of reality and it\u2019s simply too expensive to fix the software to make the organization more intelligent. We live in these boxes, as pervasive as oxygen, and as inflexible as punched cards.Documents and the World Wide\u00a0WebThe second act is started by the arrival of Tim Berners-Lee and the advent of the web. It actually starts just a hair before his arrival. In the late 1980s and early 1990s we get serious about computer networking. Protocols like Telnet, Gopher, Usenet and Email itself provide a user interface to the spanning arcs of the early internet, but it\u2019s not until the 1990s we get mass adoption of networked computers, leading incrementally to me typing this on Google Docs, and you reading it in a web browser. This process of joining the dots\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cthe network is the computer\u201d as Sun Microsystems used to say)\u200a\u2014\u200awas fast. In the early 1990s, vast numbers of machines already existed, but they were largely stand-alone devices, or connected to a few hundred machines on a university campus without much of a window into the outside world. The software and hardware to do networking everywhere\u200a\u2014\u200athe network of networks, the internet\u200a\u2014\u200atook a long time to create, and then spread like wildfire. The small pieces became loosely joined, then tightly coupled into the network we know today. We are still riding the technological wave as the network gets smarter, smaller and cheaper and starts showing up in things like our lightbulbs under names like \u201cthe Internet of Things.\u201dBureaucracy and\u00a0machinesBut the databases and the networks never really learn to get on. The Big Iron in the machine rooms and the myriads of tiny little personal computers scattered over the internet like dew on a cobweb could not find a common world-model which allowed them to interoperate smoothly. Interacting with a single database is easy enough: forms and web applications of the kinds you use every day. But the hard problem is getting databases working together, invisibly, for our benefit, or getting the databases to interact smoothly with processes running on our own laptops.Those technical problems are usually masked by bureaucracy, but we experience their impact every single day of our lives. It\u2019s the devil\u2019s own job getting two large organizations working together on your behalf, and deep down, that\u2019s a software issue. Perhaps you want your car insurance company to get access to a police report about your car getting broken into. In all probability you will have to get the data out of one database in the form of a handful of printouts, and then mail them to the company yourself: there\u2019s no real connectivity in the systems. You can\u2019t drive the process from your laptop, except by the dumb process of filling in forms. There\u2019s no sense of using real computers to do things, only computers abused as expensive paper simulators. Although in theory information could just flow from one database to another with your permission, in practice the technical costs of connecting databases are huge, and your computer doesn\u2019t store your data so it can do all this work for you. Instead it\u2019s just something you fill in forms on. Why are we under-utilizing all this potential so badly?The Philosophy of\u00a0DataThe answer, as always, is in our own heads. The organizational assumptions about the world which are baked into computer systems are almost impossible to translate. The human factors\u200a\u2014\u200athe mindsets which generate the software\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t fit together. Each enterprise builds their computer system in their own image, and these images disagree about what is vital and what is incidental, and truth does not flow between them easily. When we need to translate from one world model to another, we put humans in the process, and we\u2019re back to processes which mirror filling in paper forms rather than genuinely digital cooperation. The result is a world in which all of our institutions seem to be at sixes and sevens, never quite on the same page, and things that we need in our ordinary lives seem to keep falling between the cracks, and every process requires filling in the same damn name and address data, twenty times a day, and more often if you are moving house. How often do you shop from Amazon rather than some more specialized store just because they know where you live?There are lots of other factors that maintain the gap between the theoretical potential of our computers and our everyday use of the\u200a\u2014\u200atechnological acceleration, constant change, the sheer expense of writing software. But it all boils down to mindset in the end. Although it looks like ones and zeros, software \u201carchitects\u201d are swinging around budgets you could use to build a skyscraper, and changing something late into a project like that has similar costs to tearing down a half-made building. Rows upon rows upon rows of expensive engineers throwing away months (or years) of work: the software freezes in place, and the world moves on. Everything is always slightly broken.Over and over again, we go back to paper and metaphors from the age of paper because we cannot get the software right, and the core to that problem is that we managed to network the computers in the 1990s, but we never did figure out how to really network the databases and get them all working together.There are three classic models for how people try and get their networks and databases working together smoothly.First Paradigm: the diverse peers\u00a0modelThe first approach is just to directly connect machines together, and work out the lumps as you go. You take Machine A, connect it over a network to Machine B, and fire transactions down the wire. In theory, Machine B catches them, writes them into its own database, and the job is good. In practice, there are a few problems here.The epistemological problem is quite severe. Databases, as commonly deployed in our organizations, store fact. If the database says the stock level is 31 units, that\u2019s the truth for the whole of the organization, except perhaps for the guy who goes down to the shelf and counts them, finds the real count is 29, and puts that in the database as a correction. The database is institutional reality.But when data leaves one database and flows into another, it crosses an organizational boundary. For Organization A, the contents of Database A are operationally reality, true until proven otherwise. But for Organization B, the communique is a statement of opinion. Consider an order: the order is a request, but it does not become a confirmed fact until after the payment clears past the point of a chargeback. A company may believe an order has occurred, but this is a speculation about someone else\u2019s intentions until cold hard cash (or bitcoin) clears all doubts. Up until that point, an \u201cordered in error\u201d signal can reset the whole process. An order exists as a hypotheses until a cash payment clears it from the speculative buffer it lives in and places it firmly in the fixed past as a matter of factual record: this order existed, was shipped, was accepted, and we were paid for it.But until then, the order is just a speculation.The shifting significance of a simple request for new paint brushes flowing from one organization to another, a statement of intention clearing into a statement of fact, is not something we would normally think about closely. But when we start to consider how much of the world, of our lives, run on systems that work much like this\u200a\u2014\u200afood supply chains, electrical grids, tax, education, medical systems, it\u2019s odd that these systems don\u2019t come to our notice more often.In fact, we only notice them when something goes wrong.The second problem with peer connection is the sheer instability of each peer connection. A little change to the software on one end or the other, and bugs are introduced. Subtle bugs which may not become visible until the data transferred has wormed its way deep into Organization B\u2019s internal records. A typical instance: an order was always placed in lots of 12, and processed as one box. But for some reason, one day an order is placed for 13, and somewhere far inside of Organization B, a stock handling spreadsheet crashes. There\u2019s no way to ship 1.083 of a box, and The Machine Stops.This instability is compounded by another factor: the need to translate the philosophical assumptions\u200a\u2014\u200ain fact, the corporate epistemology, of one organization into another organization\u2019s private internal language. Say we are discussing booking a hotel and car rental as a single action: the hotel wants to think of customers as credit card numbers, but the car rental office wants to think of customers as driving licenses. A small error results in customer misidentification, comedy as customers are mistakenly asked for their driving license numbers to confirm hotel room bookings\u200a\u2014\u200abut all anybody knows of the error is \u201ccomputer says no\u201d when customers read back their credit card details with no idea that the computer now wants something else.If you think this is a silly example, the Mars Climate Orbiter was lost by NASA in 1999 because one team was using inches, and the other, centimeters. These things go wrong all the time.But over a wire, between two commercial organizations, one can\u2019t simply look at the other guy\u2019s source code to figure out the error. Every time two organizations meet and want to automate their back end connections, all these issues have to be hashed out by hand. It\u2019s difficult, and expensive, and error prone enough that in practice companies would often rather use fax machines. This is absurd, but this is how the world really works today.Of course, there are attempts to clarify this mess\u200a\u2014\u200ato introduce standards and code reusability to help streamline these operations and make business interoperability a fact. You can choose from EDI, XMI-EDI, JSON, SOAP, XML-RPC, JSON-RPC, WSDL and half a dozen more standards to assist your integration processes.Needless to say, the reason there are so many standards is because none of them work properly.Finally, there is the problem of scaling collaboration. Say that two of us have paid the upfront costs of collaboration and have achieved seamless technical harmony, and now a third partner joins our union. And now a fourth, and a fifth. By five partners, we have 13 connections to debug. Six, seven\u2026 by ten the number is 45. The cost of collaboration keeps going up for each new partner as they join our network, and the result is small pools of collaboration which just will not grow.Remember, this isn\u2019t just an abstract problem\u200a\u2014\u200athis is banking, this is finance, medicine, electrical grids, food supplies, and the government.Our computers are a mess.Hub and Spoke: meet the new\u00a0bossOne common answer to this quandary is to cut through the exponential (well, quadratic) complexity of writing software to directly connect peers, and simply put somebody in charge. There are basically two approaches to this problem.The first is that we pick an organization\u200a\u2014\u200aVISA would be typical\u200a\u2014\u200aand all agree that we will connect to VISA using their standard interface. Each organization has to get just a single connector right, and VISA takes 1% off the top, and makes sure that everything clears properly.There are a few problems with this approach, but they can be summarized with the term \u201cnatural monopoly.\u201d The business of being a hub or a platform for others is quite literally a license to print money for anybody that achieves incumbent status in such a position. Political power in the form of setting terms of service and negotiating with regulators can be exerted, and over all an arrangement that might have started with an effort to create a neutral backbone rapidly turns into being clients of an all-powerful behemoth without which one simply cannot do business.This pattern recurs again and again in different industries, at different levels of complexity and scale, from railroads and fibre optics and runway allocation in airports through to liquidity management in financial institutions.In the database context, there is a subtle form of the problem: platform economics. If the \u201chub and spoke\u201d model is that everybody runs Oracle or Windows Servers or some other such system, and then relies on these boxes to connect to each-other flawlessly because, after all, they are clone-like peas in a pod, we have the same basic economic proposition as before: to be a member of the network, you rely on an intermediary who charges whatever they like for the privilege of your membership, with this tax disguised as a technical cost.VISA gets 1% or more of a very sizeable fraction of the world\u2019s transactions with this game. If you ever wonder what the economic upside of the blockchain business might be, just have a think about how big that number is.Protocols\u200a\u2014\u200aif you can find\u00a0themThe protocol is the ultimate \u201cunicorn.\u201d Not a company that is worth a billion dollars two years after it was founded, but an idea so good that it gets people to stop arguing about how to do things, and just get on with it and do them.The internet runs on a handful of these things: Sir Tim Berners Lee\u2019s HTTP and HTML standards have worked like magic, although of course he simply lit the fire and endless numbers of technologists gave us the wondrous mess we know and love now. SMTP, POP and IMAP power our email. BGP sorts out our big routers. There are a few dozen more, increasingly esoteric, which run most of the open systems we have.A common complaint about tools like Gchat or Slack is that they do jobs which have perfectly great open protocols in play (IRC or XMPP) but do not actually speak those protocols. The result is that there is no way to interoperate between Slack and IRC or Skype or anything else, without going through hacked together gateways that may or may not offer solid system performance. The result is a degradation of the technical ecosystem into a series of walled gardens, owned by different companies, and subject to the whims of the market.Imagine how much WikiPedia would suck by now if it was a start up pushing hard to monetize its user base and make its investors their money back.But when the protocol gambit works, what\u2019s created is huge genuine wealth\u200a\u2014\u200anot money, but actual wealth\u200a\u2014\u200aas the world is improved by things that just work together nicely. Of course, SOAP and JSON-RPC and all the rest aspire to support the formation of protocols, or even to be protocols, but the definitional semantics of each field of endeavor tend to create an inherent complexity which leads back towards hub and spoke or other models.Blockchains\u200a\u2014\u200aa fourth\u00a0way?You\u2019ve heard people talking about bitcoin. Missionary chaps in pubs absolutely sure that something fundamental has changed, throwing around terms like \u201cCentral Bank of the Internet\u201d and discussing the end of the nation state. Sharply dressed women on podcasts talking about the amazing future potential. But what\u2019s actually underneath all this? What is the technology, separated from the politics and the future potential?What\u2019s underneath it is an alternative to getting databases synchronized by printing out wads of paper and walking it around. Let\u2019s think about paper cash for a moment: I take a wad of paper from one bank to another, and the value moves from one bank account\u200a\u2014\u200aone computer system\u200a\u2014\u200ato another. Computer as paper simulator, once again. Bitcoin simply takes a paper-based process, the fundamental representation of cash, and replaces it with a digital system: digital cash. In this sense, you could see bitcoin as just another paper simulator, but it\u2019s not.Bitcoin took the paper out of that system, and replaced it with a stable agreement (\u201cconsensus\u201d) between all the computers in the bitcoin network about the current value of all the accounts involved in a transaction. It did this with a genuinely protocol-style solution: there\u2019s no middleman extracting rents, and no exponential system complexity from a myriad of different connectors. The blockchain architecture is essentially a protocol which works as well as hub-and-spoke for getting things done, but without the liability of a trusted third party in the center which might choose to extract economic rents. This is really a good, good thing. The system has some magic properties\u200a\u2014\u200asame agreed data on all nodes, eventually\u200a\u2014\u200awhich go beyond paper and beyond databases. We call it \u201cdistributed consensus\u201d but that\u2019s just a fancy way of saying that everybody agrees, in the end, about what truth (in your bank balance, in your contracts) is.This is kind of a big deal.In fact, it breaks with 40 years of experience of connecting computers together to do things. As a fundamental technique, blockchains are new. And in this branch of technology, genuinely new ideas move billions of dollars and set the direction of industries for decades. They are rare.Bitcoin lets you move value from one account to another without having to move either cash or go through the baroque wire transfer processes that banks use to shuffle numbers because the underlying database technology is new, modern and better: better services through better technology. Just like cash it is anonymous and decentralized, and bitcoin bakes in some monetary policy and issues the cash itself: a \u201cdecentralized bank.\u201d A central bank of the internet, if you will.Once you think of cash as a special kind of form, and cash transactions as paper shuffling to move stuff around in databases, it\u2019s pretty easy to see bitcoin clearly.It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that Bitcoin has stated us on the way out of a 40 year deep hole created by the limits of our database technology. Whether it can effect real change at a fiscal level remains to be seen.Ok, so what about Ethereum?Ethereum takes this \u201cbeyond the paper metaphor\u201d approach to getting databases to work together even further than bitcoin. Rather than replacing cash, Ethereum presents a new model, a fourth way. You push the data into Ethereum, it\u2019s bound permanently in public storage (the \u201cblockchain\u201d). All the organizations that need to access that information\u200a\u2014\u200afrom your cousin to your government\u200a\u2014\u200acan see it. Ethereum seeks to replace all the other places where you have to fill in forms to get computers to work together. This might seem a little odd at first\u200a\u2014\u200aafter all, you don\u2019t want your health records in such a system\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s right, you don\u2019t. If you were going to store health records online, you\u2019d need to protect them with an additional layer of encryption to ensure they couldn\u2019t be read\u200a\u2014\u200aand we should be doing this anyway. It\u2019s not common practice to apply appropriate encryption to private data, that\u2019s why you keep hearing about these enormous hacks and leaks.So what kinds of things would you like as public data? Let\u2019s start with some obvious things: your domain names. You own a domain name for your business, and people need to know that your business owns that domain name\u200a\u2014\u200anot somebody else. That unique system of names is how we navigate the internet as a whole: that\u2019s a clear example of something we want in a permanent public database. We\u2019d also like it if governments didn\u2019t keep editing those public records and taking domains offline based on their local laws: if the internet is a global public good, it\u2019s annoying to have governments constantly poking holes in it by censoring things they don\u2019t like.Crowdfunding as a test\u00a0bedAnother good example is crowdfunding for projects, as done by places like KickStarter, IndieGoGo and so on. In these systems, somebody puts a project online and gather funds, and there\u2019s a public record of how much funding has flown in. If it\u2019s over a certain number, the project goes live\u200a\u2014\u200aand we\u2019d like them to document what they did with the money. This is a very important step: we want them to be accountable for the funds they have taken in, and if the funds aren\u2019t sufficient, we want them returned where they came from. We have a global public good, the ability for people to organize and fund projects together. Transparency really helps, so this is a natural place for a blockchain.So let\u2019s think about the crowdfunding example in more detail. In a sense, giving money to a crowdfunding project is a simple contract:If the account balance is greater than $10000 then fund the project, and if I contributed more than $50, send me a t-shirt. Otherwise, return all the money.expressed as let\u2019s pretend code, that might be:See an actual example at https://ethereum.org/crowdsaleIf you represent this simple agreement as actual detailed code, you get something like this. This is a simple example of a Smart Contract, and smart contracts are one of the most powerful aspects of the Ethereum system.Crowdfunding potentially gives us access to risk capital backed by deep technical intelligence, and invested to create real political change. If, say, Elon Musk could access the capital reserves of everybody who believes in what he is doing, painlessly selling (say) shares in a future Mars City, would that be good or bad for the future of humanity?Building the mechanisms to enable this kind of mass collective action might be critical to our future. (e.g. See Coase\u2019s Blockchain youtube video)Smart ContractsThe implementation layer of all these fancy dreams is pretty simple: a smart contract envisages taking certain kinds of simple paper agreements and representing them as software. You can\u2019t easily imagine doing this for house painting\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cis the house painted properly?\u201d is not something a computer can do\u200a\u2014\u200ayet. But for contracts which are mainly about digital things\u200a\u2014\u200athink cell phone contracts or airline tickets or similar, which rely on computers to provide service or send you an e-ticket\u200a\u2014\u200asoftware already represents these contracts pretty well in nearly all cases. Very occasionally something goes wrong and all the legalese in English gets activated, and a human judge gets involved in a lawsuit, but that\u2019s a very rare exception indeed. Mostly we deal with web sites, and show the people in the system who help us (like airline gate staff) proof that we\u2019ve completed the transaction with the computers, for example by showing them our boarding passes. We go about our business by filling in some forms and computers go out and sort it all out for us, no humans required except when something goes wrong.To make that all possible today, companies offering those kinds of services maintain their own technical infrastructure\u200a\u2014\u200adotcom money pays for fleets of engineers and server farms and physical security around these assets. You can buy off-the-shelf services from people that will set you up an e-commerce website or some other simple case, but basically this kind of sophistication is the domain of the big companies because of all the overheads and technical skill you need before you can have a computer system take money and offer services.It\u2019s just hard and expensive. If you are starting a bank or a new airline, software is a very significant part of your budget, and hiring a technical team is a major part of your staffing challenge.Smart Contracts & the World\u00a0ComputerSowhat Ethereum offers is a \u201csmart contract platform\u201d which takes a lot of that expensive, difficult stuff and automates it. It\u2019s early days yet, so we can\u2019t do everything, but we are seeing a surprising amount of capability even from the first version of the world\u2019s first generally available smart contract platform.So how does a smart contract platform work? Just like bitcoin, lots and lots of people run the software, and get a few tokens (ether) for doing it. Those computers in the network all work together and share a common database, called the blockchain. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain stores financial transactions. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain stores smart contracts. You don\u2019t rent space in a data center and hire a bunch of system administrators. Rather, you use the shared global resource, the \u201cworld computer\u201d and the resources you put into the system go to the people whose computers make up this global resource. The system is fair and equitable.Ethereum is open source software, and the Ethereum team maintain it (increasingly with help from lots of independent contributors and other companies too.) Most of the web runs on open source software produced and maintained by similar teams: we know that open source software is a good way to produce and maintain global infrastructure. This makes sure that there\u2019s no centralized body which can use its market power to do things like jack up the transaction fees to make big profits: open source software (and its slightly more puritan cousin, Free Software) help keep these global public goods free and equitable for everybodyThe smart contracts themselves, which run on the Ethereum platform, are written in simple languages: not hard to learn for working programmers. There\u2019s a learning curve, but it\u2019s not different from things that working professionals do every few years as a matter of course. Smart contracts are typically short: 500 lines would be long. But because they leverage the huge power of cryptography and blockchains, because they operate across organizations and between individuals, there is enormous power in even relatively short programs.So what do we mean by world computer? In essence, Ethereum simulates a perfect machine\u200a\u2014\u200aa thing which could never exist in nature because of the laws of physics, but which can be simulated by a large enough computer network. The network\u2019s size isn\u2019t there to produce the fastest possible computer (although that may come later with blockchain scaling) but to produce a universal computer which is accessible from anywhere by anybody, and (critically!) which always gives the same results to everybody. It\u2019s a global resource which stores answers and cannot be subverted, denied or censored (See From Cyperpunks to Blockchains video on youtube).We think this is kind of a big deal.A smart contract can store records on who owns what. It can store promises to pay, and promises to deliver without having middleman or exposing people to the risk of fraud. It can automatically move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past, like a will or a futures contract. For pure digital assets there is no \u201ccounterparty risk\u201d because the value to be transferred can be locked into the contract when it is created, and released automatically when the conditions and terms are met: if the contract is clear, then fraud is impossible, because the program actually has real control of the assets involved rather than requiring trustworthy middle men like ATM machines or car rental agents.And this system runs globally, with tens and eventually hundreds of thousands of computers sharing the workload and, more importantly, backing up the cultural memory of who promised what to whom. Yes, fraud is still possible, at the edge of the digitial, but many kinds of outright banditry are likely to simply die out: you can check the blockchain and find out if the house has been sold twice, for example. Who really owns this bridge in Brooklyn? What happens if this loan defaults? All there, as clear as crystal, in a single shared global blockchain. That\u2019s the plan, anyway.Democratized access to the state of the\u00a0artAll of this potentially takes the full power of modern technology and puts it into the hands of programmers who are working in an environment not much more complex than coding web sites. These simple programs are running on enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. That creates markets, registries like domain names, and many other things that we do not currently understand because they have not been built yet. When the web was invented to make it easy to publish documents for other people to see, nobody would have guessed it would revolutionize every industry it touched, and change people\u2019s personal lives through social networks, dating sites, and online education. Nobody would have guessed that Amazon could one day be bigger than Wal-Mart. It\u2019s impossible to say for sure where smart contracts will go, but it\u2019s hard not to look at the web, and dream.Although an awful lot of esoteric computer science was required to create a programming environment that would let relatively ordinary web skills move around property inside of a secure global ecosystem, that work has been done. Although Ethereum is not yet a cakewalk to program, that\u2019s largely an issue of documentation, training, and the gradual maturation of a technical ecosystem. The languages are written and are good: the debuggers take more time. But the heinous complexity of programming your own smart contract infrastructure is gone: smart contracts themselves are simpler than modern JavaScript, and nothing a web programmer will be scared of. The result is that we expect these tools to be everywhere fairly soon, as people start to want new services, and teams form to deliver them.The Future?Iam excited precisely because we do not know what we have created, and more importantly, what you and your friends will create with it. My belief is that terms like \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d and \u201cWeb 3.0\u201d will be inadequate\u200a\u2014\u200ait will be a new thing, with new ideas and new culture embedded in a new software platform. Each new medium changes the message: blogging brought long form writing back, and then twitter created an environment where brevity was not only the soul of wit, but by necessity its body also. Now we can represent simple agreements as free speech, as publication of an idea, and who knows where this leads.Ethereum Frontier is a first step: it\u2019s a platform for programmers to build services you might access through a web browser or a phone app. Later we\u2019ll release Ethereum Metropolis, which will be a web browser like program, currently called Mist, which takes all the security and cryptography inherent in Ethereum and packages it nicely with a user interface that anybody can use. The recent releases of Mist showcase a secure wallet, and that\u2019s just the start. The security offered by Mist is far stronger than current e-commerce systems and phone apps have. In the medium term, contract production systems will be stand-alone, so nearly anybody can download a \u201cdistributed application builder\u201d and load it up with their content and ideas and upload it\u200a\u2014\u200afor simple things, no code will be required, but the full underlying power of the network will be available. Think along the lines of an installation wizard, but instead of setting up your printer, you are configuring the terms of a smart contract for a loan: how much money, how long, what repayment rates.

In a little while\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re talking a year or two\u200a\u2014\u200aEthereum Serenity will take the network to a whole new level. Right now, adding more computers to the Ethereum network makes it more secure, but not faster. We manage the limited speed of the network using Ether, a token which gives priority on the network etc. In the Serenity system, adding more computers to the network makes it faster, and this will finally allow us to build systems which really are internet scale: hundreds of millions of computers working together to do jobs we collectively need done. Today we might guess at protein folding or genomics or AI, but who\u2019s to say what uses will be found for such brilliant software.I hope this non-technical primer on the Ethereum ecosystem has been useful, and as soon as we have a user friendly version of the system available for general use, you\u2019ll be the first to know!byVinay Gupta, CEO, Mattereum.@leashlessLayout by Eva Shon, along with icons from thenounproject.com", "responses": "29"}, {"title": "VeChainX\u200a\u2014\u200aDecentralized Exchange for the New Equity Blockchain!", "author_name": "VeChain X", "link": "https://medium.com/@vechainx/vechainx-decentralized-exchange-for-the-new-equity-blockchain-c09bc28a5cd5?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 19, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "12.7K", "content": "VeChainX\u200a\u2014\u200aDecentralized Exchange for the New Equity Blockchain!VeChain XBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 19, 2018INTRODUCTIONVeChainX is establishing a unique Decentralized Exchange Platform that will give opportunities to traders to trade Cryptocurrencies With less Fees, Anonymous and they able to use unlimited trading options!Problems faced by Cryptocurrency ExchangesThe appearance of Bitcoin in 2009 generated demand for platforms where it would be possible to exchange cryptocurrencies. As it\u2019s commonly known, demand generates supply. Many successful projects such as Okex, Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitfinex, BTC China, Kraken, and BTC-E are a confirmation of that.However, many of these projects were forced to close due to low levels of financial and development maturity at the time, as well as the inability to withstand DDoS and hacking attacks. On top of that, they experienced significant legislative and regulatory issues.How is the VeChainX team solving these problems?The VeChainX Platform is able to withstand DDoS attacks of any length.

Amazing! Isn\u2019t it? Thanks to the Blockchain Technology for making this possible.More and more people around the world are now becoming aware of the Blockchain Technology and believed to totally change their business approach. The fact that these technologies has been the highlights of every online advertisements from the past couple of years, these fascinating technology leaves a very good impression that global adaptation has now been started. Thanks to the different social media platforms that helped spread awareness about the marvels of the Blockchain Technology & the underlying principles that made this technology indeed a disruptive innovation.Now, let\u2019s dig deeper to find the reasons why we need to get along with this journey to the next level. Let\u2019s take a look at the top five sectors on different industries that blockchain can amazingly transform.Financial SectorHave you not noticed the way we transact payment these days? It\u2019s cashless, isn\u2019t it? A simple swipe of a credit card or a debit card or online fund transfer through payment gateways completes your transactions. Whether you pay your bills or purchase an item on an ecommerce website, you can make the deal done in just a few taps from your device. Paid & complete.The financial sector has been the first industry that uses tokenization, a process of replacing a tangible asset, which is our money, into it\u2019s digital counterpart, online funds. The same tokenization process can be applied in the blockchain today. The huge difference is that, banks uses the traditional credit, debit and payment gateways uses a central hub that secures the data of all financial transactions. And what is this central hub? Well, we do not know. The public does not need to know because this is the target of many hackers to exploit. Now, that\u2019s where blockchain comes into play. It is a growing public ledger where all actions are recorded and can be verified by people involved in the transactions. It Also keeps an audit trail that cannot be altered so that when someone attempts to steal, such unscrupulous user needs to exit with the unique exit map that the real owner only knows. So, basically, escaping without leaving a trace is impossible. Plus, the whole public can watch you do your thing online!Information TechnologyThe information technology principles applied to blockchain makes it the best infrastructure to build many business management systems because it allows individuality and traceability of any employees that has to conform into their daily tasks on the job. Careers in Information Technology is highly valuable these days. Especially when the person has some hacking ideas. Offering their skills in maintaining an infrastructure instead of deploying destruction, they can perform a better descent job in maintaining and improving the cybersecurity across all networks instead.MedicalBlockchain Technology offers more safety and convenience. Aside from storing patient\u2019s information, it also helps patient\u2019s ownership of his own medical, health and diagnosis history. This way, referencing to previous prescribed drugs, records of allergies, drug reactions and all of a person\u2019s health trails can easily be accessed and reviewed by healthcare personnel. This way, Doctors will not have to predict a person\u2019s health history anymore. Blockchain can be very useful in solidifying proof of medical records of any person as well as eradicating unauthorized access to highly confidential health concerns of a patient.SchoolsNothing can be more important for a school owner/administrator than to keep all the school records safe. Aside from grades as highly confidential, part of a school\u2019s administrative responsibility is to keep the confidentiality of every student\u2019s family backgrounds and residences. School records are one of the most valuable source of identity for a person because this is a record of an individual from toddler to adulthood. Blockchain can be used for these school records allowing only the parents, the student and the administrator their level of access.Real Estates2019 is predicted to be the year of the most traditional, highly regulated, Trillion Dollar industry to jump into using the robust technology of the blockchain. As it has been the most illiquid market in the world, real estate is coming into the picture through the idea of asset tokenization. Just like the financial sector where gold reserves is the basis of the monetary asset and value of money, Real Estate has its own tangible asset that can also use the process of tokenization. And through the blockchain technology, transactions can be made faster, easier and more convenient for everyone.So, where do cryptocurrency play its role in any of these 5 sectors? Well, each and every transaction from any of these sectors entails payments and if people that are involved comes from different countries, then payment can be very challenging due to the currency exchange and high transaction fees. Cryptocurrency can lessen the burden of passing from one payment gateway to another and deductions can be very minimal. Additionally, although fund transfer on cryptocurrency may not be real-time yet, but it is still proven to be way much faster and gets completed within few seconds or just a couple of hours without exceeding a whole day.Fortunately, there is C Estates Inc. A real estate company that uses technology to build a platform that everyone can use and does not simply rely on one-to-one transactions. It\u2019s business model is built in a smart asset blockchain technology that creates a complimenting ecosystem making real estate easy for everyone!", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Investigating the $40M Binance\u00a0Hack", "author_name": "Anthony Xie", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/investigating-the-40m-binance-hack-586036ec8d?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 10", "readtime": "10 min read", "upvotes": "52", "content": "Investigating the $40M Binance\u00a0HackAnthony XieBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 10Readers who follow me know that I\u2019m the founder of HodlBot. We built an easy way for investors to automatically diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios across indices, and custom user-created funds.To use our platform, users must first connect their exchange account of choice to HodlBot. While users manage & track their portfolios on HodlBot, the actual trades are completed on the exchange through the API.For almost a year, HodlBot only supported Binance. We chose Binance as the first exchange we ever integrated with because we had faith in Binance\u2019s track-record, security protocols, and commitment to their users.So it was quite the devastating blow to find out that Binance had been hacked for 7,000 BTC.What we\u00a0knowBinance has not said much about the hack. While they\u2019ve shared details about damages, they have been very quiet about the finer details.According to their most recent blog post, they are striving to maintain the highest degree of transparency, but are concerned that sharing too many security details will tip off hackers and ultimately weaken their own security.Nevertheless, I do believe it\u2019s important for the community to understand what happened, so I will be doing a deep dive in this article.Timeline of\u00a0EventsHere\u2019s what we know about the timeline of events.May 7 at ~5:15 PM UTC7,074 BTC is withdrawn from Binance\u2019s hot wallet.May 7 at ~7:00 PM UTCBinance shuts down deposit and withdrawals for unscheduled maintenance. CZ assures users that funds are SAFU and that trading will not be disrupted.May 7 at ~11:36 PM UTCBinance announces a security breach and confirms that hackers were able to withdraw ~7,000 BTC from Binance\u2019s hot wallet.May 8 at 12:42 PM UTCBinance restricts all existing API keys to trade-only and announces that all existing API keys will be deleted at 1:30 PM UTC.May 8 at 1:30 PM UTCBinance deletes all existing API keys.How was the Attack Similar to Last\u00a0Time?Both the most recent attack and the attempts in the past have involved Binance\u2019s API and phishing.Hackers phish users by disguising themselves as trustworthy entities and tricking users into divulging sensitive information.A fake Binance log-in screen used to phish unsuspecting usersOften the stolen information are users API keys, which give the attacker the ability to programmatically interact with the exchange as if they were the user themselves.On Binance there are 3 distinct levels of API permissions:Read\u200a\u2014\u200aability to get data about holdings, trade history, and the market.Trade\u200a\u2014\u200aability to execute tradesWithdrawal\u200a\u2014\u200aability to withdraw fundsWhen a user creates a set of API keys, by default, read & trade permissions are enabled and withdrawal access is disabled. Because withdrawal carries a much higher risk, Binance requires users to first set up 2-factor authentication and IP whitelisting.During the SYS & VIA attacks, attackers mostly got their hands on API keys with trade-only access. Because attackers can\u2019t withdraw from accounts that have trade-only access, they had to first relocate the funds.Here\u2019s how they did it:Before the attack, the culprits target an exchange pair that is easy to manipulate. Typically these pairs have low trading volume and a thin order book. Hackers buy up a bunch of these coins ahead of time.Right before the pump, the attackers place limit orders to sell their coins at ridiculous prices (often 10,000x the normal price).Attackers use stolen accounts to send a torrent of buy orders via the API, ripping through the entire order book and purchasing their own coins on the other side of the market at 10,000x the normal price. When this is complete, they will have effectively transferred wealth from accounts that have trade-only access, to accounts that have withdrawal access.Attackers try to withdraw their spoils from Binance. Once it\u2019s off the exchange and onto the blockchain, it becomes almost impossible for anyone to reverse the trades.The evidence for this strategy at play can be found in Binance\u2019s trading history. During the 2018 API hacks, attackers pumped SYS & VIA prices in an attempt to move funds as aforementioned.As shown in the following 1D candles and volume charts, prices & volumes spiked across SYS/BTC and VIA/BTC pairs on July 3, 2018 and March 6, 2018 respectively. More details about the previous hacks here.What\u2019s Different This\u00a0Time?This time, the attack was different. As per Binance\u2019s official statement, hackers were able to obtain a large number of user API keys, 2FA codes, and other sensitive information.With 2FA codes, attackers are completely able to enable withdrawal access and disable IP whitelisting. This makes the attack much easier to pull off, as hackers no longer need to arouse suspicion by inadvertently pumping coin prices while transferring funds away from trade-only accounts.In order to confirm this line of reasoning, I pulled the last month of hourly-tick trade data from Binance\u2019s API.If API keys were used to manipulate trades, our sweep will show any abnormal spikes in trading volume and price.Comparing 30D Max vs. 1D Max (Hourly Trade\u00a0Data)I calculated the 30-day max for hourly trading volume and trading price across every single exchangeable pair on Binance prior to the hack. I also calculated the 1-day hourly max for trading volume and price on the day of the hack.The goal is to compare the two and see if hourly prices or trading volumes spiked during the day of the hack.Trading Volume ComparisonThe following table is sorted by the percentage difference between the 1D hourly max, and the 30D hourly max.We saw a 3x increase in LINK/PAX hourly trading volume during the day of the hack, but the figure is not high enough to warrant suspicion, especially given the fact that LINK/PAX prices didn\u2019t shoot up as well.Price ComparisonDuring the day of the hack, we only saw a 34% increase in price percentage in the most extreme case.This further backs up the claim that attackers did not manipulate prices this time around.While it\u2019s possible that attackers sprinkled trades around to not get noticed, I don\u2019t think this is likely. To move anywhere in the neighbour of 7,000 BTC in trading volume without disturbing the price & trading volume would require many accounts, and or, a lot of time.If this were the case, the trading activity over a prolonged amount of time is likely to arouse suspicion from the original account owners, who see their funds slowly deplete. Any user complaints to Binance would spell disaster for the hackers.Getting Away with Highway\u00a0RobberyBitcoin\u2019s value and reliability are greatly due to the fact that the ledger is immutable. But also this means that once a successful withdrawal is made, it becomes basically impossible to retrieve the stolen funds.Binance confirmed that the hackers were able to withdraw ~7000 BTC in this one transaction. I used Google BigQuery to query the transactions related to the hack and plotted the movement of the stolen funds in the graphs below.The circles represent wallet addresses. The lines represent the flow of funds. The circles and line widths are proportional to the amount of Bitcoin being sent between addresses.Transaction Depth=1Output values with BTC < 1 filtered\u00a0out.Transaction Depth=2Output values with BTC < 1 filtered\u00a0out.Transaction Depth=3Output values with BTC < 1 filtered\u00a0out.Transaction Depth=4Output values with BTC < 1 filtered\u00a0out.Current State of the Stolen\u00a0FundsAs far as I can tell, there are no transactions beyond depth=4. The stolen Bitcoin is being shuffled and being parked in stationary addresses.Here is a much bigger visualization with individual wallet addresses labelled.Output values with BTC < 1 filtered\u00a0out.The Difficulty with Tracking Stolen\u00a0FundsAt some point, it will be highly infeasible to track where these Bitcoins are due to the fact that the number of transactions involving these stolen coins will scale exponentially.Currently, there are 3 common ways of tracking tainted coins.Poison\u200a\u2014\u200a3 stolen bitcoins and 7 good bitcoins go into a transaction, 10 stolen bitcoin come out.Haircut\u200a\u2014\u200a3 stolen bitcoins, and 7 good bitcoins go into a transaction, 10 come out marked as 30% stolen.FIFO\u200a\u2014\u200a3 stolen bitcoins, and 7 good bitcoins go into a transaction. The first 3 that come out are marked as stolen.In my opinion, none of these methods work well in the long-run. Labelling tainted coins and blacklisting fundamentally weakens the fungibility of and the censorship-resistant nature of Bitcoin. I side with those who think we should abandon all hope of ever trying to repossess or blacklist these stolen coins.Clearing Up Conspiracy TheoriesExchange hacks are a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. While we won\u2019t have time to address them all in the article, we can tackle some of the most poignant ones.Binance messed up and burned 7,000 by sending BTC to Segwit addresses that cannot send funds anywhereThis is fundamentally not true. You can\u2019t see Segwit transactions onBlockchain.com but you can easily see them here.It was an inside job to promote their DEXTerrible business move. Binance loses a huge amount of brand equity for what? In the midst of all of this, they haven\u2019t even promoted their DEX.There was more than 7,000 BTC that was stolenAll we have is Binance\u2019s official numbers. There is no evidence of this currently. Pundits are carefully watching Binance hot wallets.Security Breach Without API Keys Being CompromisedThis one is more likely. Rumour has it 700 accounts with withdrawal access were compromised. No one has come forward saying that their account was hacked. Since passwords and 2FA were compromised, you\u2019d imagine Binance would ask users to reset their personal information. At the same time, If API keys were not compromised, why would Binance reset API keys?Attackers are still in control of many accounts that Binance does not know aboutIt\u2019s possible. Binance reset API keys, but hackers could still have access to a bunch of accounts via stolen personal information.What Does This Mean for the Future of Centralized Exchanges?The Push for DEXsObviously hacks like these serve a reminder that centralized exchanges are fallible and act as a push for DEX.At the same time, DEX trading volume was at an all-time low at the beginning of 2019.Diar reportAt the end of the day, it looks like people are still favouring convenience, speed, liquidity over security.There is simply no better choice than centralized exchanges if you want to:Retain full control over your assetsObtain favourable trading prices and access to liquid marketsPay low transaction fees.Diversifying Your Assets Across Multiple ExchangesGiven that centralized exchanges are still crucial, one way to mitigate your risk is by diversifying your assets across exchanges. We offer an easy way to do that at HodlBot.What Does This Mean for the Future of\u00a0Binance?Binance can make the $40 million back in 47 daysIn the grand scheme of things $40 million isn\u2019t a devastating amount, especially for one of the largest and most profitable exchanges in the world.The $40 million Binance hack ranks as the 6th highest in terms of $USD value lost.Trading bots are InevitableAPI keys and phishing were a common theme across the last 3 hack attempts at Binance. Warning users to not give any third-party service providers access to your personal API key is simply unrealistic. This kind of unilateral statement punishes both negligent trading applications as well as security conscious ones like ours.Instead of condemning 3rd party trading applications and turning a blind eye to them, which does absolutely nothing, Binance should look to support them by launching their own OAuth client. In doing so, Binance can actually improve trading security and mitigate the risk of future API mishaps by having closer control and supervision.

Practically completely change the music industry, through the functions and advantages that the Blockchain technology puts at our disposal.For more than 20 months, our team of developers have been working hard to build the BitSong Ecosystem and now that we are really close to the launch of our first Testnet, we are writing this article to introduce you a little into the architecture and general logic of network operations and provide you with the reasons behind our choices in the past.The first step we have taken has been to choose a Blockchain suited to our needs, on which to implement our ecosystem. Initially we launched on the idea of \u200b\u200bEthereum, as at the time it enjoyed very high hype but it was also the most advanced Blockchain in terms of functions. However, after a few months and after talking to various industry experts, we realized that it did not fit our needs, as it does not have the speed we need, it uses the Proof of Work and the development is not exactly in line with our principles, but also the fact that the EVM has many bugs. Finally, we decided to leave Ethereum and continue the research.At that point another option was Graphene, but the idea was immediately set aside, as graphene has not been updated for many months and it seemed almost as if the developers have abandoned the project. At that point we found Tendermint, with whom there was immediately \u201clove\u201d. It seemed that Tendermint was perfectly suited to what we had in mind and so we started working on it.TendermintBased on the DLS protocol, it does not require any \u201cactive\u201d mining\u200a\u2014\u200aas is the case with Proof-of-Work\u200a\u2014\u200aand can ensure the secure operation of the network provided there are more than two-thirds of \u201chonest\u201d actors.Advantages:The project was initially developed as a framework for blockchain networksPoS consensusFast block timesHigh throughputIt takes one block for a transaction to be confirmedExperienced dev teamExcellent documentationDisadvantages:When we started developing BitSong we were still far from the release of our framework and there could be high risks of failure.From Tendermint we then landed on Cosmos SDK, which is the basis of the entire BitSong Ecosystem!Cosmos is an ecosystem of blockchains that can scale and interoperate with each other. Before Cosmos, blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. They were hard to build and could only handle a small amount of transactions per second. Cosmos solves these problems with a new technical vision. In order to understand this vision we need to go back to the fundamentals of blockchain technology.The vision of Cosmos is achieved through a set of open source tools like Tendermint, the Cosmos SDK and IBC designed to let people build custom, secure, scalable and interoperable blockchain applications quickly.We inform you that today, May 11th of 2019, the BITSONG OFFICIAL BASE was\u00a0born!!The only functions currently active are the creation of a wallet and transactions.As follows we present the roadmap of our Blockchain:Staking moduleDistribution moduleMinting moduleGovernance moduleProposal moduleThe basic modules of our blockchain are those of being distributed and operating the mechanism of how BitSong will work. Once these steps are completed, the first official testnet will be launched, then the next modules will be created which will be dedicated to the artists.The format of the bitsong address is bech32 and will start with the \u201cbitsong\u201d prefix.BitSong is compatible with any Cosmos HUB application, in fact it is immediately available, the compatibility with Ledger Nano S.As follows, we also present the application roadmap:Block explorerWalletAPI ConsoleStreaming PlayerWe also remind you that we will carry out all open source activities on Github, so we invite you to follow us on our github channel to be aware of all developments.

That\u2019s why they gave themselves an absolute monopoly on minting moolah.They turned shiny metal into coins, paid their soldiers and their soldiers bought things at local stores. The king then sent their soldiers to the merchants with a simple message:\u201cPay your taxes in this coin or we\u2019ll kill you.\u201dThat\u2019s almost the entire history of money in one paragraph. Coercion and control of the supply with violence, aka the \u201cviolence hack.\u201d The one hack to rule them all.When power passed from monarchs to nation-states, distributing power from one strongman to a small group of strongmen, the power to print money passed to the state. Anyone who tried to create their own money got crushed.The reason is simple:Centralized enemies are easy to destroy with a \u201cdecapitation attack.\u201d Cut off the head of the snake and that\u2019s the end of anyone who would dare challenge the power of the state and its divine right to create coins.That\u2019s what happened to e-gold in 2008, one of the first attempts to create an alternative currency. Launched in 1996, by 2004 it had over a million accounts and at its peak in 2008 it was processing over $2 billion dollars worth of transactions.The US government attacked the four leaders of the system, bringing charges against them for money laundering and running an \u201cunlicensed money transmitting\u201d business in the case \u201cUNITED STATES of America v. E-GOLD, LTD, et al.\u201d It destroyed the company by bankrupting the founders. Even with light sentences for the ring leaders, it was game over. Although the government didn\u2019t technically shut down e-gold, practically it was finished. \u201cUnlicensed\u201d is the key word in their attack.The power to grant a license is monopoly power.E-gold was free to apply for interstate money transmitting licenses.It\u2019s just they were never going to get them.And of course that put them out of business. It\u2019s a living, breathing Catch-22. And it works every time.Kings and nation states know the real golden rule:Control the money and you control the world.And so it\u2019s gone for thousands and thousands of years. The very first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (260\u2013210 BC), abolished all other forms of local currency and introduced a uniform copper coin. That\u2019s been the blueprint ever since. Eradicate alternative coins, create one coin to rule them all and use brutality and blood to keep that power at all costs.In the end, every system is vulnerable to violence.Well, almost every one.The HydraIn decentralized systems, there is no head of the snake. Decentralized systems are a hydra. Cut off one head and two more pop-in to take its place.In 2008, an anonymous programmer, working in secret, figured out the solution to the violence hack once and for all when he wrote: \u201cGovernments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\u201dAnd the first decentralized system of money was born:Bitcoin.It was explicitly designed to resist coercion and control by centralized powers.Satoshi wisely remained anonymous for that very reason. He knew they would come after him because he was the symbolic head of Bitcoin.That\u2019s what\u2019s happened every time someone has come forward claiming to be Satoshi or when someone has been \u201couted\u201d by the news media as Bitcoin\u2019s mysterious creator. When fake Satoshi Craig Wright came out, Australian authorities immediately raided his house. The official reason is always spurious. The real reason is to cut off the head of the snake.As Bitcoin rises in value, the hunt for Satoshi will only intensify. He controls at least a million coins that have never moved from his original wallets. If VC Chris Dixon is right and Bitcoin rocket to $100,000 a coin, those million coins will shoot up to $100 billion. If it goes even higher, say a $1 million a coin, that would make him the world\u2019s first trillionaire. And that will only bring the hammer down harder and faster on him. You can be 100% sure that black ops units would be gunning for him around the clock.Wherever he is, my advice to Satoshi is this:Stay anonymous until your death bed.But resistance to censorship and violence are only one of a number of incredible features of Bitcoin. Many of those key components are already at work in a number of other cryptocurrencies and decentralized app projects, most notably blockchains.Blockchains are distributed ledgers, the third entry in the world\u2019s first triple-entry accounting system. And breakthroughs in accounting have always presaged a massive uptick in human complexity and economic growth, as I laid out in my article Why Everyone Missed the Most Important Invention in the Last 500 Years.But even triple-entry accounting, decentralization and resistance to the violence hack are not the true power of cryptocurrencies. Those are merely the mechanisms of the system, the way it survives and thrives, bringing new capabilities to the human race.The ultimate feature is one that Bitcoin and current cryptocurrencies have only hinted at so far, a latent feature.The true power of cryptocurrencies is the power to print and distribute money without a central power.Maybe that seems obvious, but I assure you, it\u2019s not. Especially the second part.That power has always rested with the divine right of kings and nation-states.Until now.Now that right returns to its rightful owners: The people.And that will blow open the doors of world commerce, sowing the seeds for Star Trek like abundance economics, leaving the Old World Order of pure scarcity economics in the pages of history books.There\u2019s just one problem.Nobody has created the cryptocurrency we actually need just yet.You see, Satoshi understood the first part of the maxim, the power to print money. What he missed was the power to distribute that money.The second part is actually the most crucial part of the puzzle. Missing it created a critical flaw in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Instead of distributing the money far and wide, it traded central bankers for an un-elected group of miners.These miners play havoc with the system, holding back much needed software upgrades like SegWit for years and threatening pointless hard forks in order to drive down the price with FUD and scoop up more coins at a depressed price.But what if there was a different way?What if you could design a system that would completely alter the economic landscape of the world forever?The key is how you distribute the money at the moment of creation.And the first group to recognize this opportunity and put it into action will change the world.To understand why you have to look at how money is created and pushed out into the system today.The Great\u00a0PyramidToday, money starts at the top and flows down to everyone else. Think of it as a pyramid.In fact, we have a famous pyramid, with a third eye, on the dollar itself.One of the most cliched arguments against Bitcoin is that it\u2019s a Ponzi or \u201cpyramid\u201d scheme. A pyramid scheme rests on the original creators of the system roping in as many suckers as possible, paying them for enrolling people in the system rather than by offering goods and services. Eventually you run out of people to bring in and the whole things collapses like a house of cards. A Ponzi scheme is basically the same, in that you dupe the original investors with fake returns on their initial investment, a la Bernie Madoff, and then get them to rope in more suckers because they\u2019re so elated by the huge returns.The irony of course is that fiat currency, i.e. government printed money like the Yen or US dollar, is closer to a pyramid scheme than Bitcoin. Why? Because fiat money is minted at the top of the pyramid by central banks and then \u201ctrickled down\u201d to everyone else.The only problem is, it doesn\u2019t trickle down all that well.It moves out to a few big banks, who either lend it to people or give it to people for their labor. In fact, having a job or getting a loan are the primary methods that people at the bottom of the pyramid get any of the money. In other words, they trade their current time (with a job) or their future time (with a loan) for that money. It\u2019s just that their time is a limited resource and they can only trade so much of it before it runs out.Think of economics as a game. Everyone in the system is a player, looking to maximize their advantage and the advantage of their team (a company, their family and friends, etc.) to get more of the money. But to start the game you need to initially distribute the money or nobody can play. Distributing money sets the playing field.Now if you were in charge of the money, how would you distribute it to the network? You\u2019d want to keep as much of it for yourself as possible, so you\u2019d set the rules to maximize your own personal advantage. Of course you would! That\u2019s what anyone in their right mind would do, maximize their own power to keep it for as long as possible.That\u2019s precisely what the kings and queens of the ancient world did, and that\u2019s what nation states do today. As Naval Ravikant said in his epic series of tweets on blockchain, today\u2019s networks are run by \u201ckings, corporations, aristocracies, and mobs.\u201d \u201cAnd the Rulers of these networks [are] the most powerful people in society.\u201dThat\u2019s why every single system in the history of the world has distributed the money in one way:From the top down.Because it maximizes the advantage of the kings and mobs at the top.Unfortunately, that means most of the money never really leaves the top. It stays right there, as wasted and frozen potential that\u2019s never realized. There is little to no incentive for the money to move. Since money is power, hoarding it is literally hoarding more power and nobody would willingly give up that power.In other words, the game is rigged.What we need is a way to reset the game.Up until now, our prospects looked very dim.For example, we could pass a law, like a Universal Basic Income (UBI). That would give everyone a stream of money, pushing it out across the entire playing field and giving more people a chance to participate in the system. If more people can participate, we unlock all kinds of hidden and untapped value.How many great inventors never managed to create their next breakthrough because they were stuck driving a bus seven days a week to feed their family, with no hope of free time or any clear path to digging themselves out of debt? How many great writers went to their graves never having written their great novel? How many budding scientists never discovered the cure to cancer or heart disease?The problem with all of the plans before now, from UBI to socialism (high taxes on the rich to spread the wealth across the game) is that to redistribute the money after it\u2019s already been distributed is nearly impossible. The people with that money rightfully resist its redistribution. And as Margret Thatcher said \u201cThe trouble with Socialism is that eventually you run out of other people\u2019s money.\u201dBut what if the money is NOT already distributed?What if we don\u2019t have to take it from anyone at all?The inevitable outcome of all fractional reserve lending booms is\u00a0bust.That\u2019s the missed opportunity of all of today\u2019s cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are creating new money. And unlike credit markets, which only pretend to expand the money supply, by lending it out 10x with fractional reserve lending, cryptocurrencies are literally printing money. And they aren\u2019t loaning it to people, they\u2019re giving it to them for their service to the network.It\u2019s like microloans, without the loans.As Naval said: \u201cSociety gives you money for giving society what it wants, blockchains give you coins for giving the network what it wants.\u201dSo instead of giving all the money to a small group of miners, what if we could do better? A lot better?We can.I outlined one way in the an article about the Cicada project, How We Deliver a Universal Basic Income Right Now and Save Ourselves from the Robots. The Cicada design flips the idea of mining on its head. Everyone on the network is a miner and nobody can have more than one miner.Miners are drafted randomly to keep the network running smoothly. You might be walking along, getting coffee and your phone gets called on to secure the network for a few minutes. After that it goes right back to sleep. As a reward, you might win new coins for doing nothing but having the application on your phone. Simple right?Because everyone is eventually drafted, everyone gets paid, in essence creating a UBI right now.And that\u2019s just one way.If you think about it you can come up with dozens. Oh and don\u2019t get caught up with thinking the only way to do this is with an ID. Lots of ways to randomly draft miners without that too. The key is to free your mind of the \u201cSatoshi box\u201d and think different.What we really need is to completely gamify the delivery of money, distributing it far and wide at the moment of creation.Money is a Game. Embrace\u00a0it.Give it out as rewards for using apps, or as distributed mining fees, or as shared cuts of the mining fees to organizations that provide value to the network are just a few more ways to do it right. Those are just the tip of the iceberg. There are thousands of ways but we just haven\u2019t been thinking about the problem the right way.In other words, we missed the real power of Satoshi\u2019s creation: the distribution of money.The first system that truly gamifies the delivery of money will rocket to exponential growth, upending the current system for good. That will set the initial playing field dynamically and allow players who never would have gotten into the game to compete. The more people who can participate, the more efficient and valuable the network becomes.\u201cNetworks have \u201cnetwork effects.\u201d Adding a new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants.\u201dRight now, we\u2019re not adding new participants fast enough to the cryptonets of tomorrow. The system is still vulnerable to the violence hack. Gamified money is the answer to exponential growth.If the system can grow large enough, fast enough, it will become an unstoppable juggernaut, and the rest of the economic universe will need to come over to the new playing field.Once the Amazons and Google\u2019s of the world join the playing field, their self-preservation instinct will kick in and they\u2019ll want to protect and expand it. And this new network will behave differently. Instead of rewarding just the people at the top, who\u2019ve been rigging the rules in their favor since the beginning of time, the game will completely reset with a new set of rules.What\u2019s best for the whole network, not just the few players at the top, is best.\u201cBlockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network to govern without a ruler and without money. They are merit-based, tamper-proof, open, voting systems. The meritorious are those who work to advance the network. Blockchains\u2019 open and merit based markets can replace networks previously run by kings, corporations, aristocracies, and mobs.\u201dThose that join the network and help it grow will thrive and flourish with it. It will amplify their own value, making it grow faster than at any point in history. Every ounce they give to the system will magnify their own rewards.By contrast, economies that stand against the network, attempting to cripple it with arbitrary rules, will pay a heavy price. The system will stretch across the globe and only the most essential rules will take root, because in order to upgrade a distributed system, you need vast consensus across the network. Since people can generally only agree on big, essential solutions, no self-defeating, narrow-minded rules will be allowed.Let\u2019s say that a country decides to restrict ICOs to their citizens altogether or make cryptocurrencies illegal. Instead of killing the network, the rules will blow back on their creators. Only their own people will suffer, as they won\u2019t be able to participate in the explosion of new potential that ICOs bring to the table, draining money out of the economy into rival economies. Even worse, if they make cryptos illegal, they\u2019ll simply drive that money underground, which will keep them from getting tax from their citizens, which will starve them of revenue.As the system spreads it will put people back in control of their own financial power. No one will be able to take your money from you. And that is a good thing.Of course, not everyone thinks so. Some folks always worry that people will do bad things with this power, like commit crimes. But people will always do bad things. They do those things now and they always have. Crippling the system for everyone just to get those people is the height of insanity. It has never worked and it never will.Still, some people will never believe that.They trust their central powers unquestioningly. All you have to do is wrap up your argument in \u201cprotecting the children\u201d or \u201cfighting terrorism\u201d and you can generally fool half of the people half of the time about any terrible policy you want.Yet I\u2019ve found that people who see central systems as the answer to everything have usually lived in a stable central system for their whole lives.A few days in an unstable system would change their minds very quickly.Don\u2019t believe me?Imagine you lived in Syria right now.Your central infrastructure is destroyed, as is your money. You don\u2019t want the war, but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Now your house is gone, your friends and family are dead, your banks are bombed out and you\u2019re cast out, adrift, homeless and penniless. Even worse, nobody wants you. The world has shifted from open borders to building walls everywhere. You\u2019re not welcome anywhere, you can\u2019t stay where you are and you\u2019re broke.But what if your money was still there, recorded on the blockchain, waiting for you to download and restore a deterministic wallet and give it the right passphrase to restore it?How much easier would it be to start your life over?Cryptocurrencies finally offer a way for us to control our own destiny. For the very first time in the history of the world, we have a way to generate and distribute money without a central power. People will have control over the money they rightfully earned.And even better, instead of setting the playing field so the game is always rigged, we can set the game up the way it was always meant to be played, with open competition and flexible rules in a dynamic system that allows everyone to compete.But we need to think big. We need to find a way to distribute the money far and wide without taking it from everyone else. Do that and we change the game forever.That\u2019s what my team is working on. Want to talk?

Rather than sharing insights on Blockchain or Javascript, I\u2019d like to walk through my inner journey the past few years.It\u2019s a journey that\u2019s left me itching for change\u200a\u2014\u200aand driving down to Los Angeles to set up a new home base is a big one!How I landed in Silicon\u00a0ValleyI moved to Silicon Valley during the summer of 2012, a little over five years ago. I had just graduated college and serendipitously landed here because of a new job offer. I was eager and anxious to start my career out here and frankly had no idea what to expect.As it turned out, I lucked out\u200a\u2014\u200aSilicon Valley is one of the best places in the world for entrepreneurs, engineers, and anyone bold enough to try and change the world through technology.\u2026This was a stark contrast to life in my New Jersey hometown, where most people went to the community college, pursued 9-to-5 jobs, and settled into comfortable lives by their mid-20s. There was very little space there for thinking big, or taking risks, or creating your own career path.So, landing in San Francisco was the best kind of culture shock imaginable. Suddenly, I was surrounded by technology and innovation and immersed in a community where challenging yourself was actually encouraged.The next three years of living in San Francisco had a path-altering impact on my life, as I began to learn that crazy ideas aren\u2019t \u201ccrazy\u201d for those of us willing to put in the work and take a few risks.First challenge: Goldman\u00a0SachsThat first post-college job was as an analyst at Goldman Sachs, where I was able to learn how tech company financials work at a fundamental level through working with CEOs and CFOs preparing for IPO rounds and acquisitions. This was hugely beneficial when I later moved on to working with some of those tech companies directly, and planted the seeds of my interest in solving problems with software.After a year at Goldman Sachs, however, I realized that a career in banking was not what I wanted long term. I wanted to go back to being an engineer as I had been in college. So I decided to go against the grain and say goodbye to a \u201csuccessful\u201d position. Where was I off to next?Second challenge: Andreessen HorowitzWell, I was on the brink of leaving to join as a systems engineer for a small industrial startup in the middle of the country. But after a random cold email followed by a long series of unexpected events, I got an offer to join Andreessen Horowitz on the deal team. It was an opportunity I couldn\u2019t pass up\u200a\u2014\u200aand thank God I didn\u2019t.I spent the next two years at Andreessen Horowitz, where I worked with and learned from the pioneers of the web, like Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, Chris Dixon, and many others. I saw thousands of companies come through the doors\u200a\u2014\u200aI saw their ideas, their teams, their challenges and their strengths. I learned the ins and outs of building a successful technology startup, and on the flip side, learned the common mistakes that lead to failure. Most importantly, I met incredible entrepreneurs who inspired me to also become like them one day.Third challenge: returning to engineeringWhen I left a16z, I made the transition to software engineering. I was young and wanted to go out and just build stuff for the world. You could say that I had \u201centrepreneur envy\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI was eager to build products day to day, and eventually start my own company. I\u2019ve written about my experience extensively in the past.This transition was nothing short of amazing. I was learning and growing at a break-neck pace. I was passionate and excited by my work. Frankly, I was having so much fun being an engineer that not a single day felt like \u201cwork\u201d.But beyond just loving my work, I also felt empowered. Empowered to do things I never thought were possible before. Because being an engineer gave me freedom. Freedom to build anything I want, whenever I want and wherever I want. The freedom to learn how everything works at a fundamental level. The freedom to teach and empower new developers. And most importantly, the freedom to be a creator and literally, create something from nothing.When things started to feel differentIt was only after I left Andreessen Horowitz to return to an engineering track that my feelings about life in Silicon Valley started to change.Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world\u200a\u2014\u200aParis, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea\u200a\u2014\u200aand I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn\u2019t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening.What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.This isn\u2019t exactly a surprise, since one of the Internet\u2019s core functions is to make access to knowledge available everywhere. I personally taught myself almost everything I know about programming on the internet (outside some fundamentals from Hack Reactor), for free. And I\u2019m just one of thousands of learners using the Internet to access information that used to be limited to elite colleges like Stanford, Berkeley, or MIT.These days, techies aren\u2019t limited to Silicon Valley if they want to find funding and a community. Many other cities with active and relevant tech scenes have their own unique cultures, art, cuisines, and activities to offer.The group think issue in Silicon\u00a0ValleyDespite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I\u2019m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately.What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story\u200a\u2014\u200awhether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered\u2026 but within the Valley, you\u2019d hear the same stories over and over.Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I\u2019d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing\u200a\u2014\u200athe like-mindedness\u200a\u2014\u200awas no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking\u200a\u2014\u200agroup think as they call it.Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.My first Silicon Valley lesson: say \u201cyes\u201d to your desires and create your own\u00a0pathThis isn\u2019t to say Silicon Valley hasn\u2019t taught me anything important.It\u2019s been a perfect place to learn to take risks. A place to learn the value of creating your own path, and to prove to myself that I can do it.While living here, I\u2019ve made a deliberate effort to say yes to my dreams. I wanted the freedom to build anything I want, and I earned that. I wanted to learn and grow as quickly as possible, and I\u2019ve proven that. I wanted to meet people from around the world and learn from them, and I got that. I wanted to find my purpose instead of following a \u201csuccessful\u201d path, and I did that.Most importantly, I wanted to pave a path that is unique to me, and I\u2019m doing exactly that. I\u2019m only a couple years into it, and the future feels unlimited.Looking back, when I left Andreessen Horowitz to pursue this path, I set out a three-part roadmap for myself:Figure out what I like developing the most.Get really good at it.Use those skills to have a positive impact on the world.I spent the past two years learning many different areas of programming (e.g. web development, mobile development, distributed systems, etc.) and various application areas (e.g. machine learning, blockchain, etc.). I purposely stayed broad and exposed myself to as much as possible, and learned to code things that interested me most. Eventually, I fell in love with blockchain development.My fascination with blockchains started when we first made the investment in Coinbase at a16z, and ever since, I\u2019ve been keeping up with the technology and eventually joined Coinbase as a software engineer, which helped me further dive deeper into the space. After Coinbase, I continued to tinker and teach myself various aspects of blockchain, and now I\u2019m at phase two, where I\u2019m focusing on getting really good at it. The next step is to use my skills to \u201cbuild a world-changing company or something else entirely\u201d.Leading the path I want to lead doesn\u2019t require me to be in Silicon valley anymore. I don\u2019t need to be here to follow my personal roadmap. Having the freedom of an engineer to learn and grow as an entrepreneur, writer, and speaker has opened me up to a whole new world. It made me realize that I can be an engineer, entrepreneur, writer and speaker from anywhere in the world.\u201cIf you set goals and go after them with all the determination you can muster, your gifts will take you places that will amaze you.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aLes\u00a0BrownMy second Silicon Valley lesson: You don\u2019t have to be in Silicon Valley to change the\u00a0worldThe world is becoming increasingly global. Silicon Valley is just one way of living. One way of thinking. One way of viewing the world. But there\u2019s so many other ways. Because after all, technology is global, engineering is global, innovation is global and entrepreneurship is global.It\u2019s evident by the fact that we now see countries like India and China leap frog generations of western technology and even inventing their own ways\u200a\u2014\u200atake mPesa in Kenya, Paytm in India, or WeChat in China.Moreover, it\u2019s become easier than ever to connect with anyone thousands of miles away. Being physically present is no longer a requirement. I can code from South Africa and still ship a product to someone in Silicon Valley.Beyond this, what really nudged me was when I realized that the blockchain revolution is global. I\u2019ve spent the past year doing research and development in blockchain technologies, and noticed that many cities outside of the valley, like New York, Berlin, Toronto, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Bangkok, are making immense strides in pushing blockchains forward. Many well known projects and efforts to bring blockchain to the masses are being started from places outside of Silicon Valley. For once, I noticed that Silicon Valley isn\u2019t the center of it.So then a crazy idea came to my head. Can I leave Silicon Valley and still pursue my dreams? Can I still build a massive and world-changing company? Can I still make a big impact in this world?The answer to that increasingly became a clear yes.Of course, there\u2019s a strong argument for staying in Silicon Valley. After all, this place has a massive network of entrepreneurs and people who \u201cget it\u201d. This place knows how to breed amazing startups. Moreover, I\u2019ve personally built up a great network in Silicon Valley over the past five years. I could easily stay and lead a very successful life here, financially at least.But frankly, I don\u2019t want to. That feels a bit too easy. I\u2019m young, passionate, and driven\u200a\u2014\u200aI can\u2019t let inertia, familiarity, comfort or money hold me back from going on to to doing bigger and harder things. I\u2019m going to challenge myself. I\u2019m going to fight for my goals. To work day and night for them. And money isn\u2019t going to get me any of these things.Money has never been my main motivator. I left Goldman Sachs before my first-year bonus because I was too eager to sit back for two months hating my life, instead of starting my new career at a16z. Then I left an amazing career at a16z to go become a developer. Challenge and impact are what gets me out of bed in the morning.I have this burning desire to do even more, see more and experience more, outside of Silicon Valley. When the opportunity exists to experience a whole new city and still do what I love, why not just go out there and try? Why not try to expose myself to ideas in a place where the opportunities are wide open? Why not meet other types of people, learn other skills, and live on the edge a little?Here I am: ready to do exactly that!Onwards to the next\u00a0cityPerhaps my feeling and frustrations towards Silicon Valley and San Francisco are merely a fact of being here for too long. Perhaps they\u2019re just from me needing a change. Perhaps they\u2019re just from finding my true calling as an engineer, builder, writer and entrepreneur and realizing that I can do that from anywhere.I\u2019m ready to pick up my bags and embark onto the next adventure in Los Angeles.Am I scared?Hell yeah I\u2019m scared.I know practically no one in Los Angeles except for a few college friends who I haven\u2019t spoken to in years. While on one hand, this sounds scary, on the other hand, I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m beyond ecstatic to get out there and build up my network from ground up, just like I have done for the past five years in Silicon Valley.And the best part is, I can always come back here\u200a\u2014\u200afor a day, a week or a month. Silicon Valley is where my entire network is, and they aren\u2019t going anywhere. If I come back a year, or two years, or even five years from now, most of them will still be here.Why Los\u00a0AngelesSo why the heck would I choose Los Angeles of all places? Lots of reasons!Proximity: Los Angeles is quite literally a \u201cplane hop\u201d away from San Francisco. I can get from LA to SF within 3 hours door-to-door. This was a big factor in choosing my next city because it\u2019s important to me to stay connected to Silicon Valley. Being in close proximity makes it easy to come here as often as I need to.Booming tech: Tech is just starting to boom in Los Angeles. With Snapchat, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and many other giant tech companies building giant campuses there, there\u2019s no shortage of tech talent down here on sunny \u201cSilicon Beach\u201d. The tech momentum has just started, and I foresee a massive shift coming where tech is going to make a ripple effect across every industry in Los Angeles. This means there\u2019s an opportunity as an engineer or an entrepreneur to make a huge impact here during this tech boom.Weather: Not to brag, but Los Angeles has perfect weather. I wake up every morning to beautiful sunshine and the temperature literally can\u2019t get more perfect. It makes me want to be outside a lot more frequently. I\u2019ve noticed my mood is magically better because I get to have sunshine every single day.Diversity: I love that Los Angeles is full of creative and artistic folks who are out there hustling and trying to make it. Meeting a diverse group of people not just doing tech is frankly refreshing. I\u2019ve had a blast learning from people who are in non-tech fields like fashion, media, entertainment, art, real estate, etc.The hustle: People here in LA are in it to \u201cmake\u201d it. The hustle here is real, which I quickly learned while scoping out neighborhoods the past few months. I remember the first time I went to the gym in the morning at my usually crazy wee early hour, and I saw the gym half packed at 5:30am. I kept checking my watch to see if my clock was off or something. After a few days of utter awe, I started to notice that it was all just people who were motivated, passionate and ready to get it on. They were hustling, and they started first thing in the morning.Of course, every city has it\u2019s flaws. Let\u2019s not even get into the traffic situation in LA\u00a0;)What I\u2019ll be working\u00a0onAs some of you may know, I\u2019ve been heavily focused in the blockchain space for a while now. I hope to share more details about my next project in the coming months.In the meantime, look out for more updates from me, whether it\u2019s posts to teach you blockchain, videos for my #AskPreethi series, or pictures of me sitting on Venice beach with my laptop being a nerd and coding \ud83d\ude0eStill here? Good! Here\u2019s the mic. Have you ever made a \u201ccrazy\u201d move to chase something you wanted?

This meant that people or organizations could grow their internet presence knowing the rules of the game wouldn\u2019t change later on. Huge web properties were started during this era including Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. In the process, the importance of centralized platforms like AOL greatly diminished.During the second era of the internet, from the mid 2000s to the present, for-profit tech companies\u200a\u2014\u200amost notably Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA)\u200a\u2014\u200abuilt software and services that rapidly outpaced the capabilities of open protocols. The explosive growth of smartphones accelerated this trend as mobile apps became the majority of internet use. Eventually users migrated from open services to these more sophisticated, centralized services. Even when users still accessed open protocols like the web, they would typically do so mediated by GAFA software and services.The good news is that billions of people got access to amazing technologies, many of which were free to use. The bad news is that it became much harder for startups, creators, and other groups to grow their internet presence without worrying about centralized platforms changing the rules on them, taking away their audiences and profits. This in turn stifled innovation, making the internet less interesting and dynamic. Centralization has also created broader societal tensions, which we see in the debates over subjects like fake news, state sponsored bots, \u201cno platforming\u201d of users, EU privacy laws, and algorithmic biases. These debates will only intensify in the coming years.\u201cWeb 3\u201d: the third era of the\u00a0internetOne response to this centralization is to impose government regulation on large internet companies. This response assumes that the internet is similar to past communication networks like the phone, radio, and TV networks. But the hardware-based networks of the past are fundamentally different than the internet, a software-based network. Once hardware-based networks are built, they are nearly impossible to rearchitect. Software-based networks can be rearchitected through entrepreneurial innovation and market forces.The internet is the ultimate software-based network, consisting of a relatively simple core layer connecting billions of fully programmable computers at the edge. Software is simply the encoding of human thought, and as such has an almost unbounded design space. Computers connected to the internet are, by and large, free to run whatever software their owners choose. Whatever can be dreamt up, with the right set of incentives, can quickly propagate across the internet. Internet architecture is where technical creativity and incentive design intersect.The internet is still early in its evolution: the core internet services will likely be almost entirely rearchitected in the coming decades. This will be enabled by crypto-economic networks, a generalization of the ideas first introduced in Bitcoin and further developed in Ethereum. Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras: community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.Why decentralization?Decentralization is a commonly misunderstood concept. For example, it is sometimes said that the reason cryptonetwork advocates favor decentralization is to resist government censorship, or because of libertarian political views. These are not the main reasons decentralization is important.Let\u2019s look at the problems with centralized platforms. Centralized platforms follow a predictable life cycle. When they start out, they do everything they can to recruit users and 3rd-party complements like developers, businesses, and media organizations. They do this to make their services more valuable, as platforms (by definition) are systems with multi-sided network effects. As platforms move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and 3rd parties steadily grows.When they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. The easiest way to continue growing lies in extracting data from users and competing with complements over audiences and profits. Historical examples of this are Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga, and Twitter vs. its 3rd-party clients. Operating systems like iOS and Android have behaved better, although still take a healthy 30% tax, reject apps for seemingly arbitrary reasons, and subsume the functionality of 3rd-party apps at will.For 3rd parties, this transition from cooperation to competition feels like a bait-and-switch. Over time, the best entrepreneurs, developers, and investors have become wary of building on top of centralized platforms. We now have decades of evidence that doing so will end in disappointment. In addition, users give up privacy, control of their data, and become vulnerable to security breaches. These problems with centralized platforms will likely become even more pronounced in the future.Enter cryptonetworksCryptonetworks are networks built on top of the internet that 1) use consensus mechanisms such as blockchains to maintain and update state, 2) use cryptocurrencies (coins/tokens) to incentivize consensus participants (miners/validators) and other network participants. Some cryptonetworks, such as Ethereum, are general programming platforms that can be used for almost any purpose. Other cryptonetworks are special purpose, for example Bitcoin is intended primarily for storing value, Golem for performing computations, and Filecoin for decentralized file storage.Early internet protocols were technical specifications created by working groups or non-profit organizations that relied on the alignment of interests in the internet community to gain adoption. This method worked well during the very early stages of the internet but since the early 1990s very few new protocols have gained widespread adoption. Cryptonetworks fix these problems by providing economics incentives to developers, maintainers, and other network participants in the form of tokens. They are also much more technically robust. For example, they are able to keep state and do arbitrary transformations on that state, something past protocols could never do.Cryptonetworks use multiple mechanisms to ensure that they stay neutral as they grow, preventing the bait-and-switch of centralized platforms. First, the contract between cryptonetworks and their participants is enforced in open source code. Second, they are kept in check through mechanisms for \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cexit.\u201d Participants are given voice through community governance, both \u201con chain\u201d (via the protocol) and \u201coff chain\u201d (via the social structures around the protocol). Participants can exit either by leaving the network and selling their coins, or in the extreme case by forking the protocol.In short, cryptonetworks align network participants to work together toward a common goal\u200a\u2014\u200athe growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This alignment is one of the main reasons Bitcoin continues to defy skeptics and flourish, even while new cryptonetworks like Ethereum have grown alongside it.Today\u2019s cryptonetworks suffer from limitations that keep them from seriously challenging centralized incumbents. The most severe limitations are around performance and scalability. The next few years will be about fixing these limitations and building networks that form the infrastructure layer of the crypto stack. After that, most of the energy will turn to building applications on top of that infrastructure.How decentralization winsIt\u2019s one thing to say decentralized networks should win, and another thing to say they will win. Let\u2019s look at specific reasons to be optimistic about this.Software and web services are built by developers. There are millions of highly skilled developers in the world. Only a small fraction work at large technology companies, and only a small fraction of those work on new product development. Many of the most important software projects in history were created by startups or by communities of independent developers.\u201cNo matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aBill\u00a0JoyDecentralized networks can win the third era of the internet for the same reason they won the first era: by winning the hearts and minds of entrepreneurs and developers.An illustrative analogy is the rivalry in the 2000s between Wikipedia and its centralized competitors like Encarta. If you compared the two products in the early 2000s, Encarta was a far better product, with better topic coverage and higher accuracy. But Wikipedia improved at a much faster rate, because it had an active community of volunteer contributors who were attracted to its decentralized, community-governed ethos. By 2005, Wikipedia was the most popular reference site on the internet. Encarta was shut down in 2009.The lesson is that when you compare centralized and decentralized systems you need to consider them dynamically, as processes, instead of statically, as rigid products. Centralized systems often start out fully baked, but only get better at the rate at which employees at the sponsoring company improve them. Decentralized systems start out half-baked but, under the right conditions, grow exponentially as they attract new contributors.In the case of cryptonetworks, there are multiple, compounding feedback loops involving developers of the core protocol, developers of complementary cryptonetworks, developers of 3rd party applications, and service providers who operate the network. These feedback loops are further amplified by the incentives of the associated token, which\u200a\u2014\u200aas we\u2019ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum\u200a\u2014\u200acan supercharge the rate at which crypto communities develop (and sometimes lead to negative outcomes, as with the excessive electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining).The question of whether decentralized or centralized systems will win the next era of the internet reduces to who will build the most compelling products, which in turn reduces to who will get more high quality developers and entrepreneurs on their side. GAFA has many advantages, including cash reserves, large user bases, and operational infrastructure. Cryptonetworks have a significantly more attractive value proposition to developers and entrepreneurs. If they can win their hearts and minds, they can mobilize far more resources than GAFA, and rapidly outpace their product development.\u201cIf you asked people in 1989 what they needed to make their life better, it was unlikely that they would have said a decentralized network of information nodes that are linked using hypertext.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aFarmer &\u00a0FarmerCentralized platforms often come bundled at launch with compelling apps: Facebook had its core socializing features and the iPhone had a number of key apps. Decentralized platforms, by contrast, often launch half-baked and without clear use cases. As a result, they need to go through two phases of product-market fit: 1) product-market fit between the platform and the developers/entrepreneurs who will finish the platform and build out the ecosystem, and 2) product-market fit between the platform/ecosystem and end users. This two-stage process is what causes many people\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding sophisticated technologists\u200a\u2014\u200ato consistently underestimate the potential of decentralized platforms.The next era of the\u00a0internetDecentralized networks aren\u2019t a silver bullet that will fix all the problems on the internet. But they offer a much better approach than centralized systems.Compare the problem of Twitter spam to the problem of email spam. Since Twitter closed their network to 3rd-party developers, the only company working on Twitter spam has been Twitter itself. By contrast, there were hundreds of companies that tried to fight email spam, financed by billions of dollars in venture capital and corporate funding. Email spam isn\u2019t solved, but it\u2019s a lot better now, because 3rd parties knew that the email protocol was decentralized, so they could build businesses on top of it without worrying about the rules of the game changing later on.Or consider the problem of network governance. Today, unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered, which users get promoted and which get banned, and other important governance decisions. In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms. As we know from the offline world, democratic systems aren\u2019t perfect, but they are a lot better than the alternatives.Centralized platforms have been dominant for so long that many people have forgotten there is a better way to build internet services. Cryptonetworks are a powerful way to develop community-owned networks and provide a level playing field for 3rd-party developers, creators, and businesses. We saw the value of decentralized systems in the first era of the internet.

It\u2019s been in the news a lot lately, including the cover of some major magazines, but reading those articles can be like gibberish if you don\u2019t have a foundation for what exactly Ethereum is. So what is it? In essence, a public database that keeps a permanent record of digital transactions. Importantly, this database doesn\u2019t require any central authority to maintain and secure it. Instead it operates as a \u201ctrustless\u201d transactional system\u200a\u2014\u200aa framework in which individuals can make peer-to-peer transactions without needing to trust a third party OR one another.Still confused? That\u2019s where this post comes in. My aim is to explain how Ethereum functions at a technical level, without complex math or scary-looking formulas. Even if you\u2019re not a programmer, I hope you\u2019ll walk away with at least better grasp of the tech. If some parts are too technical and difficult to grok, that\u2019s totally fine! There\u2019s really no need to understand every little detail. I recommend just focusing on understanding things at a broad level.\u00a0Many of the topics covered in this post are a breakdown of the concepts discussed in the yellow paper. I\u2019ve added my own explanations and diagrams to make understanding Ethereum easier. Those brave enough to take on the technical challenge can also read the Ethereum yellow paper.Let\u2019s get started!Blockchain definitionA blockchain is a \u201ccryptographically secure transactional singleton machine with shared-state.\u201d [1] That\u2019s a mouthful, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s break it down.\u201cCryptographically secure\u201d means that the creation of digital currency is secured by complex mathematical algorithms that are obscenely hard to break. Think of a firewall of sorts. They make it nearly impossible to cheat the system (e.g. create fake transactions, erase transactions, etc.)\u201cTransactional singleton machine\u201d means that there\u2019s a single canonical instance of the machine responsible for all the transactions being created in the system. In other words, there\u2019s a single global truth that everyone believes in.\u201cWith shared-state\u201d means that the state stored on this machine is shared and open to everyone.Ethereum implements this blockchain paradigm.The Ethereum blockchain paradigm explainedThe Ethereum blockchain is essentially a transaction-based state machine. In computer science, a state machine refers to something that will read a series of inputs and, based on those inputs, will transition to a new state.With Ethereum\u2019s state machine, we begin with a \u201cgenesis state.\u201d This is analogous to a blank slate, before any transactions have happened on the network. When transactions are executed, this genesis state transitions into some final state. At any point in time, this final state represents the current state of Ethereum.The state of Ethereum has millions of transactions. These transactions are grouped into \u201cblocks.\u201d A block contains a series of transactions, and each block is chained together with its previous block.To cause a transition from one state to the next, a transaction must be valid. For a transaction to be considered valid, it must go through a validation process known as mining. Mining is when a group of nodes (i.e. computers) expend their compute resources to create a block of valid transactions.Any node on the network that declares itself as a miner can attempt to create and validate a block. Lots of miners from around the world try to create and validate blocks at the same time. Each miner provides a mathematical \u201cproof\u201d when submitting a block to the blockchain, and this proof acts as a guarantee: if the proof exists, the block must be valid.For a block to be added to the main blockchain, the miner must prove it faster than any other competitor miner. The process of validating each block by having a miner provide a mathematical proof is known as a \u201cproof of work.\u201dA miner who validates a new block is rewarded with a certain amount of value for doing this work. What is that value? The Ethereum blockchain uses an intrinsic digital token called \u201cEther.\u201d Every time a miner proves a block, new Ether tokens are generated and awarded.You might wonder: what guarantees that everyone sticks to one chain of blocks? How can we be sure that there doesn\u2019t exist a subset of miners who will decide to create their own chain of blocks?Earlier, we defined a blockchain as a transactional singleton machine with shared-state. Using this definition, we can understand the correct current state is a single global truth, which everyone must accept. Having multiple states (or chains) would ruin the whole system, because it would be impossible to agree on which state was the correct one. If the chains were to diverge, you might own 10 coins on one chain, 20 on another, and 40 on another. In this scenario, there would be no way to determine which chain was the most \u201cvalid.\u201dWhenever multiple paths are generated, a \u201cfork\u201d occurs. We typically want to avoid forks, because they disrupt the system and force people to choose which chain they \u201cbelieve\u201d in.To determine which path is most valid and prevent multiple chains, Ethereum uses a mechanism called the \u201cGHOST protocol.\u201d\u201cGHOST\u201d = \u201cGreedy Heaviest Observed Subtree\u201dIn simple terms, the GHOST protocol says we must pick the path that has had the most computation done upon it. One way to determine that path is to use the block number of the most recent block (the \u201cleaf block\u201d), which represents the total number of blocks in the current path (not counting the genesis block). The higher the block number, the longer the path and the greater the mining effort that must have gone into arriving at the leaf. Using this reasoning allows us to agree on the canonical version of the current state.Now that you\u2019ve gotten the 10,000-foot overview of what a blockchain is, let\u2019s dive deeper into the main components that the Ethereum system is comprised of:accountsstategas and feestransactionsblockstransaction executionminingproof of workOne note before getting started: whenever I say \u201chash\u201d of X, I am referring to the KECCAK-256 hash, which Ethereum uses.AccountsThe global \u201cshared-state\u201d of Ethereum is comprised of many small objects (\u201caccounts\u201d) that are able to interact with one another through a message-passing framework. Each account has a state associated with it and a 20-byte address. An address in Ethereum is a 160-bit identifier that is used to identify any account.There are two types of accounts:Externally owned accounts, which are controlled by private keys and have no code associated with them.Contract accounts, which are controlled by their contract code and have code associated with them.Externally owned accounts vs. contract\u00a0accountsIt\u2019s important to understand a fundamental difference between externally owned accounts and contract accounts. An externally owned account can send messages to other externally owned accounts OR to other contract accounts by creating and signing a transaction using its private key. A message between two externally owned accounts is simply a value transfer. But a message from an externally owned account to a contract account activates the contract account\u2019s code, allowing it to perform various actions (e.g. transfer tokens, write to internal storage, mint new tokens, perform some calculation, create new contracts, etc.).Unlike externally owned accounts, contract accounts can\u2019t initiate new transactions on their own. Instead, contract accounts can only fire transactions in response to other transactions they have received (from an externally owned account or from another contract account). We\u2019ll learn more about contract-to-contract calls in the \u201cTransactions and Messages\u201d section.Therefore, any action that occurs on the Ethereum blockchain is always set in motion by transactions fired from externally controlled accounts.Account stateThe account state consists of four components, which are present regardless of the type of account:nonce: If the account is an externally owned account, this number represents the number of transactions sent from the account\u2019s address. If the account is a contract account, the nonce is the number of contracts created by the account.balance: The number of Wei owned by this address. There are 1e+18 Wei per Ether.storageRoot: A hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia tree (we\u2019ll explain Merkle trees later on). This tree encodes the hash of the storage contents of this account, and is empty by default.codeHash: The hash of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine\u200a\u2014\u200amore on this later) code of this account. For contract accounts, this is the code that gets hashed and stored as the codeHash. For externally owned accounts, the codeHash field is the hash of the empty string.World stateOkay, so we know that Ethereum\u2019s global state consists of a mapping between account addresses and the account states. This mapping is stored in a data structure known as a Merkle Patricia tree.A Merkle tree (or also referred as \u201cMerkle trie\u201d) is a type of binary tree composed of a set of nodes with:a large number of leaf nodes at the bottom of the tree that contain the underlying dataa set of intermediate nodes, where each node is the hash of its two child nodesa single root node, also formed from the hash of its two child node, representing the top of the treeThe data at the bottom of the tree is generated by splitting the data that we want to store into chunks, then splitting the chunks into buckets, and then taking the hash of each bucket and repeating the same process until the total number of hashes remaining becomes only one: the root hash.This tree is required to have a key for every value stored inside it. Beginning from the root node of the tree, the key should tell you which child node to follow to get to the corresponding value, which is stored in the leaf nodes. In Ethereum\u2019s case, the key/value mapping for the state tree is between addresses and their associated accounts, including the balance, nonce, codeHash, and storageRoot for each account (where the storageRoot is itself a tree).Source: Ethereum whitepaperThis same trie structure is used also to store transactions and receipts. More specifically, every block has a \u201cheader\u201d which stores the hash of the root node of three different Merkle trie structures, including:State trieTransactions trieReceipts trieThe ability to store all this information efficiently in Merkle tries is incredibly useful in Ethereum for what we call \u201clight clients\u201d or \u201clight nodes.\u201d Remember that a blockchain is maintained by a bunch of nodes. Broadly speaking, there are two types of nodes: full nodes and light nodes.A full archive node synchronizes the blockchain by downloading the full chain, from the genesis block to the current head block, executing all of the transactions contained within. Typically, miners store the full archive node, because they are required to do so for the mining process. It is also possible to download a full node without executing every transaction. Regardless, any full node contains the entire chain.But unless a node needs to execute every transaction or easily query historical data, there\u2019s really no need to store the entire chain. This is where the concept of a light node comes in. Instead of downloading and storing the full chain and executing all of the transactions, light nodes download only the chain of headers, from the genesis block to the current head, without executing any transactions or retrieving any associated state. Because light nodes have access to block headers, which contain hashes of three tries, they can still easily generate and receive verifiable answers about transactions, events, balances, etc.The reason this works is because hashes in the Merkle tree propagate upward\u200a\u2014\u200aif a malicious user attempts to swap a fake transaction into the bottom of a Merkle tree, this change will cause a change in the hash of the node above, which will change the hash of the node above that, and so on, until it eventually changes the root of the tree.Any node that wants to verify a piece of data can use something called a \u201cMerkle proof\u201d to do so. A Merkle proof consists of:A chunk of data to be verified and its hashThe root hash of the treeThe \u201cbranch\u201d (all of the partner hashes going up along the path from the chunk to the root)Anyone reading the proof can verify that the hashing for that branch is consistent all the way up the tree, and therefore that the given chunk is actually at that position in the tree.In summary, the benefit of using a Merkle Patricia tree is that the root node of this structure is cryptographically dependent on the data stored in the tree, and so the hash of the root node can be used as a secure identity for this data. Since the block header includes the root hash of the state, transactions, and receipts trees, any node can validate a small part of state of Ethereum without needing to store the entire state, which can be potentially unbounded in size.Gas and\u00a0paymentOne very important concept in Ethereum is the concept of fees. Every computation that occurs as a result of a transaction on the Ethereum network incurs a fee\u200a\u2014\u200athere\u2019s no free lunch! This fee is paid in a denomination called \u201cgas.\u201dGas is the unit used to measure the fees required for a particular computation. Gas price is the amount of Ether you are willing to spend on every unit of gas, and is measured in \u201cgwei.\u201d \u201cWei\u201d is the smallest unit of Ether, where 1\u2070\u00b9\u2078 Wei represents 1 Ether. One gwei is 1,000,000,000 Wei.With every transaction, a sender sets a gas limit and gas price. The product of gas price and gas limit represents the maximum amount of Wei that the sender is willing to pay for executing a transaction.For example, let\u2019s say the sender sets the gas limit to 50,000 and a gas price to 20 gwei. This implies that the sender is willing to spend at most 50,000 x 20 gwei = 1,000,000,000,000,000 Wei = 0.001 Ether to execute that transaction.Remember that the gas limit represents the maximum gas the sender is willing to spend money on. If they have enough Ether in their account balance to cover this maximum, they\u2019re good to go. The sender is refunded for any unused gas at the end of the transaction, exchanged at the original rate.In the case that the sender does not provide the necessary gas to execute the transaction, the transaction runs \u201cout of gas\u201d and is considered invalid. In this case, the transaction processing aborts and any state changes that occurred are reversed, such that we end up back at the state of Ethereum prior to the transaction. Additionally, a record of the transaction failing gets recorded, showing what transaction was attempted and where it failed. And since the machine already expended effort to run the calculations before running out of gas, logically, none of the gas is refunded to the sender.Where exactly does this gas money go? All the money spent on gas by the sender is sent to the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d address, which is typically the miner\u2019s address. Since miners are expending the effort to run computations and validate transactions, miners receive the gas fee as a reward.Typically, the higher the gas price the sender is willing to pay, the greater the value the miner derives from the transaction. Thus, the more likely miners will be to select it. In this way, miners are free to choose which transactions they want to validate or ignore. In order to guide senders on what gas price to set, miners have the option of advertising the minimum gas price for which they will execute transactions.There are fees for storage,\u00a0tooNot only is gas used to pay for computation steps, it is also used to pay for storage usage. The total fee for storage is proportional to the smallest multiple of 32 bytes used.Fees for storage have some nuanced aspects. For example, since increased storage increases the size of the Ethereum state database on all nodes, there\u2019s an incentive to keep the amount of data stored small. For this reason, if a transaction has a step that clears an entry in the storage, the fee for executing that operation of is waived, AND a refund is given for freeing up storage space.What\u2019s the purpose of\u00a0fees?One important aspect of the way the Ethereum works is that every single operation executed by the network is simultaneously effected by every full node. However, computational steps on the Ethereum Virtual Machine are very expensive. Therefore, Ethereum smart contracts are best used for simple tasks, like running simple business logic or verifying signatures and other cryptographic objects, rather than more complex uses, like file storage, email, or machine learning, which can put a strain on the network. Imposing fees prevents users from overtaxing the network.Ethereum is a Turing complete language. (In short, a Turing machine is a machine that can simulate any computer algorithm (for those not familiar with Turing machines, check out this and this). This allows for loops and makes Ethereum susceptible to the halting problem, a problem in which you cannot determine whether or not a program will run infinitely. If there were no fees, a malicious actor could easily try to disrupt the network by executing an infinite loop within a transaction, without any repercussions. Thus, fees protect the network from deliberate attacks.You might be thinking, \u201cwhy do we also have to pay for storage?\u201d Well, just like computation, storage on the Ethereum network is a cost that the entire network has to take the burden of.Transaction and\u00a0messagesWe noted earlier that Ethereum is a transaction-based state machine. In other words, transactions occurring between different accounts are what move the global state of Ethereum from one state to the next.In the most basic sense, a transaction is a cryptographically signed piece of instruction that is generated by an externally owned account, serialized, and then submitted to the blockchain.There are two types of transactions: message calls and contract creations (i.e. transactions that create new Ethereum contracts).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All transactions contain the following components, regardless of their type:nonce: a count of the number of transactions sent by the sender.gasPrice: the number of Wei that the sender is willing to pay per unit of gas required to execute the transaction.gasLimit: the maximum amount of gas that the sender is willing to pay for executing this transaction. This amount is set and paid upfront, before any computation is done.to: the address of the recipient. In a contract-creating transaction, the contract account address does not yet exist, and so an empty value is used.value: the amount of Wei to be transferred from the sender to the recipient. In a contract-creating transaction, this value serves as the starting balance within the newly created contract account.v, r, s: used to generate the signature that identifies the sender of the transaction.init (only exists for contract-creating transactions): An EVM code fragment that is used to initialize the new contract account. init is run only once, and then is discarded. When init is first run, it returns the body of the account code, which is the piece of code that is permanently associated with the contract account.data (optional field that only exists for message calls): the input data (i.e. parameters) of the message call. For example, if a smart contract serves as a domain registration service, a call to that contract might expect input fields such as the domain and IP address.We learned in the \u201cAccounts\u201d section that transactions\u200a\u2014\u200aboth message calls and contract-creating transactions\u200a\u2014\u200aare always initiated by externally owned accounts and submitted to the blockchain. Another way to think about it is that transactions are what bridge the external world to the internal state of Ethereum.But this doesn\u2019t mean that contracts can\u2019t talk to other contracts. Contracts that exist within the global scope of Ethereum\u2019s state can talk to other contracts within that same scope. The way they do this is via \u201cmessages\u201d or \u201cinternal transactions\u201d to other contracts. We can think of messages or internal transactions as being similar to transactions, with the major difference that they are NOT generated by externally owned accounts. Instead, they are generated by contracts. They are virtual objects that, unlike transactions, are not serialized and only exist in the Ethereum execution environment.When one contract sends an internal transaction to another contract, the associated code that exists on the recipient contract account is executed.One important thing to note is that internal transactions or messages don\u2019t contain a gasLimit. This is because the gas limit is determined by the external creator of the original transaction (i.e. some externally owned account). The gas limit that the externally owned account sets must be high enough to carry out the transaction, including any sub-executions that occur as a result of that transaction, such as contract-to-contract messages. If, in the chain of transactions and messages, a particular message execution runs out of gas, then that message\u2019s execution will revert, along with any subsequent messages triggered by the execution. However, the parent execution does not need to revert.BlocksAll transactions are grouped together into \u201cblocks.\u201d A blockchain contains a series of such blocks that are chained together.In Ethereum, a block consists of:the block headerinformation about the set of transactions included in that blocka set of other block headers for the current block\u2019s ommers.Ommers explainedWhat the heck is an \u201commer?\u201d An ommer is a block whose parent is equal to the current block\u2019s parent\u2019s parent. Let\u2019s take a quick dive into what ommers are used for and why a block contains the block headers for ommers.Because of the way Ethereum is built, block times are much lower (~15 seconds) than those of other blockchains, like Bitcoin (~10 minutes). This enables faster transaction processing. However, one of the downsides of shorter block times is that more competing block solutions are found by miners. These competing blocks are also referred to as \u201corphaned blocks\u201d (i.e. mined blocks do not make it into the main chain).The purpose of ommers is to help reward miners for including these orphaned blocks. The ommers that miners include must be \u201cvalid,\u201d meaning within the sixth generation or smaller of the present block. After six children, stale orphaned blocks can no longer be referenced (because including older transactions would complicate things a bit).Ommer blocks receive a smaller reward than a full block. Nonetheless, there\u2019s still some incentive for miners to include these orphaned blocks and reap a reward.Block headerLet\u2019s get back to blocks for a moment. We mentioned previously that every block has a block \u201cheader,\u201d but what exactly is this?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A block header is a portion of the block consisting of:parentHash: a hash of the parent block\u2019s header (this is what makes the block set a \u201cchain\u201d)ommersHash: a hash of the current block\u2019s list of ommersbeneficiary: the account address that receives the fees for mining this blockstateRoot: the hash of the root node of the state trie (recall how we learned that the state trie is stored in the header and makes it easy for light clients to verify anything about the state)transactionsRoot: the hash of the root node of the trie that contains all transactions listed in this blockreceiptsRoot: the hash of the root node of the trie that contains the receipts of all transactions listed in this blocklogsBloom: a Bloom filter (data structure) that consists of log informationdifficulty: the difficulty level of this blocknumber: the count of current block (the genesis block has a block number of zero; the block number increases by 1 for each each subsequent block)gasLimit: the current gas limit per blockgasUsed: the sum of the total gas used by transactions in this blocktimestamp: the unix timestamp of this block\u2019s inceptionextraData: extra data related to this blockmixHash: a hash that, when combined with the nonce, proves that this block has carried out enough computationnonce: a hash that, when combined with the mixHash, proves that this block has carried out enough computationNotice how every block header contains three trie structures for:state (stateRoot)transactions (transactionsRoot)receipts (receiptsRoot)These trie structures are nothing but the Merkle Patricia tries we discussed earlier.Additionally, there are a few terms from the above description that are worth clarifying. Let\u2019s take a look.LogsEthereum allows for logs to make it possible to track various transactions and messages. A contract can explicitly generate a log by defining \u201cevents\u201d that it wants to log.A log entry contains:the logger\u2019s account address,a series of topics that represent various events carried out by this transaction, andany data associated with these events.Logs are stored in a bloom filter, which stores the endless log data in an efficient manner.Transaction receiptLogs stored in the header come from the log information contained in the transaction receipt. Just as you receive a receipt when you buy something at a store, Ethereum generates a receipt for every transaction. Like you\u2019d expect, each receipt contains certain information about the transaction. This receipt includes items like:the block numberblock hashtransaction hashgas used by the current transactioncumulative gas used in the current block after the current transaction has executedlogs created when executing the current transaction..and so onBlock difficultyThe \u201cdifficulty\u201d of a block is used to enforce consistency in the time it takes to validate blocks. The genesis block has a difficulty of 131,072, and a special formula is used to calculate the difficulty of every block thereafter. If a certain block is validated more quickly than the previous block, the Ethereum protocol increases that block\u2019s difficulty.The difficulty of the block affects the nonce, which is a hash that must be calculated when mining a block, using the proof-of-work algorithm.The relationship between the block\u2019s difficulty and nonce is mathematically formalized as:where Hd is the difficulty.The only way to find a nonce that meets a difficulty threshold is to use the proof-of-work algorithm to enumerate all of the possibilities. The expected time to find a solution is proportional to the difficulty\u200a\u2014\u200athe higher the difficulty, the harder it becomes to find the nonce, and so the harder it is to validate the block, which in turn increases the time it takes to validate a new block. So, by adjusting the difficulty of a block, the protocol can adjust how long it takes to validate a block.If, on the other hand, validation time is getting slower, the protocol decreases the difficulty. In this way, the validation time self-adjusts to maintain a constant rate\u200a\u2014\u200aon average, one block every 15 seconds.Transaction ExecutionWe\u2019ve come to one of the most complex parts of the Ethereum protocol: the execution of a transaction. Say you send a transaction off into the Ethereum network to be processed. What happens to transition the state of Ethereum to include your transaction?First, all transactions must meet an initial set of requirements in order to be executed. These include:The transaction must be a properly formatted RLP. \u201cRLP\u201d stands for \u201cRecursive Length Prefix\u201d and is a data format used to encode nested arrays of binary data. RLP is the format Ethereum uses to serialize objects.Valid transaction signature.Valid transaction nonce. Recall that the nonce of an account is the count of transactions sent from that account. To be valid, a transaction nonce must be equal to the sender account\u2019s nonce.The transaction\u2019s gas limit must be equal to or greater than the intrinsic gas used by the transaction. The intrinsic gas includes:a predefined cost of 21,000 gas for executing the transactiona gas fee for data sent with the transaction (4 gas for every byte of data or code that equals zero, and 68 gas for every non-zero byte of data or code)if the transaction is a contract-creating transaction, an additional 32,000 gasThe sender\u2019s account balance must have enough Ether to cover the \u201cupfront\u201d gas costs that the sender must pay. The calculation for the upfront gas cost is simple: First, the transaction\u2019s gas limit is multiplied by the transaction\u2019s gas price to determine the maximum gas cost. Then, this maximum cost is added to the total value being transferred from the sender to the recipient.If the transaction meets all of the above requirements for validity, then we move onto the next step.First, we deduct the upfront cost of execution from the sender\u2019s balance, and increase the nonce of the sender\u2019s account by 1 to account for the current transaction. At this point, we can calculate the gas remaining as the total gas limit for the transaction minus the intrinsic gas used.Next, the transaction starts executing. Throughout the execution of a transaction, Ethereum keeps track of the \u201csubstate.\u201d This substate is a way to record information accrued during the transaction that will be needed immediately after the transaction completes. Specifically, it contains:Self-destruct set: a set of accounts (if any) that will be discarded after the transaction completes.Log series: archived and indexable checkpoints of the virtual machine\u2019s code execution.Refund balance: the amount to be refunded to the sender account after the transaction. Remember how we mentioned that storage in Ethereum costs money, and that a sender is refunded for clearing up storage? Ethereum keeps track of this using a refund counter. The refund counter starts at zero and increments every time the contract deletes something in storage.Next, the various computations required by the transaction are processed.Once all the steps required by the transaction have been processed, and assuming there is no invalid state, the state is finalized by determining the amount of unused gas to be refunded to the sender. In addition to the unused gas, the sender is also refunded some allowance from the \u201crefund balance\u201d that we described above.Once the sender is refunded:the Ether for the gas is given to the minerthe gas used by the transaction is added to the block gas counter (which keeps track of the total gas used by all transactions in the block, and is useful when validating a block)all accounts in the self-destruct set (if any) are deletedFinally, we\u2019re left with the new state and a set of the logs created by the transaction.Now that we\u2019ve covered the basics of transaction execution, let\u2019s look at some of the differences between contract-creating transactions and message calls.Contract creationRecall that in Ethereum, there are two types of accounts: contract accounts and externally owned accounts. When we say a transaction is \u201ccontract-creating,\u201d we mean that the purpose of the transaction is to create a new contract account.In order to create a new contract account, we first declare the address of the new account using a special formula. Then we initialize the new account by:Setting the nonce to zeroIf the sender sent some amount of Ether as value with the transaction, setting the account balance to that valueDeducting the value added to this new account\u2019s balance from the sender\u2019s balanceSetting the storage as emptySetting the contract\u2019s codeHash as the hash of an empty stringOnce we initialize the account, we can actually create the account, using the init code sent with the transaction (see the \u201cTransaction and messages\u201d section for a refresher on the init code). What happens during the execution of this init code is varied. Depending on the constructor of the contract, it might update the account\u2019s storage, create other contract accounts, make other message calls, etc.As the code to initialize a contract is executed, it uses gas. The transaction is not allowed to use up more gas than the remaining gas. If it does, the execution will hit an out-of-gas (OOG) exception and exit. If the transaction exits due to an out-of-gas exception, then the state is reverted to the point immediately prior to transaction. The sender is not refunded the gas that was spent before running out.Boo hoo.However, if the sender sent any Ether value with the transaction, the Ether value will be refunded even if the contract creation fails. Phew!If the initialization code executes successfully, a final contract-creation cost is paid. This is a storage cost, and is proportional to the size of the created contract\u2019s code (again, no free lunch!) If there\u2019s not enough gas remaining to pay this final cost, then the transaction again declares an out-of-gas exception and aborts.If all goes well and we make it this far without exceptions, then any remaining unused gas is refunded to the original sender of the transaction, and the altered state is now allowed to persist!Hooray!Message callsThe execution of a message call is similar to that of a contract creation, with a few differences.A message call execution does not include any init code, since no new accounts are being created. However, it can contain input data, if this data was provided by the transaction sender. Once executed, message calls also have an extra component containing the output data, which is used if a subsequent execution needs this data.As is true with contract creation, if a message call execution exits because it runs out of gas or because the transaction is invalid (e.g. stack overflow, invalid jump destination, or invalid instruction), none of the gas used is refunded to the original caller. Instead, all of the remaining unused gas is consumed, and the state is reset to the point immediately prior to balance transfer.Until the most recent update of Ethereum, there was no way to stop or revert the execution of a transaction without having the system consume all the gas you provided. For example, say you authored a contract that threw an error when a caller was not authorized to perform some transaction. In previous versions of Ethereum, the remaining gas would still be consumed, and no gas would be refunded to the sender. But the Byzantium update includes a new \u201crevert\u201d code that allows a contract to stop execution and revert state changes, without consuming the remaining gas, and with the ability to return a reason for the failed transaction. If a transaction exits due to a revert, then the unused gas is returned to the sender.Execution modelSo far, we\u2019ve learned about the series of steps that have to happen for a transaction to execute from start to finish. Now, we\u2019ll look at how the transaction actually executes within the VM.The part of the protocol that actually handles processing the transactions is Ethereum\u2019s own virtual machine, known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).The EVM is a Turing complete virtual machine, as defined earlier. The only limitation the EVM has that a typical Turing complete machine does not is that the EVM is intrinsically bound by gas. Thus, the total amount of computation that can be done is intrinsically limited by the amount of gas provided.Source: CMUMoreover, the EVM has a stack-based architecture. A stack machine is a computer that uses a last-in, first-out stack to hold temporary values.The size of each stack item in the EVM is 256-bit, and the stack has a maximum size of 1024.The EVM has memory, where items are stored as word-addressed byte arrays. Memory is volatile, meaning it is not permanent.The EVM also has storage. Unlike memory, storage is non-volatile and is maintained as part of the system state. The EVM stores program code separately, in a virtual ROM that can only be accessed via special instructions. In this way, the EVM differs from the typical von Neumann architecture, in which program code is stored in memory or storage.The EVM also has its own language: \u201cEVM bytecode.\u201d When a programmer like you or me writes smart contracts that operate on Ethereum, we typically write code in a higher-level language such as Solidity. We can then compile that down to EVM bytecode that the EVM can understand.Okay, now on to execution.Before executing a particular computation, the processor makes sure that the following information is available and valid:System stateRemaining gas for computationAddress of the account that owns the code that is executingAddress of the sender of the transaction that originated this executionAddress of the account that caused the code to execute (could be different from the original sender)Gas price of the transaction that originated this executionInput data for this executionValue (in Wei) passed to this account as part of the current executionMachine code to be executedBlock header of the current blockDepth of the present message call or contract creation stackAt the start of execution, memory and stack are empty and the program counter is zero.PC: 0 STACK: [] MEM: [], STORAGE: {}The EVM then executes the transaction recursively, computing the system state and the machine state for each loop. The system state is simply Ethereum\u2019s global state. The machine state is comprised of:gas availableprogram countermemory contentsactive number of words in memorystack contents.Stack items are added or removed from the leftmost portion of the series.On each cycle, the appropriate gas amount is reduced from the remaining gas, and the program counter increments.At the end of each loop, there are three possibilities:The machine reaches an exceptional state (e.g. insufficient gas, invalid instructions, insufficient stack items, stack items would overflow above 1024, invalid JUMP/JUMPI destination, etc.) and so must be halted, with any changes discardedThe sequence continues to process into the next loopThe machine reaches a controlled halt (the end of the execution process)Assuming the execution doesn\u2019t hit an exceptional state and reaches a \u201ccontrolled\u201d or normal halt, the machine generates the resultant state, the remaining gas after this execution, the accrued substate, and the resultant output.Phew. We got through one of the most complex parts of Ethereum. Even if you didn\u2019t fully comprehend this part, that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t really need to understand the nitty gritty execution details unless you\u2019re working at a very deep level.How a block gets finalizedFinally, let\u2019s look at how a block of many transactions gets finalized.When we say \u201cfinalized,\u201d it can mean two different things, depending on whether the block is new or existing. If it\u2019s a new block, we\u2019re referring to the process required for mining this block. If it\u2019s an existing block, then we\u2019re talking about the process of validating the block. In either case, there are four requirements for a block to be \u201cfinalized\u201d:\u00a01) Validate (or, if mining, determine) ommers\u00a0Each ommer block within the block header must be a valid header and be within the sixth generation of the present block.\u00a02) Validate (or, if mining, determine) transactionsThe gasUsed number on the block must be equal to the cumulative gas used by the transactions listed in the block. (Recall that when executing a transaction, we keep track of the block gas counter, which keeps track of the total gas used by all transactions in the block).\u00a03) Apply rewards (only if mining)The beneficiary address is awarded 5 Ether for mining the block. (Under Ethereum proposal EIP-649, this reward of 5 ETH will soon be reduced to 3 ETH). Additionally, for each ommer, the current block\u2019s beneficiary is awarded an additional 1/32 of the current block reward. Lastly, the beneficiary of the ommer block(s) also gets awarded a certain amount (there\u2019s a special formula for how this is calculated).\u00a0\u00a04) Verify (or, if mining, compute a valid) state and nonceEnsure that all transactions and resultant state changes are applied, and then define the new block as the state after the block reward has been applied to the final transaction\u2019s resultant state. Verification occurs by checking this final state against the state trie stored in the header.Mining proof of\u00a0workThe \u201cBlocks\u201d section briefly addressed the concept of block difficulty. The algorithm that gives meaning to block difficulty is called Proof of Work (PoW).Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work algorithm is called \u201cEthash\u201d (previously known as Dagger-Hashimoto).The algorithm is formally defined as:where m is the mixHash, n is the nonce, Hn is the new block\u2019s header (excluding the nonce and mixHash components, which have to be computed), Hn is the nonce of the block header, and d is the DAG, which is a large data set.In the \u201cBlocks\u201d section, we talked about the various items that exist in a block header. Two of those components were called the mixHash and the nonce. As you may recall:mixHash is a hash that, when combined with the nonce, proves that this block has carried out enough computationnonce is a hash that, when combined with the mixHash, proves that this block has carried out enough computationThe PoW function is used to evaluate these two items.How exactly the mixHash and nonce are calculated using the PoW function is somewhat complex, and something we can delve deeper into in a separate post. But at a high level, it works like this:A \u201cseed\u201d is calculated for each block. This seed is different for every \u201cepoch,\u201d where each epoch is 30,000 blocks long. For the first epoch, the seed is the hash of a series of 32 bytes of zeros. For every subsequent epoch, it is the hash of the previous seed hash. Using this seed, a node can calculate a pseudo-random \u201ccache.\u201dThis cache is incredibly useful because it enables the concept of \u201clight nodes,\u201d which we discussed previously in this post. The purpose of light nodes is to afford certain nodes the ability to efficiently verify a transaction without the burden of storing the entire blockchain dataset. A light node can verify the validity of a transaction based solely on this cache, because the cache can regenerate the specific block it needs to verify.Using the cache, a node can generate the DAG \u201cdataset,\u201d where each item in the dataset depends on a small number of pseudo-randomly-selected items from the cache. In order to be a miner, you must generate this full dataset; all full clients and miners store this dataset, and the dataset grows linearly with time.Miners can then take random slices of the dataset and put them through a mathematical function to hash them together into a \u201cmixHash.\u201d A miner will repeatedly generate a mixHash until the output is below the desired target nonce. When the output meets this requirement, this nonce is considered valid and the block can be added to the chain.Mining as a security mechanism\u00a0Overall, the purpose of the PoW is to prove, in a cryptographically secure way, that a particular amount of computation has been expended to generate some output (i.e. the nonce). This is because there is no better way to find a nonce that is below the required threshold other than to enumerate all the possibilities. The outputs of repeatedly applying the hash function have a uniform distribution, and so we can be assured that, on average, the time needed to find such a nonce depends on the difficulty threshold. The higher the difficulty, the longer it takes to solve for the nonce. In this way, the PoW algorithm gives meaning to the concept of difficulty, which is used to enforce blockchain security.What do we mean by blockchain security? It\u2019s simple: we want to create a blockchain that EVERYONE trusts. As we discussed previously in this post, if more than one chain existed, users would lose trust, because they would be unable to reasonably determine which chain was the \u201cvalid\u201d chain. In order for a group of users to accept the underlying state that is stored on a blockchain, we need a single canonical blockchain that a group of people believes in.This is exactly what the PoW algorithm does: it ensures that a particular blockchain will remain canonical into the future, making it incredibly difficult for an attacker to create new blocks that overwrite a certain part of history (e.g. by erasing transactions or creating fake transactions) or maintain a fork. To have their block validated first, an attacker would need to consistently solve for the nonce faster than anyone else in the network, such that the network believes their chain is the heaviest chain (based on the principles of the GHOST protocol we mentioned earlier). This would be impossible unless the attacker had more than half of the network mining power, a scenario known as the majority 51% attack.Mining as a wealth distribution mechanismBeyond providing a secure blockchain, PoW is also a way to distribute wealth to those who expend their computation for providing this security. Recall that a miner receives a reward for mining a block, including:a static block reward of 5 ether for the \u201cwinning\u2019\u201d block (soon to be changed to 3 ether)the cost of gas expended within the block by the transactions included in the blockan extra reward for including ommers as part of the blockIn order to ensure that the use of the PoW consensus mechanism for security and wealth distribution is sustainable in the long run, Ethereum strives to instill these two properties:Make it accessible to as many people as possible. In other words, people shouldn\u2019t need specialized or uncommon hardware to run the algorithm. The purpose of this is to make the wealth distribution model as open as possible so that anyone can provide any amount of compute power in return for Ether.Reduce the possibility for any single node (or small set) to make a disproportionate amount of profit. Any node that can make a disproportionate amount of profit means that the node has a large influence on determining the canonical blockchain. This is troublesome because it reduces network security.In the Bitcoin blockchain network, one problem that arises in relation to the above two properties is that the PoW algorithm is a SHA256 hash function. The weakness with this type of function is that it can be solved much more efficiently using specialized hardware, also known as ASICs.In order to mitigate this issue, Ethereum has chosen to make its PoW algorithm (Ethhash) sequentially memory-hard. This means that the algorithm is engineered so that calculating the nonce requires a lot of memory AND bandwidth. The large memory requirements make it hard for a computer to use its memory in parallel to discover multiple nonces simultaneously, and the high bandwidth requirements make it difficult for even a super-fast computer to discover multiple nonce simultaneously. This reduces the risk of centralization and creates a more level playing field for the nodes that are doing the verification.One thing to note is that Ethereum is transitioning from a PoW consensus mechanism to something called \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d. This is a beastly topic of its own that we can hopefully explore in a future post. \u263a\ufe0fConclusion\u2026Phew! You made it to the end. I hope?There\u2019s a lot to digest in this post, I know. If it takes you multiple reads to fully understand what\u2019s going on, that\u2019s totally fine. I personally read the Ethereum yellow paper, white paper, and various parts of the code base many times before grokking what was going on.Nonetheless, I hope you found this overview helpful. If you find any errors or mistakes, I\u2019d love for you to write a private note or post it directly in the comments. I look at all of \u2019em, I promise\u00a0;)And remember, I\u2019m human (yep, it\u2019s true) and I make mistakes. I took the time to write this post for the benefit of the community, for free. So please be constructive in your feedback, without unnecessary bashing. \u263a\ufe0f", "responses": "309"}, {"title": "What Will Bitcoin Look Like in Twenty\u00a0Years?", "author_name": "Daniel Jeffries", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/what-will-bitcoin-look-like-in-twenty-years-7e75481a798c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 31, 2017", "readtime": "34 min read", "upvotes": "49K", "content": "What Will Bitcoin Look Like in Twenty\u00a0Years?Daniel JeffriesBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 31, 2017Prediction is a tricky business.It\u2019s so easy to be wrong and so hard to be right.But that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll do here. Since we\u2019re rapidly approaching the ten year anniversary of Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper publication, I\u2019ll attempt to project out twenty years to see the evolution of Bitcoin, blockchain, alternative cryptocurrencies and decentralization.This is the type of article that will look unbelievably foolish or incredibly brilliant when I\u2019m old and gray.I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going for it anyway.I\u2019m also going to go much, much deeper than \u201cBitcoin will go to zero\u201d or \u201cBitcoin will become the reserve currency and be worth $1,000,000\u201d. That\u2019s not really saying all that much and anyone can do it.Instead we\u2019ll look at how the technology will transform and how society will transform with it.I\u2019ve got a decent track record of successfully predicting future trends and technology but nobody gets it 100% right. Arthur C. Clarke, one of the greatest sci-fi writers of all time, saw the coming of satellites and GPS, as well as the cloud, the Internet and telecommuting but by his own admission he overestimated the importance of rockets and failed to see the importance of a prototype laptop a company gifted to him to write his next novel.Magnum Chaos represented by Lorenzo Lotto, at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in\u00a0Bergamo.Chaos theory tells us it\u2019s impossible to predict the future.But that\u2019s not entirely true.We can never see black swan events or completely unexpected technology (try explaining a computer and the Internet to an 18th century farmer) but we can do a kind of Monte Carlo analysis of tomorrow and see the major pathways spinning out into infinity.Few people can do it well.In fact, most people get the future laughably wrong so before we leap into our predictions, we need to understand why so we can try to avoid the same mistakes.This Internet Thing will Never Work\u00a0OutThe first reason people get the future so wrong is because they dedicate about five minutes to looking at something before they form an opinion on it.That isn\u2019t thinking.Homer\u2019s brain.That\u2019s the primordial lizard brain running a mental heuristic that\u2019s absolutely incapable of understanding anything new and novel. It\u2019s only good at attack, defense, finding food and shelter and avoiding boredom. It\u2019s a survival machine.Unfortunately, many people live almost their entire lives at this level and their opinions are worth zero when it comes to seeing new trends and developments.The second major reason people get the future so wrong is it goes against everything they understand about the world. Think about a company like Kodak who simply refused to see the power of digital film because they\u2019d built up a business over a hundred years on the back of chemical film. They had every advantage and they blew it. They mistook the past for the future and they paid a heavy price by going bankrupt as the market roared past them. To see the future you have to be able to step outside of yourself, forget your past successes and see beyond your current understanding.A third major reason people fail to see the future is because it challenges their position of power. That\u2019s why oligarch banker, Jamie Dimon, and a prince from a country that just allowed women to drive last month, all see Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a \u201cfraud\u201d or a \u201cscam\u201d.They literally can\u2019t see clearly because they\u2019re the main beneficiaries of the current system. They don\u2019t want to see. So they engage in a kind of information warfare, even if it\u2019s unconscious. It\u2019s nothing but a mental defense mechanism. The rise of new ways of running the world means their position is under fire and they\u2019re terrified.Asking these people about Bitcoin is like asking a taxi driver what he thinks about Uber or a horse and buggy manufacturer what he thinks about cars. Their opinions are worth less than nothing.The fourth major reason people screw up predictions is because they mistake their opinion for reality. There\u2019s what you think about the world and there\u2019s actual reality and they\u2019re often not the same thing. One is the map and one is the territory. Don\u2019t mistake the map for the territory.Take this now infamous article by Clifford Stoll from Newsweek in 1995 that declared the Internet a total failure poised for imminent collapse. Stoll writes:\u201cVisionaries see a future of telecommuting workers, interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms. They speak of electronic town meetings and virtual communities. Commerce and business will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems. And the freedom of digital networks will make government more democratic. Baloney.\u201d [Emphasis mine.]Clifford Stoll: I see nothing but the shadow of my opinions in Plato\u2019s\u00a0cave.Reading that quote it\u2019s impossible not to grin ear to ear as feelings of tremendous superiority wash over you. What an idiot! Who didn\u2019t see the Internet coming?Answer: Almost nobody.Hindsight is 20/20.I\u2019m betting almost everyone busting up laughing at the poor guy didn\u2019t see it coming either, if they even knew what the Internet was in the first place. If they did they almost certainly didn\u2019t see a working Wikipedia, the rise of telecommuting and a day when they would buy everything from books to groceries through Amazon.Actually what\u2019s most striking about the above quote is not how inaccurate it is, but how accurate it is on so many levels.That\u2019s right.Read the article and you\u2019ll see tons of his predictions are incredibly spot on!If you go back and strip out all Stoll\u2019s opinions what emerges is an amazingly clear picture of the next two decades of the net. Check it out:\u201cNicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we\u2019ll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet.\u201dI yanked two words: \u201cUh, sure.\u201d His opinion.Stoll saw the future, he just refused to see it. If he managed to get out of his own way and just observe instead of interpreting and filtering what he saw, the article would have gone down in history as one of the most forward thinking and accurate ever written. That brings us to our next reason.The fifth reason people get the future wrong is a complete and total lack of patience.Take the opening line of Stoll\u2019s article:\u201cAfter two decades online, I\u2019m perplexed.\u201dStoll had already lived with the Internet for twenty years but it just wasn\u2019t coming together for him. It\u2019s easy to think it\u2019s never going to happen when that much time goes by.The waiting is the hardest part. It takes patience to let things develop naturally.Patience. Patience. Patience.Creativity requires setbacks and failures and tremendous tenacity. Once you expose your idea to the reality of rust, gravity and friction, things tend to fall apart. No plan survives contact with the enemy. Reality is a whetstone that either shatters you or sharpens your ideas.Things take time.A classic example of the real creative process and how long it takes comes from George de Mestral, the inventor of Velcro.He first came up with the idea in 1941, after taking his dog for a walk in the woods and seeing a bunch of burrs attached to his fur. The concept didn\u2019t fully take root in his mind for another seven years. He started working on recreating the tiny hooks in 1948 and it took him ten years to make it work and mass produce it.After that he opened his company in the late 1950s, he expected immediate high demand.It didn\u2019t happen.It took another five years before the budding space program in the 1960\u2019s saw Velcro as a way to solve the problem of getting astronauts in and out of bulky and unwieldy space suits. The rest of the world only cares about the problems things solve for them not the idea or ideology behind it. Soon after the ski industry noticed it would work on boots.All in all from initial idea to functioning, profitable business?About twenty five years.Lastly, we can take one more lesson from Stoll before I launch into my predictions for crypto.His biggest mistake is the sixth and final reason people are blind to the future. He took current inventions, air lifted them forward and imagined them as the solution to future problems. Wrong!Current inventions solve current problems. Future problems will take brand new solutions.In the article Stoll mentions that CD books would never replace real books. He was right that reading books on CD with a crappy CRT monitor that rips apart your retinas was a miserable experience. But understanding that helps us understand the necessary characteristics of a future solution.It\u2019s nearly impossible to know what form those solutions will take, but we can figure out what traits the solution will have so we can recognize it when it gets here.Let\u2019s see how it works:CDs are clunky. Monitors back then were blurry and hard to read. They hurt the eyes. Computers were huge and not very portable. Even laptops were bricks that burned your legs that nobody would want to read a damn thing on.But he also missed the shortcomings of books.Books are heavy too. They\u2019re made of trees! And they can easily get lost or damaged by the elements. You can only carry so many before you\u2019re carrying a huge weight around.From there we can see that a good solution would be:Super-portable and lightweight.Have a crystal clear display.Hides the data storage completely from the user.As easy to use as a book. Just open and read.Protect the data so if we lose it or damage it, we can recover it without needing to buy it again.Allow you to carry lots of books at once.The Kindle improved reading and now it\u2019s even waterproof which makes it better than traditional books. New solutions must offer the same feature set plus new and improved features to really take\u00a0off.Of course we know the answer now: the Kindle and the iPad.Both have tremendous ease of use, hide the storage media from the user completely, protect the data by backing it up and they\u2019re easy on the eyes.Solutions start by pointing out what\u2019s wrong, asking the right questions about how to fix it and correctly defining what properties we would need to have a better experience.From the above, we have three principles to help us predict the future:Patience.Observe, don\u2019t interpret.Don\u2019t graft today\u2019s solutions onto tomorrow\u2019s problems.All right, let\u2019s break out the crystal ball and peer into the fate of Bitcoin and crypto.Hopefully we\u2019ll have better luck than Stoll and this article won\u2019t get trotted out by tomorrow\u2019s Boing Boing replacement to call me an idiot.The Rise of Bitcoin, Crypto and DecentralizationWe\u2019ll start with a few easy predictions and move on to some more complex and far reaching ones as well as some seriously controversial ones.I\u2019ll also include a confidence meter to let you know how strongly I feel about the scenario playing out.1) The Bubble\u00a0BurstsPeople in and out of crypto see them as bubble that will pop, causing prices to crash badly.They\u2019re right.But so what?That\u2019s not the end of the story. It\u2019s just the beginning.Right now we\u2019re in the grips of tremendous euphoria. There\u2019s so much potential. We can practically taste the decentralized future. It\u2019s just around the corner! Any day now.Of course, that\u2019s almost certainly not how it will work out. The bubble will pop. Vitalik is right. 90% of tokens will fail.But after the pop comes the real working ideas.Eight years into the crypto experiment, everyone is working on the railroad tracks of the future but we don\u2019t have much to show for it other than speculative trading and some smart contracts. The apps are hideous and practically unusable. It\u2019s nerve wracking when you push \u201csend\u201d and blast $5000 across the web to someone. Better hope you copy and pasted that address right so your money doesn\u2019t disappear into the void!When the Internet bubble burst many of today\u2019s marquee companies saw their stocks crash 85%. Yet they survived and the best was yet to come. Amazon and Google went on to dominate the world.The same will happen in crypto.The 10% of projects that make it through the bloodbath will turn into the Amazon, Google and Facebook of tomorrow and likely even the JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs as well, not to mention maybe even the governments of the future, like digital direct democracies or liquid democracies.Innovation is hard work. You\u2019re literally trying to create something that doesn\u2019t exist!There are no guidelines, no working templates, no business models to clone. There\u2019s nothing. You\u2019re on your own! It\u2019s just you and your imagination. With those odds of course 90% of people and companies fail!It doesn\u2019t matter.Crypto, blockchain and triple entry accounting are probably the most important invention of the last 500 years so they\u2019re not going to go gently into that good night.The bubble burst is just the next step. Three years after that the tech will really mature and take off running.2) Government Cryptocurrencies will\u00a0FlourishThe community won\u2019t like this one, but it\u2019s a no brainer.Many governments will not sit by and lose control of the money supply without a vicious fight. Anyone working on a project right now should be anticipating protocol level assaults on decentralized cryptos and designing defenses against them.A distributed, decentralized DDoS stopping grid, like the one from Gladius is a great first step but there is a lot more work to be done. We\u2019ll talk about some additional defenses cryptos needs to survive later when I come to the evolution of protocols.Governments will lose the battle in the long run, probably in thirty to one hundred years (maybe faster depending on how many wars or financial crises strike). That\u2019s provided we survive as a race, don\u2019t nuke ourselves, and push out into space. But in ten or twenty years expect very strong government cryptocurrencies to come to power and dominate the flow of money for many, if not most, people around the world.\u201cBut no one will adopt them!\u201d scream the crypto faithful!Of course, they will.The average person has zero understanding of just about anything that actually matters and they absolutely don\u2019t see a need for privacy and security until it\u2019s physically ripped away from them under extreme circumstances like a war. When soldiers invade your house and take everything you own suddenly the need for privacy becomes very real to people.Remember this interview with Snowden about government surveillance on the John Oliver show?Watch the look on Snowden\u2019s face when he realizes that the average man on the street doesn\u2019t know a damn thing about privacy and doesn\u2019t care about it in the least! The only time they care is when the government has a picture of their dick on file. Seriously.People will adopt government cryptos like good little sheep without a second thought. Even better, they\u2019ll think it\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do and they\u2019ll even be willing to kill for it if told that\u2019s right. Count on it!Of course, in many ways government issued cryptocurrencies are utterly ridiculous, as Naval Ravikant points out in his epic blockchain tweetstorm:They\u2019re nonsense because the very purpose of blockchain is to distribute power across a system. By not allowing a single group to control or change the rules arbitrarily, decentralized cryptos and apps provide a powerful set of checks and balances against harmful actions to the system.When five different banks own a blockchain, that\u2019s not a blockchain, that\u2019s a database. Only when the banks, the regulators, the shareholders and the customers of the bank hold the keys to the blockchain at the same time and can counteract each other\u2019s power is it a true blockchain.The checks and balances on power are exactly the point!Government crypto will represent a total and complete corruption of that idea.But it won\u2019t matter. They\u2019ll do it any way.In fact, instead of distributing power, they\u2019ll look to concentrate even more power, by giving themselves the ability to track every single citizen\u2019s spending with impunity and automatically collect taxes from wages and sales of goods and services. That\u2019s why authoritarian governments are racing to build official state cryptos. They can\u2019t wait to have panopticon money in your pocket as soon as possible.They will absolutely outlaw physical cash and they will do it under the guise of one of three excuses:Stopping money launderingStopping terroristsStopping crimeOf course, knowing that you spend half your paycheck on Amazon, groceries and rent has nothing to do with any of those things but hey, if you trot out any or all of the above reasons you can easily get half the population to do whatever you want and even better they\u2019ll believe it with all their hearts.Remember American psychologist Gustave Gilbert\u2019s talk with Nazi Herman Goring during the Nuremberg trials? Goring told him that most people will go along with whatever their leaders tell them to do without question, whether it\u2019s a democracy or fascist dictatorship.Naively, Gilber replied, \u201cThere is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.\u201dBut Goring only laughed and said, \u201cOh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.\u201dGovernment cryptos will be a very, very bitter pill to swallow for current true believers in the crypto space but they better get used to them.A better bet is to assume there\u2019ll be hybrid systems of decentralized and centralized crypto and to design for it right now to avoid getting swallowed in the tsunami to come. Better to embrace the current system with blockchain and then overwhelm it from within rather than ignore it so that it becomes hostile.3) Decentralized Cryptocurrencies Will Become a Parallel Economic Operating System for the\u00a0PlanetJust because centralized cryptos rise to prominence doesn\u2019t mean the decentralized cryptos will go away. Oh, many governments will try, but in the end they\u2019ll fail to stamp them out. The reasons are simple.The same factors that make it hard to form consensus across a blockchain, make it hard for all the world\u2019s governments to agree on anything. They won\u2019t be able to do it. Some governments will love decentralization and others will hate it.Even as some countries openly rail against them, many others will openly embrace decentralized cryptocurrencies, especially the ones who suffered the worst under the dominance of Europe and the US dollar over the last century.I see the Latin American countries, freewheeling no-holds-barred globalists like Singapore, historical bankers-to-the-world Switzerland and many of the Asian and African countries welcoming decentralized crypto with open arms, if only to stick it to the current empires.If all the countries don\u2019t agree, then decentralized cryptos are never going away, even as centralized cryptos come to power.But to remain relevant, decentralized cryptos need to move fast. They need a killer app. Right now they\u2019re vulnerable to attack. To really take root they need that killer app to spread virally across the globe. It\u2019s got to be something so indispensable that people can\u2019t imagine their lives without it. This will bring existing power players into the system and they will then use that power to defend it against attacks from outside powers.I outlined one of the ways that can happen in my article for gamifying the distribution of money. But that\u2019s just one way it can play out. There are many, many more. If you\u2019re working on a platform now, know that it\u2019s a race against time before central cryptos take root.4) The Killer App for Crypto is NOT a\u00a0BrowserThis is a classic example of grafting old inventions onto a new system. The Brave Browser is awesome and I bet I\u2019ll really love it as it gets paired with BAT and/or a universal payment system that automatically swaps cryptocurrencies without the need for an exchange but I don\u2019t see it as the final interface to the blockchain. I see it as a potential intermediate step.So what does the killer app look like?I don\u2019t know.But I know it is:UbiquitousEasy to useActs as a platform for everything from changing money to getting tickets to protecting privacy and information.Open sourceIt\u2019s also something totally new and original that expands and extends the best characteristics of the blockchain while minimizing its greatest weaknesses.Maybe a decentralized AI assistant or attention filter? The possibilities are endless so get moving!5) Blockchain is Just the Beginning of Decentralized ConsensusBlockchain systems are only the first successful implementation of decentralized consensus mechanisms.People are already inventing new ones like IOTA\u2019s Tangle and the HashGraph.It doesn\u2019t really matter if both of those projects prove failures in the long run because some other project will create another method. This is virtually guaranteed.Over the next twenty years, I predict dozens, if not hundreds of experimental distributed consensus protocols, capable of transaction levels that blow away Visa level processing, augmented by artificial intelligence systems.It\u2019s also strongly possible that none of these systems will be designed by humans.Instead AI\u2019s will rapidly iterate on ideas and come up with systems that no human ever could if they had a hundred years. They\u2019ll draw their inspiration from nature and systems of insects or roots or other biological systems like proteins.One or two of these systems will come to dominate all coins and become the meta-system to rule them all, uniting many different kinds of coins and running the entire system like a massive fractal that enables countless daughter networks to flourish inside of it.6) Crypto Will Get a LOT Easier to\u00a0UseToday\u2019s user experience in crypto is awful.If I mistype something or copy and paste wrong, my money disappears forever. If there\u2019s a software glitch I lose my money forever. If someone hacks my computer or phone my money is gone forever.See a trend there? Make any mistake you\u2019re toast. It\u2019s like driving a motorcycle on the edge of a one inch mountain road with no rail.The core wallets are slow, hard to use and ugly. When I last upgraded Ethereum, it forgot to keep my private keys so I had to go restore them all. Earlier this year I had an old Bitcoin stuck in an ancient version of Multibit from 2013. It took me a week to free it after the software mistakenly thought I had sent a transaction that was never actually broadcast.Imagine these wallets going into cold storage and coming out five years later. Will they even be usable? What happens when quantum computers come out and we need to completely update the basic protocols that underscore the system?The average person will never be able to do these procedures. Zero chance. Two decades in IT taught me that people can and will screw up their machines in ways that are utterly unimaginable to tech people. Murphy\u2019s Law rules.Even worse, there\u2019s no way to reverse any transaction or to secure it against mistakes. I foresee many algorithmic methods to freeze, roll back and protect transactions, as well as ways to self-escrow money and recover stolen money. Think of them as automated versions of calling the bank and declaring a card stolen.If grandma can\u2019t do it, forget it. Everyone is not an IT person who can bang away at the Linux terminal.Only systems that provide all the features of the old system plus brand new features achieve mass adoption.Think about CD-ROM books from the 80\u2019s again. They had a bunch of new features, like charts and color and you could back them up.But it wasn\u2019t good enough because CD\u2019s had fatal flaws. Ray Kurzweil calls this the \u201cfalse pretender\u201d phase of evolutionary development in his book The Singularity is Near. The new tech has some advantages but too many disadvantages to really make it with the wider world and replace the old technology.It wasn\u2019t until Kindles and iPads came along that eReaders had all the old features of reading a book, such as portability and being easy on the eyes, plus new features like the ability to carry a thousand books with you at once, something no dead tree could compete with, that it could really take off.Cryptos must follow a similar path from fatally flawed to bringing untold new powers to people and businesses to acheive world dominance.I also see many of the kinds of systems we really need arising from the desire to pass digital money down to your children. For that we will need ad-hock banks formed with groups of people as needed or algorithmic banks and bullet proof multi-signature wallets with decentralized cloud or foglet services to act as the final arbiter.It won\u2019t be enough to simply shard up your keys and give them to trusted friends or loved ones. That is a first pass solution. Friends stop being friends, people get divorced or die or worse. We need something better and completely automated.Think about how hard it would be to pass your Bitcoin down to your loved ones now. What if you died tomorrow or got hit on the head and forgot your password?Even if you plan for it, it kind of sucks too.You would have to create a will, lock a backup of your private keys and wallet in a safe, give the password to an estate lawyer and hope that he doesn\u2019t make off with it or the USB stick or Trezor/Nano doesn\u2019t die. You could also create a multi-signature wallet with some friends and family members and hope someone doesn\u2019t check a different version into Github with a backdoor or bug and screw it up. All of it is ugly and immature. It\u2019s unacceptable.By the way, if you want to start a crypto business that everyone will need in the future, solve the inheritance problem. Everyone will pay you gladly.I foresee drag and drop smart contracts and AI generated wills with self-escrowing money. In essence, the blockchain itself will be the bank and the customer service department, perhaps using your biometric markers and third party proof-of-staked groups or a decentralized AI that can verify your loved ones, as well as trigger events like your end of days. Automated password and key recovery will be STOP.Whatever it looks like, we\u2019ll need algorithmic approximations of the controls we have now for giving money to people we want and keeping it out of the hands of people who want to rob us. We also need the system to protect us from accidents, death and going nuts.7) The protocols of Coins will Get Abstracted from the Coins ThemselvesRight now all the coins that exist are inextricably bound to their protocols.I expect us to abstract away the protocols for exchanging, sending and receiving as well as securing, defending and storing our coins.This will mirror the evolution of today\u2019s servers from bare metal to virtualization to containers to serverless.To start with, most coins can\u2019t scale. We can\u2019t even come close to hitting Visa level transaction processing on chain, the holy grail of any crypto system and the subject of much in-fighting and controversy. Bitcoin can do 7 transactions per second at its peak.Some people have gone so far as to consider this a virtue of the coin as it encourages people to save and store it rather than send it.That\u2019s just absurd.We should be able to move the coin as fast and as far and as often as we like.Let\u2019s face it, the 1 MB limit is nothing but a hack. Originally Bitcoin had no limit. Then Satoshi snuck it in overnight with no mention of it and no explanation in the source code. It was most likely nothing but a ham-fisted way to prevent DDoS attacks.We can and will come up with better flooding protections.Are you a 1MB adherent? How about SegWit2X\u2019s 2MB? Maybe you go for Bitcoin Cash\u2019s 8MB block?Wrong. All of them wrong and ridiculous.According to the folks at the Lightning Network if we had seven billion people doing a mere two transactions a day it would take:24 GB blocks3.5 TB/day1.27 PB per yearWe need to think differently and evolve beyond petty nonsense to design real solutions. To survive Bitcoin and crypto must change. It\u2019s got to be easy to integrate new defenses, newer cryptographic algorithms when quantum computers come knocking and better speeds and innovations.We can\u2019t just rest on the laurels of the Satoshi vision and assume he thought of everything.He didn\u2019t.And frankly, who gives a fuck what Satoshi thinks? He left the project. If he really wanted to guide it he could have stuck around like Linus did with Linux. But he didn\u2019t. He left it up to the rest of us to figure it all out.So let\u2019s really start to do that because the current system won\u2019t stand or will just become dominated by mega-payment processors just like the system we have right now.One way to do that is to abstract all the protocols and run all the older coins as something equivalent to virtual machines or containers. Then the rules are separate from the coins themselves.That\u2019s just one way, but to really become the promised breakthrough technology, blockchain needs real innovation.Either way, people need to think quick, or we\u2019ll still be debating 1 MB versus 2 MB while the CryptoRuble and CryptoYuan blow past us.We\u2019ll also need this because it will become necessary to defend against hostile actors and APTs (advanced persistent threat) protocol level attacks. Think the Great Firewall of China attacking or blocking transactions by screwing with packets and headers with state level man in the middle attacks. The NEM architecture is a good first step, as it includes firewall like protection for nodes.But it needs to go further to stop even more insidious and devastating assaults and it can\u2019t take fours years and a hard fork to implement the solution.The best solutions will likely be externalized security rule chains downloaded to all nodes in the network that act as intrusion detection, firewalls and protocol inspectors and AI based auto-evolving rulesets and countermeasures.Think Neuromancer\u2019s ICE.8) We will have Four Dominant Meta Coins, Plus Fifty to One Hundred Minor Coins, and Infinite Virtual Variations of These Coins, Plus State\u00a0CoinsRight now we\u2019re making coins for everything.Got an identity platform like Civic? Make a coin.Created decentralized DNS? Make a coin and ICO!Building a scratch-your-ass on the blockchain app? You need a coin my friend!Actually you don\u2019t need a coin.Coins will start to shake out into various meta categories. At this point I can only see four types of coins needed, with a blockchain of blockchains (or post-blockchain tech) seamlessly swapping them as needed to consume services:Deflationary Saver CoinInflationary Spender CoinAction TokenReward TokenDeflationary coins are for hoarding and investing. They will rise over time and benefit savers. Everyone needs this kind of investment and it\u2019s the reason Bitcoin started in the first place.An inflationary coin mirrors the dollar today. Nobody likes spending Bitcoin on a flat screen TV only to realize that they paid $175,000 for it a few years later as the price of Bitcoin rockets up. We need stable, spendable coins. Imagine this as the classic \u201cstore of value\u201d Paul Krugman is always bitching about and know that we actually do need this to buy and sell every day goods.An action token is for actions on the network that should always be free such as voting or sending a text message. These are not microtransactions. Resetting my password on something should not cost the equivalent of two pennies. As the EOS folks say \u201cIf you went to Amazon and it cost three cents to load the page, nobody would load the page.\u201dReward tokens are designed to flow around the system as a digital representation of karma, incentivizing good behavior and punishing bad behavior.You could literally build the ultimate universal system with just these four coins. Every other coin could simply act as a subcomponent of those coins with different metadata.9) We\u2019ll Learn We Didn\u2019t Know Crap About EconomicsAre you a Keynesian planner or an Austrian free market adherent?The answer is who cares?All of our economic theories are based on studies conducting with limited data in the analog age of ink and wood pulp. All current economic theory will prove about as advanced as cave paintings as we experiment with new economic systems over the coming years.That\u2019s what these new coins are: Micro-economic systems at war.It\u2019s Darwinian economics.A few basic laws of economics will hold true but many of them will simply fall by the wayside. That\u2019s because with blockchain dominate systems we\u2019ll have real time economic data on a global scale not just a bunch of guesses done with pencil and paper a hundred years ago.As artificial intelligence tracks statistics in real time around the globe we\u2019ll be able to see the real effects of a steel tariff enacted in one country as prices shoot up for building in another country dependent on that steel. We\u2019ll track global production and manufacturing with unbelievable precision and what we learn will very much surprise us in so many wonderful ways.10) A DAO Will Grow to Fortune 500\u00a0StatusThe most likely DAO to reach this milestone will be a DAO that mirrors an open version of Visa, in that it will likely take cuts from the transactions and miners on the most dominant network and it will help fund the future development and governance of that network.It will not hoard all the money but act as a nexus that flows the money down to other businesses and DAOs via smart contract as well as to state and local governments and other non-governmental entities that benefit the network.To do that though the DAO has to evolve.Right now we think of DAO\u2019s as a smart contract. Not even close.\u201cHow beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, / That has such people in\u00a0\u2018t!\u201dA DAO will require AI to help manage and mitigate its rulesets and it will need to be able to auto-generate templated governance models. Governance is everything in DAOs and there are no good scalable models yet to manage a company the size of a major corporation today as an open source meritocratic workplace. Early DAOs failed because they have what I call the Brave New World problem.Everyone imagines they\u2019re the chief and nobody wants to take out the trash.It\u2019s hard to order paperclips when everyone is a king in a DAO.To function effectively a team needs role players and stars. People also have to understand their role and accept it, even if it will change later as they build merit and experience in the system.Management is hard enough as it is in corporate environments. How do you fire someone for non-performance in a DAO? How do you ensure that the guy in charge of ICO security is actually qualified and not just elected because everyone likes him? You can\u2019t risk someone running off with $45 million in Bitcoin because Bob got elected for his great stories about Burning Man and his painting skills.The automated corporate and non-profit architectures of tomorrow will have to evolve incredible tools for ongoing management and decision making as well as operating agreements that function like code to become a reality.11) The Gig Economy Will Grow Big\u00a0TimePeople from the World War II generation had one or two jobs their whole life.Today we have five or six.Tomorrow\u2019s people will have five or six at the same time.Half of those income streams will be automated and passive, likely some kind of crypto UBI. We will also see the rise of AI job matching services. The machines will know your capabilities and skill sets and match short term gigs to you so you don\u2019t even have to look for a job.Imagine a software project that requires an insane amount of code, something like ten trillion lines. Software projects are only getting more complicated and will continue to grow. AI\u2019s will write and test half of it but people will write the other half. The project would get fed into a distributed, decentralized system that chunks up and parses out the work, acts like a project manager and delivers the work to coders all across the worldwide network based on the reputation and skillset fingerprint.Think of it like an AI Github married to UpWork and the Mechanical Turk system.It could work for manufacturing and all kinds of blue collar work as well, which can make a big dent in the haves and have-nots divide we see today.The Hong Kong subway AI is perhaps the first prototype of this kind of network, even if it\u2019s not a perfect analogy. It predicts what will fail on the subway and sends engineers to get ahead of the failures. That makes the uptime of the world\u2019s busiest subway 99%.Much of this will be governed by Externalized Reputation Banks powered by blockchains that will be the social credit of tomorrow.This will be both good and very, very evil.Black Mirror\u2019s Social\u00a0Credit.On the evil side of the house we have the Chinese Social Credit system that is about as Black Mirror as it gets today. It will get infinitely worse as nation-states use Reputation Banks to cram ideology down people\u2019s throats.But open, publicly managed Rep Banks will help us find relationships and work and figure out who to trust in business and in life.It will be a double edged sword.The main challenge is that very few people can agree on what is good or bad in a system and ideology tends to warp those concepts into unrecognizable messes. It will be incredibly easy to create a ruleset that enslaves us all if we\u2019re not careful.The Controversy KingsI just cranked through some of the easier predictions to make. Now let\u2019s toss out a few that just might spark fierce debates and controversy in the community.12) The Blockchain Will Enable All Kinds of\u00a0EvilCrypto enthusiasts will have to come to terms with the fact that the blockchain can and will enable as much evil as it does good.Nothing is all good or evil. Everything exists on a continuum. You can kill someone with a gun but you can also feed your family by hunting. Water sustains life but it can also drown you or even poison you.If you\u2019re out there designing a system right now with the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d DevOps approach, just know that it\u2019s most likely a disaster for systems that can algorithmically govern many aspects of our lives.Instead, you should adopt a go slow, think about it and don\u2019t break things approach.You should start thinking about all the ways to destroy your system or you won\u2019t be able to defend it. If you aren\u2019t imagining all the ways a hostile group will use the power of blockchain, one that doesn\u2019t share your views on openness and freedom and collaboration, then you\u2019re just naive.I\u2019m half way through an article called \u201cWhat If Hitler Had the Blockchain?\u201d Frankly, I don\u2019t want to publish it because I don\u2019t want to give the bad guys any fresh ideas but rest assured it probably doesn\u2019t matter. Their dark minds are already hard at work imagining how to use blockchain as a system of repression and control.I will be somewhat intentionally vague here, so as not to put all of these ideas out into the collective unconscious but think digital tracking of all aspects of your life from where you go and what you do, to statistical predictions about your behavior, as well as behavioral algorithms designed to incentivize you to conform to an ideology, and lastly think unbreakable digital rights management and outright genocide.Genocide?Yeah.Don\u2019t forget that IBM helped the Nazis manage the holocaust with punch cards for tracking victims.What could they have done with blockchain? Answer: Many more horrible atrocities that we can only begin to imagine now.Maybe you think that an open system will always prevent abuses?Wrong.If the Internet has taught us anything it\u2019s that open systems tend towards centralization and given enough time central powers can and will subvert and corrupt any system to their own ends.If you\u2019re working in crypto and you\u2019re not thinking about all the ways to misuse crypto then it\u2019s very likely that instead of designing a system to save the world you just created a prison for it.13) Bitcoin Has a 50/50 Shot At SurvivingMost true believers will not like this one but honestly, 50/50 might be really, really high here.I know, I know. You\u2019ve heard it all before! The Money Badger can\u2019t be stopped! New ATH!!!! Buy and HODLz forever!Look you stuck with me this long so stick with me a little longer so I can explain.First off, I\u2019m rooting for Bitcoin to live until my dying days but let\u2019s look at this objectively for a few minutes to see why it might go down hard. It\u2019s probably not what you think.Bitcoin has first mover advantage. It\u2019s the absolute first of its kind and still dominates the global market share but it also suffers from a number of major flaws that could kill it.Basically, it\u2019s the Model T of the blockchain revolution.How many Model T\u2019s do you see on the street today?Can you retrofit a Model T to make it burn rubber like a Lamborghini? Can you add sophisticated electronics to make it a self-driving Tesla? Nope.To start with, Bitcoin has no built-in governance. This is a crucial flaw. Only a few ways to change it exist. The first is to submit a proposal where almost everyone agrees and as we have seen with SegWit, that\u2019s incredibly hard. It took four years for the change to get adopted.The second is to start a new project and hard fork it. This might be the only way this actually works in the end. A team might fork it and build in governance, but it\u2019s a long shot.A coin with well designed, widespread, build-in governance will have a massive advantage over Bitcoin and could easily replace it, as it makes upgrades seamless and smooth.Upgrades and responses to attacks by well funded hostile forces will need to move fast and percolate throughout the network in hours or days, not years.What about scaling? We already talked about that problem. Changing the blocksize won\u2019t cut it. It will require something more radical.What if China turns the Great Firewall on it? Would it even be possible to retrofit private relays and other anti-interference code into the system at this late stage?What if governments simply decide that they will spend a billion dollars on a datacenter and secretly designed ASICs to run the system? Could any miners compete?What if hostiles just decided to round up all the core developers? How easy would it be to replace them considering the tremendous shortage of talent in the crypto world now?These are only some of the nearly insurmountable problems of my favorite crypto. I point them out not to kill it but to make people think. If you can really see a problem you can find a way to fix it. But if we\u2019re only going to deal with fake problems like the blocksize limit we will get nowhere.Bitcoin is a beautiful, brilliant idea and it\u2019s already changed the world. It won\u2019t fail because it\u2019s a fraud or a scam, but because of its own hard coded rules, in-fighting and lack of governance.Of course, it doesn\u2019t have to fail. We can start thinking about how to save it right here, right now.As I noted earlier, some kind of virtualization or containerization that allows Bitcoin to adapt and evolve by migrating to an abstracted set of protocols and defenses would help ensure that it not only survives but thrives.I\u2019m rooting for it. I\u2019m betting if you\u2019re reading this, you are too.The best way to make sure it survives is to understand all the real reasons it could fail and start designing real solutions to those problems today, so that when they do arrive, we\u2019re ready.The Final\u00a0FrontierI have a lot more predictions but I\u2019ll save them for my fiction. Maybe I\u2019ll do a followup if this article goes viral.I also left a few evil ideas off the table because I don\u2019t want to see them come to pass. If someone else comes up with them, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it but the worst scenarios in the Monte Carlo pathways of tomorrow will not come from my keyboard.Cryptocurrencies represent a fundamental upgrade to the economic systems of the world. Once they\u2019re fully booted up and integrated into the global and interplanetary networks of the future, the world will look very, very different in ways we can only begin to understand.Hundreds of years from now, today\u2019s economies will look like the feudal economies of the past.Cyrptocurrencies, decentralized apps and DAOs even hold the possibility of bootstrapping us into Star Trek like post-scarcity economies but it will take time.I\u2019m not betting on Singularity level acceleration taking us there tomorrow, even if I sprinkle the Singularity into all my sci-fi work because it\u2019s the stuff of great fiction. But it\u2019s probably not reality.If I\u2019m wrong, then my uploaded and snapshotted virtual mind, running on a global fog of computronium in a Matrioshka brain will just have to deal with it.But I doubt it.So where does that leave us?Crypto will be both good and evil like everything in life.If you\u2019re working on crypto then you\u2019re building the world of tomorrow but don\u2019t expect it to arrive next week.Inertia has a way of slowing down even the fastest rockets.Just enjoy the ride while we boldly go where no one has gone before.############################################Check out the interview I did with the awesome Core Media team on the future of #crypto on SoundCloud:############################################If you love my work please visit my Patreon page because that\u2019s where I share special insights with all my fans.

But back in 1989 he created something incredible.It\u2019s more revolutionary than the cotton gin, the steam engine, the PC and the smart phone combined.When people look back hundreds of years from now, only the printing press and the Internet will have it beat for sheer mind-boggling impact on society. Both the net and the printing press enabled the democratization of information and single-handedly uplifted the collective knowledge of people all over the world.So what am I talking about? What did Ijiri create that\u2019s so amazing?Triple-entry accounting.Uh, what?Yeah. I\u2019m serious.But don\u2019t feel bad if you slept through the revolution. It wasn\u2019t televised or posted on Reddit. When Professor Ijiri died in 2017, most people didn\u2019t catch his obituary. His most famous book, Momentum Accounting & Triple-Entry Bookkeeping, has a grand total of zero reviews on Good Reads. So you\u2019re not alone if you missed it.Go ahead and Google \u201ctriple-entry accounting\u201d and see what comes up.232,000 results. In the age of Google that\u2019s like not existing. Minor Instagram celebrities and memes invented last week have more hits.The number two link is a Wikipedia article that\u2019s barely a stub. The fourth down is a paper from 2005. Ijiri isn\u2019t even mentioned on the first page.So why is it so important if nobody knows about it?Because the first application for it didn\u2019t come along until 2008 and so it\u2019s real impact is still to come. But make no mistake, it\u2019s coming like a tsunami that will remake every aspect of our lives and societies.How do I know?To understand why, you just need to know a little about history\u2019s sexiest subject.Accounting: History\u2019s Sexiest\u00a0SubjectHere\u2019s the thing: Without accounting, you wouldn\u2019t be reading this article on your iPad, or driving to work in a new car or listening to music on Pandora. Without accounting there\u2019s no commerce, no trade. Without commerce there would be no planes, no trains, no tractors, no steam engine, no skyscrapers or computers. There would be no nation states, no boats, no shipping containers traveling all over the world ferrying goods from the far corners of the Earth.In fact, without accounting you\u2019d still be subsistence farming or hunting in the forest.You see, there\u2019s only been two accounting breakthroughs in the entire history of the world before now.Both of them presaged a massive uptick in human societal complexity and innovation.The first breakthrough was single-entry accounting.Before that we were running around the forest chasing animals, following the moon or farming. Our prospects were limited. You lived with your tribe or clan and you hunted and gathered. Your parents before you did the same thing and theirs before them and theirs before them in an endless cycle down through the years.Accounting broke that cycle.For the first time we had the ability to bootstrap ourselves into a different kind of life, one that didn\u2019t involve every single person on the planet living hand to mouth.The earliest examples of single entry accounting go back to the Sumerians about 5000 years ago on cuneiform tablets. Yeah, those Sumerians, the ones who gave us the Epic of Gilgamesh, the world\u2019s oldest recorded story. These systems were simple but effective. You just put one note in a ledger. So-and-so owes me $50.Once you can keep track of who owns what, trading starts to happen at a much larger scale. That\u2019s why the kings and queens of ancient times could build castles and establish professional armies and create great wonders of the world.But single-entry accounting isn\u2019t very good. It can only take you so far. The only accountants back then were the king\u2019s brother because you really had to trust that guy. All he had to do was wipe away a line in the ledger and that money no longer existed. There was no way to verify, no way to audit, no way for two people to agree.That meant trade was a family affair. The kings and queens traded with the dukes and mostly they kept all the money for themselves and left the rest of us to starve. Powerful clans dominated the Earth.Double-Entry to the\u00a0RescueIt wasn\u2019t until the 1400's that the single-entry system really started to show its age though. For the first time, you had boats that could travel from near and far. That meant they could trade with people they\u2019d never met. Since boats became the most important way to carry goods to distant lands, port city-states like Venice became the center of the ancient world and the nexus of world trade. But with so much trade going on, single-entry accounting showed even more cracks. It\u2019s easy to make data entry errors. People\u2019s books were soon a hopeless mess of conjecture and lost money. The more trades that stacked up, the more errors.Multiple civilizations from the Italians in the 1300's, to the ancient Koreans, to the second Muslim Caliphate all developed versions of a double-entry system. The systems never caught on though. And that brings us full circle to the most important invention in the history of man: the printing press. Without it, knowledge remained siloed. People would develop a breakthrough in one area of the world, only to die off and leave no trace. The press allowed people to make hundreds of thousands of copies and that meant knowledge survived and circulated, instead of dying with its creator.By the 1400\u2019s, a Franciscan friar finally codified the double-entry system and it swiftly became the standard with Venetian merchants. All thanks to the preserving power of print.This opened up world trade. Now goods could flow easily to all the empires of the old world.Fast forward to today and we still use a double-entry system. If you do your taxes in TurboTax or keep your books in Quickbooks you\u2019re using double-entry.But now those systems are starting to show their age badly.Take a company like Enron. They did all kinds of things to cook the books. They managed to hide billions in debt.And that\u2019s where Triple-entry Accounting comes in.The Dawn of Triple-EntryMost people missed Professor Ijiri\u2019s breakthrough because it straddles two equally obscure and poorly understood fields: cryptography and accounting.It\u2019s rare enough to find a person who\u2019s versed in one of those disciplines, never mind both. Without that kind of interdisciplinary understanding, it\u2019s no surprise that his invention went over like a lead zeppelin.There\u2019s also the little problem that he was incredibly ahead of his time. Encryption had not yet entered the public consciousness. If you work in information technology you might remember the Clipper chip scandal, where the NSA tried to mandate a backdoor in all encryption. That was in 1993. Ijiri published his work in 1989. It passed mostly unacknowledged by the general public.In 2005, came a more well-known example of a triple-entry accounting system, created by famed cryptographer Ian Grigg.Then, in 2006/2007, a self-taught programmer likely stumbled on one or both of the systems. He was working on an alternative currency, with no centralized trust.It was called Bitcoin.It was the first working example of triple-entry accounting.Now I know what you\u2019re thinking. Please not another story on how Bitcoin changed the world. But here\u2019s the deal, whether Bitcoin survives or fails, the blockchain will continue to thrive and flourish, as will triple entry accounting. Corporations and governments that initially scoffed at it are now racing to adopt its power. (Oh and I don\u2019t think Bitcoin will die either. It\u2019s here to stay, like it or not haters.)At the recent Consensus summit in New York City, I counted Deloitte and Touche, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Deutsche Bank, US Dept of Health and Human Services, The World Bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Toyota, Fidelity and Citi among the attendees. JP Morgan announced they were incorporating the anonymity protocol of Zcash into their own enterprise blockchain, an idea which would have seemed absurd only a few years ago.But here\u2019s the thing: We\u2019re only at the caveman stage of what we can do with blockchains.We\u2019ve been playing around with funny money, making currency and trading it, but the utility of these currencies in the real world has so far remained limited to speculators and early adopters.But blockchains can do much, much more, as can the cryptos that drive that innovation.One Pill Makes You\u00a0LargerTriple-entry accounting and by extension blockchains and crypto are a way of agreeing on objective reality. It\u2019s not the objective reality. That\u2019s a philosophical black hole we\u2019ll ignore for now, but it\u2019s an objective reality. It\u2019s two parties agreeing on a version of past events. The third entry in the system, entered into the blockchain, is both a receipt and a transaction. It\u2019s proof that something happened between two parties, which goes beyond the receipts that each party holds in double entry.But all that is theoretical. Why does it matter? What can you do with it?So many things.I Won the Popular\u00a0VoteHow about voting?We have tons of problems with voting today that we\u2019ve hedged against in advanced democracies and completely failed to deal with in banana republics, third world countries and authoritarian regimes the world over.How many people voted?Did they already vote?Was their vote recorded properly?Did their vote reflect their intention?How can we audit it all later, easily and quickly?Can we trust that audit?And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.There\u2019s also the little problem of counting those votes accurately. Even in 2017, that\u2019s fraught with error, subject to the the honesty of the vote counters and the checks and balances in the systems to prevent fraud. We also have proprietary voting machines that we can\u2019t publicly audit or trust, where countless failures in the chain of custody of the machine could see the votes altered.Blockchains can change all that by ensuring that votes are provably correct and publicly auditable.What we\u2019ll see in the not too distant future is the merger of what\u2019s called E2E voting systems (end-to-end verifiable voting, and blockchain-based systems.E2E means that everyone in the entire population, down to the individual voter, can verify the results. Every individual knows his or her vote was recorded accurately and they can check it themselves. They don\u2019t have to trust someone to tell them it was correct like we do today. They can also see that everyone else cast their vote with certainty. But despite this amazing transparency, it still preserves the all-important secrecy of ballots, which prevents coercion and group-think.Today we can\u2019t do any of that (other than keep ballots secret). We can generally attest to the integrity of elections but we can\u2019t prove it, which is why a certain person who won an election recently sometimes claims he won the popular vote by two million. E2E changes that. Politicians may not like it, because they have a stake in being able to say the votes are rigged, but too bad for them, because the rest of us want absolute voting integrity.There are multiple examples of E2E systems in use today, such as Helios developed by Ben Adida of Harvard\u2019s Center for Research on Computation and Society. It\u2019s not ready for the high stakes of a national election yet but it\u2019s been used on the small scale for campus wide votes. Think of these as alpha tests.What about voting on the Internet? That\u2019s where the blockchain comes in. If you can marry an E2E voting system with the efforts behind decentralized identity and reputation systems, you can deliver E2E distributed voting too, aka \u201cInternet voting.\u201d That\u2019s one of the goals of the Cicada project and other decentralized platforms like the recently formed decentralized Digital Identity consortium.Bye, Bye\u00a0EnronWhat else can you do with triple-entry accounting?One of the simplest and most promising use cases is for issuing stock.Let\u2019s say you have a little company that we\u2019ll call Enron. It\u2019s doing tremendously well. You\u2019ve got a million shares of stock, say 10% of the total shares.At least you think you do. You\u2019ve got an official looking piece of paper that says you own a million shares. That\u2019s legit, right? It has a stamp and everything.Except you don\u2019t really, because they were cooking the books or issuing double shares. With today\u2019s double entry systems it\u2019s a security problem to give you access to their books. They live behind the corporate firewall.But triple-entry changes all that. We can issue stock and you can check your stock against the blockchain. Now you don\u2019t need access to their books to verify that you actually have 10%. You can look at the chain, see that there were 10 million shares issued and that you have a million, so you have 10% for realz.That might not stop them from completely cooking the books, but it goes a long way towards stopping lots of financial fraud that\u2019s possible today. When you get stock, you\u2019ll know you didn\u2019t get double-issued stock.Still, even with all that, you might not believe it because Bitcoin and cryptos have a lot of negative press swirling around them, so let\u2019s look at a few of the most common arguments against them, just for kicks.But\u2026But TulipsYou know this story. Bitcoin is a Tulip craze and it has no value. Only fools and computer geeks see it as worthwhile.Photo creditThis is such an asinine comparison. It demonstrates a complete lack of critical thinking. It\u2019s nothing but a knee-jerk opinion formed after casually reading an article or two on Reddit and calling it a day. That\u2019s not thinking. That\u2019s a lazy mental heuristic, a poster child in the Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments.Here\u2019s the deal: Tulips actually had no inherent value. They were just flowers. They were pretty and that was about it.Bitcoin is founding an entirely new method of frictionless transactions, spawning new decentralized app platforms that you\u2019ll be using every day in three to five years.Don\u2019t believe that? Take Status for example. Status just raised $270 million dollars in an ICO to build a Decentralized WeChat. (FYI, it might be a $100 million, as the reporting on this ICO is all over the place.) Now people are right in saying that just because someone raises money doesn\u2019t mean that has any value. You may hate or resent Status and think they suck. Doesn\u2019t matter. But their approach is smart. That means it could very well be successful. The reason is WeChat.WeChat isn\u2019t that well known in the US, but it\u2019s used by 890 million people in China and greater Asia. It started as a chat app but now it\u2019s the ultimate mobile platform, with its plugins powering everything from buying tickets to comparison shopping to finding out how crowded an area is before you go shopping. People in China use it for every aspect of daily life.The only problem is WeChat can\u2019t really spread beyond China because it\u2019s fraught with centralized control by an authoritarian regime. Decentralizing that trust will go a long way to revolutionizing mobile computing and bringing that power to the Western world.WeChat is like Paypal / Slack / Stash / Viber / Facebook / Twitter / eBay / Instagram / Priceline / Hotels.com / Yelp all rolled into one.If you think all ICOs are Ponzi schemes and you can\u2019t see the potential in a decentralized WeChat then you can\u2019t see the potential in much.If Status is successful, that $270 million is going to look like a drop in the bucket.Nerds!But only nerds like cryptos!You mean like when computer geek Jeff Bezos was starting a little company called Amazon to sell books on this thing called the Internet that nobody but nerds understood? I mean there are all these book stores I can go to, why would I need that?Or how about when Steve Jobs and Woz were hacking together a computer in their garage?What the hell is a computer people asked? Only nerds need that.Neither the Internet or computers had much value then. But those pioneers were smart enough to see into the future, projecting out far enough with intellectual curiosity and seeing the potential while people still scoffed at them.That\u2019s what us geeks see in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and blockchain right now, even if others are missing it.But\u2026But It\u2019s\u00a0UnstableYou know this story too. Cryptos are unstable. They can go to nothing overnight. You can lose a lot of money.This argument tells you absolutely zero.Anything can go to nothing over night.Nothing is immune. Not central markets or decentralized ones.Housing crisis anyone?Stock market crash in the 20\u2019s, 80s, 90s?Here\u2019s the Dow Jones over a 100 years to illustrate:Photo creditThat is a long-term trend up. Awesome. But it\u2019s not the whole story.You see those big downward spikes? They\u2019re really smoothed out on this long timeline, but those are times when people lost a lot of money. If you\u2019re in one of those times, it can hurt bad. It looks a lot steeper zoomed in.Let\u2019s take a look. Here\u2019s the zoom in on the 1920\u2019s crash out.Photo creditLooks a lot different from that perspective, right?How about this headline from the 1980\u2019s crash, dubbed Black Monday, when traders came into work to find the market dropped drastically overnight?Photo creditThat\u2019s what trading is. High risk, high reward.But while everyone else is worried about wild swings, traders love it. They know that downward spirals are opportunities while novices cry about market manipulation and unrealistically expect things to go up forever.Bitcoin looks wild in the short term, and it is, but it\u2019s long term trend is up.Investing when everyone else thinks something is worthless, and hanging on tight when everyone else is losing their minds is how it\u2019s done. That\u2019s why Warren Buffet is rich and you\u2019re not. He bought Coke when everyone else though it was going bankrupt. That\u2019s what he does. That\u2019s all he does. He finds good companies that are undervalued and buys them up while others are fleeing.As Rudyard Kipling wrote in his famous poem If:\u201cIf you can keep your head when all about you,Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,But make allowance for their doubting too\u2026Yours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it.\u201dBut\u2026But It\u2019s Backed By\u00a0NothingOne of the biggest and most ridiculous claims against cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum is that they have no inherent value except that we believe they do. I can\u2019t tell you how many times this shows up in comments on any article written on this subject. Read my lips:Nothing has any inherent value except the value we put in it.Well maybe food, water, shelter does, but beyond those basics, what else? Not much. Even gold and diamonds are just some shiny shit we dug out of the ground and we liked it because it shimmers. No real value and barely any utility.Your USD is backed by nothing. It only has value because we all agree it has value.But wait, you say, it\u2019s backed by the US government. Sure, but what\u2019s that really worth in a serious crisis? How\u2019s that working out in Venezuela right now?We tend to think of trust as a fixed trait. It\u2019s not.Trust is a moving concept.If my government was stable for fifty years and then a bunch of morons get elected who do stupid shit, that trust is now worth shit, as is their backing.A backing by a central entity is no guarantee of anything. At multiple points in history, currencies from major industrialized nations have gone into a tailspin despite that backing. Think Germany before WWI, which led directly to WWII.It can even happen here. And it has.J.P. Morgan once bailed out the U.S. Treasury because they were broke.But this is the modern world you say. Nothing like that can happen again.Sure.Last I checked we\u2019re only seventy years out of a war that consumed the planet, cratered multiple economies and currencies and killed 50 million people. That\u2019s barely a picosecond on the grand scale of human time. If you think we\u2019re so evolved since then, as multiple governments across the planet wage war on the post-world war alliances that have bound us together for seventy years, then I don\u2019t know what to say other than you believe in fairy tales about human nature. Human nature is the same dark creature it\u2019s always been and it can turn on us in a second.But wait you say, the USD has inherent power as a store of value and a means of transacting business!But Bitcoin and other cryptos are now more and more valuable every day as they fund companies through ICOs and through the thousands of decentralized apps that companies are building for them right now.Tomorrow they\u2019ll be even more valuable because they\u2019ll power voting, gaming, issuance of shares and even security and reputation banks.That\u2019s a hell of a lot more valuable than just a means to buy Beanie Babies and iPads and Snickers.Oh, and Bitcoin\u2019s long-term trend is up. The US dollar\u2019s long-term trend is down. It bleeds value little by little, slowly eroding your purchasing power like cancer eating away at you for years without you seeing or feeling it. It\u2019s called inflation. One day you will wake up and find your dollar is worth a lot less than it once was because it\u2019s designed to decrease in value over time.Yesterday\u2019s Snickers cost 5 cents. Today it\u2019s $1. Tomorrow it will be $5. Your dollar is still a dollar.Bitcoin and Ethereum are not just any other asset, like gold or silver or stock in a company.They\u2019re shares in an economy.It\u2019s just hard to see right now because it\u2019s a banana republic economy.But in five to ten years, it will be a third-world economy and then a second-world economy and then a first-world economy. And everyone will be wondering, why didn\u2019t I see that coming? I wish I got in back then when everyone was missing the forest for the trees.Imagine buying shares in the United States when the first settlers got here and swindled the Native Americans out of Manhattan.What would those shares be worth today?############################################DISCLAIMER: Be a big boy or girl and make your own decisions about where to put your hard earned money.

And Grigg is vastly more influential in the crypto community, as this video from Balanc3 at Consensys shows. This article should not be seen as taking away from Ian Grigg\u2019s contributions or efforts or ideas. He deserves all the credit in the world. However, I feel that the concept of looking at accounting in three dimensions goes back to Yuji Ijiri in 1989, even if the substance of what he was tracking with that third dimension is different and even if it preceded much of the work that came about with encryption, so I feel it is a fair attribution. However, attribution of ideas is a tricky business because usually when an idea is ready to pop it is sitting out there in the collective unconscious and multiple people hit on it in different ways. As always people are free to disagree with me. Also, if you disagree with this, it\u2019s only one point of many in the article, so try not the throw the baby out with the bath water.

This beginner\u2019s guide should help those who are new to Ethereum to understand the high level differences between the two.ComparisonSimply put, Bitcoin can be described as digital money. Bitcoin has been around for eight years and is used to transfer money from one person to another. It is commonly used as a store of value and has been a critical way for the public to understand the concept of a decentralized digital currency.Ethereum is different than Bitcoin in that it allows for smart contracts which can be described as highly programmable digital money. Imagine automatically sending money from one person to another but only when a certain set of conditions are met. For example an individual wants to purchase a home from another person. Traditionally there are multiple third parties involved in the exchange including lawyers and escrow agents which makes the process unnecessarily slow and expensive. With Ethereum, a piece of code could automatically transfer the home ownership to the buyer and the funds to the seller after a deal is agreed upon without needing a third party to execute on their behalf.The potential for this is incredible! Think of the numerous applications that act as a third party to connect you with others based on some set logic (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, eBay). Many of the centralized systems we use today could be built in a decentralized manner on Ethereum. With Ethereum you can make these transactions trustless which opens up an entire world of decentralized applications. Decentralization is important because it eliminates single points of failure or control. This makes internal collusion and external attacks impractical. Decentralized platforms cut out the middlemen which ultimately leads to lower costs for the user. There are a few decentralized applications I am particularly excited about.IdentityThere are many websites a person can create a digital identity on (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). This is cumbersome to manage and at the end of the day you are not in full control of your information as it is still owned by a centralized entity. With Ethereum you can have a decentralized identity management system like uPort that allows you to be in full control of your data. There is no centralized server that has access to your private data, can get hacked, edit your information, or get shut down.Right now in the US we have credit bureaus (e.g. Experian, TransUnion, Equifax) that other institutions like banks rely on to tell them your credit. Credit bureaus can put certain groups such as international and young people at a disadvantage. Lending Club, a peer to peer lending platform, addresses the problem of traditional financial services relying solely on FICO scores by offering additional data points like home ownership, income, and length of employment. Ethereum applications like uPort can go one step further by allowing you to control your own data, identity, and reputation.Computing Power / StorageConsider all of the spare computing power and storage a regular person might have on their computer. If it is not being used, then why not make it available to someone else? It is a similar concept to renting out a spare bedroom on Airbnb. An added benefit to using a decentralized application is that there are no centralized servers that are prone to censorship.There are several projects in development to allow people to rent spare computing power and storage from those that have it. Filecoin allows people to rent out their computer storage to others and get paid for it. Similarly, Golem allows people to rent out their computing power. Ideas like these are not completely new. Since 2000, Folding@home has allowed volunteers to contribute spare computing power for scientific research at Stanford University. Now this concept can be monetized and applied to other industries, potentially lowering costs.Social MediaAkasha is a decentralized social media platform. There are no centralized servers so no single party has complete control over the content. This means that the platform is resistant to censorship. An added benefit of building a decentralized application for social media on Ethereum is that one can create a system that financially rewards high quality content. This is like Reddit but you can send small amounts of money to the poster instead of upvotes.Rights ManagementDecentralized applications may be used to bring transparency to multiple industries. For example SingularDTV offers an entertainment rights management platform which allows transparent distribution of funds to the creators, investors, crew, actors, and others involved in a project. There is no centralized party which can prevent a certain group from getting access to their funds because the terms are enforced by code. Everyone will get paid according to the terms discussed up front and no third party is needed to mediate.Managing CompaniesA time consuming and often expensive aspect of starting a new company is allocating and managing shares. As companies grow and raise more funds they eventually need to issue and move shares around. Aragon is an example of a promising project that has an easy to use interface for managing the company\u2019s cap table and raising capital.Raising CapitalLastly, one of the major use cases for Ethereum is decentralized fundraising from a global network of investors. Crowdsales lower the barrier to entry for developers working on high risk projects. Since Ethereum launched in July 2015 we have seen unprecedented amounts of funds raised for decentralized applications through crowdsales. Ethereum itself was funded through a crowdsale that raised $18 million in bitcoin and a project called The DAO raised $160 million. Some other notable crowdsales are shown below:Amount raised at time of crowdsale (not implied valuation)For more information about how these tokens work, refer to How to Raise Money on a Blockchain with a Token, Blockchain Token Securities Law Framework, and The difference between App Coins and Protocol Tokens.ResourcesThis post only covered a handful of Ethereum\u2019s countless use cases.

Some ideas are useful to develop them on top of the blockchain technology but there are also many use-cases and ICOs running with use-cases that are far away from the core idea of blockchain technology.Why are people developing centralized technologies where financial assets are dealed from a central party. Is this the sense of blockchain?The core thought of blockchain was to decentralize the traditional cashflow and control of asset transfers and giving the powerr back to the community and the common user. The intention was to regulate everything through the mass of the community and not only one central person or institution.One of the issues now is that people are creating a big commercial business to gain a lot of money through unneccessary use-cases based on the blockchain similar to the 90\u2019s where millions of USD where invested in \u201cInternet Companies\u201d just because they communicated a business model that invloved the internet.PAYSURA wants to develop for our community and to create a real value for everyone.PAYSURA\u200a\u2014\u200aInternational PayReward CoinPAYSURA found a use-case that can be improved enormously using the blockchain technology. If we have a look at traditional customer loyalty & reward systems we notice and realize that plenty of them exist all over the world. People are arguing with the mass of programs and physical cards in their wallets. It is confusing and complicated. It is just annoying.PAYSURA is developing a loyalty and reward system based on the blockchain technology. A loyalty system that will have a real value called\u200a\u2014\u200aInternational PayReward Coin (IPC) -. A loyalty system that will be worldwide available and uniform. A loyalty system without physical cards and without complicated registration. A loyalty system that is secure and protecting personal data.Now many investors and and even the community might say: \u201cThis is done by many. There are a lot of people working on such a loyalty and reward system so what is the individual point of PAYSURA?\u201dPAYSURA is developing a loyalty system with a RewardPool developed and hosted by PAYSURA. In the RewardPool every merchant and private customer can register themselve and merchants are able to open up their own unit and offer products as reward for IPC.But to show a real decentralization and use the real intention of the blockchain-technlogy PAYSURA intends to develop an own blockchain. Currently the system is running on top of the ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token.A smart contract is a nice to have but PAYSURA wants to deliver a decentralized unifrom but still customizable loyalty system based on its blockchain.So what does it mean?PAYSURA will develop a blockchain that will only focus on transactions between merchants and customers. Through this the transaction speed can be much faster and better optimised compared to all other blockchains that are just adapted to the loyalty systems but not focussing on them.The special thing will be that every merchant can develop an individual bonus system\u200a\u2014\u200astill with IPC\u200a\u2014\u200aon top of the blockchain hence it will be possible to keep one uniform loyalty system but with individual program offers by merchants. Through this every merchant will have its own blockchain based loyalty system and using its own customized program and on the other side the customer will be relieved from the mass of traditional loyalty systems that he is facing currently. Such a blockchain will bring a decentralized loyalty system where the merchant will have an individual handling and solving a big issue of all customers.Currently PAYSURA is developing the whole IT Architecture and Concept of the blockchain. In addition to that the development will start.

In making well founded assessments of blockchain and distributed ledger platforms and the value they bring to enterprise, it\u2019s useful to categorize platforms based on their core functionality and characteristics. As blockchains were derived from tenets of cryptography and data configurations, certain functionality can be replicated in a coordinated database system, while other functionality is only feasible in a true blockchain environment.In this article, we\u2019ll assess the foundational business functionalities for the main enterprise facing platforms including Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and R3 Corda in terms of where the software acquires its influence and how the system is overall optimized, whether through traditional distributed systems or a contemporary blockchain basis.Figure 1: Demarcation of Underlying TechnologyIn particular, we\u2019ll focus on three key areas of functionality:Data coordination\u200a\u2014\u200aHow information and trust within a system is better distributed and allocated among stakeholdersCryptoeconomic internal incentive layers\u200a\u2014\u200aHow is a system architected so that different stakeholders and users are motivated based on economic incentives to ensure functionality of a system eg. Game Theory and mechanism design.Integration into the digital commoditization of assets\u200a\u2014\u200aHow the systems can integrate into a digital goods economy. In some nominal characterizations this is known as the token economyMain goals of blockchain: what do businesses want to achieve with this technology?Blockchains such as Ethereum have similar goals to their distributed leger counterparts. Identifying the goal of what businesses hope to achieve using blockchain technology can be a challenging approach, because like the internet in the 1990\u2019s, businesses did not yet know how to conceptualize use of the powerful tool. Similarly today, it is known that blockchain technology is capable of instantiating various functions, though how to architect those functions into a business solution requires further insights and assessments of the underlying capabilities.The three main axes explored\u200a\u2014\u200aprocessing and coordination of data, trusted and immutable records, and digitization of assets\u200a\u2014\u200aare broad enough to encapsulate the primary usability of a blockchain while allowing for further extrapolation of those functions into business scenarios. By discussing these three aspects, it is possible to reveal the meaning behind why a business entity would want to use the technology.Efficient processing and coordination of informationIf improved distributed system design or database coordination is the sole purpose of a protocol or platform, then perhaps a blockchain is not necessarily what is needed. Blockchain platforms have traditionally promoted the concepts of better data coordination and distributed consensus mechanisms in which data is facilitated and transferred through a technology platform. While useful, a significant portion of these desired functional traits can be obtained through better coordination of a central database or improved distributed systems design. In this investigation, it is necessary to determine the extent to which platforms and protocols are trying to optimize existing data coordination functionality versus implementing new blockchain functionality. Blockchains are designed for more than just advanced data coordination.Immutable/trusted record of the products and transactionsThe original thesis around why we need blockchains revolved around the concept of digitizing trust. A theme promoted by Andrew Keys of ConsenSys is that \u201cAs the internet resulted in a digitization of information, blockchains result in the digitization of trust and agreements.\u201d This meaningful thesis embodies the ethos of what blockchains hope to achieve while also paving the way for a further path. The additional variable would be the digitization of value. When value is attached to the trust that is implemented into a system, then certain alignment structures and incentive mechanisms will influence and incentivize proper behaviors within a system, resulting in a robust platform.It is often the case that immutability is used synonymously with trust when designing a system ie because the system is immutable, it is trusted that bad things will not go unpunished. Though in our platform protocol assessment, it is important to also assess the mechanisms behind how a trusted system is implemented to ensure a business model that can be beneficial to users of a platform (further exploration through cryptoeconomics).Digitalization of\u00a0assetsThe digitization of goods and assets is considered a primary goal for most blockchain or distributed ledger platforms. If businesses are looking for a digitization of assets, a distributed ledger or coordination of a database is able to offer some capabilities though much consideration should be put into the accessibility of these digital goods. Because coordinated databases are essentially centrally run or distributed among a group or subgroups of counterparties via a legacy software paradigm, the levels of digitization may be limited based on the freedom that is afford by the digitizing platform. While the concept of digitizing goods sounds like a simple process, the different incentivisation dynamics and economic reasonings around how goods such as real estate, human attention or even electricity are digitized requires significant consideration into what type of platform would be responsible for the digitization as certain vendor platforms do exhibit degrees of \u201cvendor lock-in\u201d and reliance on a centrally managed platform in various instances.Records and registries like titling systems and supply chains are also feasible via a distributed ledger system though their level of interaction with an economic incentive layer is fairly limited if reliant on a closed proprietary system, and a proliferation of those assets into a digital ecosystem or marketplace would be severely stunted if based on closed rails. A free market system that fully utilizes the various facets that the open market is able to provide is necessary to facilitate true digital goods in a constantly developing digital ecosystem.Assessment of database coordination characteristicsDatabase Coordination: CharacteristicsWhile in depth analysis has been performed on the functionalities of these platforms in terms of characteristics like immutability, security, scalability, manageability, and performance, much more can be ascertained through understanding the foundations upon which the architectures are built.Many tools have been invented and implemented for proper data coordination within distributed systems. One example would be heavy emphasis on tools like Hadoop and the various ensembles in this ecosystem including Spark, Hive, and Zookeeper. A reliance on these products show a heavy integration of distributed system tools and protocols. Further parallels can be shown in protocols such as Tendermint, a BPFT consensus engine being designed with similar functionalities as tools like Apache Zookeeper. Internally there has also been research along the lines of event sourcing databases which can replicate several functionalities desired from a coordinated data sharing system.Through assessing tools like Apache Kafka and how the data streaming service is able to achieve significant levels of throughput in an enterprise setting, we can demarcate the functional differences between a blockchain and a distributed ledger based on varying levels of dependency on these database coordination and optimization tools in terms of the foundational concepts. Implementations of Ethereum including Plasma are utilizing tools like MapReduce to augment certain mapping functionalities on top of a UTXO and account based model while also reducing components into merkle proofs, though it is important to realize that the base layer of the protocol is still reliant upon Ethereum as the root blockchain. By decomposing these details, further insight can be obtained on how best to assess technological characteristics of these software platforms.Data Coordination: Platform ComparisonIBM FabricThrough a deep dive into Fabric architecture, it can be determined that the platform has created an intricate development environment focused on allowing superior throughput based on detailed configurations of the software architecture for optimal performance in a distributed systems environment. The movement of chaincode between the client and a network of distributed endorsing peer nodes along with the transaction mechanisms and transfer of receipts that satisfy endorsement policies is effective in the closed system, while the gossip protocol that propagates transactions within private channels allows for the coordination of large datasets. While the infrastructure is robust and capable, additional consideration should be put into the thought process of how the architecture was designed to allow multilateral coordination structures where there may eventually be a factorial of channels involved in a network which can be difficult to manage.Figure 2: Hyperledger Fabric ArchitectureThis figure demonstrates some of the architectural configuration of Fabric and how components are organized into a system designed for advanced information processing and maximum transaction throughput.The main idea is that channels provide opportunities for moving transactions along within the platform. In looking at the architecture, the function of ordering service nodes (OSNs) serve to record transactions in the Apache Kafka ordering service. In the data streaming ecosystem, Kafka is a powerful tool with capabilities of appending various forms of transactions into separate Kafka clusters and eventually partitions.In this setup, data is able to be distributed across clusters to formulate a distributed storage platform that can record the data structures that are sometimes referred to as \u201cblocks\u201d or blobs within the Fabric definition of \u201cstate\u201d in the context of their key/value store configuration. A conceptualization to acknowledge within this software framework is that all of the participants and data structures within this ecosystem are native in that they function primarily alongside other users within this software ecosystem.Figure 3: Apache KafkaSource: Apache\u00a0KafkaFabric does in fact employ a ledger-type substructure that deploys certain hash linked data stores, though it should be recognized that the configuration of the hashes does not follow the original architectural design affiliated with a blockchain system derived from Bitcoin or Ethereum. While data blobs are batched and undergo deliver events to eventually create a hash link of the transactions, it must be understood that this process does not necessarily transition the data into a modification of the system\u2019s state. Rather, the blocks are configured in a way that the information is stored in a database type structure with different instances of hashes.In the Fabric ecosystem, deliver events are called blocks while chaincode goes through deploy events to eventually secure the data within the chainpartitions of the ordering service structure. The configuration of the data-structures and modules of this system are able to allow transaction throughput that would be expected of the distributed database architecture, though it should be acknowledged, that asset-code coordination is still a challenge that has not been completely solved within the Fabric ecosystem as assets and value do not necessarily have a digital representation that can be coordinated within the ledger.R3 CordaR3 Corda is built on an environment that does not claim to a blockchain, but rather a decentralized database that utilizes various forms of structural reconfiguration toward building a system that would primarily be used by banks and other institutions for their processes. The platform borrows heavily from the UTXO model used in bitcoin transactions where state is defined by a series of inputs and outputs and the varying reconfigurations of the inputs can dictate the state of the output.The R3 Corda architectural framework relies upon a nodal structure that is reliant on submodules called notaries that help maintain the validity of a network similar to validator structures in other platforms that abstract the function of consensus. Nodes are accompanied by relational databases that are appended within the data-structures allowing for querying using SQL. Transaction communication is restricted within subprotocols called flows.These flows are comparable to the channel architecture that is seen in IBM Fabric where only individual parties privy to the transactions are able to access the information. Classes undergo transformations that result in state machines called fibers or co-routines. The architecture relies on flows communicating with sub-flows and interacting with libraries of flows that have predefined functions within the confines of the platform. Additionally there is a self contained identity layer within Corda that allows varying degrees of access control within the overall network.While R3 Corda has openly stated that it does not intend to be a blockchain, it should be taken into consideration that the reconfiguration of the concept of a distributed database to a decentralized database does rely fairly significantly upon traditional database systems. While the system is architected around novel data-structures and different compositions of how a distributed system is organized, the platform does have data allocation in mind and does find various ways to optimize the functions of a data distribution system. One thing to keep in mind is that because the system is limited to certain facets of data coordination in the confines of a specific architecture, integration into actual blockchain systems has been sacrificed as modularity and interoperability were not implemented for the original design.Figure 4: R3 Corda WorkflowFigure details: the workflow of transactions within Corda and how Input states and Output states are moved through the system and how documentation is appended into the workflow\u00a0process.EthereumThe Ethereum ecosystem is built from a combination of private blockchain and public blockchain ecosystems. The public chain does not have anywhere near the throughput and data processing capabilities as described in the data coordination context so should not be assessed based on those capabilities. When assessing this aspect of Ethereum, it makes the most sense to synthesize the different nuances of the network topology of private instantiations of Ethereum.The Ethereum Yellow Paper adamantly decrees a set of specifications on what constitutes Ethereum as well as the technical particularization of the code base. Due to this strict adherence to the blueprints of this protocol, forks of Ethereum as well as consortium implementations do resemble the original substrate upon which the technology is built. In fact the same specifications are continuous whether in a proof of work, proof of authority, or proof of stake implementation because the protocols are considered progeny of the same Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) specifications.Modified architectures still specify alignment with the original EVM. Key changes in platforms like Quorum include an alteration of the consensus mechanism, modification of global state roots to accommodate private and public states, alterations of State Patricia Merkle tries, and additional modules to handle private transactions. The architecture allows this software to maintain the lineage and data structures from the original Ethereum configuration while also offering increased transaction throughput via the alterations. In addition to the improved data transaction optimization that Quorum provides, the capability of coordinating and integrating with public Ethereum environments via tools like Plasma, Truebit, and Cosmos provide additional extensibility to the protocol.Through technical evaluations of tools like Plasma and formats of obtaining consensus in Casper, it is apparent that database management tools like MapReduce and Abstract Rewrite Systems will be implemented in Ethereum. In Plasma, MapReduce is an integral part of assembling the coordination of an account based system and a bitmap-UTXO commitment structure of a multichain setup.The orchestrated transaction processing paradigm using the interplay between rootchains, plasma chains, and child chains through a combination of fraud-proof mechanism designs and fidelity bond incentive structures help satisfy dynamics between the block-withholding and mass withdrawal surfaces. It also allows for further cryptoeconomic structures to be filled using mechanisms from systems like Casper or Truebit for mirroring concepts used in erasure coding in terms of the data availability problem that is prevalent in the space. For a multichain architecture, Ethereum would be able to combine the database coordination and throughput capabilities of a distributed database system with the public chain compatible capabilities of an actual blockchain.Database Coordination: ConclusionA viable conclusion regarding the database coordination spectrum of capabilities would be that IBM has superior database management toolsets due to a reliance on traditional database and distributed systems software architecture, based on the overall monolithic design and substantially resource intensive process that went into building Fabric. R3 Corda is still further defining its capabilities, while offering several coordination services to banks and financial institutions in a private reconfiguration of nuances from the bitcoin protocol. Ethereum, while designed for public chain compatibility, does not have the raw database processing capabilities of IBM Fabric, though it does have certain coordination schematics within the context of scalability for enterprise use cases that Fabric does not have.Private instantiations of Ethereum and complementary clients are able to act as the architectural building blocks upon which larger systems can be built, based on modular design that adheres to a comparatively unix-based philosophy. The Ethereum related code bases are designed to rival the transaction throughput capabilities of the database platforms like Fabric while allowing functionality that is nonexistent in both Corda and Fabric, though complementary relationships can also be explored across platforms. The main differentiating factors may be further elucidated from assessments of the subsequent factors.Cryptoeconomic Configurations of Blockchain PlatformsA cryptoeconomic subsystem inside of a software platform requires various configurations of mechanism design and game theory that would exist to incentivize actors to behave in the most optimal manner that is both beneficial to their own self interest as well as the interest of the ecosystem. A core tenet that distinguishes blockchain ecosystems from distributed ledger-designed database systems is the capability to use mechanism design as an economic incentive layer that ensures proper allocation of trust and cooperation to make a system behave in a way that is conducive towards instantiating decentralized consensus among users as well as security. The main goal of these systems which rely on a \u201creverse game theory\u201d design is to create a dominant strategy within a subsystem that results in an incentivized equilibrium structure that further strengthens the overall integrity of the whole system.Examples of Cryptoeconomic Mechanism DesignPlasma &\u00a0TruebitPlasma was designed to bring scalability and multichain capabilities to the Ethereum network. By providing the catalyst upon which multiple blockchains of the Ethereum lineage can communicate with each other, Plasma acts as a viable bridge between private blockchain and public blockchain networks. From further analysis, it is apparent that Plasma offers both scalability and availability to the Ethereum network.Though to understand the effectiveness of plasma, it is important to understand the mechanics upon which Plasma was designed. A significant amount of the interoperability is achieved through what are known as fraud proofs. By configuring blockchains so that derived sub-blockchains (or child blockchains) can still reliably validate transactions, based on computations from the MapReduce functions, scalability can be achieved with minimized trust.A mechanism was designed around Plasma to allow for what are called Mass Exists when faulty chains are discovered. These situations pertaining to faulty actions are related to inconsistencies in data availability and block withholding attacks. By allowing a mechanism where nefarious activity can be punished through alternating configurations of the interrelated chains, the ecosystem hopes to instantiate a cohesive equilibrium for how entities interact.Plasma shares quite a bit of influence from a heavily cryptoeconomic incentive structure focused platform called Truebit which was designed to increase the offchain computational capabilities of the Ethereum network. By architecting the Truebit system around a verification game in which Solvers of the overall consensus mechanism can be challenged by Verifiers which obtain a reward if they identify a nefarious counterparty, an internal cryptoeconomic \u201cchecks and balances\u201d of the system is created to incentive a dominant strategy of behaving fairly. As Plasma through the influence of TrueBit is focused on creating a multichain interoperability network, the internal enforcement of the system is paramount toward achieving information and consensus fidelity.As seen in the figure below, the cryptoeconomic game involved in Truebit and derived into Plasma includes counterbalancing interactions between solvers and challengers to verify the correctness of computation towards eventually being verified on chain. Challengers are incentivized to constantly challenge due to forced errors that guarantee a payout if solved correctly.Figure 5: Cryptoeconomic DesignEthereum Casper Proof of\u00a0StakeAn example of cryptoeconomic incentive layers can also be seen in Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof of stake consensus mechanism via implementations of Casper. While proof of work has its own internalized game theoretical incentive structure to dissuade participants from commandeering the network, the transition to proof of stake has even further internal structures for disincentivizing participants from equivocating or trying to create alternative instances of the blockchain when encountering forks. The staking protocol creates a Byzantine Fault Tolerant environment where Ether would be bonded into the consensus mechanism. What this means is that individuals would be bound by a fidelity bond to behave honorably within the system.If an attacker were planning to equivocate or try to assume control within the consensus mechanism, various protocols pertaining to \u201cslasher algorithms\u201dwould destroy the Ether holdings or bonds of the attacker, hence punishing them for their nefarious actions. In the mechanism design behind the punishments, the amount of Ether destroyed is consistently programmed to be proportioned to the amount that an attacker wished to gain in which the equilibrium achieved is one where the attacker would never want to compromise the system in the first place.Cosmos and TendermintCosmos is also building an ecosystem that relies on the Tendermint consensus mechanism that relies heavily upon Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithms. The platform depends on validators that have similar roles as miners in the bitcoin network. The validators have staking tokens called Atoms which are used to secure the network via a proof of stake mechanism that relies upon the trust generated by the bonded validators. The interplay between the players in the ecosystem is also indicative of a game theoretical structure where validators can lose their tokens or the tokens delegated to them if discovered to be violating the protocol. Due to this bonded deposit design of stakeholders within this system, the consensus mechanism allows for an incentivization mechanism that secures the network. This security design allows for the proper functioning of the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI), the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) as well as the varying interactions between the Cosmos hub and zones.R3 Corda & IBM\u00a0FabricAn important note to recognize is that R3 Corda and Hyperledger Fabric do not have these cryptoeconomic incentive layers instantiated within their software architectures. Due to the fact that the software architectures are foundationally designed based on distributed database focused paradigms, they were not originally designed for the incorporation of native cryptocurrency layers within the overall framework. And because of this inherent difference in design of the software, they are not yet calibrated to be able to take part in multi-chain ecosystems where there is interoperability and coordination with a multitude of blockchains. Because the systems are structured with maximum throughput in mind, architectural layouts for an interoperable network topology with blockchains including the public blockchain mainnets were overlooked based on the initial construction of these systems.Why is cryptoeconomic mechanism design necessary?One may ask why a cryptoeconomic infrastructure layer is necessary in software design. What this paradigm creates is a new layer of trust and immutability that can exist within a computing environment without relying on a centralized entity. We have been building software in a particular client server and database architecture for decades. Companies like IBM, Intel, and Oracle have already perfected this model along with the systems and subsystems that were created subsequent to the initial creation, and these models are still being used within distributed system architectures as well as newly labeled distributed ledger systems. Though these systems are still centralized in various aspects, whether through a central entity or a cartel-like consortium structure in which incentives are aligned based on inherent reliance on a centralized entity as opposed to a genuine incentive structure to ensure the proper functioning of the system.Figure 6: Client Server\u00a0ModelA decentralized system allows viable alternative pathways toward achieving certain goals within a software environment. The main tradeoffs that are highlighted within this interchange would be trust vs execution. Because a large centralized system is better trusted, it is considered to be capable of better execution. Though what blockchain systems hope to instill are the characteristics of a system in which trust and value can be reallocated without reliance on a large centralized entity.One idea that is championed within certain facets of system design is that in order to optimize a system, it is necessary to also suboptimize the subsystems. What this means is that the coordination of a system must be orchestrated and architected so that internal subsystems also have a stake or incentivization mechanism within the overall larger ecosystem, to further achieve cooperative goals. By creating a cryptoeconomic game theoretic approach towards this optimization of the overall environment, a confluence of both computer science and economic models can be created allowing for the creation of new software architectures that can be envisioned within the digital economy.Based on this visioning of a digital economy it should be recognized that the use of a combination of private blockchains and public blockchains that can interoperate is what will create a viable digital ecosystem where various layers of commerce and business relationships can emerge, and develop beyond what is possible in legacy technological configurations.Integration into a Blockchain Token\u00a0EconomyFor the purpose of this investigation, it is necessary to define the concept of tokenization. The concept borrows from the notion that businesses or entities are able to create fungible or non fungible representations of various forms of assets, commodities and services based on certain digital standards that currently exist in our ecosystem.While the token economy is still developing, its important to distinguish that the first wave of products will initially have various failures and flaws that require time and iteration to perfect. Even though the tokenization of assets, financial products, energy and digital attention are all viable business models, the exact dynamic that they are implemented upon require additional layers of functionality and access that will only be improved upon with time. A successful token economy will be the resultant artifact created from significant developments and discoveries that are being made in game theoretical mechanism design and blockchain innovations.As described in Josh Stark\u2019s article on cryptoeconomics, the tokens that exhibit the strongest signs of usability are evaluated on whether they form a necessary component within the economics and game theory design of the overall business. If a business can digitize or tokenize various facets of its ecosystem, the lines of products that can be created expand exponentially beyond our traditional means of exchanging physical goods, financial assets, commodities, or technological services. By creating the digital medium upon which tokenized assets can come to fruition, significant developments can evolve from the new ecosystem.In viewing the ecosystem of blockchain tools, it is apparent that Ethereum is in fact the substrate upon which the token economy can be built upon. And if the token economy model is able to incorporate the functions of private blockchains, scalability solutions and privacy tools like ZK-Snarks, the overall tokenization of digital assets will overshadow the current capabilities upon which our economic models are limited to due to inherent restrictions in organizational feasibilities.Achieving Business Goals of BlockchainIn order to achieve the mentioned business goals of the blockchain, we must assess the various avenues that need to be serviced. In an overview of the chart detailing capabilities of the mentioned models, Ethereum is able to service the Distributed Database Coordination scenario as well as the additional functions while R3 Corda and IBM Fabric have not yet chosen to touch upon those layers of functionality.In the context of business use-cases, we overlay the different functionalities discussed on top of real world business scenarios to better understand the capabilities of the platforms.Figure 7: Summary of CapabilitiesEfficient allocation of informationFunctionally speaking, the products are similarly matched from the viewpoint of database coordination and utilization of distributed systems. R3 Corda, IBM Fabric, and enterprise versions of Ethereum do in fact have distributed information allocation features that can facilitate the allocation of information via different layers of access control and consortium configurations of governance. While each platform is different in terms of its software architectural configuration, each one is able to execute the necessary performance on efficient information allocation and coordination.Trusted immutable informationImmutability has been used somewhat as a synonymous concept to trust in the context of a lot of these technologies. In assessing the immutability characteristics it must be understood that within an ecosystem that utilizes a Apache based data streaming tools like Kafka, there are inherent capabilities that allow the read/write access to data. Therefore the immutability aspects of IBM Fabric are somewhat limited due to some of the choices made in the system design.For R3 Corda\u2019s UTXO model based system, the aspect of immutability is preserved differently within the overall confines of the system. Due to the overall distributed ledger design of their system, they have established certain facets of trust that can be demonstrated throughout the platform.The layers of trust and immutability established within an Ethereum context are all conceptualized within a subprotocol of public blockchain derived state roots from Patricia Merkle Tries. Due to this preservation of core software paradigms within the ecosystem and a viable connection to the public chain, the Ethereum blockchain and related derivations of Ethereum are able to fully substantiate immutability. Trust gained from this immutability can eventually be attached to a new value system as assets begin to undergo digitization.Digitization of\u00a0assetsIt should be recognized that IBM Fabric is in fact able to create digital assets in the nominal sense as the digitization of an asset is derived from a registry of the product into a digital format. Though the digitization of an asset on Fabric would result in an asset that can only function on systems that use Fabric. This would be equivalent of if an email client was created to only be able to send emails back and forth with people who use the exact same email client, unlike what exists in our current world where a multitude of email clients can all interoperate together.R3 Corda has similar inconsistencies in that users of R3\u2019s platform would be restricted from interacting with other platforms beyond R3 within their overall landscape creating a bit of vendor lock in. Because R3 Corda is focused on mainly bank clientele, it may make sense to have a separate banking software, though it should be noted that users of the platform will be restricted to banking relationships with only the institutions using R3 Corda, and will not be able to seamlessly interoperate with the ecosystem of counterparties that do not use the vendor platform.Because Ethereum is meant to act as an underlying protocol similar to HTTP or TCP/IP in web services, there is no conception of \u201cvendor lock in\u201d to just one builder of Ethereum applications. The trust that can be established via the different facets of the Ethereum blockchain allow for the digitization of global assets that can occur within a new economic system unlike what is currently available. If referring back to the email example, the Ethereum protocol can be perceived as analogous to IMAP or POP3 as universal protocols for accessing email.Ethereum and Ethereum derived protocols are able to act as a blockchain infrastructure upon which companies can build digital assets. Similar to how every company was able to create a website in the late 90\u2019s using HTML for the scaffolding of the web page, every company will be able to create digital economies for their services and products using Ethereum smart contracts that can create tokens which will be accessible by a broader network.The Road\u00a0AheadIn order to have a robust enough platform that can interact with public markets, the system must be able to satisfy business requirements that allow for efficient processing of data, additional layers of trust allocation, and an ability to represent assets in a developing digital economy. It is apparent that all three platforms aim to achieve similar goals though through different avenues in terms of technological advancements and utilization of technical configurations.In the road ahead, we must consider where we see economic business models evolving in this developing ecosystem, and it is apparent that Ethereum based platforms have an advantage on the true integration into a digital economy, though have apparent weaknesses in some of the data transaction throughput functions that IBM Fabric and R3 Corda can excel in. As different blockchain and distributed ledger platforms are iterated upon and transcend beyond the capabilities that exist in our current technological zeitgeist, decisions around which platform to use to build upon will fall heavily upon the direction of the use cases in our ecosystem, and I see different types of use cases layered upon each other.This document does not aim to say one platform is overall better than another platform, rather aims to stipulate that the platforms are inherently different from each other. Ethereum has certain functionality that distributed ledgers like Fabric and Corda do not have while Fabric and Corda have performance capabilities that Ethereum currently is not able to achieve to the same extent.In order to truly achieve the level of interaction and scalability that is desired by our existing systems, a protocol must be built and designed with all interactions in mind, similar to how the internet was first designed. Ethereum as a protocol, is able to act as the foundational technology stack that services a broad enough ecosystem to encompass the necessary factors in an economic environment, though keep in mind, the platform is currently incomplete and could also benefit from some of the capabilities inherent in the DLT counterparts.While the road ahead will include technologies that have not yet been perfected, protocols should be examined on how closely they will eventually replicate the degrees of functionality that we hope to see in the next generation of the internet and sometimes the the most apparent solution is not to focus on only one technology.Useful Links:Ethereum WhitepaperGrid+ on\u00a0PlasmaTruebit WhitepaperPlasma WhitepaperPublic & Permissioned BlockchainsData availability & Erasure\u00a0coding", "responses": "15"}, {"title": "MEDIA Protocol And Blockchain Security\u200a\u2014\u200aPart\u00a08", "author_name": "MEDIA Protocol", "link": "https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsm/media-protocol-and-blockchain-security-part-8-4cff66779feb?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 28, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "1.91K", "content": "MEDIA Protocol And Blockchain Security\u200a\u2014\u200aPart\u00a08MEDIA ProtocolBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 28, 2018The team here at MEDIA Protocol are deeply committed to creating a more direct, transparent and secure ecosystem for content creators, publishers, and consumers through the revolutionary application of blockchain technology.

By seizing more than 50% of the locations, these malicious actors can stop payments between users by refusing to confirm the transactions.More troubling, they can also reverse transactions, leading to double-spending. This is essentially counterfeiting, allowing the same tokens to be used more than once. Preventing this kind of counterfeiting is a key rationale behind blockchain, because it devalues the cryptocurrency.It is practically impossible to generate new coins out of thin air, so there would be no inflation as such. But, if this type of attack succeeds, it would massively undermine confidence in that network.Why These Attacks Are\u00a0RareMounting the attack would take considerable resources, at great cost. This is likely to significantly outweigh any profit that could be made from the attack.Even larger governments would struggle to corral the computing power necessary to launch an attack of this nature, making it even less likely for private individuals.Moves To Counter These\u00a0AttacksEthereum is in the process of moving from the existing PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm to a PoS(Proof of Stake) model, via the \u2018friendly\u2019 Casper protocol which combines both.This moves the validation of transactions, and blocks, away from the algorithm model (where the miners supplying computational power are simply offering their resources), to one where the miners have a financial stake in accurately verifying the data.It becomes less about contributing power, and more about the wealth backing it. So any attempts to double-spend or approve bogus transactions means that those miners will lose their financial stake.Are We\u00a0Safe?While 51% attacks are a credible threat, the actors capable of committing them are very limited by the cost and resources required. This makes the likelihood very low.Additionally, Ethereum and other networks are taking preventative and defensive measures as outlined above, making the blockchain more secure from these types of attacks.For other security aspects of blockchain technology, check out the rest of our Blockchain Education Programme below.Read All Parts In Our Blockchain Education Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain: Is It Secure?Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Apply To Cyber Security?Part 3\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Create Transparency?Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Blockchain Ensures That No-One Can Impersonate The Owner Of An AddressPart 5\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Ways Of Handling Real-world Identity On The BlockchainPart 6\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat Sybil Attacks Are And Possible MitigationsPart 7\u200a\u2014\u200aImproved Confidentiality and Data IntegrityPart 8\u200a\u2014\u200a49%/51% Attack (This article above)You May Also Be Interested In Our Blockchain Marketing Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact Of Blockchain On Marketing: VolumePart 2\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: VelocityPart 3\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Variety\u00a0Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: VeracityFor more information regarding MEDIA Protocol find us on our social channels below:Website: www.mediaprotocol.orgFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MEDIAProtocolTwitter: https://twitter.com/MEDIA_ProtocolLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/media-protocol/Telegram: https://t.me/Media_Protocol_Community and https://t.me/MP_AnnouncementsMedium: https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsmYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MEDIAProtocol", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Learn to securely share files on the blockchain with\u00a0IPFS!", "author_name": "Coral Health", "link": "https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/learn-to-securely-share-files-on-the-blockchain-with-ipfs-219ee47df54c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 20, 2018", "readtime": "10 min read", "upvotes": "3.7K", "content": "Learn to securely share files on the blockchain with\u00a0IPFS!Coral HealthBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 20, 2018If you have any questions about the following tutorial or want to request a future tutorial, join our Telegram chat!

The blockchain provides a democratized trust and validation protocol that has already disrupted banking and is on the verge of overhauling healthcare, financial services, social apps and more.However, from a technological perspective, the blockchain is not without its warts. Current proof of work consensus mechanisms have slowed transaction speeds to near crippling levels. Waiting for Bitcoin transactions to complete makes the platform nearly unusable to some and Cryptokitties almost brought the Ethereum network to a grinding halt.This makes storing data or large files on the blockchain a non-starter. If the blockchain can barely sustain small strings of text that simply record a balance transfer between two parties, how on earth are we ever going to store large files or images on the blockchain? Are we just going to have to be OK with limiting the utility of the blockchain to things that can only be captured in tiny text strings?Enter IPFSThe most promising solution that\u2019s available today is IPFS, or Interplanetary File System, created by the folks at Protocol Labs. It\u2019s a peer-to-peer protocol where each node stores a collection of hashed files. A client who wants to retrieve any of those files enjoys access to a nice abstraction layer where it simply needs to call the hash of the file it wants. IPFS then combs through the nodes and supplies the client with the file.You can think of it as being similar to BitTorrent. It\u2019s a decentralized way of storing and referring to files but gives you more control and refers to files by hashes, allowing for much richer programmatic interactions.Here are some simple diagrams so you can see the workflow of IPFS.John wants to upload a PDF file to IPFSHe puts his PDF file in his working directoryHe tells IPFS he wants to add this file, which generates a hash of the file (you can tell it\u2019s IPFS because the hash always starts with Qm\u2026)His file is available on the IPFS networkNow suppose John wants to share this file with his colleague Mary through IPFS. He simply tells Mary the hash from Step 3 above. Then steps 1\u20134 above just work in reverse for Mary. All Mary needs to do is call the hash from IPFS and she gets a copy of the PDF file. Pretty cool.Security HoleThere is an obvious security hole here. As long as anyone has the hash of the PDF file, they can retrieve it from IPFS. So sensitive files are not well suited for IPFS in their native states. Unless we do something to these files, sharing sensitive files like health records or images is a poor fit for IPFS.Enter Asymmetric EncryptionLuckily, we have tools at our disposable that pair very nicely with IPFS to secure files before uploading them to IPFS. Asymmetric encryption allows us to encrypt a file with the public key of the intended recipient so that only they can decrypt it when they retrieve it with IPFS. A malicious party who retrieves the file from IPFS can\u2019t do anything with it since they can\u2019t decrypt it. For this tutorial we\u2019ll be using GPG for asymmetric encryption.Let\u2019s edit our workflow diagram a bit so we include encryption and decryption:John wants to upload a PDF file to IPFS but only give Mary accessHe puts his PDF file in his working directory and encrypts it with Mary\u2019s public keyHe tells IPFS he wants to add this encrypted file, which generates a hash of the encrypted fileHis encrypted file is available on the IPFS networkMary can retrieve it and decrypt the file since she owns the associated private key of the public key that was used to encrypt the fileA malicious party cannot decrypt the file because they lack Mary\u2019s private keyThe BlockchainSo where does the blockchain fit into this? Before we go on, we encourage you to read our popular post: Code your own blockchain in less than 200 lines of Go!Of particular importance is this diagram:From \u201cCode your own blockchain in less than 200 lines of\u00a0Go\u201dPay attention to the BPM part. This kind of simple text recording is all the blockchain can really handle today. This is why cryptocurrencies are a good fit for the blockchain. All you need to record is the sender, recipient and amount of Bitcoin (or Ether, etc.) being transferred. Because all these hashes need to be calculated and verified to preserve integrity of the chain, the blockchain is horrible, absolutely horrible at storing files or large amounts of data in a block.This is why IPFS is so powerful when coupled with the blockchain. Instead of BPM above, we simply store the hash of the IPFS file! This is really cool stuff. We keep the simplicity of data that\u2019s required on the blockchain but we get to enjoy the file storage and decentralized peer-to-peer properties of IPFS! It\u2019s the best of both worlds. Since we also added security with asymmetric encryption (GPG), we have a very elegant way of \u201cstoring\u201d, encrypting, and sharing large data and files on the blockchain.Revised block\u00a0diagramA real world application would be storing referents to our health or lab records in each block. When we get a new lab result, we simply create a new block that refers to an encrypted image or PDF of our lab result that sits in IPFS.Enough talk already. Show me how to do\u00a0this!In this tutorial we will do the following:Set up GPGSet up IPFSEncrypt a file with someone else\u2019s public keyUpload the encrypted file to IPFSDownload the file from another computer (or Virtual Machine) and make sure only the privileged party can decrypt and view itThings you\u2019ll needA second computer or a Virtual Machine instance. The second computer simulates a person with whom you want to securely share your files.A test file. We recommend downloading this, which is a sample PDF lab result. This is the exact type of sensitive, personal data we need to protect and since we\u2019re a healthcare company, it\u2019s a nice example. Put this file in your working directory.That\u2019s it! Let\u2019s get started.SetupGPGLet\u2019s download GPG on both our main and secondary computers.Follow the instructions in this article for your OS. On Mac, the easiest way is to open your terminal and brew install gnupg assuming Homebrew is installed.Generate a key on each of your computers after GPG installation. Use the following steps:gpg --gen-key and follow the prompts and pick the default options. Make sure to securely remember or store the password you choose for your username and email.You\u2019ll get to a stage where gpg asks you to do some random things to generate entropy. I just typed a bunch of random characters until the process was finished.Success messageAfter the key has been generated on the second computer, we need to add that key to the keyring of the first computer, so we can encrypt files that only the second computer can decrypt.Export your public key on your second computer into an armored blob using the email address you chose when creating the keygpg --export --armor -email > pubkey.ascMove the pubkey.asc file you just created to your first computer. Make sure to do this securely. A USB stick is better than sending it over email.Once the pubkey.asc file is on your first computer and your working directory, import it into your keyring like thisgpg --import pubkey.ascYou can check to see it was imported correctly with gpg --list-keys. My second computer\u2019s name was Cory Heath and it shows up correctly:Great! We\u2019re done with GPG setup. Let\u2019s move onto IPFS.IPFSFollow the instructions to download and install IPFS for your OS here for both computers. Once you\u2019ve done that, initialize IPFS with ipfs init on both computers and start your daemon with ipfs daemon on both computers:Nice! We\u2019ve set everything up. Let\u2019s get to encrypting and uploading our PDF file to IPFS.EncryptionRemember the sample lab result we downloaded earlier? Make sure to move that to your working directory on your first computer.Let\u2019s encrypt that file (I renamed it myriad.pdf since the lab result was produced by Myriad Genetics) using the public key of the 2nd computer (in my case, named Cory Heath).gpg --encrypt --recipient \"Cory Heath\" myriad.pdfIf you check your directory now with ls you\u2019ll see a new encrypted file named myriad.pdf.gpgOnly your second computer can decrypt and see this file. Try it! Email it to another friend and try as they might, they won\u2019t be able to open it! Even if they rename it back to myriad.pdfWe\u2019ve got our encrypted file now. Let\u2019s upload it to IPFS!Uploading to\u00a0IPFSTo upload to IPFS, all we need to do on our first computer isipfs add myriad.pdf.gpgWe get an output like this:The Qm... string is the hash of the file. You can send this to your friend or anyone to whom you wish to give access so they can download it from IPFS.Let\u2019s just double check to make sure our file is available on IPFS with ipfs pin lsHighlighted hashYou can see the hash of our file is indeed present and now available on IPFS!Downloading from\u00a0IPFSLet\u2019s now switch to our second computer. Remember, we are simulating a second person. To make this more realistic, swap in the second computer throughout this tutorial with a friend!In our case, instead of a second computer we\u2019re using a Ubuntu VM with Vagrant. This is not a requirement.On your second computer, download the posted encrypted file from your first computer from IPFS using the same hash:ipfs get QmYqSCWuzG8Cyo4MFQzqKcC14ct4ybAWyrAc9qzdJaFYTLThis is what it should look like when successfully downloaded:DecryptionSince we\u2019re on our second computer, and this encrypted file was encrypted with the second computer\u2019s public key, in theory we should be able to decrypt and view this file without any issues.Let\u2019s give it a try.Decrypt the downloaded file and let\u2019s rename it to myriad.pdfgpg --decrypt QmYqSCWuzG8Cyo4MFQzqKcC14ct4ybAWyrAc9qzdJaFYTL > myriad.pdfMoment of truth:Let\u2019s open this file and if all went well we should be able to see it on our second computer.open myriad.pdfTADA! We successfully downloaded, decrypted and opened our file which was stored fully encrypted on IPFS, protected from anyone who shouldn\u2019t have access!Recap and Next\u00a0StepsGive yourself a pat on the back. What we just accomplished is incredibly powerful and addresses some key issues found in blockchain technology today.Let\u2019s do a quick review of what we did:Recognized that the blockchain is pretty bad at storing large volumes of data and filesGot IPFS up and running, connected to the networkSecured sensitive files using GPG and stored them on IPFSUnderstood hashing in IPFS and how we can store the hashes on the blockchain to combine the strengths of the blockchain with distributed file storageWhere you take what you learned here is completely up to you. There are many places to branch off from this. Consider deploying these examples to live servers to act as your own IPFS nodes to store important files. The drawback to IPFS is that if your files aren\u2019t very popular, when you stop your node, your file is gone from the IPFS network. You can prevent this by spinning up cloud servers to act as their own IPFS nodes, so you can host them yourself until more nodes become interested in your files and start storing them.Check out our previous \u201cCode your own blockchain\u201d tutorials, Parts 1\u00a0, 2 and 3 and 4. Once you\u2019ve gone through those, try integrating IPFS and blockchain with your own large, encrypted files. You can also learn about Byzantine fault tolerance, Turing completeness and other advanced blockchain concepts here.

We\u2019re here to connect the worlds of marketing and technology for everyone\u2019s benefit.We\u2019ve got love for both worlds, but from our own experience we know that they can sometimes feel, literally, worlds apart. So we\u2019re committed, not just to connecting them, but to creating a common understanding between them.This series of articles aims to explain the relationship between marketing and blockchain to help everyone\u200a\u2014\u200athe marketeers, the technologists, and the content consumers\u200a\u2014\u200aunderstand the principles behind this game-changing technology.We want to help educate by demystifying the potential applications of blockchain technology.

After Volume, the next tentpole of Big Data is Velocity.These days, not only are businesses having to handle an unprecedented amount of data, they are having to do so at speed. With new information arriving and changing at a relentless rate, it is becoming ever more important to find ways to manage it all in a timely fashion.In a global, increasingly mobile marketplace, there\u2019s no downtime. Customers no longer have to wait to be at their desk or at home to shop, read and browse. When an idea strikes, their smartphone gives them the immediacy, accessibility, portability, connectivity, and interactivity required to action it.Data continually flows in, day and night, and with it come new customer demands and the need for a real-time response.What Challenges Does This Pose For Marketing?The biggest challenge is the increased pressure that Big Data puts on responsiveness. Gone is the luxury of waiting just for office hours, or taking long stretches of time to come up with new products or services to keep the customer happy. Consumers no longer accept this.One particular area of focus is being able to track user behaviour in order to offer near-instant recommendations. This can be based on what they\u2019ve just purchased, or the recommended products that show up on the next page they browse.What this means is that increasingly, marketing will require useful apps that can keep up with the pace of mobile-generated customer data, and have the built-in processes to respond to that.How Does Blockchain Facilitate This?Every transaction on the blockchain has a digital footprint, making it much easier to track trends and patterns. These help explain user behaviour and formulate a speedy response to it.The crucial attributes of blockchain data being both secure and traceable make it trustworthy\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can use that information right away without having to verify or quantify it first.Blockchain is not reliant on any centralised resource to store or move data. The distributed nature of the system means it\u2019s constantly ready and able to move huge amounts of data to where it\u2019s needed at very high speeds. This gives you the speed of response required to match your customers\u2019 needs.Where Else Do Blockchain And Marketing Overlap?Velocity demands responding to the customers as quickly as they interact with you in the first place. Keeping pace is key.Having looked at how blockchain helps companies handle the Big Data demands of Volume and Velocity, we next turn our attention to Variety.Read All Parts In Our Blockchain Marketing Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact Of Blockchain On Marketing: VolumePart 2\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Velocity (This article above)Part 3\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Variety Coming SoonPart 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Veracity Coming SoonYou May Also Be Interested In Our Blockchain Education Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain: Is It Secure?Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Apply To Cyber Security?Part 3\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Create Transparency?Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Blockchain Ensures That No-One Can Impersonate The Owner Of An AddressPart 5\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Ways Of Handling Real-world Identity On The BlockchainPart 6\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat Sybil Attacks Are And Possible MitigationsPart 7\u200a\u2014\u200aImproved Confidentiality and Data IntegrityFor more information regarding MEDIA Protocol find us on our social channels below:Website: www.mediaprotocol.orgFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MEDIAProtocolTwitter: https://twitter.com/MEDIA_ProtocolLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/media-protocol/Telegram: https://t.me/Media_Protocol_Community and https://t.me/MP_AnnouncementsMedium: https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsmYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MEDIAProtocol", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "Blockchain for non-techies: 2.

As an emerging technology, blockchain is on a typical journey to maturity and mainstream adoption.Anthony BackBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 5, 2018Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency have been on a wild ride since 2008. Epic booms, busts, wild swings, scams and a lack of real-world implementation have led many to dismiss the technology as overhyped and valueless.But a closer look at the last decade reveals blockchain has thus far had a typical journey for an emerging technology on the road to maturity and adoption. A journey that\u2019s evident in the rise of many other innovative and game-changing technologies.The Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies was first published in 1995 and is somewhat of an institution in high tech. It proposed a standard adoption model and process for new technologies on their path to becoming a mature technology.Here are descriptions of each stage direct from Gartner.Innovation trigger\u200a\u2014\u200aA potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.Peak of inflated expectations\u200a\u2014\u200aEarly publicity produces a number of success stories\u200a\u2014\u200aoften accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; many do not.Trough of disillusionment\u200a\u2014\u200aInterest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.Slope of enlightenment\u200a\u2014\u200aMore instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.Plateu of productivity\u200a\u2014\u200aMainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology\u2019s broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off.Blockchain\u2019s Innovation Trigger\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Bitcoin WhitepaperBlockchain technology\u2019s innovation trigger came in the form of a white paper written by a mysterious figure in 2008 named Satoshi Nakamoto. The white paper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System shared the workings for a new digital currency system that didn\u2019t rely on banks to facilitate transactions or governments to create and disseminate the currency. Although the proposed bitcoin payment system was exciting, it was the mechanics of how it worked that was truly revolutionary. As it turned out, the main technical innovation was not actually the digital currency itself but the technology that lay behind it, known today as blockchain.In the following few years after the white paper is released, word begins to spread amongst technology insiders, businesses and at conferences. These years also witnessed the birth of altcoins such as Namecoin, Litecoin, OpenCoin (Ripple) and other more privacy-focused coins like DASH, Monero, and ZCash.Peak of Inflated Expectations\u200a\u2014\u200aICOs, Lambos &\u00a0FOMOThe peak of inflated expectations arguably started with the rise of Ethereum in 2014 but reached crazy levels in 2017 where market mania and speculation took over. Pure speculation led token and coin prices to go through the roof. The Bitcoin price hit just under USD 20,000 a rise of around 1900% from the beginning of 2017 while the price of Ethereum with all its technological constraints remaining unsolved rose 13,000%.You may remember this guy.It was the advent of Ethereum back in 2014 that ultimately enabled the explosion of new projects and coins and the subsequent mania. Developers had for the first time a platform to build and deploy other decentralized applications but Ethereum also gave birth to a new fundraising mechanism called an Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), which sent the cryptosphere to the peak of inflated heights.Overall, the period of time from 2014\u20132017 saw expectations reach unprecedented levels with hundreds of startups and tokens being created, some seemingly overnight, and billions of dollars invested in projects with little promise. The vast majority of projects have since failed to gain traction and many have also been exposed as scams taking advantage of the euphoric and unrealistic expectations of the public.Talk of the potentially revolutionary nature of blockchain technology hit its peak and expanded to a larger segment of the population and business community. Blockchain technology was idealized as a panacea to every known problem in the world and became the hot topic in the tech and business community. Some corporations, like the Long Island Iced Tea Corp., merely renamed themselves to include the word blockchain and witnessed their share price soar 289%.Of course, during this time, a few success stories emerged as well and established multinational companies in banking, insurance, healthcare, and many others industries began to take legitimate steps to develop solutions. Enterprises started a more in-depth exploration of the technology through consortiums and R&D initiatives and some produced working prototypes and tested the technology in the real world.Trough of disillusionment\u200a\u2014\u200a2018\u2019s reality\u00a0checkThis is where blockchain and crypto are now. 2018 has been a dramatic year with general sentiment now one of skepticism and caution. Prices have dropped significantly, projects are failing at high rates and people are unsure whether the technical issues impacting adoption such as scalability and usability can be overcome. Real-world use cases are still being defined and publicly available blockchain solutions are relatively few in number when compared to the technology\u2019s level of hype.According to Gartner, blockchain technology is officially entering the trough of disillusionment. And there\u2019s plenty of evidence to suggest this is correct.Huge price\u00a0dropsAt the end of 2017, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of USD 19,783. At the time of writing, it sits at around USD 6300. Ethereum\u2019s price has experienced a total decline of approximately 76% in 2018, according to data from CoinDesk. The same goes for most other altcoins. A large number of investors have lost a lot of money which has, in turn, dragged down disillusionment and spread negative sentiment even further.Projects are failing, ICOs aren\u2019t fashionable & funding has dried\u00a0upThe failure rate of ICOs has skyrocketed in 2018, some research indicating that well over 50% of ICOs fail and do so rather quickly. It\u2019s become much harder for projects to raise funding as there is now widespread skepticism around scams and the potential for meaningful ROIs on ICOs. Even blockchain startups that have managed to navigate the market downturn are struggling and have needed to go back to the drawing board.The overall view, especially among the retail investor community toward ICOs and blockchain projects is now one of distrust. There is also a far greater acknowledgment of the speculative, risky and dangerous nature of these types of ventures.Enterprises slow at delivering on blockchain initiativesDue to a variety of technological, regulatory and cost-related reasons, only a small portion of enterprises have delivered real-world blockchain driven products and services. R&D initiatives and moving beyond PoC to the pilot stage is proving slow and difficult. Some enterprises have even shelved their blockchain related efforts sighting regulatory and market uncertainty as well as a knowledge gap.What\u2019s coming next\u200a\u2014\u200aPromising signs of\u00a0maturityAccording to Gartner\u2019s 2018 Hype Cycle, blockchain technology is entering the trough of disillusionment stage. Precisely how long this will last is unknown, however, the average length of the trough ranges for emerging technologies is from two to four years. Some rapidly moving innovations mature much faster, only suffering from a slump of six to twelve months.Of course, there are no guarantees that emerging technologies will make it out of the trough of disillusionment stage of the Hype Cycle. There are many examples of technologies that have failed to catch fire like Ultrawideband and RSS Enterprise. Other emerging technologies like Speech Recognition have taken decades longer than expected to reach full maturity.There are good signs that blockchain technology will not be added to this list. In fact, the technology could be further along the Hype Cycle than Gartner has concluded. Blockchain is showing signs that are usually associated with an emerging technology in the Slope of Enlightenment stage.Companies improving products on the basis of early feedback.More instances of how the technology can benefit enterprises start to crystallize and become more widely understood and used.More enterprises funding pilots.Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers.The reputation of the technology rising again.Banks and Wall Street are warming\u00a0upThere are signs that banks will soon be more open to partnering with projects to help with their day to day operations. The Swiss Bankers Association has issued guidelines to banks that wish to do business with startups and The Monetary Authority of Singapore has said it is willing to help cryptocurrency companies secure banking services by bringing the banks and cryptocurrency startups together to reach an understanding.Some of the biggest names on Wall Street are warming up to trading Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as well. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, Goldman Sachs has started registering clients for its new Bitcoin trading desk, and over 70 of the largest banks have joined in an unprecedented move to adopt blockchain based payments systems. The Australian Securities Exchange and the Vanguard Group are well on their way to implementing blockchain in 2018 after successful pilots. These are just a few examples.More enterprises are funding pilots and moving into productionBlockchain has grabbed the attention of enterprises in a wide range of industries. After a long period of R&D, major enterprises are moving beyond pilots toward production. IBM alone is working with hundreds of enterprises on blockchain implementations. The latest tally is that there have been tens of thousands of blockchain pilots run within corporations, some of which are moving into full implementation.Cypherium, developed by former software developers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tencent has released a beta version of its enterprise blockchain ready for use in the wild. There\u2019s also the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) made up of 30 members including Ford, Renault, BMW, GM, Bosch, IBM, Hyperledger and IOTA which is developing standards, pilot projects, and open source software tools. Most major Fortune 500 companies, from insurance and finance to retail and manufacturing are developing pilots and real-world services using blockchain technology.Regulatory advancementsThe regulatory landscape is shifting and advancing. Regulators in many countries are taking real steps to crack down on scams, and are also producing research papers, standards and introducing new regulations.One of the first countries to begin building a regulatory framework for blockchain projects was Switzerland. The country has proposed an idea for minimizing regulations while still keeping companies in line with legislation through \u2018sandboxes\u2019 which allow startups to experiment and innovate within controlled conditions.Britain and Singapore have been exploring their blockchain and crypto regulatory environment as well, providing a platform which enables companies to experiment under relaxed regulation and licensing requirements. The upper house of the UK Parliament has also published an inquiry on crypto-assets and the G20, EU, and many other bodies are all actively investigating the implementation of new regulations that will spur innovation in the blockchain sector. In the US, the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office recently launched the most comprehensive study on exchanges.A rise of enterprise custodial products and\u00a0servicesCustody solutions have begun to emerge which is expected to catalyze the entry of institutional capital into the industry. Coinbase has announced its Coinbase Custody product upon completion of their first successful deposit. The multinational investment bank, Citigroup, has announced that it will offer crypto custody solutions to institutional investors. Citigroup launched a product called Digital Asset Receipt, which is intended for institutional investors to securely invest in cryptocurrencies in a fully regulated and secure manner.There\u2019s also BitGo, a leader in cryptocurrency security. The BitGo Trust Company has been approved by the South Dakota Division of Banking as a public South Dakota Trust Company, making it the first qualified custodian purpose-built for storing digital assets.Third-generation blockchains are\u00a0emergingBlockchain innovation is moving quickly. Bitcoin represented the first generation of blockchains, Ethereum the second and although it\u2019s early days, there is now a new breed of 3rd generation blockchains actively working to solve some of the technological limitations of their predecessors. These platforms are tackling significant inhibitors of usability and mainstream adoption and have better scalability, interoperability, treasury systems, and on-chain governance. Ethereum is also pursuing and implementing major improvements and overhauls to their platform.Universities have added blockchain to their curriculumAs demand for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology-related jobs increases, demand for education and courses in these areas is reaching new highs. As a result, universities and schools are starting to offer different specializations in blockchain and cryptocurrencies. According to new research conducted by Coinbase and research firm Qriously, 42% of the world\u2019s top 50 universities now offer at least one course on crypto or blockchain.What does this mean for enterprises and investors?The Hype Cycle is a model developed by Gartner to understand how emerging technologies rise, behave and grow on the journey to maturity.If you\u2019re part of an enterprise thinking about utilizing blockchain to optimize and transform business operations or an investor seeking investment opportunities, the Hype Cycle can be quite useful.It should not be interpreted as gospel, or solely relied on, but enterprises and investors can use it as a guide to help decide when to act (invest/develop) alongside other due diligence. It can also assist in analyzing risks and managing expectations.For example, investors with a low-risk appetite might want to wait until an emerging technology is more proven and mature, toward the end stages of the cycle. An investor or enterprise with a high-risk appetite that is looking for big rewards could, for example, make investments right after a technology breakthrough has just been made, during the peak of inflated expectations or at the beginning of the trough of disillusionment. In the blockchain and crypto world, this would be the equivalent of making investments in the immediate years following the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper leading up to the peak in 2017 and arguably throughout 2018 as well.Of course, investing too late or too early both come with risks. Too late and you risk being left behind competitors or even wholly disrupted. Too early, and there is a significant risk of losing money as immature technologies yield little results and markets are not ready.At the end of the day, every organization and investor has their own risk appetite, but this should not completely dictate their actions. This is especially true for transformational technologies like blockchain.\u201cIf an organization operates exclusively within its comfort zone, it will miss opportunities. It will always tend to adopt everything early, or late, in line with its enterprise personality. Organizations should recognize their risk comfort zones, but be prepared to step outside them depending on the strategic importance of an innovation.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aGartnerAs the blockchain ecosystem suffers through a downturn, it is also showing clear signs that it will overcome challenges and continue to mature. It\u2019s arguably the best time for enterprises, and investors to act. This does not necessarily mean investing millions of dollars tomorrow morning. What\u2019s important now is to at least invest in education so to understand:How potentially valuable blockchain technology is to you or your organization.How the technology is impacting your industry.Where the technology is currently positioned on the Hype Cycle and the associated pros and cons.Final thoughts\u200a\u2014\u200aDon\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwaterNobody really knows precisely when blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will mature and reach mainstream adoption. Some experts have said this will happen in 2020/2021, while others point to 2025 as a more realistic timeframe.What is becoming clearer, however, is that blockchain technology is on track to become a transformative and disruptive force. Yes, market conditions and sentiment are bad, there are many average projects out there, and some critical technological shortcomings still need to be overcome. But there are good projects and initiatives too, building great products and services and actively solving these issues.If you zoom out a bit, get some perspective and put the current market into context, you\u2019ll realize that blockchain is on a rather typical journey to maturity and mainstream adoption.", "responses": "17"}, {"title": "Why Aren\u2019t More People Investing in Blockchain?", "author_name": "FST Network", "link": "https://medium.com/fstnetwork/why-arent-more-people-investing-in-blockchain-8db3489206e8?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 1, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "5.5K", "content": "Why Aren\u2019t More People Investing in Blockchain?FST NetworkBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 1, 2018It\u2019s no secret that blockchain technology is one of the most revolutionary innovations of our lifetime. The potential rooted in blockchain in terms of the number of industries it can disrupt and all of the problems it can solve is enormous.Yet, relative to other industries, not that many people are active in the blockchain community at the moment, whether through trading or learning about the landscape more generally. Without mainstream adoption of blockchain technology, the landscape will be unable to achieve its full potential, and could run the risk of remaining a novelty as opposed to attaining global acceptance. There are many factors that contribute to this issue, but here are a handful of them that stand out the most and how to solve them.Market VolatilityOne of the primary reasons more people don\u2019t get involved in blockchain is the unpredictable, volatile nature of the market as a whole. The value of a coin could be $1,000 one day, and drop to $400 the next day. This certainly doesn\u2019t put the minds of potential traders at ease when they are considering investing their hard-earned money into cryptocurrency. That being said, the issue here is more of a catch-22 than it is anything else because the low liquidity of the market as a whole which is causing this problem actually stems from a low number of individuals buying and selling in a marketplace. When an industry has a low volume of buyers and sellers, one event could cause the value to drastically rise or fall without warning. For example, a single Tweet from a well-known blockchain influencer could make the value of a coin drop significantly.The way to solve the volatility of cryptocurrency is simple: get more people buying and selling within the space, including large scale institutions such as hedge funds or investment banks. That is one of the problems we\u2019re helping to solve here at FundersToken. By enabling individuals and businesses to become tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain, regardless of whether or not they can effectively code, we are ramping up mainstream adoption of blockchain as a whole. In turn, this will help solve the liquidity problem so common in cryptocurrency.A Lack of UnderstandingAnother contributing factor to the low number of people being active in the blockchain ecosystem is simply a lack of understanding of the space in general. This is understandable given how technical and engineering-focused the landscape currently is. If we were to speak in terms common to the business world, we could say blockchain isn\u2019t that \u201cuser-friendly\u201d. For those who aren\u2019t as technically proficient as the next person, the underlying concept of intangible assets holding value can be pretty difficult to effectively explain.If you are interested in learning the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of blockchain, check out Coindesk for a number of digestible guides on the industry as well as daily news related to the field. Once you get acquainted with the basic concepts and can speak the \u201clanguage\u201d of blockchain, comprehending even the most complex topics will be quite easy.Not Seeing The Value In Learning About ItAnother contributing factor to the low number of people involved in blockchain is them not seeing the true value of the technology. While this certainly ties in with having a general lack of knowledge of the industry as discussed in the point above, there are a couple of compelling reasons why the blockchain ecosystem will benefit entrepreneurs and professionals. The first is that it will cut out the middlemen who come in between you and your customers, resulting in lower trading fees.The second is that being tokenized also caters to consumer psychology because it makes your customers feel like they are a part of a dynamic community tied to your brand as opposed to only buying your goods and services. By having a specific token your customers can use to purchase your various products, they are much more likely to become loyal to your brand, increasing the lifetime value of that customer.The High Cost and Difficulty of TokenizationAs it currently stands, becoming a tokenized business is an extremely difficult endeavor both logistically and financially. Hiring a programmer to develop smart contracts to be used on the Ethereum blockchain alone can cost your business tens of thousands of dollars to complete. On top of that, because the technology is so new, it\u2019s tough to differentiate between amateur developers and competent ones, so there\u2019s no guarantee your smart contract will come out operating the way you would have liked it to in the first place.There is a large amount of hurdles that have hindered a rapid and widespread adoption of blockchain technology. From a lack of knowledge to the exclusive nature of the industry to the market\u2019s volatility, we are far from where we want to be as a community. Here at FundersToken, we are determined to help expedite this process by simplifying the entire process of tokenization, campaign management, marketing your coin and much more.

Some see it as today\u2019s version of Willy, the Mt Gox trading bot that manipulated Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2013/14. Most of the analysis has focused on off-chain dynamics: Tether\u2019s lack of a banking partner, its split from its auditor, the ownership relationship vis-a-vis Bitfinex, etc.Because Tether is a blockchain token, signals can be derived from the on-chain data as well. My partner Edwin Ong and I have been collecting and analyzing data on different blockchains (including Ethereum usage) for some time, and we recently took a closer look at Tether.Tether Blockchain BackgroundFirst, a primer on how Tether\u2019s blockchain works: Tether is a token issued on the Omni Layer (\u201cMastercoin\u201d to old-school blockchain enthusiasts), a platform that enables the creation of new assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.Every Omni transaction (and thus Tether transaction) is recorded in a Bitcoin transaction sharing the same transaction hash. For example, this BTC transaction is actually the sending of 50,000 USDT\u00a0.To date, Tether has \u201cissued\u201d 2.22 billion USDT tokens on the Omni network. (Separately, Tether has also \u201cauthorized\u201d 60M USDT ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network.)The hockey stick graph of Tether\u2019s token supply over\u00a0timeWhile other coins do run on Omni, Tether is the largest tenant by far, with over 75% of Omni\u2019s transactions ever and over 95% of its transactions in January. At this point, Omni is effectively a Tether blockchain.Tether accounts for the vast majority of Omni\u2019s transactionsDespite its age, the Omni ecosystem is relatively sparse. Many of the repos on Omni team\u2019s Github are very much a work in progress. The primary user-facing tool is https://omniexplorer.info, a block explorer that is today mostly used to track USDT movement, especially by users from Binance and Remitano (a Vietnamese exchange that is now a top website in that country).OmniExplorer referral traffic. (via SimilarWeb)Prior to splitting with Tether, the auditor Friedman LLP wrote that it\u201cutilized the Omniexplorer.info website to trace that the balance per the Omniexplorer.info website matches the information provided by the Client.\u201dEven the carefully thought out TetherReport relied on collections of \u201c500 sequential transactions pulled from OmniExplorer.\u201dOur ApproachWhile OmniExplorer is useful, there is no substitute for primary data when it comes to blockchain analysis. To collect Omni data, we ran full nodes of Omnicore and synced them to our data toolchain.Transaction TrendsWe first looked at Tether\u2019s transaction trends. Unsurprisingly, the big picture is what you might expect: both the number of transactions and the aggregate value of transactions have skyrocketed in recent months.The aggregate value of Tether transactions nearly doubled each of the past 3\u00a0months.To put the transaction data in perspective, we looked at Tether from the MV=PQ lens framed by Chris Burniske:Average daily supply in 2017 =    273,374,613 (M)Total 2017 transaction value = 14,963,834,982 (PQ)V = PQ / M = 14,963,834,982 / 273,374,613 = 54.73Tether\u2019s velocity of 54.7 is about 10 times higher than that of the M1 money supply. (Of course, speculation is typically not included in money circulation calculation.) Regardless, users sure love moving Tethers! So, who are they?Tether Users\u00a0To answer the user questions, we mapped out different distributions of Tether usage by addresses, and created lists of the most frequent and the biggest Tether senders.Tether\u2019s biggest s[p]endersThe #1 most frequent user, with its iconic address 1Po1oWkD2LmodfkBYiAktwh76vkF93LKnh, is the exchange Poloniex, sending over 2B USDT (nearly Tether\u2019s entire supply!) over 111K transactions, averaging nearly 19K USDT per transaction. Clearly, with their high number of transactions, it\u2019s obvious that the busiest addresses are exchange wallets.Tether\u2019s busiest\u00a0sendersThe biggest senders list looks a little different. The #1 sender is 1KYiKJEfdJtap9QX2v9BXJMpz2SfU4pgZw, Bitfinex\u2019s account (per Tether), sending nearly 5B USDT over 38K transactions, averaging nearly ~130K USDT per transaction, a lot higher than Poloniex\u2019s 19K per transaction.Some of these other big senders are not as busy. 1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz is Tether\u2019s new \u201ctreasury account\u201d after the November hack, distributing 1.7B of newly printed USDT in 31 transactions, mostly to 1KYiKJEfdJtap9QX2v9BXJMpz2SfU4pgZw (Bitfinex). 1HckjUpRGcrrRAtFaaCAUaGjsPx9oYmLaZ (the Chinese platform Huobi) averages 12.6M USDT per transaction over 62 sends!Recycle12.6M is a lot of Tethers per transaction. It turns out that in Huobi\u2019s case, the transactions are all to the same recipient.Those are some big numbers per transaction!Our tool lets us easily track the interactions between any 2 addresses, so we can see that Huobi\u2019s address has been sending those tens of millions everyday to 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D, another Huobi address.This other Huobi address maintains a nearly 50/50 split in terms of aggregate amount sent and received.This Huobi address maintains an almost 50/50 sent/received ratioThis 50/50 split is hardly atypical for Tether addresses. There are many more who maintain this ratio, whether they transact frequently (like 16bUGjvunVp7LqygLHrTvHyvbvfeuRCWAh) or not (like 1MMZ5QNzARpn7kvf2aj4UzViALP9j84Ufi).What this suggests is that many Tether addresses are simply being used to cycle funds from entities to entities. Thus, the high token velocity should be discounted for such use cases.Address RelationshipsWe also mapped out relationships between distinct addresses, focusing on relationships between addresses that transact together often and addresses that transact large numbers of USDT together.Some of these addresses love sending Tethers to their favorite receivers many many\u00a0timesBitfinex\u2019s dominance in Tether is absolutely clear from examining these interactions. 1KYiKJEfdJtap9QX2v9BXJMpz2SfU4pgZw alone is involved in 22 of the top 50 highest-valued \u201crelationships.\u201dOne of Bitfinex\u2019s addresses dominates the \u201cHighest Valued Relationships\u201d chartBy mapping out these relationships on Tether\u2019s blockchain and following a few degrees of separation, we have been able to track and in some cases correlate capital flow, especially in combination with other blockchain and market data.Balance DistributionAnother area we examined was the distribution of USDT holdings amongst addresses. Tether.to\u2019s top 20 addresses is a popular page, and we are adding a top 100 list to the mix. While blockchain address distribution can hardly be conclusive given the ease of new address generation, the data can still be informative.In Tether\u2019s case, the top 200 addresses out of Tether\u2019s nearly 100K active addresses hold over 2B USDT. Yes, the top 0.2% owns over 90% of the token\u2019s total supply. This is more than double BTC\u2019s wealth concentration.Data DownloadWe believe that on-chain data, in combination with network metrics, ultimately provides the best understanding of the vibrancy and health of any blockchain. They will matter as much tomorrow as DAUs and ARPUs do today.Given the dearth of easily downloadable on-chain data for Tether, we are publicly releasing the entirety of Tether\u2019s transaction data up to block 507015.This dataset is a little bigger than what Google Sheets or Excel can easily handle, so storing the data in a database or data warehouse might make analysis more pleasant. A graph database can be useful if you want to follow the \u201csocial graph\u201d of the addresses. If you are just interested in high-level trends, you can also browse the data we have published on Blockspur.Tether\u2019s blockchain data has answered a few of our questions and raised some new ones, and we are excited to hear if they can provide new insights for you. If you have specific questions about using the data or about this post in general, please contact us and we\u2019d be happy to share our perspectives.Thanks to Brian Schroeder, Gordon Wilson, and Remy Hathaway for feedback.

And although our vision of million-user DApps on Ethereum has not changed, our understanding of what we need to do to get there has.And what we\u2019ve realized is, not only do we think a game will be the FIRST \u201ckiller DApp\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abut we think games will actually be THE KEY to onboarding millions of new users onto Ethereum and acquiring their first cryptocurrency.By the end of this post, I hope you\u2019ll not only have a better understanding of why we\u2019ve been pouring so many of our team resources into a game and its marketplace, but also agree that games are simply THE best path the blockchain industry has toward hitting mainstream adoption in the immediate future.The next big thing will start out looking like a\u00a0toy.\u2013Chris DixonReady? Then let\u2019s dive in.To start off with, we need to talk about an inconvenient truth\u2026Blockchains Don\u2019t Just Have a Scaling Problem\u200a\u2014\u200aThey Have a USER ADOPTION\u00a0Problem.When we first started Loom Network one year ago, everyone was talking about scalability.It seemed like everyone was just waiting around for an Ethereum scaling solution to come along\u200a\u2014\u200athen once that was solved, we would magically see a Cambrian explosion in large-scale blockchain applications.But\u2026What we\u2019ve come to realize since starting this project is that scalability is actually not the biggest problem Ethereum faces.User adoption is.User Adoption: How Close Are We to One Million\u00a0Users?Let\u2019s look at some numbers.Below is a snapshot of the number of Daily Active Users (DAU) in the past 24 hours of THE MOST POPULAR applications on Ethereum:Daily Active Users (DAU) of the most popular Ethereum DApps on Sept 20, 2018. Taken from dapp.review.The first interesting thing to notice here is that the most actively used DApps fall largely into three major categories:DEX / Marketplace: IDEX, ForkDelta, etc.Gaming: CryptoKitties, Etheremon, etc.Gambling / Casino: 333ETH, DailyDivs, etc.But the second, and more important thing to\u00a0notice:Currently, even the two most popular DApps on Ethereum have only one or two thousand Daily Active\u00a0Users.If you add up ALL the 100+ active DApps on dapp.review combined, it\u2019s still less than 10,000 users in total who are interacting with an Ethereum DApp on a given day.For context and comparison, Facebook has around 1.4 billion DAU, and Twitter 157 million. PUBG Mobile, just one mobile game out of thousands, has 10 million DAU.The largest DApps on Ethereum are still TINY in the grand scheme of\u00a0things.This is not meant to disparage Ethereum (which I previously opined will be the backbone of Web 3.0), or to marginalize the work being done by the teams who created these DApps. These teams are pioneers who are pushing the envelope with what is currently possible.My main point in bringing up these numbers is to emphasize the fact that currently with less than 10,000 daily users between all Ethereum DApps combined, we are still very, very far from mainstream adoption.Major Roadblocks Toward Mainstream AdoptionScalability aside, there are two major problems preventing blockchain applications from gaining mainstream popularity:Lack of \u201ckiller DApps\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aapplications that are good enough to incentivize millions of users to really want to use them.Friction\u200a\u2014\u200aUX issues that make DApps significantly harder to use than their centralized counterparts. (Users must first acquire ETH from an exchange, then install Metamask, then transfer the ETH to Metamask, then sign a transaction and pay a gas fee for EVERY action inside the DApp\u2026 etc.)These two factors can be tied together using something called the Fogg Behavior Model, which is often used in marketing circles to optimize conversion rates for a particular desired user action. (E.g. Downloading your application, signing up for a free trial of your SaaS, or purchasing your product).The Fogg Behavior\u00a0ModelThe Fogg Behavior Model: When something is hard to do, only the most motivated users will end up taking action. The red arrow shows us where blockchain applications currently fall\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh friction, and low adoption by a small group of highly motivated users.For those of you who see mathy stuff and are already recoiling in horror, don\u2019t worry.What the graph above basically says is this:If your application is difficult to use, it will filter out all but the most motivated users.And the easier your application is to use\u200a\u2014\u200athe more casual users will be willing to give it a try on a\u00a0whim.In short, if we want to get millions of users using DApps, we have two\u00a0options:Reduce friction as much as possible, by improving the UX of blockchain applications until they\u2019re just as easy to use as regular applications.Build more \u201ckiller apps\u201d on the blockchain that appeal to millions of strongly motivated users.Now, you could view this as an \u201ceither/or\u201d approach to solving the problem.But here at Loom Network, we don\u2019t like to pussyfoot around and do things half-assed \ud83d\ude09So we decided, \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna do both of \u2018em.\u201dI\u2019ma call it, \u201cLoomy\u2019s 2-step program to blockchain mass adoption.\u201d \ud83d\ude0eAllow Loomy to explain.Step 1: Reduce Friction\u200a\u2014\u200aMake Blockchain Applications Just as Easy to Use as their Centralized Counterparts.Scalability aside, this has been our major focus at Loom Network over the past year.Using DPoS sidechains to Ethereum, we\u2019ve been able to build user-facing DApps that actually look and feel identical to traditional applications, yet still have the benefits of running on the blockchain.What do I mean?You can try for yourself at DelegateCall.com.

It looks and feels exactly like Quora, or any other web app.Or take the game we\u2019re building, Zombie Battleground.Our alpha users can download the game from the app store onto their mobile devices, and it looks and feels exactly like any other mobile game.Yet there is no centralized server and the entire game runs on the blockchain.To the end user, Zombie Battleground looks and feels like any other mobile game. The fact that the whole game takes place 100% on the blockchain is totally transparent to the end\u00a0user.We\u2019re still constantly working on improving parts of the UX even further\u200a\u2014\u200aand making it even easier for other developers to build DApps just like this on the Loom SDK.But we\u2019re basically already there: we\u2019ve successfully built multiple DApps with a totally fluid UX.With the Loom SDK, it is now possible to build DApps that are just as easy to use as traditional applications, massively reducing UX friction and opening the gateway for mainstream adoption.But Loomy ain\u2019t done yet!Step 2: Build DApps that appeal to a group of MILLIONS of motivated usersSo now that we\u2019ve solved the UX issues that have traditionally made DApps difficult to use, that means millions of users are going to suddenly flow in and start using them yesterday, right?Not so fast.Those of you reading this are the cool kids. We\u2019re the early adopters.We philosophically believe to the core that blockchain applications represent something revolutionary, and for us, the word \u201cdecentralization\u201d is enough to get us all excited and giddy and blabbering maniacally to anyone within earshot who happens to make eye contact.But for the majority of mainstream users, this isn\u2019t the case.They might conceptually understand why decentralized apps are better. But simply saying, \u201cIt\u2019s Facebook\u200a\u2014\u200abut decentralized!\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to be a strong enough value proposition to get people to jump ship from a centralized Facebook that, despite its many shortcomings, more or less works just fine.For the majority of mainstream users, the promise of decentralization, in itself, is not enough.So what kind of DApps can we build that we know millions of people DO care enough to\u00a0use?Why, I\u2019m glad you asked!Because the answer here is\u200a\u2014\u200ayou guessed it\u200a\u2014\u200agames.Games: The Missing\u00a0LinkPeter Thiel has famously said that to build a successful startup, you need to solve some problem 10x better than any other existing service.That\u2019s really hard to do. And it\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen any \u201ckiller DApps\u201d yet.We\u2019re still waiting for the next great visionary to come along and show us what the blockchain allows us to do 10x better than any centralized service\u200a\u2014\u200aor what it enables that has never been possible before.Keep in mind we\u2019re still in the super early days of the technology. In 1994, people still had no idea wtf this \u201cInternet\u201d thing was and how significant of an impact it would have on the world we live in.So just like it would have been hilariously wrong to write off the Internet in 1994, it would likewise be foolish to write off Ethereum just because it\u2019s been around for 3 years now and we\u2019re still waiting for that killer DApp.But while we\u2019re waiting\u200a\u2014\u200ain the meantime we have\u00a0games.Games are unique among applications, in that users don\u2019t need to be strongly incentivized to download and play a new game.A game doesn\u2019t need to be 10x better than any game that came before it. As long as the game is marketed well and looks somewhat fun, there\u2019s a huge user base (2.2 billion gamers worldwide) willing to give it a try, even paying money to do so (1.0 billion paying users).According to one survey:40.6% of gamers download 2\u20133 new games per year.27.3% download one game per month.12.4% download one game per week.4.4% download new games every single day.4.4% of 2.2 billion is 96 million users.That means there\u2019s an audience of 96 million hyper-active gamers who are downloading and trying 300+ games every single year.Games, unlike apps, don\u2019t have to do something 10x better than any previous app and convince users to jump ship. Gamers are always looking for new fun games each month, and will try them on a\u00a0whim.And the Blockchain DOES Bring Benefits to Online\u00a0GamingWith the friction removed from the DApp onboarding experience, gamers will be able to download games like Zombie Battleground on the app store and start playing them without even knowing what the blockchain is.But the thing is, the game being on the blockchain does bring benefits to the end user that most people aren\u2019t aware of yet.Benefits like:True ownership of in-game items that players can buy and sell freely, enabling robust in-game economies.Provable and auditable item scarcity and fairness in drop rates.Infinite modability\u200a\u2014\u200agames can be built that allow developers to build and upload their own alternate game modes for all players to use. Developers can actually modify and extend server-side logic, allowing for infinitely expandable game worlds driven entirely by community development.Pretty cool stuff.But simply put\u200a\u2014\u200awhen you spend money to buy an item in a game, it\u2019s pretty obvious that you would want to be able to do whatever you want with it, including selling it to someone else.If nothing else, when you quit the game, you could sell all your items to another player to make back some of the money you invested\u200a\u2014\u200ajust like you could with a physical card game like Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh.The only reason online games don\u2019t currently enable this is because limiting the resale of items allows game companies to maximize profits by forcing every single player to buy the same item directly from the company.Gamers are starting to get fed up with game companies\u2019 cash-grabbing tactics. No one wants to spend their hard-earned dollars on game items that they can\u2019t resell to other players and don\u2019t really\u00a0own.Companies preventing players from reselling items they paid money for is clearly a bad deal from the players\u2019 perspective\u200a\u2014\u200abut players put up with it because there\u2019s currently no alternative.The ability to truly own and freely resell their items is a benefit many gamers don\u2019t even know they want yet. But after they experience it, they may come to demand it from all games they play in the\u00a0future.In this way, we can naturally introduce millions of people to the blockchain.After they\u2019re hooked on the game, they\u2019ll learn they can sell their items for real money. With a properly-designed game economy, some players may even be able to make a lot of money.And not surprisingly, users who are earning real money will have a lot more motivation to learn about the blockchain and its benefits.In Fogg\u2019s model, we\u2019re getting them onboarded with as low friction as possible, and slowly increasing their motivation to want to do well in the game\u200a\u2014\u200athen with that higher motivation, we get them to take the next step into using the advanced blockchain features.And after experiencing it, they may even come to demand in-game assets be stored on the blockchain from all games in the future.Games: The Trojan Horse to Cryptocurrency Mass\u00a0AdoptionWhat\u2019s even cooler here is that games may be the first way millions of users acquire their first cryptocurrency.Crypto on-ramps are currently very limiting and difficult to use.If you\u2019re in the US, you can use something like Coinbase, which is probably as easy as it gets. But even then, you have to link a phone number, scan and send them your passport, link your bank account\u2026Getting set up to buy your first cryptocurrency is cumbersome.But let\u2019s look at what the process might look like with blockchain games.A user downloads a game because it looks fun. They start playing, they get hooked, and 10 hours into the game, BOOM, a monster drops a super rare item.The flow in the game informs them, \u201cHey, did you know you can sell your rare items to other players on our massive P2P marketplace?\u201dThe player heads to the marketplace, which is kind of like a blockchain-based eBay for digital in-game items, and puts their item up for sale\u200a\u2014\u200achoosing whether they want to receive ETH, LOOM, BTC, or a stablecoin like DAI linked to their home country\u2019s currency.Another player pays for it using a cryptocurrency of their choice, and the marketplace\u2019s liquidity network automatically converts it to the seller\u2019s chosen currency.Now the seller has acquired their first cryptocurrency simply by playing a game\u200a\u2014\u200awithout needing to do KYC or even needing to have a bank account.Think of the implications of this for adoption of cryptocurrency worldwide, especially in poorer countries where bank accounts aren\u2019t commonplace.Grinding for rare items in a free-to-play mobile game that can then be sold on a P2P marketplace may be the way millions of users in third-world countries acquire their very first cryptocurrency.These users are now onboarded, familiar with the blockchain and digital ownership, and able to use their cryptocurrency to interact with other game marketplaces and DApps.Games As a Driver For Blockchain TechnologyIt\u2019s not all fun and games\u200a\u2014\u200agames have serious technical requirements.The challenge of building a game fully on the blockchain that can handle hundreds of thousands of concurrent users has forced us to push our technology to its absolute limits.We\u2019ve learned more about the scalability limitations of blockchains and how to overcome them from building a single game than we would have from years of writing technical whitepapers and theorizing.Not only that, but the UX in games has to be really, really good.Games are supposed to be fun, and having a clunky UX totally kills the mood.Nothing makes gamers rage quit like a bad UX.By the end of 2018, we will have totally solved the UX issues faced by blockchain games\u200a\u2014\u200amaking them feel just as seamless as normal mobile\u00a0games.And if we can get the UX that smooth on a mobile game, making it work for traditional web applications will be child\u2019s play.Our focus on building out the infrastructure and UX specifically for games is the challenge that has driven massive innovation in our tech\u200a\u2014\u200aputting us way ahead of the curve.This is technology that can be used to run any type of application on Loom Network\u200a\u2014\u200aso you can think of building our tech for games like stress testing it to run large-scale applications that have the most strenuous requirements.Games as a Key Piece in Our Long-term Strategy: Becoming the Most Widely Utilized Blockchain in ExistenceBlockchain infrastructure projects love to boast about the technology and metrics like TPS (Transactions Per Second).But at the end of the day, the chain that has the most Daily Active Users will win out in the long-term.At Loom Network, we\u2019re not interested in building ghost towns that look impressive on spec sheets. We\u2019re interested in having Loom Chains become some of the most widely utilized blockchains in the world.And we believe being the first application platform to gain 1 million DAU\u200a\u2014\u200aor even 100,000 DAU to start\u200a\u2014\u200ais the best way to show the world what our tech is capable of, securing our place in developers\u2019 minds as the de-facto chain they can trust to deploy their applications.By the way, did we mention assets on Loom chains can be secured by Plasma Cash, providing the full security of Ethereum IN ADDITION to being super-scalable and having a fluid UX? \ud83d\ude09Not only that, but then we\u2019ll also have a strong core audience of passionate users who we can funnel into new games and products.Steam didn\u2019t become the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming out of nowhere\u200a\u2014\u200aValve already had over a million users playing Counter-Strike who they were able to funnel into the Steam platform from day one. And once they had all those users authenticated, other games wanted to launch on Steam because that\u2019s where the user base is.Once you have that ONE core app that onboards a million users, everything compounds on itself and snowballs from there. Thanks, Metcalfe.And for all the reasons detailed above, we think games are the quickest way to get there.Paving the Way for Other Game Companies: Let\u2019s Show Them What\u2019s\u00a0PossibleWe think once gamers experience the benefits of blockchain games, there\u2019s going to be a strong and growing demand\u200a\u2014\u200awhich will lead to an explosion in blockchain games.But right now, all this blockchain stuff is really new. So large companies are unlikely to take the plunge into the unknown, when they already have a profit model that\u2019s working for them.Someone needs to show them a new working model, and demonstrate that there\u2019s REAL DEMAND from users.After we publicly launch Zombie Battleground at the end of this year, we can use it as a case study to get other mobile game studios on board.We can show them a new profit model and a growing hungry user base who wants more\u200a\u2014\u200aand get them to follow suit.And this is why we decided to move forward with building Zombie Battleground ourselves.Rather than continuing to build only infrastructure and waiting for someone else to build a killer DApp, we figured, why not do it ourselves and pave the way?You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\u2013Buckminster FullerAnd that, my friends, is why we have been putting such a large focus on games.What\u2019s Coming: PlasmaChain, Validators and Staking, the Loom Marketplace/DEX, and\u00a0More!If you made it this far, you now have further insight into our core company thesis\u200a\u2014\u200aand how we think the future of the blockchain will unfold\u200a\u2014\u200athan pretty much anyone else in the world.Want a deeper look into what we\u2019re up to?We recently posted an updated roadmap that details everything that\u2019s coming from Loom Network over the next 3 months.Well, not everything\u2026 In typical Loom Network fashion, we have at least one major surprise coming in the next two months \ud83d\ude09And for the gamers among\u00a0you\u2026The public beta of Zombie Battleground is coming by the end of this year, at which point it will be free to download for everyone on the App Store and Google Play.But we\u2019ll have opportunities before that for you to get into the alpha and start buying card packs (and start stocking up on those super-rare Limited Editions!) within the next couple weeks.If you\u2019re interested, head on over to loom.games and sign up for the waiting list. (Just click the \u2018Play Now\u2019 button.)I hope to see you all on the Battleground! \ud83d\ude09", "responses": "19"}, {"title": "After 9 years of blockchain, killer apps\u00a0emerge", "author_name": "CoTrader.com", "link": "https://medium.com/@cotrader.com/after-9-years-of-blockchain-killer-apps-emerge-9fe923cc5ffc?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 4, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "2.9K", "content": "After 9 years of blockchain, killer apps\u00a0emergeCoTrader.comBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 4, 2018Sure, we all know that Bitcoin and Ethereum represent killer apps\u200a\u2014\u200adecentralized money, and a platform for governance, crowdfunding, and decentralized applications (dApps). But what will dApps on Ethereum be good for? Don\u2019t worry, this story has a happy ending.Currently, people invest a lot in infrastructure projects, thinking they\u2019re worth more because, well, they\u2019ve had good returns, and other things might be built upon it. That makes sense. However, infrastructure can also come in the form of dApps that run marketplaces across blockchains platforms, for example. The underlying platforms running the actual marketplace then become less interesting, like which exact flavor of an OS the server, or the client device, uses.Amazon, FB, Instagram, Uber\u200a\u2014\u200aThese aren\u2019t exactly infrastructure projects, though some of their login and other APIs might be considered as infrastructure. These are all marketplaces and networks.When we start to see real, useful blockchain apps, they may likely be marketplaces as well. We\u2019ll take a look at some examples of these in a minute.First, let\u2019s consider a few interesting, but potentially problematic examples of blockchain apps. What do you think of \u201cmedical records on the blockchain\u201d? Would you want your private medical records to be stored on the blockchain forever? Even if encrypted, what if someone posts your private keys? Everyone in the world will have access to some of your most private information, forever. When centralized bodies have your private or copyrighted information, at least not everyone in the world sees it, and you can petition, often successfully, to take down any such material, and suit those that posted it. But once such info is on the blockchain, nobody can help you. The info will be there indefinitely. You took a perfectly good unique key\u200a\u2014\u200ayour DNA, that only you can prove with a sample taken on the spot\u200a\u2014\u200aand reduced it to a digital key that can be stolen to share your private info, with no recourse, for the rest of your biological life.So, if even these at-first captivating blockchain projects pose such threats, what will be the less problematic killer apps of blockchain? What will all these infrastructure projects actually be used for, ever?Let\u2019s start from basics: Blockchain decentralization might makes sense when:You want to disrupt or strengthen central points of friction or failure.You want to know or prove that some information or process is true.https://cotrader.com is a good example fitting this criteria.CoTrader enables anyone to invest together with the best proven investors, or fund managers.This fits our 2 criteria:Anyone can enter either side of the investment funds marketplace, once accessible only to very few privileged people\u2014 that is, anyone can be a CoTraders, and anyone can try their skill and compete as a fund manager.The best fund managers are empowered to prove their past investment performance and fees, and CoTraders know this information is true and tamper-proof.There are a few other killer blockchain applications. These will likely get identified by the top fund managers at CoTrader, who stand to multiply their own gains by allowing CoTraders to invest together with them.To learn more about the live blockchain project that\u2019s out before the ICO, in a rare feat, check out this medium article:Fewer than 0.1% of ICOs ever release a product, but CoTrader is live on Ethereum before its ICOhttps://CoTrader.com has a working product before its ICO.

It\u2019s funny because most people don\u2019t know too much about [the blockchain], but they know it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Smartmatic is hard at work trying to find ways to incorporate blockchain technology into its own offerings.At democracy\u2019s heart lies a set of paradoxes: a delicate interplay of identity and anonymity, secrecy and transparency. To be sure you are eligible to vote and that you do so only once, the authorities need to know who you are. But when it comes time for you to mark a ballot, the government must guarantee your privacy and anonymity. After the fact, it also needs to provide some means for a third party to audit the election, while also preventing you from obtaining definitive proof of your choice, which could lead to vote selling or coercion.Building a system that accomplishes all this at once\u200a\u2014\u200aand does so securely\u200a\u2014\u200ais challenging enough in the physical world. It\u2019s even harder online, as the recent revelation that Russian intelligence operatives compromised voting systems in multiple states makes clear. But that hasn\u2019t stopped tech companies from trying. According to a report by the Wharton School, election administration is said to be a $1 billion per year industry in the United States alone (that\u2019s just for infrastructure and technology). Worldwide, according to industry insiders, the figure is likely between $8 billion and $10 billion. And given the hype around the blockchain, it\u2019s hardly surprising that the top players are turning to the technology in hopes of fortifying their systems and winning the trust of leery officials.Though none would say so openly, they were also staking their claim amid a gold rush that has already transformed teens into millionaires and sleepy iced-tea companies into stock-market juggernauts. In the decade since the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto published an infamous white paper outlining the idea behind bitcoin, a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d based on a mathematical \u201cconsensus mechanism,\u201d more than 1,500 new cryptocurrencies have come into being. The idea has been applied to contracts, record keeping, insurance, fine art, the news media, and cats.Some evangelists even believe the blockchain will power a whole new internet based on a true peer-to-peer architecture that will restore the utopian promise of the web\u2019s early days. Why shouldn\u2019t a system based on \u201ccryptographic proof instead of trust,\u201d as Nakamoto put it, redeem our faith in the democratic process as well?By half past 1:00 on the first day, conference attendees had taken in a keynote, a presentation (\u201cElections in the Cyber Age: How Digital Democracy Is Improving Election Integrity\u201d), and a panel discussion (\u201cBlockchain Technology, Smartphone Apps, E-Voting: What Are the Implications for the Future of Democracy?\u201d); posed for a group picture; and traded war stories over lunch. Through it all, the booth for Votem Inc., one of several vendors offering \u201cinternet voting solutions,\u201d sat unmanned.Pete Martin, president and chief executive of the Cleveland-based online voting company, and his director of testing and certification, David Wallick, had one of those trips: a delayed flight, a missed connection, an improvised rerouting. (The guy dispatched by Facebook appears to have had a similar issue, if that company\u2019s empty display table is any indication.) Fortunately, like all good startups, Votem was agile. Arriving at the hotel just 45 minutes before they were scheduled to lead a blockchain workshop of their own, Martin and Wallick speedwalked to the meeting room, plugged in a laptop, and were ready to make their case, with minutes to spare.Martin, a serial entrepreneur who got his start as a teenage auto-leasing magnate in Cleveland before moving on to custom computer sales and an MBA, planted his feet confidently and fired up his pitch deck as a crowd of 50 or so attendees listened attentively.Voting is \u201cbroken,\u201d he said, as the screen behind him flashed a famous image from 2000 of Florida election officials diligently trying to decipher a voter\u2019s intent from the so-called hanging chad on a mispunched card. For people who have devoted themselves to promoting democratic ideals, it was a cringe-inducing moment.Moving on, Martin talked about the decline of trust in government. He explained how the cycle of fear and doubt can lead to unchecked populism (Brexit, Trump, etc.). He touched on the challenge voters have in accessing polling places and highlighted the issue of low turnout.Several audience members nodded thoughtfully.Martin, 55, who has the look of a high school principal, poised and professional, with a Mitt Romney\u2013esque touch of gray at his temples, first became interested in online voting after selling his fifth company, a B-to-B software consulting firm. Casting around for his next challenge, Martin signed up for an executive summit in Los Angeles. It was led by the serial entrepreneur and futurism guru Peter Diamandis. As part of an exercise designed to identify participants\u2019 \u201cmassively transformative purpose,\u201d Martin recalls, he was asked to write down \u201cwhat I\u2019d do before I die that would positively impact a billion people.\u201dHe stared at a blank sheet of paper for five long minutes. \u201cThen I wrote down the magical words: mobile voting.\u201dThis was December 2014. Martin knew nothing about the election services industry, but no matter. He hired people, bought a small online-voting outfit that had developed its own proprietary software, and before long, turned his commitment into an audacious pledge: By 2025, Martin vowed, 1 billion people would cast a ballot on what would become the Votem platform. So far, he\u2019s up to 8.5 million, which includes a number of small public elections (Montana and the City of Detroit have used Votem\u2019s technology), as well as internal political party votes, union elections, and the recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame fan poll (way to go, Bon Jovi).The real prize, of course, is national elections, which is what brought Martin to Portugal: the chance to run elections for various democracies around the world and one day\u200a\u2014\u200awho knows?\u200a\u2014\u200ahelp select a U.S. president. Martin\u2019s pitch boiled down to internet-based voting via personal devices or on touchscreens in polling places, but with a twist: Votes cast through Votem would be recorded on the blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200adigital, distributed, immutable.At democracy\u2019s heart lies a set of paradoxes: a delicate interplay of identity and anonymity, secrecy and transparency.In the past year or so, explaining the concept of a blockchain has become a cottage industry in itself (check out YouTube). The most helpful formulation I\u2019ve encountered is the one offered by Nathan Heller in the New Yorker, in which he compares the blockchain to a scarf knit with a single ball of yarn. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to remove part of the fabric, or to substitute a swatch, without leaving some trace,\u201d Heller wrote. Typically, blockchains are created by a set of stakeholders working to achieve consensus at every step, so it might be even more apt to picture a knitting collective creating that single scarf together, moving forward only when a majority agrees that a given knot is acceptable.The idea touted by Votem\u200a\u2014\u200aalong with competitors like Voatz (based in Boston), Smartmatic (London), and Polys (Moscow), each of which also sent teams to Portugal\u200a\u2014\u200ais that knitting votes into a blockchain would protect them from tampering, whether from government officials, bumbling bureaucrats, or state-based intelligence operations. Unlike bitcoin, a public blockchain powered by thousands of miners around the world, most voting systems, including Votem\u2019s, employ what\u2019s known as a \u201cpermissioned ledger,\u201d in which a handful of approved groups (political parties, election observers, government entities) would be allowed to validate the transactions.Martin looked around the room. \u201cWho\u2019s heard of the Pythagorean theorem?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow old is it? Four thousand years old, right? Has it ever changed? No. That\u2019s what the system is built on. The math has to work.\u201dIn 2010, the Board of Elections and Ethics in Washington, D.C., resolved to tackle an issue that has bedeviled officials for decades: some 2.6 million overseas voters, including members of the military, who are largely disenfranchised due to the difficulty of physically visiting a polling place. The usual solution\u200a\u2014\u200avoting by mail\u2014carries its own risks, such as missing ballots, uncounted votes, and fraud. Nonetheless, every state currently allows snail-mail voting under some circumstances, and three of them (Oregon, Washington, and Colorado) rely exclusively on the method.Election supervisors in D.C. figured they could do better. They partnered with a nonprofit and developed an online voting system using Ruby on Rails, a web application framework. Then, adopting a practice advocated by cybersecurity specialists, they published their source code, set up a mock election, and issued an open invitation to try hacking it.Among those who took the challenge were J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor from the University of Michigan perhaps best known for his public call for manual recounts following the 2016 election. Within a day and a half, he and his students had seized control of the platform and obtained the passwords of every voter in the system\u200a\u2014\u200aalong with the ability to change their votes. In an exuberant touch, they even modified the system\u2019s \u201cthank you\u201d page, the one that let voters know they had successfully cast a ballot, to play the Michigan Wolverines\u2019 fight song.Illustrations by Maite\u00a0FranchiIt took D.C. elections officials nearly two days to detect the breach\u200a\u2014\u200aa discovery the students watched in real time after also hacking the closed-circuit cameras in the network operations center.It was dramatic evidence of the pitfalls of online voting. Maybe too dramatic, according to those in the online voting business. \u201cIt was good that the system was compromised, because it showed the vulnerabilities, but the industry is still suffering as a consequence of that,\u201d says Smartmatic\u2019s Mike Summers. \u201cEverybody says, \u2018Okay, well that proves internet voting is insecure.\u2019 But look, if a carmaker has a problem with a car, we don\u2019t all stop driving.\u201dIn the years since the 2010 pilot, Halderman has become a revered figure among the tight cadre of election security activists convinced that online voting is a disaster waiting to happen. Armed with PhDs in math and computer science and a zeal for old-fashioned paper ballots, these experts\u200a\u2014\u200awith their powerful ties to universities, research institutions, and influential government agencies\u200a\u2014\u200aare the bane of the mobile voting industry. They\u2019re utterly convinced that the blockchain, far from enhancing election security, is simply an overhyped distraction that will inevitably weaken it.The naysayers are eager to outline the various reasons for their skepticism to anyone who will listen. There are several major risks inherent in most any online voting system, they say, none of which are wholly mitigated by the introduction of a blockchain. First, there\u2019s malware. Allowing people to vote on their own insecure devices offers hackers an unusually soft target. Experts believe that one-third of the world\u2019s personal computers\u200a\u2014\u200aand a swiftly growing number of mobile phones\u200a\u2014\u200aare infected with malware.\u201cYou have to consider the devices people are voting from as dirty,\u201d says computer scientist David Jefferson, formerly of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a national security institution charged with safeguarding the nuclear weapons program. Hackers could, perhaps, insert into the software a malicious piece of code designed to change a vote right on someone\u2019s device before it is encrypted and posted to a blockchain. \u201cYou won\u2019t know, the government body won\u2019t know, there\u2019s no way to detect it, and then the malware may erase itself, so there\u2019s no forensic evidence,\u201d Jefferson says. \u201cIt\u2019s just hopeless.\u201d\u201cEvery major government agency has been penetrated multiple times. No system is invulnerable, and everyone in the security community knows\u00a0this.\u201dThen there\u2019s the issue of targeted denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, in which a hacker directs so much traffic at a server that it\u2019s overwhelmed and ceases to function. \u201cYou could aim an attack at just Los Angeles and San Francisco, and suddenly you\u2019ve turned a blue state red,\u201d cautions Josh Benaloh, senior cryptographer at Microsoft Research, whom I heard one vendor describe as a \u201ccrypto god.\u201d Although a distributed ledger itself would likely withstand such an attack, the rest of the system\u200a\u2014\u200afrom voters\u2019 personal devices to the many servers a vote would pass through on its way to the blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200awould remain vulnerable.And finally, there\u2019s the so-called penetration attack, like the University of Michigan incursion, in which an adversary gains control of a server and deliberately alters the outcome of an election. \u201cEvery major government, military, and commercial agency has been penetrated multiple times,\u201d notes Jefferson, who now serves on the board of election security nonprofit Verified Voting. \u201cNo system anywhere on the internet is invulnerable, and everyone in the security community knows this.\u201dWhile it\u2019s true that information recorded on a blockchain cannot be changed, a determined hacker might well find another way to disrupt the process. Bitcoin itself has never been hacked, for instance, but numerous bitcoin \u201cwallets\u201d have been, resulting in billions of dollars in losses. In early June 2018, a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange was penetrated, causing the value of bitcoin to tumble and resulting in a loss of $42 billion in market value. So although recording the vote tally on a blockchain introduces a new obstacle to penetration attacks, it still leaves holes elsewhere in the system\u200a\u2014\u200alike putting a new lock on your front door but leaving your basement windows open.Mobile-voting companies are well aware of these issues and say they are working to solve them.\u201cWe assume every machine is rife with malware,\u201d Votem\u2019s Martin says. \u201cSo we also do all kinds of mathematical checking. We know what your individual ballot should look like, cryptograpically, and if it doesn\u2019t match that cryptographic profile, we won\u2019t accept it.\u201dBoth Votem and Voatz market a system whereby a voter, having cast a ballot, receives a QR code tied to her vote. By scanning the code with another device (either at home or in a polling station), she can reassure herself that the vote was at least recorded properly somewhere. True, she won\u2019t know with certainty that it was part of the final tally, but no form of voting currently in use offers much assurance on that score. (A group called the U.S. Vote Foundation is working on it.)DoS attacks can be fought off by obtaining extra server space, proponents of online voting point out, and they are less of a factor in elections that offer extended voting periods. Asked if the possibility of a targeted DoS attack concerns him, Martin points out that hurricanes and other weather events routinely keep people from the polls as well.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely held to a higher standard,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, there was a squirrel in Ohio that took out an entire precinct!\u201d (Quick-thinking officials switched to paper ballots until power was restored.)As for penetration attacks, Martin says the company has numerous protocols in place to fend them off, but in the end, he admits, \u201cWe have never said and will never say it\u2019s unhackable. What we\u2019re saying is if it is hacked, we will know immediately, because the math won\u2019t add up.\u201cLook, the thing you have to remember is there are tradeoffs,\u201d he continues. \u201cThere is no perfect solution.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s Josh Benaloh is one of the most esteemed cryptographers working on voting issues. Despite being skeptical that the holy grail of true, \u201cend-to-end verifiable\u201d online voting can be achieved in the near term, he believes that day will come. Many online voting skeptics would say that it\u2019s not worth even trying, Benaloh tells me. \u201cOthers say it\u2019s inevitable, and we have a responsibility to make it as secure as possible. I\u2019m more on the inevitable side of things.\u201dEven so, Benaloh, like numerous computer science experts I spoke to, maintains that the blockchain technology being touted by various voting companies won\u2019t actually help at all\u200a\u2014\u200aand may well introduce a new array of pitfalls.\u201cIn my experience, people are trying to take advantage of this craze,\u201d Benaloh says. \u201cThere are real substantial problems to be solved to do reasonable and responsible internet voting, and honestly, blockchains do not solve any of the problems that are out there.\u201dA blockchain is only as valuable as the data stored on it. And whereas traditional paper ballots preserve an indelible record of the actual intent of each voter, digital votes \u201cdon\u2019t produce an original hard-copy record of any kind,\u201d Jefferson says. \u201cSo the county has no meaningful way of verifying that these ballots truly represent what voters intended. It\u2019s all evanescent. It\u2019s electrons all the way down, and the blockchain can\u2019t fix that.\u201d\u201cBlockchain is not part of the solution unless you\u2019re selling stuff,\u201d says Joe Kiniry, principal scientist at Galois Inc., a software engineering company that designs secure systems for government agencies, including the Department of Defense, and chief scientist at Free and Fair, an open-source elections services outfit. \u201cWe have really good ways of [storing personal votes and totals] without using something as complex as a blockchain. Adding a blockchain to a voting protocol is the worst thing you could do,\u201d Kiniry adds. \u201cIt increases complexity for no extra benefit.\u201d\u201cWe know the blockchain is not a silver bullet,\u201d Martin concedes. \u201cThat\u2019s why we also have other protocols in place. But it\u2019s absolutely more secure than a single point of failure.\u201dOn May 8, Lieutenant Scott Warner, a paratrooper with the Army Corps of Engineers, stationed in Vicenza, Italy, with the 173rd Air Brigade, used an app on his mobile phone to place his vote in the West Virginia Senate primary, becoming one of the first voters in U.S. history to record his ballot to a blockchain in a federal election. (An election official then had to copy Warner\u2019s selections by hand onto a traditional paper ballot and scan it into a machine, rendering the event a little less momentous than media made it out to be.)The registration process was \u201ceasy to maneuver,\u201d Lt. Warner said, according to a press release issued by the secretary of state\u2019s office.Here\u2019s how it worked: After the state verified to the election services company, Voatz, that Warner was eligible for an absentee ballot, he received an email instructing him to download the smartphone app. The app then directed him to take a picture of a government-issued photo ID, which it checked against a state voter registration database. Finally, Warner was asked to take a video selfie (and to blink to prove he was a live person) in order to confirm through biometric facial recognition that he was the same individual pictured on the ID.In short order, the app displayed a ballot. \u201cI hit \u2018vote\u2019 for the candidates I wanted to support,\u201d Warner recounted. \u201cThen I used the thumbprint Touch ID on my phone to verify who I was. That was it. Pretty slick!\u201dSome secure-voting activists might say it was a little too slick. That is, if they could actually assess the protocol Voatz used in West Virginia. For now, the only information describing the system is a white paper issued by West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner\u200a\u2014\u200aLt. Scott Warner\u2019s dad, as it happens\u200a\u2014\u200awhich devotes just three sentences to outlining the voting system architecture, less than it devotes to detailing Secretary Warner\u2019s military service (he is a decorated Army veteran) and that of his four grown children.\u201cYou take baby steps, build trust, and start using it for bigger and more complex elections.\u201dThough hardly foolproof, one essential step in evaluating any system, most experts on the subject agree, is releasing the source code and running a live test. So far, although some i-voting companies publish their architecture and protocols online (Votem, for instance, just detailed its architecture on GitHub), they are reluctant to allow this kind of full vetting.\u201cIn every single case where it\u2019s been allowed to happen, we\u2019ve been able to find grave vulnerabilities,\u201d says David Jefferson, the computer scientist. \u201cVoting system vendors never do open testing anymore because of the D.C. experience. They can\u2019t survive a determined attack. It would be a catastrophic PR failure and possibly the end of their company.\u201dAccording to West Virginia elections director Donald Kersey, the state \u201cdidn\u2019t give any thought\u201d to opening up the protocol or source code to public scrutiny, in part to protect Voatz\u2019s intellectual property and in part to avoid drawing \u201ca big target on a vulnerability that might be out there.\u201d\u201cWhat they\u2019re basically saying is, \u2018We\u2019ll let the Russians test it, but not you,\u2019\u201d one cybersecurity expert insists.\u201cThis is incorrect and spreading false propaganda,\u201d a spokesperson from Voatz replies via email, adding that Security Innovation, \u201ca renowned, independent mobile security firm,\u201d audited the source code and that \u201cseveral other tests\u201d had also been carried out.Secretary Warner emphasized that the number of votes involved in the pilot was limited\u200a\u2014\u200ajust over a dozen voters, in two counties\u200a\u2014\u200aand that the project was designed to address a very specific problem: the friction experienced by deployed service members who want to help elect their leaders.Still, those votes are meaningful only if they are truly secure, and the cybersecurity professionals I spoke to remain skeptical. Ironically, the real danger may not be that the West Virginia project will be hacked, but that it won\u2019t. The stakes are small. Chances are no one will bother. Votes will be tallied. Election officials and voters will be reassured. And a seemingly successful small-scale pilot will lead to larger rollouts\u200a\u2014\u200aand ever more worthy targets. As Voatz chief executive Nimit Sawhney tells me, \u201cYou take baby steps, build trust, and start using it for bigger and more complex elections.\u201dGiven the recent revelation that Russian intelligence compromised election systems in at least seven states in the days before the 2016 election, one can only assume they or others like them\u200a\u2014\u200aeven \u201csomebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,\u201d as then-candidate Donald Trump famously put it\u200a\u2014\u200awill do so again.The scary part is that we may never know. We may even stop asking, secure in our unshakable faith in the mighty blockchain. \u201cEventually, an election will have some very surprising outcome, and people will say, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t argue with the blockchain,\u2019\u201d Benaloh predicts.\u201cI don\u2019t really blame the secretary of state for the fact that somebody came along and managed to convince him that this is a great thing,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut I can\u2019t believe the people who are selling this don\u2019t know that what they\u2019re selling is a handful of beans.\u201dA Voatz spokesperson replies: \u201cWithout really having an understanding of how the blockchain is being used here, this is a typically irresponsible and brash statement, and we are not going to get into the mud on it. We will let the work speak for itself.\u201dIn the end, democracy always depends on a certain leap of faith, and faith can never be reduced to a mathematical formula. The Economist Intelligence Unit regularly ranks the world\u2019s most democratic counties. In 2017, the United States came in 21st place, after Uruguay and Malta. Meanwhile, it\u2019s now widely believed that John F. Kennedy owed his 1960 win to election tampering in Chicago. The Supreme Court decision granting the presidency to George W. Bush rather than calling a do-over\u200a\u2014\u200adespite Al Gore\u2019s popular-vote win\u200a\u2014\u200astill seems iffy. Significant doubts remain about the 2016 presidential race. And yet our certainty that we are living not only in a democracy, but quite possibly the greatest democracy on the face of the earth, somehow remains unshaken.While little doubt remains that Russia favored Trump in the 2016 election, the Kremlin\u2019s primary target appears to have been our trust in the system itself. So if the blockchain\u2019s trendy allure can bolster trust in American democracy, maybe that\u2019s a net positive for our national security. If someone manages to hack the system, hopefully they\u2019ll do so quietly. Apologies to George Orwell, but sometimes ignorance really is strength.Back at the Votem workshop in Portugal, Pete Martin comes to the last slide of his deck and opens the floor to questions. A hand shoots up. \u201cThere are a lot of people in the world who are not very savvy,\u201d an election commissioner from Jordan points out. \u201cFor them, trust is about, \u2018I see that I wrote my paper and put it in the box and nobody looked at me.\u2019 If you come and say to them, \u2018Blockchain,\u2019 they\u2019re going to say, \u2018What magic is this? This is nonsense! This is another conspiracy!\u2019\u201dMartin smiles. For the foreseeable future, he promises, \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be the only way to vote. It will just be another channel.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWhen online banking came around, all the branches didn\u2019t go away, right?\u201dAs the presentation concludes, several electoral officials crowd around with questions. Despite the skepticism, the potential of blockchain-based electronic voting had clearly inspired a good portion of the audience.And it may well be inevitable. Back in 2010, after the D.C. election board\u2019s chief technologist, Paul Stenbjorn, watched helplessly as a handful of students compromised his entire system, he fired off a defiant response on the Board of Elections website: \u201cThe computer science community needs to understand that this toothpaste is already out of the tube,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand no volume of warnings can put it back.\u201dCorrection: A previous version of this piece misstated how many states allow voting by mail. All U.S. states currently allow it in certain circumstances.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Ternio\u200a\u2014\u200aHighly Scalable Programmatic Blockchain", "author_name": "Shane McQuillan", "link": "https://medium.com/@trading_trusted/ternio-highly-scalable-programmatic-blockchain-59a86c935e66?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 6, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "12.2K", "content": "Ternio\u200a\u2014\u200aHighly Scalable Programmatic BlockchainShane McQuillanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 6, 2018Ternio has built a highly scalable blockchain framework capable of delivering over 1 million transactions per second, fully decentralized and on-chain. It\u2019s not lightning, plasma, sharding or any concepts already being tested.TERN TokenThe company is applying this speed and scale to the $224B programmatic ad industry which is ripe for disruption with blockchain. They have already struck partnerships with the leading companies in the industry. Ternio provides their blockchain framework to existing trustworthy ad companies in the supply chain\u200a\u2014\u200aenabling those companies to verify users, instantly pay publishers, and protect advertisers from ad fraud.ScaleTernio\u2019s blockchain is called Lexicon and uses highly modified versions of IBM\u2019s HyperLedger Fabric and Stellar to achieve such high scale and low cost validation. In a recent testnet, they were able to deliver 1.2 million transactions per second. They are also the only blockchain company that is supporting their claims by currently going through a 3rd party verification process.This scale is required to support high QPS (queries per second) of programmatic buying and selling which is similar to high frequency trading on the stock market. When someone visits a website (publisher) it generates an impression. If that page has 5 advertisements, then that\u2019s 5 impressions. Aggregate that over tens of millions of users and tens of millions of webpages and the scale is immense.Co-founder Ian Kane provides an explanation of programmatic advertising\u200a\u2014\u200astarting at 0:42.OpportunityThis is not another ad network I.C.O. similar to many that already exist. Ternio does not sell advertisements. This is a B2B enterprise play in an industry that transacted $224B last year and is on track to be over $300B by 2019. In a consumer industry the company needs to convince each unique customer to use their product, but in business you need to convince only a few decision makers to capture millions if not billions of dollars. Ternio has first mover advantage in a highly niche and lucrative market that most do not understand.Co-founder Daniel Gouldman explains ad supply chain problems at the Dubai Innovation and Investment Summit\u200a\u2014\u200astarting at 4:15Ternio solves the following problems:Lack of transparency: Approximately $0.50 of every $1.00 currently spent makes it to the publisher. The remaining $0.50 is taken by companies to transact the advertisement. Both the advertiser and publisher do not know how many companies sit in between them. Many low value companies thrive in this obscurity.Lengthy payment terms: Since the 2008 financial crisis payment terms have been stretched to a point where they are no longer sustainable. Publishers are paid anywhere from Net30 to Net120. The hurts every company in the supply chain as they have to wait up to 4 months to be paid. In addition, many supply chain companies sustain themselves on payment float (collect Net30 > pay Net60)Advertising Fraud: in 2017 $18 billion dollars was spent on advertising fraud. This is a massive problem. Fraud can be anything from domain spoofing (representing a low quality site as a high quality one) or bot traffic (generating ad impressions from data centers to increase ad revenue).Ternio provides their Lexicon blockchain to companies in digital advertising space so that they can solve the problems mentioned above. This is an important differentiator because they are not competing with established companies, but rather complementing the efforts of companies already controlling billions in ad spend.Co-founder Ian Kane explains how Ternio differentiates;TractionA huge need exists in the advertising industry to solve the problems outlined above. Marc Pritchard of Proctor and Gamble, one of the biggest advertisers in the world, recently called the ad supply chain, \u201cMurky at best, fraudulent at worst.\u201d The status quo is not sustainable so the response to Ternio\u2019s technology has been great. Ternio has already struck numerous partnerships with ad agencies, buying platforms, and exchanges. They have also been approached by other companies who are interested in licensing their Lexicon framework.The founding team hosted a 90 minute live stream where they answered questions.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Gemini Launches the Gemini dollar: U.S. Dollars on the Blockchain", "author_name": "Cameron Winklevoss", "link": "https://medium.com/gemini/gemini-launches-the-gemini-dollar-62787f963fb4?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 10, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "3.3K", "content": "Gemini Launches the Gemini dollar: U.S. Dollars on the BlockchainCameron WinklevossBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 10, 2018When we founded Gemini over four years ago, our mission was simple: build a bridge to the future of money. As a first step, this meant making it safe and easy to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether, and Zcash. However, when fiat currency and cryptocurrency interact, the differences between the traditional banking system and cryptocurrencies become increasingly clear.

As a next step in our mission, we must improve the linkage between these worlds by giving fiat currency the same desirable technological qualities of cryptocurrencies.To date, there has been no trusted and regulated digital representation of the U.S. dollar that moves in an open, decentralized manner like cryptocurrencies. Enter the Gemini dollar\u200a\u2014\u200aa stable value coin (often called a \u201cstablecoin\u201d) that is (i) issued by Gemini, a New York trust company, (ii) strictly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and (iii) built on the Ethereum network according to the ERC20 standard for tokens. The Gemini dollar (ticker symbol: GUSD) combines the creditworthiness and price stability of the U.S. dollar with blockchain technology and the oversight of U.S. regulators, namely, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

You will also be able to automatically convert Gemini dollars into U.S. dollars by depositing them into your Gemini account.The U.S dollars that correspond to the Gemini dollars issued and in circulation will be held at a bank located in the United States and eligible for FDIC \u201cpass-through\u201d deposit insurance, subject to applicable limitations. In addition, the U.S dollar deposit balance will be examined monthly by an independent registered public accounting firm to verify the 1:1 peg. All Independent Accountants\u2019 Reports will be publicly available here. Further, the smart contracts underlying the Gemini dollar token have been fully audited and formally verified by an independent security firm, whose report is publicly available here.We are excited to bring the Gemini dollar to market and provide a crucial link between the traditional banking system and the new, rapidly growing crypto economy.

We live in the information age, but there is a discernible lack of transparency about the validity and authenticity of the information that we so readily consume.A series of missteps by global technology companies has only exasperated the problem. In February, the Wall Street Journal reported that Russian operatives were strategically doctoring photos to prey on people\u2019s prejudices while attempting to influence the 2016 presidential election. This same strategy was employed on Alphabet\u2019s platforms, which includes the search behemoth, Google.Most recently, the New York Times reported on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which included the harvesting of unsuspecting users\u2019 data to create manipulative ad campaigns that reached millions of people.The information age is morphing into the era of fake news, bias, and manipulation. While Facebook is at the center of these stories, they are far from the only offender. In total, the technology that was intended to connect us has, instead, confused us. What\u2019s worse, this isn\u2019t limited just to the social internet. Businesses, organizations, and individuals are increasingly required to verify and certify their data because of a lack of trust and a definite need for verifiable records.In the information age, authenticity is king, and new technologies can help business successfully navigate this terrain.Building Trust on the BlockchainAlthough misinformation is not a new problem, and it far outdates the emergence of connective technologies, many of our current issues are brought on by the accessibility and capability of existing technologies. Companies can manipulate data reports, propagandists can doctor photos, and scammers can forge emails using nothing more than a laptop and an internet connection.Therefore, it can be disconcerting to pose more technology as a solution to a technology problem, but this time is different. Really different.Formed as the accounting backbone to Bitcoin, the preeminent cryptocurrency, the blockchain was first introduced in 2009. However, as digital currencies brought increased attention to the technology, its use cases and capabilities are increasingly touted as the means by which we can best iterate on our technologically connected culture. The blockchain is a decentralized network that specializes in the authentication and transmission of data including digital currencies but also many other things as well.In March, Congress released its Joint Economic Report, and it included high praise for the blockchain by noting its prowess in enhancing security, efficiency, and data transmissions. The report noted, \u201cBlockchain technology essentially stores and transmits data securely, in large volumes, and at high speeds.\u201d Moreover, research and consulting firm McKinsey and Co. described the blockchain as a \u201cplatform for truth and trust.\u201dTruth and trust are precisely what we need right now, and we should be deploying the blockchain to areas where it can be most effective.Use Cases for Building ConfidenceIn a March editorial for the Wall Street Journal, Mounir Ibrahim advocates for the blockchain\u2019s use in holding Syria\u2019s despotic leader, Bashar al-Assad, accountable for his atrocities. By using a smartphone\u2019s device sensors, Ibrahim argues, photos can be verified and housed on the blockchain. From there, any changes will be documented in its immutable ledger so that we can have complete confidence in a photo\u2019s authenticity.This same methodology can be brought to enterprise scenarios as well. Certification, licensure, and valid data points are often required of companies, and the blockchain is more than capable of storing, cryptographically verifying, and transmitting that information when necessary.Not only that, existing data tools such as SQL are mutable and can be hacked, where as blockchain solutions cannot.Evident Proof, a blockchain-base platform for data verification, is already offering their services to corporations and individual users. Hosted on the popular Ethereum blockchain, Evident Proof receives, verifies, and cryptographically seals a wide array of data points that can then be conveyed to third parties at the user\u2019s discretion. Their proof of evidence chains represent a tangible way forward for data verification in an age of skepticism and doubt. In fact, because Evident Proof has built its Intellectual Property on top of the blockchain, proof certificates can even be used in court.Of course, Evident Proof isn\u2019t just predicated on its users\u2019 sense of altruism. Many companies or individuals are legally required to demonstrate their qualifications, and this blockchain embraces the tokenized economy to make the process as simple as possible. Open source APIs allow third-party services to connect with Evident Proof\u2019s system, so the importing and exporting of data is secure but also fast and easy.The Future Requires Little\u00a0FaithThe blockchain and distributed ledger technologies are still in the early stages of development but their capabilities are already profound. When it comes to the things they do best, they are extraordinary. They play a critical role in maintaining digital currencies but they are capable of much more than just tracking Bitcoin transactions.For the information age, they can help us to create better records and to more quickly and efficiently validate information. They are purveyors of confidence and the implications of their wide adoption extend far beyond just a trendy technological innovation. They could transform a whole range of organisations across politics, finance or business more generally.A new decentralized and trustless environment would allow for the fractionalisation of workflows, bringing into existence new micro-services that we don\u2019t have now. Things could be matched together in a trusted way that allows them to interact seamlessly, extending existing cloud economics to be scaled up or switched on and off with ease to save money.A fluid, value based system such as this wouldn\u2019t need control by banks or governments at the centre and could have a profound effect on our societal systems. The power of the information age resides in its authenticity and the blockchain is restoring that principle for millions of users.Join us in our Telegram room to be part of the conversation: https://t.me/EvidentProofOfficial", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Cutting out the middle men: Blockchain in the solar\u00a0industry", "author_name": "Sasha Beburov", "link": "https://medium.com/hyperion-fund/cutting-out-the-middle-men-blockchain-in-the-solar-industry-68b5af104e32?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 21, 2018", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "3.5K", "content": "Cutting out the middle men: Blockchain in the solar\u00a0industrySasha BeburovBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 21, 2018By Molly Lempriere. Original article\u200a\u2014\u200ahttp://www.power-technology.com/features/cutting-middle-men-blockchain-solar-industry/Blockchain is playing an increasingly important role in industry, and the solar sector is keen to be part of that. We spoke to Hyperion Fund COO Noel Shannon at Blockchain Week to see how it can speed up solar power projects.At this year\u2019s Blockchain Week, held in London on the 19\u201326th January, Hyperion Fund\u2019s COO Noel Shannon, along with a panel of energy experts, talked about how blockchain is changing the solar industry.Hyperion Fund was set up in 2017, to enable faster solar plant development in the emerging markets through blockchain. It aims to fund projects that have already achieved a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), the contract given by a government ensuring the purchase of all electricity produced usually for a period of about 20 years.Investors, both public and private, will be able to buy tokens through an initial coin offering (ICO) that represent 1W of the solar power project. Through the sale of 72 million tokens, they can bypass the traditional capital raising routes, to gain funding quickly from a broad range of investors.Blockchain keeps a digital ledger of these transactions, publically visible to ensure transparency for investors keen on becoming part of the booming solar industry. In 2016, the amount of solar power installed grew 50% compared to the year before; growth is expected to continue with an estimated $2.8 trillion being invested by 2040.Molly Lempriere: Could you tell me a little bit about Hyperion Solar\u00a0Energy?Noel Shannon: Hyperion is a fund set up to invest in solar projects, addressing a problem and creating an opportunity. There are so many opportunities for more solar in the world, the renewables market is growing and solar is a big part of that. The challenge facing solar development companies is scale, being able to do a lot fast and grow fast. There are many limitations to this, in particular it takes a lot of time to get funding, to get banks, debt, and equity, as there are a lot of negotiations that take forever. Blockchain, and an ICO, offers a way of resolving that, by effectively crowd funding.So it solves a problem, and then the opportunity that it creates is for the token holders to come into the Hyperion fund, and have transparent investment into solar projects where the coin is directly related to the solar watts produced. Hyperion has been set up to do that.I joined Hyperion because I have experience in developing solar projects in the past. Using that, I\u2019m going to develop projects that already have the PPA. The PPA is the critical piece, because I know from my work in developing and getting PPA\u2019s that it takes a lot of time. You need to get the land lease, the environmental approval, studies, and grid connection. Getting all of those licenses together to get the PPA takes time. But once you\u2019ve got it then you still need to get the finance to build the solar farm.What Hyperion will address is the financing of PPA projects and building, using my experience, these projects. Then we will either run the projects or sell them on.ML: As an investor, how would you keep track? Do you have a specific platform for this transparent look into your investment?NS: It\u2019s going to use the Ethereum platform, using smart contracts to give total transparency through the investor portion of the website to see how the projects are performing, what energy is being produced and what returns you are going to accrue at the end of the period. I think there\u2019ll be dividends every six months, not sure if that\u2019s defined by the financial team yet.ML: What is problematic for people who want to get involved in renewable energy?NS: Ordinary people cannot invest in solar power at the moment, the only way a solar project can get funding is by going to the debt or equity markets, and that entails all of the traditional challenges of negotiating with multiple potential partners to decide who is going to team up with you on a potential project. That can take an enormous amount of time, and sometimes it can end in no result.This is where smart contracts with blockchain can allow a kind of a crowd funding to take place to alleviate all of that negotiation with equity partners, and then we can leverage the fund with debt through our debt partners. Therefore it gives us the ability to go at scale to address the opportunities in the market, whilst all the time giving the token holders total transparency.I\u2019m there to make sure that the projects are built. Using experience I\u2019ve gained from Shannon Energy where we built projects in the past, I can identify those PPA projects and start the building process as soon as possible. We\u2019ve already identified a number of PPA projects that we could start building the month after next.ML: You mentioned your experience with Shannon Energy, could you tell me a little bit about your background?NS: Sure, so Shannon Energy started about five years ago building large projects in South Africa, and subsequently built various smaller projects in Europe, and we\u2019re now building in Iran. Shannon Energy has lots of experience of getting PPAs and building power plants.We\u2019ve seen the challenges that have come about through this process, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve joined Hyperion to help them overcome these challenges. We will also be joined on our advisory board by one of our project directors in Shannon, Nathan Schmidt. Hyperion will have a team of solar experts to draw on so it can build rapidly.ML: You come very much from a renewable background, what do you think the effect of blockchain has been on the energy industry?NS: I\u2019m new to blockchain, I\u2019m fascinated by how it is beginning to pervade every aspect of what we do, removing middle men and disintermediating, to allow ordinary investors to bypass all those intermediates and invest in asset based projects. That to me is fascinating and I think it\u2019s the first step in a peer-to-peer relationship that an investor can have with an asset. I think solar is just one aspect, I\u2019ve seen other coins through ICO\u2019s, I\u2019ve seen property, I\u2019ve seen wine, art, everything really.What I think the next stage is, because blockchain permits it, is to allow trading of those coins in the market. Again it\u2019s not something I\u2019m familiar with, but blockchain permits it and I think it\u2019s great.I think legislation will come to make people more comfortable about investing in this marketplace; although obviously the early movers are probably the ones who get the biggest advantage like in most things. I would welcome more legislation because it makes it better for people who worry if it\u2019s going to be compliant with any future rules.We\u2019re seeing that at Davos already, there was also an article recently in the Financial Times saying that the banking community cannot ignore cryptocurrencies and ignore ICOs so it\u2019s going to happen. Bring on the legislation and let everybody have access\u200a\u2014\u200awithout paying the intermediates big commissions\u200a\u2014\u200ato invest in these projects.ML: In terms of Hyperion\u2019s ICO, how optimistic are you\u00a0feeling?NS: Very, I think it\u2019s going to be a huge success. All the indicators from people who know and have done ICOs\u200a\u2014\u200aand I understand that there have been more than a thousand ICOs done to date\u200a\u2014\u200ahave been positive. I suppose what makes Hyperion different to many previous ICOs is that there is an identifiable asset class underpinning it, which is PPA projects with an identifiable return. That makes the Hyperion ICO a bit different from other ones that you might be worried about.By Molly Lempriere.

I often get asked how I find all of the information that I do, and I know that information about them is often hard to find for a lot of people so I hope it will be of help. The article today is based on what I believe to be the 3 biggest and most promising projects in China today, including names we already know like Neo and Tron. 6 months ago CoinMarketCap\u2019s top 10 looked very different to how it looks today\u200a\u2014\u200apeople had only just heard about Neo (it was Antshares 6 months ago), Qtum didn\u2019t exist, Tron didn\u2019t exist and neither did many others. I believe 12 months from now it will look completely different to how it looks right now as well.As new technology starts to emerge and the engineers working diligently in the background improving upon the mistakes of the starters begin to go a little more public, new blood will emerge from the shadows and giants will be overturned. There are 3 projects from China that I believe will emerge as giants in 2018 and I expect all of them to be staples by the end of the year, some higher than others. They are VeChain, Matrix, and Nebulas.VeChainVeChain is an Enterprise-focused IoT and dApp platform for products and information. It aims to connect blockchain technology to the real world by providing robust infrastructure through the use of RFID and other similar IoT technologies. This is being achieved through partnerships and collaborations with innovative brands and industries, largely aided by their partner and former incubator PwC.Vechain literally translates to something like \u201cThe Only Chain\u201d; they eventually aim to be the one coin to rule them all\u200a\u2014\u200athe new and improved Bitcoin, perhaps. I\u2019m not entirely convinced by that goal, however I do believe that VeChain will end up as the IBM of the blockchain world and many of the world\u2019s heavyweights and Fortune 500 businesses will go to VeChain for their blockchain enterprise solutions. Goals like this cannot be achieved without significant business and technical acumen, so it\u2019s a good thing VeChain has both. Their mainnet is scheduled for Q2 2018 but they have been providing enterprise solutions on their private blockchain for some time now.Business at\u00a0VeChainTheir business connections is VeChain\u2019s strong point. Thanks to their PwC connection they are able to connect with huge enterprises and talk to them about VeChain. Many of their partners need no introduction, some of them are:PwCDNV GLRENAULTMICROSOFTD.I.GKUEHNE+NAGELHYPERLEDGERBitOceanBABYGHOSTChina UnicomMadeForGoodsAnd the list goes on.Perhaps the most impressive thing about VeChain is that they also recently announced a \u201cNational Level Partnership\u201d in which they have the privilege of trialling VeChain technology in the special government zone the Gui\u2019an New Area. The trials will see the local government in the area move parts of their workflow to the blockchain and if successful could see wide scale roll outs across the country. Given that the zone is an area mandated by the central government, it is no stretch to assume that there are central government eyes on VeChain.On January 24th VeChain have a facebook live stream with DNV GL where they will further announce details of their deep and special partnership. This may be the first time we have seen a massive enterprise like DNV GL openly champion and promote a public blockchain partner, and it shows that the business development side of VeChain is perhaps the best in class. They have started to be picked up by mainstream media in China, most notably Yicai, who have been seen tweeting and retweeting a lot about VeChain recently. Yicai are state-owned and are one of the leading financial news and investment outlets in the country.Tech at\u00a0VeChainTeam of 40+ developersCTO has nearly 18 years experience in telecommunications and IoT solutions and holds over 100 relevant patentsAlready have a working app on the iOS store for tracking products and verifying their authenticityPartnered with a world leading RFID solutions provider to act as their hardware department for chips specifically designed for use on VeChainHave a \u201cuse-case first\u201d approach to designCapable of 10000 tx/sWe have successfully implemented blockchain solutions across various industries such as luxury goods, liquor and agriculture. These use-cases go beyond the Proof-of-Concept and have already been launched on the market globally.Recently rebranded to VeChain Thor and in the process revamped their economic structure to be more befitting for an Enterprise focused platform. Holding VET will passively generate THOR based on how much is being held at any given time.THOR will be used as the gas, and THOR holders above a certain amount can trigger smart contracts and carry out transactions for free on the network\u200a\u2014\u200athis standardises and streamlines cash flows for businesses that will use VeChain and allows them to predict more accurately the cost of using the network, unlike a lot of other blockchains at the moment\u2014 \u2014EOY Expectation: I expect Vechain to be a top 5 project in terms of market cap by the end of 2018, and it will most likely happen a lot sooner.Where to buy: Binance and other platforms such as Huobi.Circulating supply: 277,162,633 VETMore information: www.reddit.com/r/VeChain\u2014 \u2014MatrixMatrix is an open-source blockchain that supports smart contracts and machine learning services. With its infrastructure reinforced with artificial intelligence (AI), Matrix aims revolutionise the user experience of executing smart contracts by making the whole process faster, easier, and safer.It\u2019s a complete blockchain solution which aims to offer flexible blockchain networks that support continuous adaptive self-optimisation and multi-chain transaction. As a result of refactoring the blockchain with AI, Matrix also allows its mining power to be used in AI based big data applications (gene regulatory networks, clinical diagnoses, video analytics, financial modelling etc.) by solving complex AI algorithms and this mining power can be rented out as required by consumers. This takes the large amounts of energy consumed by typical proof of work calculations and allows them to directly add value to the world, and to the applications that will run on the MATRIX chain. The idea is incredibly well thought out and the engineers have had the foresight to think about the issues that may trip up other blockchains down the line in terms of environmentalism, self optimisation and wide-spread smart contract deployment.Their list of investors and partners from both government and industry is impressive thanks to their well connected senior leadership, and it will only continue to grow. If they can leverage their connections there is potential for Matrix to be the blockchain infrastructure for priority government initiatives such as the famous One Belt One Road. Their mainnet is scheduled for September 2018 and has been under development since the end of 2016.Business at\u00a0MatrixMatrix are the sole blockchain partner for the National Government commissioned One Belt One Road Research and Development Centre for and sole AI solution for the centre. Matrix will act as an enterprise incubator and will be the only blockchain project adopted by companies which pursue OBOR goals with the centre. The national government have put aside trillions to pour into belt and road projects and have recently invested $2.1 billion in an AI research park in Beijing. A perfect combination.

Until that day comes, Nebulas is the solution. Aside from it being a search protocol, Nebulas has its own VM which supports dApp development, and its efficient upgrade system allows for rapid scalability. Nebulas makes the list because as blockchains become more mainstream and begin to see actual real world use, blockchain projects will need a robust, intuitive search feature, and many will go to Nebulas for this.To rank items in a search engine, there needs to be some established value system. A way of judging one project, dApp, user, or protocol from another. Nebulas has designed a value system for blockchain and this value system enables Nebulas to effectively \u201cvalue\u201d users and accounts and reward them accordingly. Combine this with dApps, smart contracts, and other advanced features and Nebulas can become a serious competitor if they do well.Business at\u00a0NebulasThe founder of Nebulas was one of the founders of AntsharesNebulas are connected with Tencent through their WeStart program which will see them get funding and advice from the company, and will help them connect with other companies under the WeStart umbrellaPartnered with \u201c500 Startups\u201d, an incubator and VC investor similar to the Tencent WeStart programHave already begun building relationships within the blockchain community which is very important for a protocol project.

With good research you can capitalize on that and get in while people are still waiting for their favourite youtuber or blog website to tell them that its OK. These 3 projects are in my opinion extremely undervalued and will all eventually be recognised as leaders in 2018. I actually expect all 3 to eventually work together, with VeChain and Matrix both being connected through Hyperledger and through their China government ties, and Nebulas being the primary search protocol for both blockchains. It is also important to remember that top 20, top 10, top 5 in 2018 will mean very different thing to what they do now. Many are expecting 2018 to be the year crypto really begins to go mainstream and it\u2019s likely that the overall market cap will be worth trillions; being amongst the 20 best projects in such a high value environment is enormous.All information mentioned is available in the public domain and there is some information that I have directly from team leads which has not been divulged.\u2014 -Articles will be posted to @altcoinwhales first so subscribe to be ahead of the game.", "responses": "18"}, {"title": "MEDIA Protocol And Blockchain Security\u200a\u2014\u200aPart\u00a04", "author_name": "MEDIA Protocol", "link": "https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsm/media-protocol-and-blockchain-security-part-4-1a96d493540d?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 2, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "1.6K", "content": "MEDIA Protocol And Blockchain Security\u200a\u2014\u200aPart\u00a04MEDIA ProtocolBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 2, 2018The team here at MEDIA Protocol are deeply committed to creating a more direct, transparent and secure ecosystem for content creators, publishers, and consumers through the revolutionary application of blockchain technology. We\u2019re here to connect the worlds of marketing and technology for everyone\u2019s benefit.We\u2019ve got love for both worlds, but from our own experience we know that they can sometimes feel, literally, worlds apart. So we\u2019re committed, not just to connecting them, but to creating a common understanding between them.This series of articles aims to explain the ins and outs of blockchain security to help everyone\u200a\u2014\u200athe marketeers, the technologists, and the content consumers\u200a\u2014\u200aunderstand the principles behind this game-changing technology.We want to help educate by demystifying the potential applications of blockchain technology. Most importantly, we feel it\u2019s vital to highlight and clarify the security elements of blockchain; how it safeguards data, enables open and transparent record-keeping and ensures secure digital transactions.Strap in, and welcome to the MEDIA Protocol Blockchain Education Programme.Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Blockchain Ensures That No-One Can Impersonate The Owner Of An\u00a0AddressBlockchain ensures the identity of the person making a transaction using secure cryptography\u200a\u2014\u200athe straightforward system of pairing a public key with a private key. These take the form of alphanumeric codes: the private is always 32 bytes, and the public is always 65 bytes (33 bytes if compressed).Details of every transaction are retained permanently, giving historical data that verifies the user\u2019s identity. This means that parties on both sides of a transaction can be sure of the other\u2019s integrity.Who Has The Public And Private\u00a0Keys?The public key is broadcast to anyone on the network\u200a\u2014\u200astored on the distributed ledger in the same way as other transactions.The private key is available only to one individual user, and as such should never be broadcast or shared.Rather than exchange or apply these directly each time, a speedier method is to map the data of the public key to a hash.Hashes are data strings of a fixed size and a one-way function that cannot readily be reversed.No matter how big or small the data input is, the output will always have a fixed length. This is handy when large amounts of data are involved in transactions. Effectively, Hashing translates data, no matter how large or small, into a single output of a standard length.So instead of having to recall massive amounts of data, the user only needs to remember the hash. Users then simply digitally sign the hash value generated, making for even quicker and easier transactions.This also keeps the transfer of information confidential and verifies the identity of the signatory in one.How Do I Use My Private\u00a0Key?Each person can use their private key to create a wallet, or as a form of digital signature for transactions. By signing a transaction through the private key, the originator can be authenticated as genuine. This ensures that the person who makes the transaction is definitely the person who owns that private key.When used to create a wallet in an app, such as CryptoCatnip, the details of the private key are kept secure by fingerprint recognition, Face ID, or the user\u2019s password. Two-step authentication is required for maximum security.A device wallet is accessible only from that device, and if lost the access will be lost with it.Users are therefore urged to connect to an existing wallet, to maintain continuity of access to their funds.How Does This Prevent Impersonation?The private key is used to encrypt all transactions that the user is party to.Those transactions can then be decrypted, and thus authenticated, by anyone with the public key.It is very nearly impossible to fake transactions without knowledge of that private key.Sure, with an algorithm it\u2019s easy to generate the Public key from any Private key, but trying to do that in reverse would require computational power beyond that of anything currently in existence. Unless of course, you know of a computer somewhere that can do the required 40000000000000000000000000000000 years of calculating any faster, according to Leon Di of @WeTrust.As long as it is kept secret, there should be no way for anyone else to pass themselves off as the owner of that key.What Does This Mean For MEDIA Protocol?Using our app, CryptoCatnip, the user can create a wallet to store their private key. That key is known only to the authorised owner, and every transaction made from their wallet will be digitally signed to verify their identity.This means no one else can impersonate a user. Only the person who owns that private key can present to the blockchain with that identity.The wallet and its key are kept secure by the device containing the app: be it password, keycode, fingerprint recognition or Face ID.Both parties can be sure that any transactions made using MEDIA Protocol are transparent and public. The use of Public and Private keys on the blockchain ensures that you only transact with the person or entity that you expect and intend to transact with.No one else.Read All Parts In Our Blockchain Education Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain: Is It Secure?Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Apply To Cyber Security?Part 3\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Create Transparency?Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Blockchain Ensures That No-One Can Impersonate The Owner Of An Address (This article above)Part 5\u200a\u2014\u200aComing SoonFor more information regarding MEDIA Protocol find us on our social channels below:Website: www.mediaprotocol.orgFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MEDIAProtocolTwitter: https://twitter.com/MEDIA_ProtocolLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/media-protocol/Telegram: https://t.me/Media_Protocol_Community and https://t.me/MP_AnnouncementsMedium: https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsmYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMqo01fh4wST0XYck_zPHeA", "responses": ""}, {"title": "A Primer on Blockchains, Protocols, and Token\u00a0Sales", "author_name": "Will Little", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/a-primer-on-blockchains-protocols-and-token-sales-9ebe117b5759?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 22, 2017", "readtime": "10 min read", "upvotes": "2.6K", "content": "A Primer on Blockchains, Protocols, and Token\u00a0SalesWill LittleBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 22, 2017Total market cap & 24hr trading volume of all cryptocurrencies over the past 4+ years (via CoinMarketCap)Blockchains are changing the foundation of the global economy, and everyone is freaking out.Opinionated tribes are invoking civil wars and \u201cforking\u201d into new tribes. Multiple heated battles are happening simultaneously (mostly on social media) while only a few people on the outside understand what\u2019s going on.Even the terminology being thrown around is confusing; there\u2019s been a rapid evolution of new technology that has resulted in a lack of lingo consensus. What is an ICO vs. a token sale vs. a TGE? Are coins, tokens, and cryptocurrencies the same thing? What exactly is a \u201cprotocol\u201d, \u201cDAO\u201d, \u201cdApp\u201d, etc\u2026Still, a growing number of people are realizing that there is a way to transfer assets to each other securely, reliably, publicly, irreversibly, and globally\u200a\u2014\u200awithout the need for a central authority.Marketplace corporations that profit from buyer/seller transactions (like Uber, AirBnB, eBay, Amazon, etc\u2026) are paying especially close attention.We\u2019ve entered a world where \u201ctrust\u201d is moving toward distributed networks of machines that no one person, group, corporation, or government owns. These networks have rock-solid data integrity, zero downtime, and financial incentives for anyone who participates.The implications of this are enormous.How we do business with currency, credit, contracts, real estate, computing, communications, fundraising, and pretty much anything else you can think of is changing.It\u2019s happening right now, and it\u2019s happening fast.What is a blockchain?Simply put, a blockchain is a very long list of transactions stored on a network of computers (i.e. a distributed ledger).As an illustration, imagine writing on a piece of paper that resulted in thousands of other pieces of paper around the world magically showing what you wrote. A blockchain is like that.What is special about this distributed ledger is:It can smartly establish consensus of state (i.e. the transactions) even if huge swaths of computers on the network go down.The transactions are organized as a list of timestamped line items in the ledger inside blocks of data.Cryptography ensures that past transactions cannot be deleted or modified.Everyone can see the history of every transaction since the beginning of the chain\u2019s creation.People are financially incentivized to spin up computers in the network, which secures the network\u2019s ongoing existence.Thus, math secures a blockchain\u2019s past, and money secures a blockchain\u2019s future.What are protocols?Most of us are used to entrusting a bank to maintain a proper ledger and ensure money is not \u201cdouble spent.\u201d But with blockchains, that trust is in the network of computers and their cryptographically secure protocol (i.e. the software that governs rules, operations, and communication between network nodes).As an example, the Internet today runs on a relatively \u201cthin\u201d layer of protocols such as TCP/IP, SMTP, HTTP, and HTTPS. These protocols establish rules for computers across a network to follow in order to communicate effectively.On top of these protocols, a relatively \u201cfat\u201d layer of applications like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.. have been built to interface between data and people. With this setup, centralized organizations own all the data and users are required to create new accounts and enter credit card info (and other sensitive data) in multiple places. This is annoying, especially when our identity and payment info gets hacked.Enter blockchainsBlockchains are also operated and accessed via protocols, but the critical difference is that instead of a few \u201cthin\u201d protocols, a huge number of niche protocols are being built (i.e. \u201cfat protocols\u201d) that will support the next generation of applications. This setup allows users to \u201cown\u201d their data, and it allows developers to leverage a multitude of protocols and blockchains that will enable more powerful, secure, and inexpensive solutions for everything from payments and banking, to healthcare and telecommunications.How can people transfer assets to each other on a blockchain?Functionally, to create a transaction, applications like a \u201cwallet\u201d are used to create a \u201cpublic address\u201d (derived from a \u201cpublic key\u201d) on the network, which indicates identity. An associated \u201cprivate key\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is kept hidden from the network\u200a\u2014\u200agrants ownership.Importantly, each transaction sent into the blockchain must:be sent to a public addressbe \u201csigned\u201d by a private keyinclude a transaction fee to be collected by the computers powering the network (or just \u201cburned\u201d, depending on how the blockchain is setup).This process keeps the ledger growing in size indefinitely, and properly signals to the operators of the machines (i.e. \u201cminers\u201d) that transactions are worth processing. Without a sufficient fee sent with a transaction, miners won\u2019t bother processing it (this helps prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks).What happens if I lose my private keys or they get\u00a0stolen?Then unfortunately you are out of luck. By design there is no central authority to call and help you get it back. This is why various offline solutions for storing and securing private keys have become popular recently.(As an amusing aside: while promising to disintermediate institutions like banks, ironically a growing number of people in the crypto world are storing some or all of their private keys within safe deposit boxes\u2026 in banks.)What can blockchains do?Blockchains have utility to disintermediate central authorities & disrupt corporations that silo data and hoard profit. With new protocols for things like payments, file storage, computing, lending, identity, reputation, etc\u2026 a boom in marketplace innovation is already happening:Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, etc\u2026 record financial transactions (threatening traditional \u201cfiat\u201d currencies).Filecoin, Storj, Siacoin, etc\u2026 enable file storage (threatening cloud storage providers).Steem, Golos, Leeroy, etc\u2026 pay people to make & discover social media content (threatening Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, etc\u2026 ).And so on\u2026Of course, these are just examples of blockchains in each market. There are plenty of other currencies, file storage protocols, and social media platforms rising up as well (not to mention every other market vertical!).Can blockchains be more complex than\u00a0this?Yes, they can. As an example, blockchains like Ethereum can store transactions that contain executable code. This means it is now possible to write a computer program on a decentralized network to move assets around based on pre-defined contract conditions.In other words, anyone can now do things like make a will that distributes money over defined time intervals, create their own digital token to represent something (like an asset, part of an asset, or a club membership), or write a series of rules to govern a company (or even a whole country!).Overall, my friend Conrad (@lisperati) recently wrote to me the following important observation:\u201cOne of the things that makes blockchains different from databases (and makes ethereum different from a \u201ccomputer\u201d) is that blockchains are essentially nothing more than protocols: Anybody could write their own piece of software, connect it to the ethereum network, and it would process transactions exactly like ethereum, as long as the ethereum protocol is followed. Blockchains are a sort of \u2018protocolization\u2019 of computer software.\u201dWhat are\u00a0coins?Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, etc.. that are recorded in transactions on blockchains indicating only a change in a numerical value (e.g. \u201cX sends 1.34 to Y\u201d) are \u201ccoins.\u201dWhat are\u00a0tokens?While it\u2019s common to hear the word \u201ccoin\u201d and \u201ctoken\u201d used interchangeably, the terms are importantly different. A coin is a relatively simple type of token, whereas a token can be\u200a\u2014\u200aand often is\u200a\u2014\u200amuch more sophisticated than a coin.Tokens are a complicated subject because not all of them are the same. The various types have different names being used currently, but\u200a\u2014\u200acategorically:Asset tokens represent ownership of an asset (e.g. a company, a venture capital fund, an expensive piece of art, etc\u2026). An example is BCAP, which represents ownership in Blockchain Capital\u2019s third fund.Usage tokens (aka \u201cUse\u201d, \u201cProtocol\u201d, \u201cIntrinsic\u201d, or \u201cNative\u201d tokens) are used as transaction fees to write to a blockchain. Bitcoin is the most common example here.Work tokens give owners permission to contribute, govern, and/or \u201cdo work\u201d on a blockchain. An example would be Maker (MKR), which gives owners the ability to govern an organization that manages the stability of an underlying coin (DAI).Hybrid tokens have properties of two or more of the above. Filecoin, for example, will be both a usage token (you need it to use the system), and a work token (you need to own some in order to provide file storage).And to clarify some other potentially confusing terms regarding tokens and coins:ERC20 tokens can be any token (most commonly created on Ethereum) that adheres to the ERC20 token standard of how to access information, transfer assets, and fire off events. This makes it easier for developers to create applications such as wallets that work with a variety of tokens.App coin (or \u201cappcoin\u201d) is older term for a token used to fund a project. When you read articles from more than 6\u201312 months ago, you\u2019ll often see this term. When you come across this term, just think \u201ctoken.\u201dAlt coin (or \u201caltcoin\u201d) is an appcoin that powers it\u2019s own blockchain. Any coin that does so besides Bitcoin (e.g. Ethereum) is, by definition, an altcoin.Meta coin (or \u201cmetacoin\u201d, or \u201ccolored coin\u201d when using bitcoin) is a token that is built on top of a blockchain that already has an underlying coin. Nowadays, people just use the term token, which can be confusing when project owners generate and sell tokens in a self-described \u201cInitial Coin Offering.\u201dAnd a Cryptocurrency, by the way, is any token recorded on a blockchain that is traded on a market as money.Are all protocols created with an associated token?No. To make you even more confused (or enlightened), protocols can be created with or without an associated token.An example is what\u2019s going on over at Augur:\u201cAugur combines the magic of prediction markets with the power of a decentralized network to create a stunningly accurate forecasting tool\u200a\u2014\u200aand the chance for real money trading profits\u201dYou should read more about Augur via their white paper, but for our purposes here, it\u2019s important to know that they run their network with a protocol token (REP), which is a work token that allows owners to report on the outcomes of events that the market is attempting to predict. REP itself is a token with a tradable market value.In addition, Augur leverages another, separate protocol (which you can also read about in their white paper) to handle the token transactions between buyers and sellers. This protocol, by design, is not associated with a token.Thus, protocols and tokens are extremely open-ended and flexible.What is an Initial Coin Offering\u00a0(ICO)?This buzzword\u200a\u2014\u200athough catchy since it sounds like Initial Public Offering (IPO)\u200a\u2014\u200ais a misnomer. Most \u201cICOs\u201d these days are more accurately described as Token Sales or \u201cToken Generating Events\u201d (TGEs).Practically, token sales are fundraising events that can happen (1) before a company launches, (2) while a product is being built, or (3) after a product has been in the market for awhile. Most token sales these days are done via ERC20 tokens on top of Ethereum.A big list of past and upcoming token sales can be found here.Soon we\u2019ll see token sales be the default fundraising mechanism for new and existing companies. This will offer investors a more liquid asset (i.e. the ability to quickly buy things with the tokens or sell them). And, in addition to the capital they raised, founders retain the liquidity of the tokens they kept. This essentially results in a double-fundraising event!This is an extremely powerful change to the status quo.What are\u00a0dApps?Having discussed blockchains, protocols, and tokens, the final layer to the tech stack in the crypto-universe are consumer-facing platforms and applications. The term \u201cdApp\u201d refers to a \u201cdecentralized application\u201d, which\u200a\u2014\u200along story short\u200a\u2014\u200ameans it\u2019s built on top of one or more decentralized blockchains, protocols, and tokens.A huge list of 645+ dApps can be found at https://dapps.ethercasts.comWhat are Smart Contracts?Made popular by the folks behind Ethereum, Smart Contracts (SCs) are executable code contained within transactions on a blockchain that execute predefined rules based on a set of conditions (i.e. \u201ccontracts\u201d). SCs, therefore, are transaction protocols by definition; they move assets between parties reliably based on programmed instructions.Indeed, new protocols in the form of smart contracts written to the Ethereum blockchain are created often. Examples are SCs baked into tokens that define the who, what, where, and when between token purchasers and generators. Many token sales these days are an agreement to deliver a token that has not yet been created (e.g. Filecoin\u2019s recent token sale); the associated SC is programmed to distribute the new tokens appropriately once they become available.What are\u00a0DAOs?DAOs are \u201cDecentralized Autonomous Organizations\u201d that are governed by Smart Contracts. DAOs should not be confused with \u201cThe DAO\u201d, which did a token sale in May 2016 to raise ~$150m, of which ~$50m was hacked and stolen a few weeks later. This resulted in the shutdown of the organization and a fork of the Ethereum community after leaders decided to rollback the code and give the money back to the victims.An example of an active DAO today is Maker, which\u200a\u2014\u200aas mentioned above\u200a\u2014\u200agrants MKR token holders the right to govern an underlying currency (DAI). The job of MKR token holders is to minimize the price volatility DAI against the IMF\u2019s reserve asset, SDR. You can learn more about MKR and DAI in depth by reading their white paper here.Big picture, the future of DAOs could be in autonomous organizations like, for example, a global fleet of self-driving cars using programmed rules to operate. Instead of being owned by a central authority, they could own themselves and use profits to add to their fleet, drive themselves to repair shops and pay for services, etc\u2026So yes, Uber & Lyft, be prepared for disruption by one or more robotic, AI-driven DAOs.Author\u2019s note: thanks in advance for any/all feedback, corrections, and comments to this article.

To have meaningful analytics and quantify performance businesses need to be able to analyse data\u200a\u2014\u200asomething that is being generated at an unprecedented rate.Forget mega-, giga- and terabytes. By 2020 it is estimated that there will be a collective 44 zettabytes of data to handle. When a zettabyte equals a trillion gigabytes, it gives some idea of the scale and abundance of information out there.The Age Of Big\u00a0DataBig Data is the term used to encapsulate the sheer scale of data we currently generate, both structured and unstructured. From the amount alone, conventional methods of parsing and analysing data will often fall short, unable to perform the numerous and complex processes required to analyse, interpret and generate meaningful patterns and results.The Four\u00a0VsWhen discussing Big Data there are four key concepts to consider, affectionately referred to as The Four Vs. In this series we\u2019ll be expanding on each of these key characteristics of Big Data separately, but let\u2019s introduce them up front for now:VolumeVelocityVarietyVeracityVolume is the first and perhaps most obvious attribute. As mentioned above, there\u2019s a phenomenal amount of data out there already, with more being added every day. Estimates suggest as much as 2.5 quintillion bytes per day.The increasing reliance on cloud storage has more companies moving to a model where they can embrace Big Data and the valuable information it contains for their business. Having more raw data available to analyse allows for better, more informed decision-making.But this brings its own set of challenges.Big Data And BlockchainSome of the more obvious benefits of blockchain for Big Data, such as the security and traceability of the distributed ledger, will be covered in future articles. However, when it comes to volume, the biggest asset of blockchain is the networking of so many computers and their processing power. This unique aspect, fundamental to the execution of blockchain technology, allows data to be handled on a huge scale, similar to cloud storage, but without the vulnerabilities of a centralised server, to hacking for example.What Does This Mean For Marketing?The clearest application is in programmatic advertising. By having incredibly specific user information and behaviour data available to them, companies can reduce the risk of advertisements being closed or blocked, as they\u2019ll be targeted to the right person at the right time.That level of specificity, of truly personalised ad targeting, is only possible through Big Data processing.The key to processing Big Data successfully and efficiently, is blockchain technology.To find out the other benefits blockchain is bringing to marketing, specifically Big Data, check out the other posts in this series.Read All Parts In Our Blockchain Marketing Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact Of Blockchain On Marketing: Volume (This article above)Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Velocity Coming SoonPart 3\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Variety Coming SoonPart 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Potential Impact of Blockchain on Marketing: Veracity Coming SoonYou May Also Be Interested In Our Blockchain Education Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain: Is It Secure?Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Apply To Cyber Security?Part 3\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Create Transparency?Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Blockchain Ensures That No-One Can Impersonate The Owner Of An AddressPart 5\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Ways Of Handling Real-world Identity On The BlockchainPart 6\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat Sybil Attacks Are And Possible MitigationsPart 7\u200a\u2014\u200aImproved Confidentiality and Data IntegrityFor more information regarding MEDIA Protocol find us on our social channels below:Website: www.mediaprotocol.orgFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MEDIAProtocolTwitter: https://twitter.com/MEDIA_ProtocolLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/media-protocol/Telegram: https://t.me/Media_Protocol_Community and https://t.me/MP_AnnouncementsMedium: https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsmYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MEDIAProtocol", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "Disrupting the eSports Coaching Market with Blockchain & Asura\u00a0Coins", "author_name": "Asura World", "link": "https://medium.com/@asuracoin/disrupting-the-esports-coaching-market-with-blockchain-asura-coins-984f8d7b17ab?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 6, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "912", "content": "Disrupting the eSports Coaching Market with Blockchain & Asura\u00a0CoinsAsura WorldBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 6, 2018For schools you have teachers, for Universities you have lecturers & Professors, even for the many Sports you have Coaches of all levels, so why are there hardly any Coaches for gamers?For decades now, gaming has been viewed as a waste of time, something only kids play while growing up. However the current time speaks differently, eSports being one of the fastest and largest growing markets in the world, players being offered long term sponsorships, full-time salaries just like any other profession and unbelievable tournament prize pools. All these are leading factors in pioneering the current and future eSports market towards a more established and recognized profession.Even in China now, there are now \u201ceSport schools\u201d teaching and grooming students to play videos as a future profession, these schools offer a full curriculum around eSports just like any other traditional subject. [Source]Centralized & Forced SubscriptionsScattered around the internet there currently are a few eSport Coaching & Guides platforms, however these platforms are all centralized and run on a subscription basis, forcing users to pay a set fee to access their content.But what if you just want a specific guide? or you only want to learn about a certain hero/champion? or you only want to learn from a specific Coach?\u00a0With the current platforms, that\u2019s not possible. You\u2019d have to sign up to their subscription plan to access what you want.The Asura World\u00a0SolutionAsura World\u2019s Professional Coaching & Guides platform offers a completely opposite solution. Being operated on NEO blockchain, this enables Asura World to offer a decentralized solution of payment procedures combined with the advantages of Asura World\u2019s own cryptocurrency, ASA coins.What this essentially means is, users have complete control over what they choose to learn and what they choose to pay for. By breaking the subscription system, Asura World can not only offer a cheaper solution, but a more tailor-made solution for everyone.Under a subscription plan, even if guides don\u2019t get viewed, coaches still get paid therefore leading to a more lazy attitude towards creating better content. But with the Asura World Professional Coaching & Guides system, it also encourages Coaches to create better content, which leads to an overall steady improvement of the community as a whole!Asura World only provides a platform for our Coaches, therefore all rewards are given directly to our content creators rather than taking \u201cfees\u201d.So we ask ourselves, why should eSport coaching be available only to professional players?

It\u2019s viewable by anyone.Using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), data is stored across a number of nodes shared across a digital network. With no central data source and no overall controller, it\u2019s all but impossible to manipulate from any one storage location.The data you see, is the data you get.What About Changes In The\u00a0Data?Each amendment is added to the ledger in much the same way as a new transaction would be. This way there is always a record of the previous state, as well as where the change was made, when it was made, and which verified entity made it.This creates a comprehensive, public record of every transaction and subsequent change.How Is This Different From A Closed\u00a0System?Firstly it\u2019s important to understand what a closed system is.Think Google.Think Facebook.On these platforms data is exchanged and transactions are made with a global network of customers. But all records of that are stored centrally in a huge database. And only the company that owns the platform has access.Not only is this more susceptible to attack, with centralised storage an easier target for hackers, but it also removes any hope of transparency.Even if data is released to customers on request, there\u2019s no way to verify the integrity of that data, and whether it has been manipulated or amended.A closed system requires trust between both parties when they transact.Recent scandals like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, where users\u2019 data has been sold to third parties, have destroyed that trust. Consumers are increasingly concerned about a system where they effectively hand over all their data to an intermediary (like Facebook or Google) who assumes complete control of it, leaving the user in the dark over what happens to it next.How Is Blockchain Better?It allows apps to be built based on verifiable data from traceable sources. When no one party controls the data, it\u2019s almost impossible to tamper with or misrepresent the records.A public, accessible ledger of every transaction is available to anyone. At the same time, identity and access to sensitive information can be governed by blockchain-generated certificates and digital signatures, a method far less open to corruption or interference than human-input models like passwords.Customers can be confident when they enter into a transaction that there will always be a record of it. For their protection.They can be sure of who they\u2019re providing data to, and how it will be used. Any attempts to break that agreement would be recorded. But, most importantly, no intermediary would have sole control over it in the first place.Blockchain disintermediates and decentralises the data exchange.Is MEDIA Protocol Better Than A Closed\u00a0System?Simply: yes.Built on blockchain, MEDIA Protocol is founded on the same principle of transparency and integrity of data.MEDIA Protocol records the interaction with each piece of promoted content. It creates a simple record of what type of interaction, which specific content, and the time. Users can see what information was logged about their interaction. They will also know that this is the only information content promoters will be able to use to make their business decisions.No filters. No interpretation. Just verifiable and transparent data.This new digital content ecosystem allows producers and publishers to build apps and customer relationships based on verifiable data, the integrity of which is unimpeachable. It creates total transparency in what promotions and rewards are offered through the Protocol, where everyone can see what they\u2019re signing up for.The creation of this public, distributed ledger of transactions where no one company can hoard or control your data, is central to this disruptive technology. You can now be sure of who you\u2019re giving information to, and how it can be used.At the same time, you can rest assured that your data is secure.Read All Parts In Our Blockchain Education Programme:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain: Is It Secure?Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Apply To Cyber Security?Part 3\u200a\u2014\u200aHow Does Blockchain Create Transparency?

There are just few good alternatives (ask anyone who\u2019s ever bought drugs in person or tried to evade tax).Now, bitcoin isn\u2019t perfect. It takes over twenty minutes for a transaction to come through properly, and if you\u2019re not careful you can make it easy to trace whom you sent money to.As a result, there are a raft of alternative coins (altcoins) which are like bitcoin, but:faster (e.g. Dash)more anonymous (e.g. Zcash)with lower transaction fees (e.g. Litecoin)with dadaist pretensions (okay, this one\u2019s just for DOGE)What they fail to mention is that at the same time, their coin is like bitcoin but without:network effectsbrand recognitionyears of being unsuccessfully attacked by the world\u2019s most sophisticated hackersrelative price stability (emphasis on relative) and liquidityBuying your monthly dose of opiates is not the same as buying a soy latte: the fact that you have to wait twenty minutes for the money to reach the drug marketplace just does not matter.And it\u2019s a similar deal with money laundering. Sure, bitcoin could\u2019ve been made more anonymous by default. But all you have to do is google \u201cbitcoin cleaning\u201d and you\u2019re fine.So, that dispenses with the people trying to sell us a more perfect and beautiful internet money. Let\u2019s turn to the other category, a much bigger and more complex one.Your Business Probably Doesn\u2019t Need To Be DecentralisedLet\u2019s take as an example Steem, and their flagship product Steemit.It\u2019s in a space that\u2019s near and dear to my heart: rewarding people for creating, discovering and sharing good stuff. People who trawl through the gravel pile of online content to find gemstones should be rewarded with something better than Reddit karma points. Few people give a shit about Reddit or HN karma. At least with retweets they get exposure and new followers, but that\u2019s still chump change compared to the value that comes from curation, discovery and sharing.The best way society has for rewarding people for doing useful work is with money, so let\u2019s do that instead, the idea goes. So far so good.But Steemit sucks as a product, and has barely improved since their launch over a year ago. They will never take people away from Reddit at the rate they\u2019re going, even though they raised millions with their ICO. I tried to use it, I really did. Now, if Steem were one of the coins available for margin trading on Poloniex I\u2019d be shorting them. Their product is built on top of a brittle, slow (compared to, you know, a normal database), potentially unsafe, potentially irrelevant-in-the-future blockchain platform, for no good reason.Solving the \u201crewarding-creators-and-discoverers\u201c problem doesn\u2019t require decentralisation. No one is going to shut down a version of Reddit that rewards people with money for being the first to discover good stuff. Steemit doesn\u2019t need a blockchain, it needs better branding, design, copywriting, and most importantly the ability to iterate their product quickly. They need to be able to throw features at the funnel and see what converts. You know, that thing where you build a business on the internet.Centralisation has huge advantagesAs another example, let\u2019s look at IPFS and Filecoin. I think they\u2019re super fun and cool. But the only things I\u2019d build on top of them would either be for activists or criminals. Those are the only people who need a way to store data like that, whatever the third season of Silicon Valley is telling us.Richard is actually a lesson in what not to do. More like Silly Con Valley\u00a0amiriteFor the vast majority of businesses, it\u2019s more important that your files are stored safely and cheaply, and can reach your users quickly. There is currently no better way to do this than to use Google, Amazon et al\u2019s futuristic datacenters and CDN tech, and by the time Filecoin is ready, those corporations will be even further ahead in whatever robot- and AI-driven stuff they\u2019re doing in those big rectangular prisms.I\u2019m all for playing with fun crypto tech, but I sure wouldn\u2019t invest in a business- or consumer-facing startup that planned to use it for their primary datastore.What about prediction markets?I\u2019ve been obsessed with prediction markets ever since I read Robin Hanson\u2019s work on Futarchy.I\u2019ve been following contenders Augur and Gnosis since their inceptions, and I don\u2019t have a lot of faith in their teams to reliably deliver. Augur in particular has been going since 2014 and they don\u2019t even have an MVP. Each platform raised tens of millions of dollars in their ICOs.It\u2019s a shame that Intrade got shut down. But compromising with the US government is obviously possible: just look at PredictIt.org. They did a roaring trade on the 2016 election, while the Augur team were presumably reading Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin\u2019s latest whitepaper on how the network could theoretically do more than seven transactions per second, and scratching their heads. (Side note: Vitalik is a genius, but still human.)In the worst case, where the US government just wouldn\u2019t play ball, they could\u2019ve tried to find a place that would. In fact, that\u2019s what PredictIt did initially. They started in New Zealand, where they could experiment unencumbered before making the jump to the US. But, working around governments? Lobbying? Moving countries? That sounds like a lot of annoying, boring work. How much cooler and more fun would it be to do it with Ethereum, instead, right? It\u2019s like they haven\u2019t read PG\u2019s essay on schlep blindness.If I sound frustrated, it\u2019s because I want Augur to be a real thing that I can use right now to make a bet on when George R. R. Martin\u2019s next book is coming out, but I can\u2019t, and the reason is that the founders thought that the key to making it work was the blockchain, and it\u2019s unfortunately a less sexy problem. I\u2019ve been waiting to give them my money since 2014. They are clearly doing something wrong.What about all the corporate interest?The marketing departments of big, old, uncool corporations love opportunities to look sexy, especially when all it costs them is a press release and sending some people to conferences. Let me know when they\u2019re actually using it for any significant part of their day to day operations.C comes before D in the\u00a0alphabetNapster came before BitTorrent. The walled gardens of CompuServe and AOL came before the web. Hilton came before Airbnb. Taxi companies came before Uber. And HSBC and government-issued coins came before bitcoin. Centralisation has advantages for businesses trying to find product-market fit.If you have an idea for a new business that doesn\u2019t need to be protected from the prying eyes or arbitrary gavel of a government, then don\u2019t involve a blockchain. Your lunch will get eaten by the team using technology more appropriate for solving the customer\u2019s actual problem\u200a\u2014\u200athe team who just sucks up the fact that they can be shut down at any time by The Man, that they are the single point of failure, and that they don\u2019t get to put as many buzzwords on their landing page.Hacker Noon is how hackers start their afternoons.

Maybe you just moved to a new city and want to give your new doctor access to your medical history, or perhaps you want to nominate a healthcare proxy in case of emergency or have your prescription sent to your pharmacy.Some places, like the UK or Canada, have viable national systems for exchanging patient records, but those can be vulnerable to hackers.In the United States, healthcare comes from a patchwork of private companies, which means the handling of patient data is even more fragmented. John Halamka, chief information officer at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, told MIT Technology Review last year that there are 26 different electronic medical records systems in his home city alone.In 2016, Halamka teamed up with a group of scientists at MIT to try to find a solution to the problem using blockchain. They published their white paper on the subject in August 2016, laying out their proposal for a system that would help all those disparate databases exchange data\u200a\u2014\u200aa project they called MedRec.Andy Lippman, a senior research scientist at MIT, co-authored the paper with Halamka.

Second, it executes the patient\u2019s instructions as and when needed, sending data to a pharmacy or a specialist for referral\u200a\u2014\u200aassuming the patient gives their consent.

Now there are many projects working to make the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains faster(e.g. Lightning Networks, Plasma, Casper\u00a0\u2026), and some think these solutions will solve the scaling problem. Other projects are trying to solve the scaling problem by building new \u201cscalability first\u201d blockchains (e.g. EOS, Dfinity, Cosmos).Hashgraph is solving for the scaling problem through their DAG (Direct Acyclic Graph), which works by combining the gossip protocol with a voting algorithm that enables Hashgraph to to reach consensus quickly and securely without proof of work. Instead of the 3\u20137 transactions per second (TPS) that the Bitcoin blockchain enables, or the 10\u201320 TPS that Ethereum can handle, Hashgraph promises to process hundreds of thousands of TPS, surpassing Visa\u2019s current network transaction speeds.Developers will be able to use Hashgraph technology via a token needed to make a micro-payment to the company for API calls. Until now, Hashgraph was for permissioned based enterprise applications. The key announcement at the event was Hedera, a public blockchain on top of the Hashgraph consensus algorithm. You can watch the entire event on YouTube, or you can save some time and read this post highlighting the five most interesting things I learned at the event.1. Hedera Not Only Solves For Throughput, It Also Solves For StabilityWhile Hashgraph was first used for enterprise applications, Phase II is \u201cHedera\u201d, a public network that rides on top of the existing Hashgraph Consensus Protocol. On top of that platform is a Cryptocurrency service (i.e. a Hedera token) that supports that native micro transactions necessary for the platform to function. There is also a distributed file storage system for applications built on top of the platform. Finally, Hedera will support Solidity scripts to enable smart contracts.Hadera belevees it uniquely addresses the four requirements of a public distributed ledger:The technology enables hundreds of thousands of transactions a secondHedera is aBFT (Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant), making it highly resistant to distributed denial of service attacks.Hashgraph believes that it has attained a unique level of \u201cStability\u201d relative to the other public blockchains by leveraging it\u2019s \u201cstate proof\u201d mechanism, and patents, Hedera can\u2019t be forked.Hedera is deploying a split governance model of open consensus combined with permission governance. Anyone who wants, can operate a node. But the organization will be overseen by a governance model mirrored after that of Visa, which was conceived by Dee Hock in the 60s. There are 39 organizations that will make up the governing council. The governance terms are being finalized, after which the 39 members will be announced.Finally, Hashgraph is providing transparency by releasing the source code for open review.There is a test network up and running today on three continents built on top of the Hashgraph Consensus platform. This is all happening now. The Test Network is restricted to internal testing and a few Beta customers. It will begin to be opened up to additional Beta customers later this year.2. Hedera Hashgraph\u2019s Performance Surpasses Credit Card\u00a0QualityMajor credit cards like Visa average about 2,000 transactions a second, with peaks reaching 50,000 transactions a second, while maintaining service standards of 7 seconds max. Hedera has achieved 100,000 transactions a second, across 8 regions, with a latency of just 3.3 seconds.Those speeds will revolutionize the types of applications that will be able to run on a Blockchain.3. Hashgraph Has A Large & Growing CommunityIn addition to the 3,000+ developers in their communities, more than 50,000 people have signed up for regular daily emails.Community is a major element driving success of Crypto projects, and few projects have achieved the scale Hadera has already achieved.4. Hashgraph Is Providing Two $500,000 Grants To Further Foster The Distributed Ledger CommunitiesThe Distributed Ledger Foundation will work to inform governments about what Crypto regulations should look like around the world. The Foundation\u2019s roadshow starts May 9th at the Stanford School of Law & Informatics. They\u2019ll discuss standards for smart contracts and how voting works in the new systems. There will be similar conferences in London in July, Amsterdam in September, and Singapore in November.Via smartphones, and leveraging biometircs (e.g. a retinal scan or fingerprint) to validate their identity, Hadera will be supporting initiatives use technology to improve the voting process. Through a second $500,000 grant, the Distributed Ledger Foundation will provide support to projects addressing the major issues in voting like voter fraud, voter suppression, and voter intimidation, by determining the best practices and standards for distributed ledger voting.5. Hedera Has Multiple Beta Users, Across Industries, Using The Tech For Mission Critical Applications At\u00a0ScaleXtremepush is leveraging Hedera to solve for click fraud.CU Ledger is serving 250 million credit union members around the world and using Hedera to solve for a part of the cross border international payments process.Intiva Health is using Hedera to solve for the ongoing credentialing of doctors, nurses and other health care professionalsThe game studio Machine Zone, with over hundreds of millions of game downloads, is leveraging Hedera to solve for Satori, a distributed AI Mesh, which can process 500 million events a second. A highlight of the Hadera conference was the thirteen minute talk given by Machine Zone CEO.Everyone at the conference came away even more excited about Crypto\u2019s potential to change the world as the technical problems, like throughput, get solved. I also came away pretty sure that DAGs are a thing.If you liked what you read, go ahead and \u201cClap\u201d below so others will see it too (up to 50 claps allowed!).", "responses": "13"}, {"title": "When do you need blockchain?

Birch\u00a0ModelOk this was a joke, but I like it. It is true that you don\u2019t need blockchain per se, you need a solution to some problems that eventually could be a blockchain.Birch-Brown-Parulava modelThis is a good model that does not focus on the technology but on the distributed ledger concept, helpful to sort permissionless Vs permissioned ledgers out. Minor comment: it is not fully MECE because we could have a public network (\u201canyone can use\u201d) maintained by a privileged group of validators (~Ripple), and private validators could be incentivized as well.B. Suichies\u00a0ModelThis model introduces the differences between public and private. Corda is typically an inter-firm effort building an hybrid DL platform. Personally I think an intra-firm blockchain doesn\u2019t make sense\u200a\u2014\u200aif in the past you couldn\u2019t solve the reconciliation of the data shared across your group, it means you have larger issues (IT architecture budget systematically cut, regulatory constraints, etc.)\u2026 probably a blockchain won\u2019t help.IBM modelThis model acknowledges that you need a \u201cmarket\u201d approach. But the step 2 should lead to \u201calternative approaches\u201d as smart contracts can only manage simple business logic (lesson from The DAO). A strong need for privacy should also be dissuasive: do you want to share data or keep it private? Pick one.A. Lewis\u00a0modelAntony has an excellent blog on Bitcoin, Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers. I like the second question very much: \u201cCould this have been fixed before blockchain?\u201d. Blockchain is composed of existing pieces of technology (a bit of cryptography, a P2P consensus protocol and basic storage capabilities), so it is key to ask yourself why you couldn\u2019t use these pieces of technology before.My model (as of Aug.\u00a02016)Well I thought about creating a smart tree to decide whether one needs a blockchain or not, but I ended up with a questionnaire\u00a0:-)If you have 10/10, congratulations you might be building the next Bitcoin or Ethereum system!Now the less \u2018ticks\u2019 you have, the more trade-offs and customization you need and the less blockchain technology is relevant for your business issue. Probably below 7/10 blockchain technology doesn\u2019t make sense\u200a\u2014\u200ayou might still try to build a shared ledger but don\u2019t call it a blockchain.Karl W\u00fcstl and Arthur Gervais (may\u00a02017)Good model here except that \u201cblockchain\u201d is not defined and it comes a bit late because that we are already far beyond the public/private permissioned/permissionles debate\u00a0:-)Morgen E.

Originally published on Quora.You probably don\u2019t think about the warranty on your oven or refrigerator all that often.That is, until something goes wrong. Then you start frantically paging through the warranty to see whether or not you\u2019re covered.It should be a simple process to determine if your warranty will save you from paying for repairs. But the warranty industry\u2019s supply chain has a number of issues and inefficiencies that roadblock this process for both companies and consumers.False claims, fake products, and confusion about coverage are some of the most common issues companies face. And these are passed on to consumers in the form of tedious processes and poor customer experiences.But there is a better way for warranty companies to verify claims. Blockchain has the potential to help streamline the industry by securing supply chains and providing track-and-trace capabilities for products under warranty.Here\u2019s how:The industry is up against many challenges and complexities.Most people feel as though they\u2019re getting the runaround when they process a claim.They spend hours on the phone trying fruitlessly to prove their issue is covered. But warranty claims are much trickier than many imagine.Warranty companies are in a constant battle, trying to avoid paying fraudulent claims on products or issues they don\u2019t cover. And counterfeit products entering the supply chain add an extra layer of complexity to their job.Much of the trouble comes from information gaps between manufacturers, distributors, warranty companies, and consumers.A clear reason for these gaps is lack of consumer insight. Most warranties are located somewhere in the back of a thick booklet of product information and directions. They often require the consumer to fill out a form and mail it back to the manufacturer.But the vast majority of people never do, and that creates a major information gap. The manufacturer doesn\u2019t know for certain where their products are ending up. They only know which distributors they sell to.And because the manufacturer can\u2019t follow the paths their products take, the warranty company has no way of knowing whether the product they\u2019re covering is the real thing.Blockchain will be able to track the chain of\u00a0custody.Blockchain helps solve this problem by closing information gaps.Using a serial number or a tamper-proof cryptographic seal, companies can track the progress of a product from the manufacturer to the consumer. They can verify through immutable blockchain-based proofs that the product has moved on to the wholesaler, retailer, and consumer.So when a product is manufactured, the manufacturer creates a record of it on blockchain. As the product moves through the supply chain, it is verified and recorded at each touchpoint until a consumer buys it.When a customer calls in about the product, the warranty company is able to check the record to see if there is proven path from the manufacturer all the way to the consumer. If so, they have proof the product they\u2019re paying a claim for is authentic.Keeping fake products out of the supply chain benefits everyone.Removing counterfeits protects the manufacturer\u2019s brand and the distributor\u2019s reputation.The warranty company is protected from fraudulent claims on counterfeit items. The retailer has an additional value proposition in their pitch to upsell customers on a warranty. And the consumer can be sure they\u2019re getting the real thing.Checking a warranty on blockchain will become a\u00a0breeze.Once the supply chain is secure and product identities are registered to blockchain, warranty claim resolutions will happen in seconds.Let\u2019s say I buy a refrigerator. I flip through the thick instruction packet that comes with it, fill out the warranty, and register my fridge. Or the registration can happen automatically at the point of sale. For the next year, all is well.Suddenly, my fridge won\u2019t cool. So, I call the warranty company and submit my claim. With a blockchain system, the person who answers my call can immediately check whether or not my product is covered based on its blockchain identity. They simply look up the serial number to check the product\u2019s record and verify the warranty.And if they\u2019re not sure whether my specific problem is covered under the warranty, they can send a service person to my home. Once the problem is diagnosed, the repair technician can immediately pull out a phone that links to the blockchain system and check whether my issue is covered under the warranty.Although this is a simple version of the workings behind the process, blockchain will provide some much-needed visibility into the supply chain for warranty companies.Coupled with the ability to weed out counterfeits, this system will greatly reduce the time and money spent identifying fraudulent claims.By Ajit Kulkarni, VP of Product at Chronicled Inc (2017-present).

Sick of hearing nonsense like SHA256 algorithms and byzantine fault tolerance? Just want to know what the hell blockchain is and why people keep talking about\u00a0it?Well you\u2019re in luck. In this article, I\u2019ll explain in plain English what blockchain is, how it works and why it\u2019s so important in less than 1000 words. Let\u2019s get to it.What is blockchain?At its core, a blockchain is not so different from a regular database. It stores information on things that happened in the past, with unique attributes, such as:Decentralisation\u200a\u2014\u200ano single party has control over what information goes inConsensus\u200a\u2014\u200amany different parties store exact copies of the same ledger, so the majority has to agree on the information being added\u2018Add-only\u2019, meaning you can\u2019t edit what\u2019s already there, you can only add informationNew information can\u2019t conflict with what\u2019s already been addedInformation is able to be accessed and replicated by everybody on the networkThe most important feature of a blockchain is decentralisation. Copies of a blockchain ledger are stored and updated on computers all over the world, meaning that there is no central authority to make decisions.At its core, a blockchain is not so different from a regular database. It stores information on things that happened in the past, but with unique attributes.Let\u2019s take a look at a Bitcoin transaction as an example of how blockchain works (Bitcoin is just one possible application of blockchain technology. Blockchain is to Bitcoin what the internet is to email):Let\u2019s say I have one bitcoin and I want to send it to you. Everybody who holds a copy of the Bitcoin ledger can see that I have one bitcoin and you have zero (but on the Bitcoin network our identities are relatively private).I can then send you one bitcoin, and the network will see this and immediately update every ledger.But what if I\u2019m greedy, and want to try cheat the network?I could change my copy of the ledger to say I have 2 bitcoins, send you one and use the other to buy myself something nice.But in the history of the Bitcoin network this act of double-spending has never happened.Why not?Blockchain securityTo understand how and why blockchains are so resistant to tampering and fraud, we need to understand how they work.Without getting too technical, let\u2019s take a look under the hood and see what\u2019s going on.The information stored on a blockchain is stored in groups\u200a\u2014\u200acalled blocks\u200a\u2014\u200aand each block is time-stamped and linked to the one generated before it in time, creating a linear chain of blocks\u200a\u2014\u200ahence the term blockchain.Each of these blocks contains 3 types of information:Data on transactionsThe block\u2019s hashThe hash of the previous blockThis is really important, so bear with me while I explain what a hash is. Essentially it\u2019s like a block\u2019s fingerprint\u200a\u2014\u200aa unique string of numbers that identifies each block. The numbers are automatically calculated based on the information stored in the block. If you change the information in the block you change the hash, and therefore the block\u2019s identity.The hash of the previous block also sits in each block, which is what creates the chain of blocks, and is what makes a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin so secure.Take a look at this graphic:Each block contains the three elements listed above. But watch what happens when I try to tamper with the information in block 2 to give myself that extra bitcoin:Block 3 contains the hash of block 2, but when block 2 is changed, so does its hash, meaning everything in block 3 and beyond becomes invalid, breaking the chain.I\u2019d then need to re-calculate the hashes of every block that has changed.But it doesn\u2019t stop there. The Bitcoin network makes it intentionally difficult to find these hashes. On average, the hash for a block is found every 10 minutes by computers constantly guessing random numbers and seeing if one fits (it\u2019s actually a lot more complicated than this). This process is called \u2018proof-of-work\u2019 (PoW), and is done by powerful computers called miners.So for every block I stuffed up, it would take me 10 minutes of intense calculation to mine each block and find the correct hashes.And that\u2019s just for my copy of the ledger.The Bitcoin ledger exists on thousands of computers all over the world, so to fake that transaction, I\u2019d need to somehow get access to over 50% of the computers, and repeat the mining process for all the ledgers I control.This is insanely expensive from a computational standpoint, as I\u2019d need an almost impossible number of computers to pull it off.But by the time I did, and was able to give myself bitcoins at will, the rest of the network will have noticed. They would either try to kick me off, or would desert Bitcoin in droves, crashing the price and leaving me with control over a worthless currency.So it\u2019s pretty easy to see that blockchains are incredibly resistant to fraud, and why they\u2019re considered \u2018trustless\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest to play by the rules.So why is all this important?That\u2019s a good question. Blockchain technology is still very much in its infancy, but promises to revolutionise many different industries, such as:Banking and\u00a0paymentsBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Monero and Zcash are making the storage and transfer of value simpler and cheaper by removing the need for middlemen such as banks.GovernmentsGovernments can use blockchains to implement secure and accurate voting, public record keeping, citizen identification (IDs) and border control.HealthcareMedical records are notoriously inaccurate and difficult to transfer. If they were hosted on a blockchain they would be secure, accurate and easily accessible by approved parties.Supply chainWant to know if those apples are actually organic? Or if that diamond ring is sourced ethically? Putting goods like these on the blockchain would allow consumers and businesses to gain greater transparency on the lifecycle of their products.InsuranceNo more calling up and hassling your insurer for weeks before getting your payout. With the implementation of smart contracts on the blockchain, insurers would be able to instantly accept and pay out claims to customers based on predefined rules.", "responses": "13"}, {"title": "PROYECTO SUIZO COMBINA BLOCKCHAIN E INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL PARA REINVENTAR LAS\u00a0FINANZAS", "author_name": "Mariyam Segu\u00edas", "link": "https://medium.com/lapoblockchain/proyecto-suizo-combina-blockchain-e-inteligencia-artificial-para-reinventar-las-finanzas-39407e90c400?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 7, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "9.1K", "content": "PROYECTO SUIZO COMBINA BLOCKCHAIN E INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL PARA REINVENTAR LAS\u00a0FINANZASMariyam Segu\u00edasBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 7, 2018LAPO Blockchain anunci\u00f3 recientemente su plataforma integrada de servicios financieros, LAPO ePlatform, que pone a disposici\u00f3n de negocios, comerciantes y consumidores, un conjunto de herramientas financieras desarrolladas bajo la tecnolog\u00eda de Blockchain e impulsadas por inteligencia artificial.Su dise\u00f1o, centrado en el ser humano, permite que estas herramientas puedan ser usadas incluso por aquellos que no son expertos en tecnolog\u00eda.

Fact is, this will have (and already has) a major impact in organisations both large and small. In this post I will highlight some topics on how GDPR relates to blockchain technology. Especially on how GDPR has the opposite effect in some ways, when it comes to making Blockchain Architecture compliant with GDPR.An overly dramatic\u00a0imageThe Blockchain partTo explain why GDPR has to opposite effect in certain areas when applied to blockchain technology, we need to go over some basic concepts first.Encryption and\u00a0hashingBoth encryption and hashing are fundamental to blockchain technologies. In short, hashing is a one-way transformation of data to an unreadable piece of data (hash value). With encryption you can have a two-way transformation: You encrypt data with a certain key, so it becomes unreadable. With this key you can always decrypt this unreadable piece of data to the original value.Immutability of transactionsBy now, you will have heard that transactions on a blockchain are immutable. You cannot change these transactions once they are written on a blockchain. You cannot delete this data, since this would \u2018break the chain\u2019 in a sense, rendering the complete blockchain useless.TransparencyAs an individual, you can browse through the complete history of all bitcoin transactions, making the transactions on this public blockchain technology completely transparent. Transparency in private blockchains is another matter, but it is still guaranteed in other ways.Public vs PermissionedThis post will be focused on permissioned blockchains\u200a\u2014\u200awhere nodes are permissioned hosted\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough a lot of arguments below are still applicable to public blockchains.CRUD vs\u00a0CRABCRUD stands for Create-Read-Update-Delete. These are the basic operations of persistent storage. Now remember from the basic blockchain topics mentioned above, that you cannot delete written transactions on a blockchain. Even updating existing transactions cannot be done, since they are immutable. Therefore the \u2018CRUD\u2019 operations are not the droids you are looking for!Instead, operations on blockchain can be described as CRAB: Create-Retrieve-Append-Burn. This concept of \u2018CRAB\u2019 is invented by the folks from BigChainDB. The Create and Retrieve don\u2019t need explanation. The Append, which replaces Update, means that you can only append new transactions to a blockchain technology, therefor changing the \u2018world state\u2019 (sum of all past events/transactions up until now). According to BigChainDB, the Burn operation in CRAB means that you throw away the encryption keys, so you are unable to Append new transactions and change the world-state any further of this asset. Instead of forgetting your encryption key, you can also also set the transaction to an \u201cunsolvable\u201d private key by choosing a completely random public key, thereby locking yourself and everyone else out. When using the CRAB terminology on other blockchain technologies, you could also\u200a\u2014\u200afor example\u200a\u2014\u200ainterpret the Burn operation as throwing away encryption keys so you are unable to decrypt the actual data that is written on a blockchain technology. But we will come back to this.The GDPR\u00a0partThe complete official GDPR document can be consulted freely on the internet. The term \u2018erasure\u2019 and \u2018erase\u2019 are found 12 times in this document at the time of this writing (the website offers an easy search method).An important aspect of GDPR on blockchain is the fact that personal data is not to leave the EU. This is a major problem with public blockchains, since there is no control on who hosts a node. This is less an issue when it comes to private or permissioned blockchains. To tackle this problem, IPDB set up a foundation that could insure data stays in the EU because it is public accessible (client) but permissioned hosted (node) blockchain.There is also a separate section\u200a\u2014\u200aArt. 17\u200a\u2014\u200aon \u2018Right to be Forgotten\u2019. This concept is clearly an important one regarding \u2018erasure of data\u2019. However, not anywhere in the document, not even in the definitions part\u200a\u2014\u200aArt. 4\u200a\u2014\u200ais there any explanation of what the term erasure of data actually means.The GDPR initiative probably had only CRUD in mind (\u201cyou are always able to Delete information\u201d) when dealing with basic operations on persistent storage. The fact that this doesn\u2019t match with blockchain technology creates some friction. Now, because there is no definition in GDPR of \u201cerasure of data\u201d at this point, you probably need to interpret this as strict, which means that throwing away your encryption keys which encrypts personal data in a blockchain technology is not acceptable as \u2018erasure of data\u2019 according to GDPR.The WorkaroundOf course, this has consequences on what we can store on a blockchain. Storing personal data on a blockchain is not an option anymore according to GDPR. A popular option to get around this problem is a very simple one: You store the personal data off-chain and store the reference to this data, along with a hash of this data and other metadata (like claims and permissions about this data), on the blockchain. To see how this works in a permissioned blockchain, consider the picture below. There are 2 companies (called BlueCompany and GreenCompany) with each there own back-ends, both connected to a blockchain.A simplified off-chain structure which is GDPR CompliantSuppose GreenCompany wants to read the MyAddress value, he now has to do the following steps:Since GreenCompany does not know where MyAddress is stored, he sends a request to the blockchain layer for fetching the specific data.The blockchain can verify if the requestor (GreenCompany) has the necessary access rights to read this data. If the requestor has the proper authorisation, he gets the link and the hash of the requested data. (The link can be anything, like an API-endpoint including access tokens, or a database connection-string,\u00a0\u2026) So here, your blockchain acts as an \u201caccess control\u201d medium.Based on the link, the requestor can fetch the data directly from BlueCompany\u2019s back-end without going through the blockchain again.Upon receiving the data from BlueCompany\u2019s back-end, GreenCompany can verify if this data has not been tampered with by calculating the hash of the retrieved data, and comparing it with the hash given by the blockchain. If they match, the data has not been tampered with.As you can see, this workaround has increased the overall complexity of fetching and storing data on a blockchain. Next, we\u2019ll discuss the consequences of this approach.A compromise is rarely good for\u00a0businessI specifically used the term \u2018Workaround\u2019 above, to emphasise that the results of this approach are never as effective as storing and retrieving personal data straight from the blockchain (GDPR concerns aside). Let\u2019s cover the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of this approach.The ProsThe approach described above is a 100% GDPR compliant solution, which makes it possible to completely erase data in the off-chain storage. Thereby rendering the links and hashes stored on the blockchain completely useless.In this scenario, you use the blockchain primarily as an \u2018access control\u2019 medium, where claims are publicly verifiable. This would give someone the means to prove that some node should not store the data after an opt-out. Of course, this benefit can also be present when personal data is indeed stored on a blockchain.The ConsOh boy, here we go\u2026The benefit of transparency with blockchain is reduced. By storing your data off-chain, you have no way of knowing for sure who accessed your data, and who has access to your data. Once GreenCompany has the link to retrieve the data, he is not bound anymore by going through the blockchain. Maybe the link gets stored in their own database so they don\u2019t have to pass by the blockchain again for new retrievals, the link gets stolen, <insert other doom-scenarios here>,\u00a0\u2026The benefit of data-ownership with blockchain is reduced. Once your data has been stored off-chain, who owns it? The company who owns the database where your data is in? At least with blockchain technology, it is the data-owner has has all the encryption-keys to administer his own data.You still need a point-to-point integration between all the participating parties. After getting the link from the blockchain, you need a way to get data from BlueCompany to GreenCompany. For every new party added to the system, you will need to add new point-to-point integrations with each existing member, as well as provision a secure PKI.You are reducing your blockchain to a mere lookup table, thereby throwing away a lot of benefits that comes with this technology.(As a side-note: using your blockchain only as a lookup table is how a lot of companies get in the media with their \u2018solution\u2019, which\u200a\u2014\u200adepending on the use case\u200a\u2014\u200ais not enough.)More attack vectors. Each company has their own infrastructure and application landscape. By spreading the personal data over these different companies, the risk increases for a potential breach where part of this personal information can be stolen.Added complexity. Added complexity = Increased risk of unintended errors. Resulting in less secure systems.The ParadoxAnd here is the paradox: The goal of GPDR is to \u201cgive citizens back the control of their personal data, whilst imposing strict rules on those hosting and \u2018processing\u2019 this data, anywhere in the world.\u201d Also, one of the things GDPR states is that data \u201cshould be erasable\u201d. Since throwing away your encryption keys is not the same as \u2018erasure of data\u2019, GDPR prohibits us from storing personal data on a blockchain level. Thereby losing the ability to enhance control of your own personal data.", "responses": "37"}, {"title": "Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee of IAMAI on references to \u2018Cryptocurrency\u2019 by the Finance Minister of\u00a0India", "author_name": "Zebpay", "link": "https://blog.zebpay.com/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-committee-of-iamai-on-references-to-cryptocurrency-by-the-finance-5d0cc63d61c7?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 1, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "2.2K", "content": "Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee of IAMAI on references to \u2018Cryptocurrency\u2019 by the Finance Minister of\u00a0IndiaZebpayBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 1, 2018The Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee (BACC) of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) is happy that the Finance Minister has recognized the importance and popularity of cryptocurrency, and has chosen to talk about it on budget day.

That doesn\u2019t make any comment on the \u2018illegality\u2019 of other assets. It must be emphasized that gold, stocks, bonds, and other such assets are also not \u2018legal tender\u2019. To extrapolate that to mean that such assets are \u2018illegal\u2019 is irresponsible.It must be emphasized that gold, stocks, bonds, and other such assets are also not \u2018legal tender\u2019. To extrapolate that to mean that such assets are \u2018illegal\u2019 is irresponsible.(ii) Every citizen and business in this country should play their role in eliminating financing of illegitimate activities, regardless of whether such financing is done using legal tender, cryptocurrency, gold, or any other medium. We welcome this move by the Government, and want to wholeheartedly support the Government in this move. Our members already maintain a no-compromise approach to KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money laundering) processes. We encourage the Government to work with our members, as we are committed to detect, report, and eliminate suspicious transactions in pretty much the same way as other institutions do. This will also generate confidence in our banking partners.(iii) We understand the Government\u2019s position in wanting to eliminate the use of crypto-assets as part of the payment system. Since we are committed to support every regulation that the Government brings in, we will work with the Government to help it achieve its stated objective.When a platform as significant as the Union Budget speech mentions cryptocurrencies, it is clear that the sector is coming of age. We welcome this positive development, and see it as an important milestone in the journey to policy-clarity and consumer-education.Contact Person: Ajeet Khurana, Head, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee (BACC) of IAMAI", "responses": "18"}, {"title": "Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies & the New Decentralized Economy: Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aA Gentle Introduction", "author_name": "Ashley Lannquist", "link": "https://blockchainatberkeley.blog/blockchains-cryptocurrencies-the-new-decentralized-economy-part-1-a-gentle-introduction-edcb4824b174?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 27, 2017", "readtime": "11 min read", "upvotes": "1.1K", "content": "Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies & the New Decentralized Economy: Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aA Gentle IntroductionAshley LannquistBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 27, 2017Blockchain is the most important technology you might not yet understand.It is building a future that can be more decentralized and democratic, whose beneficiaries could range widely from Syrian refugees to investment banks. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2027, 10% of global GDP will be stored on blockchain technology.Rapidly evolving blockchain technology and startups could fundamentally change entire business models, fundraising models, business operations, payments systems, and more. Despite the importance of this emerging technology, much unfamiliarity surrounds the topic.The purpose of this essay, divided into three parts, is to 1) explain blockchain, cryptocurrency, and recent trends, 2) describe blockchain applications, or \u201cdecentralized apps\u201d (DApps) and their tokens, and 3) elucidate how blockchain technology will be used to redesign the Internet and economy of the future.Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies Explained!The Bitcoin blockchain launched in 2009 as a peer-to-peer (P2P) digital payment system. Its creator ingeniously derived a system, using computer networks, cryptography, and game theory (now collectively called \u201ccryptoeconomics\u201d) for parties around the world who do not know each other to conduct and record transactions without an intermediary.The bitcoin \u201ccryptocurrency,\u201d which can also be called a \u201ctoken,\u201d is the digital currency that users send to transfer value in this payments system.By circumventing intermediaries, users can send value across borders using the Bitcoin blockchain for extremely low fees (historically less than 50 cents per transaction, regardless of the amount sent).Blockchain technology\u2019s game theory component is essential: It establishes incentives and disincentives based on pure economic rationality and self-interest for participants to validate transactions in the network and to play by the rules. It underlies the self-regulating mechanisms in decentralized networks and applications.Game theory also informs the robustness of the network to malicious activity from harmful or adversarial actors within its system. This robustness is usually described in terms of \u201cbyzantine fault tolerance\u201d (BFT) or \u201cfault tolerance\u201d and is based on the Byzantine General\u2019s Problem that states that no more than 33% of the network participants can be malevolent to maintain the system\u2019s integrity (in practice, the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s threshold for fault tolerance is 50%).The result is that, entirely from the bottom-up and with no centralized coordinator or guarantor, the P2P network runs smoothly and honestly in a \u201ctrustless\u201d environment where participants are self-interested and do not know one another.In fact, during the week ending June 21, 2017, 1.8 million transactions were sent over the Bitcoin network without interruption, constituting $4.4 billion of value (at a $2507 bitcoin price).In the years after 2009, several less anonymous yet still brilliant engineers have developed alternative blockchain technologies that modify and enhance the original Bitcoin system. The most noteworthy example is Ethereum, which is the second-largest system by market capitalization (defined as the number of tokens in circulation multiplied by their market price).Cryptocurrencies are the \u201cnative\u201d digital currencies that exist in blockchain systems or applications. Whereas the Bitcoin system\u2019s native cryptocurrency is bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s is called ether.All blockchains require the use of a digital currency, whether it be their own native cryptocurrencies or an existing one such as bitcoin and ether. There are about 718 cryptocurrencies in circulation as of June 27, 2017.Cryptocurrencies are necessary to operate blockchain systems, because they are the incentive mechanism for computers (\u201cnodes\u201d) in the network to conduct (\u201cvalidate\u201d or \u201cverify\u201d) transactions.Indeed, they are the reason you only pay a tiny fee to send a bitcoin transaction. The Bitcoin blockchain system compensates the nodes maintaining the network 12.5 bitcoins every time they successfully validate a set of transactions in a process called \u201cmining.\u201dMechanicsAll blockchains or similar \u201cdistributed ledger technologies\u201d (DLT) have a common set of characteristics. This is how they work:Blockchains are digital ledgers or logs that record electronic transactions that occur between two parties.The two parties do not know each other and directly engage in a peer-to-peer network of connected computers.Rather than relying on a third-party middleman (ex. PayPal, a bank, etc.), the network collectively reaches agreement (\u201cconsensus\u201d) on which transactions are legitimate using a consensus mechanism. By \u201clegitimate,\u201d we mean that, for example, Alice sends money to Bob and does not spend the same digital currency twice (called a \u201cdouble spend\u201d) or do anything else malicious.There are several types of consensus mechanisms, each with pros and cons. The main types are \u201cproof-of-work\u201d (the basis for Bitcoin and Ethereum), \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d (eventually the basis for Ethereum), and \u201cproof-of-authority\u201d (the basis for private chain setups). Proof-of-work is very wasteful of electricity, which is one reason people want to adopt other mechanisms.If you can remember 3 more things, remember these:Once the network approves the transactions, the transactions get posted to the digital log. In Bitcoin, attempted transactions are first grouped together in a block, which then gets verified all at once (by the proof-of-work mechanism) and added to a long chain of blocks. This is why it\u2019s called a \u201cblockchain\u201d!The blocks are linked together using cryptography, so that you cannot surreptitiously edit or tamper with the transaction data on a block once the block is added to the chain (or more precisely, once a subsequent block is added to the chain after it).The transaction details are transparent and verifiable by the public. However, the identities of the buyers and sellers are hidden behind their public usernames, which are long alphanumeric addresses. Here\u2019s a window into the Bitcoin blockchain. The simultaneous transparency of transactions and masking of identities is why blockchains can be used to both anonymously buy drugs and obediently report to regulators.Note that some blockchains can restrict transaction visibility and participation to designated parties; these are called \u201cpermissioned\u201d or private blockchains. Many large companies are very interested in these private blockchains, in part because they do not want proprietary or competitive data to be public. The R3 Consortium of most major banks in the world (which raised $107 million in funding in May) has developed a private blockchain system called Corda that just entered beta phase\u200a\u2014\u200aso has the Linux Foundation (with major support from IBM) with the Hyperledger Fabric.Another exciting innovation is Zcash, which allows you to hide details of transactions such as the sender, receiver, and amounts (using zk-SNARKs) while operating on a public blockchain. JPMorgan just announced a big partnership with Zcash.Robust and Secure\u00a0NetworksIn addition to offering a mechanism for peers to transact directly for free without knowing or trusting each other, data held in blockchains are robust and secure. This is because:Using cryptography, transaction information is recorded in a way that is permanent and tamper-evident. As a result, we can call the blockchain \u201cimmutable.\u201d System attacks are extremely difficult. For Bitcoin and other \u201cbyzantine fault tolerant\u201d networks, the most prominent way that data on the blockchain can be manipulated is with a concerted attack by a majority of the network participants, called a \u201c51% attack\u201d (there are different types of attacks requiring different levels of participation to succeed). Further, experts agree that the quantum computers of the future will be able to break today\u2019s cryptography schemes.The blockchain record is downloaded on thousands of computers around the world that are participating in the network. These computers constantly sync, or update, the record for new transactions. As a result of this wide data distribution, data storage is robust and there is no single site of failure that attackers can target. To delete the blockchain you would need to destroy the thousands of computers in the system all around the world.In summary, data are not stored in concentrated sites, but rather on a log that is downloaded on thousands of nodes and constantly syncing. New data locks onto the log in blocks that are connected by cryptographic hash pointers referring to preceding and subsequent transactions on the ever-growing \u201cchain\u201d of transactions.EthereumEthereum is a promising and exciting blockchain technology with a wider set of capabilities than the first-generation Bitcoin system.Whereas Bitcoin has narrow programming leeway (some compare programming capabilities to that of a graphing calculator) and is essentially a ledger of payments between parties, Ethereum\u2019s programming language can be used to quickly build new applications.Ethereum\u2019s programming language, Solidity, is easy to use and versatile. It is \u201cTuring complete,\u201d meaning that it is capable of approximately simulating the computational aspects of any other real-world general-purpose computer language, which leads to more sophisticated applications.As part of the Turing completeness of Ethereum\u2019s Solidity programming language, anyone can build conditional contracts (using \u201cif/then\u201d and other logic statements) that execute autonomously. The coded contracts are called \u201csmart contracts\u201d and can execute previously agreed upon terms.Smart contracts are a big deal: They can be considered legally enforceable and can benefit countless industries by removing time and human error from contract processes.Note that because the contracts are on the Ethereum blockchain, their code is open-sourced; public visibility motivates developers to be extremely cautious about their code so that it is not exploited by hackers to attack the program.In combination with high quality developer tools and core components (Truffle, Metamask, uPort and others) and substantial industry support (Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, along with Brooklyn-based venture studio ConsenSys), Ethereum shows great promise and popularity within the community.Ether cryptocurrency is required for the execution of code and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Users must spend a small amount of ether, called \u201cgas,\u201d to incentivize the network to conduct and verify transactions and run smart contracts. These \u201cgas\u201d transaction execution fees are the intrinsic use of ether.Most cryptocurrencies have an intrinsic use, which is to access or employ the blockchain system or application (discussed in greater detail in Part 2).For more background on blockchain, see this article by policy research and advocacy group Coin Center and this textbook by professors at Princeton.Blockchain TodayNumerous non-governmental, governmental, and for-profit institutions are actively investing in blockchain R&D to power the future. Institutions spanning the United Nations, IMF, EU Commission, U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, and National Science Foundation are investing in blockchain research initiatives.Furthermore, many governments and central banks are interested in introducing digital currencies; Vladimir Putin, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the People\u2019s Bank of China, Bank of Canada, Bank of Japan, and more have been investigating digital currencies.It is likely that nearly every major multi-national corporation has begun looking at or investing in blockchain technology, from Walmart to Western Union. In brief, using blockchain allows businesses to remove the need for central parties or brokers in various processes, eliminating the fees, human error, time, and security risks that they entail.IBM and Microsoft have established \u201cBlockchain-as-a-Service\u201d businesses, while major consulting firms including Deloitte, Accenture, and KPMG are building blockchain practices. BCG\u2019s 2016 report \u201cThinking Outside the Blocks\u201d smoothly summarizes the relevance of the technology while guiding readers through its potential corporate uses.Meanwhile, remarkable (although very volatile) returns in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether are driving public attention to the assets as speculative investments:Year-to-date as of June 27, 2017, the price of one bitcoin has risen 148% to about $2400, while the price of one ether has risen an astonishing 2900% to about $240. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies is about $98 billion. These figures vary widely with the volatile pricing dynamics.Market Cap of Cryptocurrencies Approximately $100\u00a0BillionSource: http://coinmarketcap.com/charts/Cryptocurrencies have also been grabbing headlines as a new source of startup financing. Total fundraising to blockchain startups from \u201cICOs,\u201d or initial coin offerings (discussed below), has exceeded $600 million so far this year, surpassing levels of investment funding raised from venture capital (VC) firms. This figure includes the staggering $150 million fundraising round by Israel-based startup Bancor on June 12, 2017, which was filled in less than three hours.Initial Coin Offerings: Democratized FundraisingICOs have proven to be an incredibly rapid new means of fundraising, as evidenced by multiple strong issuances this year. They potentially democratize fundraising, allowing non-traditional upstarts without traditional equity and with open-source production to raise millions of dollars.Impressively, ICOs draw on the community of blockchain enthusiasts and cryptocurrency investors to crowdfund projects. In this way, they democratize the venture capital process.In fact, while ICOs are completely open to the public, most VCs are not legally able to participate due to agreements with LPs that limit the types of securities in which they can invest.As industry thought-leader Jamie Burke put it, \u201cThe day when VCs were the elusive elite and primary source of capital for startups has ended. When a startup (Brave) can raise $35m in 30 seconds without any dilution, the genie is out of the bottle and it isn\u2019t going back in.\u201dNote that strong demand for ICOs in May and June 2017 has led to a \u201ccrowding out\u201d of small investors in favor of large \u201cwhale\u201d investors who can receive priority allocations. Some challenge whether this undermines the democratic nature of ICOs.Strong ICO interest has also led to complications and volatility in the price of ether. Many ICOs require investment in the form of ether, which drove unprecedented demand for the asset in May and June 2017. The price of ether reached new highs (above $410) in the week of June 18 during the Status token ICO, until congestion and service disruptions on exchanges led to downward price pressure and even a \u201cflash crash\u201d of ether on the GDAX exchange to $13. These pressures may have also exposed limits in the current Ethereum network. In the final week of June, the price of ether fell to the $200-$300 range.Regulation and Investment RiskAs of June 27th, cryptocurrencies are not considered public or private \u201csecurities.\u201d They are not yet regulated by the SEC, and they do not have standardized features. Some offer features similar to distributions or coupons, some offer voting rights, and most offer neither.The SEC would like to ultimately regulate ICO participation, as it does with other forms of crowdfunding, to protect retail investors from scams and losses. Currently, ICOs and tokens are not required to provide disclosures or a prospectus. Some are also not based on sound business models. With escalating hype and public awareness, more industry outsiders are investing in ICOs and tokens. Without the safety measures and transparency normally demanded by SEC regulation, investors are at risk.ConclusionBlockchains and other distributed ledger technologies have a variety of positive features and can be applied to countless industries and uses to improve efficiency, security, and operations. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether are required to execute transactions and operate the networks. They are also investable assets and sold to the public to raise capital. As such, they constitute a new form of crowdfunding and startup fundraising. Blockchain cryptocurrencies are also a new type of alternative investment, one that is not yet SEC-regulated and that can pose risks to imprudent investors.Most industry observers agree that we are in the early days of a complete restructuring of numerous processes and operations to be decentralized and on the blockchain. \u201cThis is like the Internet in the 1990s\u201d is commonly exclaimed.Blockchain VC and thought-leader Olaf Carlson-Wee has stated, \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely still in the infrastructure building phase. But I do think within one to two years, we\u2019ll start to see the first viral applications that are user facing.\u201dIn Part 2 of this essay, we explain \u201cdecentralized applications,\u201d which are apps built on blockchain technology that redesign the delivery of products and services, hopefully in the interest of the user and public.Update: Here is Part 2!If you enjoyed reading this, please log in and recommend it below.

We have improved our auditing method as follows:Added changes in ranking, so that readers can easily see how projects are progressing compared to the previous month.Added more libraries into our analytics. Last month we only analyzed the popularity and number of commits of the 2 most active libraries for projects with more than three libraries\u200a\u2014\u200athis month we have included all libraries into our observation. We have also fixed the popularity of the libraries forked from Bitcoin, such that the number of forks is no longer calculated as part of popularity.How do we\u00a0rate?Popularity of the LibraryPopularity of the Library is defined as the mean number of Watch, Star and fork. Very High: > 500, High: between 100 and 500, MediumL between 20 and 100, Low: Below 20.Number of ContributorsNumber of Contributors: The number of contributors that have committed code in the last month. High: More than 12, Medium: between 6 and 12, Low: Below 6.Release FrequencyRelease Frequency: We took the version release frequency of Bitcoin and Ethereum, 14.25 days for a new release, as a reference value. We then divide the number of average days spent for a new release by 14.25 to get a release frequency score. High: below 2, Medium: between 2 and 4, Low: above 4.e.g. The main chain of EOS has been released 35 times from 4/2/2017 to 3/1/2018, for an average of 9.51 days between new releases.

SpencerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 29, 2017The Establishment is Embracing Bitcoin in order to Manipulate ItWith the crypto singularity of November, 2017 we are seeing the start of a power play over Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and the future of the blockchain. Everyone is implicated now, regulators, central banks, nation states and world leaders.The web could have been a free place, with an emphasis on education and a decentralized paradigm of access to information and services for all world citizens, promoting small businesses. Instead we are left with a web co-opted by advertizing, a profiteering of search, ISPs who lord over us, porn and social media algorithms. In Crypto and blockchain, it\u2019s 1994 all over again, and there are signs the same forces at work could corrupt what they could become.When you think of China\u2019s \u201cBitcoin Ban\u201d, Vladimir Putin\u2019s reaction to Bitcoin and even Morgan Stanley CEO\u2019s dismissal of it, you can see the battle going on here\u200a\u2014\u200abanks, centralized states and powerful people all see a truly stateless cryptocurrency market and decentralized blockchain as a threat to their regime, control and power.With Bitcoin Futures, new regulation in Japan and South Korea, and a constantly changing crypto assets market now accelerating with ICOs, blockchain projects all over the world and a rising Bitcoin and crypto valuations\u200a\u2014\u200athe crypto singularity also means with mainstream recognition of these new crypto-economics forces, there will be a new battle over control of it.A cryptocurrency after all is something increasingly tangible, or else a store of value that can\u2019t be censored and is resistant to seizure. As more institutions go on the blockchain, as state banks create fiat cryptocurrencies and as big money enters Bitcoin trading; there are bound to be winners and losers.Wall Street not too long ago ridiculed Bitcoin, now it seems they will be investing in cryptocurrencies and learning how to leverage them in their business. Not too long ago, Russia considered jailing bitcoin owners, but now has invested in crypto mining companies. Goldman Sachs and J.P Morgan Chase don\u2019t just need to pivot to FinTech and AI, they need to understand and embrace what\u2019s going on in the cryptocurrency markets, to have more control over it.What the Fu*k is the Crypto Singularity?China can kick out ICOs and Bitcoin trading, India can clamp down on regulation, but the Crypto-singularity is now being embraced by powerful entities, in order to control its volatility and profit from it. Bitcoin mania is worrying severely centralized states, and Financial institutions and there\u2019s a new strategy afoot, buy-in and take over.It\u2019s not just Bitcoin that is reaching new highs, it\u2019s taking all of cryptocurrency valuations with it. $300 Bn is just the beginning, and Bitcoin with its 800%+ YOY growth in 2017, marks this year as the true birth of blockchain as a scalable and exponential force in the future of crypto, ICOs, smart contacts and a new kind of digital collectable, kind of innovation, method of crowdfunding and way of doing business and investing.Let\u2019s face it, the decentralized blockchain and the Crypto singularity is one of the most dangerous ideas to centralized states and threats to monopolized governments, big players in the financial system and some of the richest and most powerful people on the planet.On Nov 1st, 2017 Bitcoin was worth around $6,700, it could very well leave November worth nearly double that, at the time of this article it\u2019s worth $11,000 USD. In other parts of the world it\u2019s already worth more than that. With Japan and Korea starting to use Bitcoin as a method of payment in retail and with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)event on December 11th, 2017\u200a\u2014\u200aeverything is changing for Bitcoin, that once seemed to have a murky fate.Banks are starting to figure out they will have to become data-native providers that don\u2019t just try to trick (read: upsell) customers and that they can\u2019t afford to not integrate FinTech and blockchain benefits, because the Crypto Singularity is poised to revolutionize the global finance and banking system.Indeed, Bitcoin and crypto can also be a threat to national security, and contribute to how terrorism is funded and its anonymity makes it almost impossible to track. China\u2019s tendency of wanting full control over local firms complicates its relationship with it, and as for Russia, they have decided to go all-in, in order to control it as much as possible. These are the real issues today, not how high can Bitcoin\u2019s price Surge or who wants in.Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is now valued at $167 billion\u200a\u2014\u200ahigher than roughly 95% of S&P 500 Index members. The valuation of Cryptocurrencies is likely to beat the likes of Apple and Amazon to the 1 trillion mark in early 2018. When that happens, you\u2019ll know that the Crypto Singularity has begun.There\u2019s no precedent for what ICOs did in 2017, for the 900% increase of Bitcoin or the hard fork that is Bitcoin Cash. With SegWit and how Ethereum solves its own scalability issues in 2018, there\u2019s light at the end of the Crypto Singularity and we are about to witness it, whatever it may be. But there is a sense that it\u2019s 1994 for Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain.This isn\u2019t just the uberification of Banking, this is something else. Bitcoin is a catalyst for crypto-mining, similar to what Emails were for the adoption of the Internet, but the number and frequency of ICOs and the variety of crypto and blockchain experiments boggles the mind. We\u2019ll likely have a smart contract revolution before 2020, as the Crypto Singularity takes shape with the next iteration of AI.Bitcoin was a test, and the period of uncertainty is over. The Crypto Singularity is then the next phase, after cryptocurrencies have been validated, popularized and after more \u201cinstitutions\u201d, both in banking, finance, government and enterprise have bought in. This has already occurred now and everyone is working behind the scenes. The Crypto Singularity will now accelerate like a blockchain revolution, and nothing can hold it back.The Crypto Singularity is\u00a0NearWhen China tried to ban and make it illegal to trade in crypto or use ICOs to fund their startups, even shutting down the cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitcoin\u2019s price plunged by 40%. Bitcoin recovered though, and it\u2019s going through the roof now. If you can\u2019t control it, then you have to join and try to manipulate it to the extent that you can. To the envy of tangible currencies, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have to play by the old rules.Thus, central banks will try to emulate it, will take what they consider to be the \u201cgood\u201d from blockchain, without the value-system of decentralization of course. You will notice everyone saying they are developing their own \u201cblockchain\u201d. If Bitcoin hit a record high of $6,000 on the 21st of October, by the time November, 2017 is over, it will likley be double that.Millennials investing in cryptocurrencies are investing in a new world order. They don\u2019t want the same central authorities to have rule over them, the same manipulators of the system, that have shut them out. Sure as a digital asset, Bitcoin can and will be used by all kinds of individuals, groups and movements that won\u2019t want to be traced.The Ideology of Decentralization and Collective Institutions We Can\u00a0TrustHowever in a world of increasing housing prices, cost of living, student loans and with millions of jobs on the chopping block of AI and automation, cryptocurrencies are also a collectible digital asset of value at the intersection of a disenfranchised youth whose push to scale social justice is also considerably stronger than those still in power might assume.It\u2019s no longer a war over ideas such as democracy, human rights or capitalism, it\u2019s gone beyond that to transparency, decentralization and trust. The Crypto Singularity is ultimately a revolution of the monetary, banking and a rebellion against the 1% and a silent epidemic of wealth inequality. The blockchain as a new mechanism of trust where transactions can take place in a more transparent manner, means nothing short of a revolution of our collective intelligence.Cryptocurrencies must challenge the established order, blockchain must create a better system with smart contracts that legislate social justice and economic equality, if it doesn\u2019t, it means the Crypto Singularity will have failed.Disruption of the global banking system is not only inevitable, it must happen quickly for humans to face successfully some of the challenges of the next thirty years on the planet. Cryptocurrencies can be a new driver for innovation, business and smarter instantaneous transactions that can improve dozens of industries and enterprise verticals.If Bitcoin is not a fraud, a bubble or even an infectious pyramid scheme, the establishment must \u2018embrace\u2019 it to seek to control it. Russia has understood this, China will soon as well. How do you control or manipulate a decentralized system? Creating a crypto version of your fiat currency is the first step. It stands to reason that Russia and China will be among the first to implement such a thing.Central banks will push to implement blockchain without the decentralization. Big money and the state will seek to \u201chijack\u201d the Crypto Singularity, and the battle ahead will be both political, generational and ideological\u200a\u2014\u200abecause the very fate of the future of money is at stake.Yet if we admit that the cryptocurrency is stateless and belongs to all of humanity, it can be regulated, but it cannot be enslaved. We are witnessing history, we just don\u2019t know what to call it or exactly where it will lead us.Correct me if I am wrong?", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "The Quick, 3-Step Guide to Blockchain Technology.", "author_name": "Thijs Maas", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/3-steps-to-understanding-blockchain-8a285572daa3?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 24, 2017", "readtime": "10 min read", "upvotes": "1.4K", "content": "The Quick, 3-Step Guide to Blockchain Technology.Understanding the 3 fundamental technologies behind\u00a0Bitcoin.Thijs MaasBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 24, 2017Ask 10 people \u201cwhat is blockchain technology?\u201d and you get 10 different answers\u200a\u2014\u200aeven in the crypto-scene itself.

Ask us anything!With all the recent craze in Bitcoin and Ethereum mining it\u2019s easy to wonder what the fuss is all about. For newcomers to this space, they hear wild stories of people filling up warehouses with GPUs making millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies a month. What exactly is cryptocurrency mining? How does it work? How can I try coding my own mining algorithm?We\u2019ll walk you through each of these questions in this post, culminating in a tutorial on how to code your own mining algorithm. The algorithm we\u2019ll be showing you is called Proof of Work, which is the foundation to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two most popular cryptocurrencies. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll explain how that works shortly.What is cryptocurrency mining?Cryptocurrencies need to have scarcity in order to be valuable. If anyone could produce as many Bitcoin as they wanted at anytime, Bitcoin would be worthless as a currency (wait, doesn\u2019t the Federal Reserve do this? *facepalm*). The Bitcoin algorithm releases some Bitcoin to a winning member of its network every 10 minutes, with a maximum supply to be reached in about 122 years. This release schedule also controls inflation to a certain extent, since the entire fixed supply isn\u2019t released at the beginning. More are slowly released over time.The process by which a winner is determined and given Bitcoin requires the winner to have done some \u201cwork\u201d, and competed with others who were also doing the work. This process is called mining, because it\u2019s analogous to a gold miner spending some time doing work and eventually (and hopefully) finding a bit of gold.The Bitcoin algorithm forces participants, or nodes, to do this work and compete with each other to ensure Bitcoin aren\u2019t released too quickly.How does mining work?A quick Google search of \u201chow does bitcoin mining work?\u201d fills your results with a multitude of pages explaining that Bitcoin mining asks a node (you, or your computer) to solve a hard math problem. While technically true, simply calling it a \u201cmath\u201d problem is incredibly hand-wavy and hackneyed. How mining works under the hood is a lot of fun to understand. We\u2019ll need to understand a bit of cryptography and hashing to learn how mining works.A brief introduction to cryptographic hashesOne-way cryptography takes in a human readable input like \u201cHello world\u201d and applies a function to it (i.e. the math problem) to produce an indecipherable output. These functions (or algorithms) vary in nature and complexity. The more complicated the algorithm, the harder it is to reverse engineer. Thus, cryptographic algorithms are very powerful in securing things like user passwords and military codes.Let\u2019s take a look at an example of SHA-256, a popular cryptographic algorithm. This hashing website lets you easily calculate SHA-256 hashes. Let\u2019s hash \u201cHello world\u201d and see what we get:Try hashing \u201cHello world\u201d over and over again. You get the same hash every time. In programming getting the same result again and again given the same input is called idempotency.A fundamental property of cryptographic algorithms is that they should be extremely hard to reverse engineer to find the input, but extremely easy to verify the output. For example, using the SHA-256 hash above, it should be trivial for someone else to apply the SHA-256 hash algorithm to \u201cHello world\u201d to check that it indeed produces the same resultant hash, but it should be very hard to take the resultant hash and get \u201cHello world\u201d from it. This is why this type of cryptography is called one way.Bitcoin uses Double SHA-256, which is simply applying SHA-256 again to the SHA-256 hash of \u201cHello world\u201d. For our examples throughout this tutorial we\u2019ll just use SHA-256.MiningNow that we understand what cryptography is, we can get back to cryptocurrency mining. Bitcoin needs to find some way to make participants who want to earn Bitcoin \u201cwork\u201d so Bitcoins aren\u2019t released too quickly. Bitcoin achieves this by making the participants hash many combinations of letters and numbers until the resulting hash contains a specific number of leading \u201c0\u201ds.For example, go back to the hash website and hash \u201c886\u201d. It produces a hash with 3 zeros as a prefix.But how did we know that \u201c886\u201d produced something with 3 zeros? That\u2019s the point. Before writing this blog, we didn\u2019t. In theory, we would have had to work through a whole bunch combinations of letters and numbers and tested the results until we got one that matched the 3 zeros requirement. To give you a simple example, we already worked in advance to realize the hash of \u201c886\u201d produced 3 leading zeros.The fact that anyone can easily check that \u201c886\u201d produces something with 3 leading zeros proves that we did the grunt work of testing and checking a large combination of letters and numbers to get to this result. So if I\u2019m the first one who got this result, I would have earned the Bitcoin by proving I did this work\u200a\u2014\u200athe proof is that anyone can quickly check that \u201c886\u201d produces the number of zeros I claim it does. This is why the Bitcoin consensus algorithm is called Proof-of-Work.But what if I just got lucky and I got the 3 leading zeros on my first try? This is extremely unlikely and the occasional node that successfully mines a block (proves that they did the work) on their first try is outweighed by millions of others who had to work extra to find the desired hash. Go ahead and try it. Type in any other combination of letters and numbers in the hash website. We bet you won\u2019t get 3 leading zeros.Bitcoin\u2019s requirements are a bit more complex than this (many more leading zeros!) and it is able to adjust the requirements dynamically to make sure the work required isn\u2019t too easy or too hard. Remember, it aims to release Bitcoin every 10 minutes so if too many people are mining, it needs to make the proof of work harder to compensate. This is called adjusting the difficulty. For our purposes, adjusting the difficulty will just mean requiring more leading zeros.So you can see the Bitcoin consensus algorithm is much more interesting than just \u201csolving a math problem\u201d!Enough background. Let\u2019s get\u00a0coding!Now that we have the background we need, let\u2019s build our own Blockchain program with a Proof-of-Work algorithm. We\u2019ll write it in Go because we use it here at Coral Health and frankly, it\u2019s awesome.Before proceeding, we recommend reading our original blog post, Code your own blockchain in less than 200 lines of Go! It\u2019s not a requirement but some of the examples below we\u2019ll be running through quickly. Refer to the original post if you need more detail. If you\u2019re already familiar with this original post, skip to the \u201cProof of Work\u201d section below.ArchitectureWe\u2019ll have a Go server, where for simplicity we\u2019ll put all our code in a single main.go file. This file will provide us all the blockchain logic we need (including Proof of Work) and will contain all the handlers for our REST APIs. This blockchain data is immutable; we only need GET and POST requests. We\u2019ll make requests through the browser to view the data through GET and we\u2019ll use Postman to POST new blocks (curl works fine too).ImportsLet\u2019s start with our standard imports. Make sure to grab the following packages with go getgithub.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew pretty prints your blockchain in Terminalgithub.com/gorilla/mux a convenience layer for wiring up your web servergithub.com/joho/godotenv read your environmental variables from a\u00a0.env file in your root directoryLet\u2019s create a\u00a0.env file in our root directory that just stores one environment variable that we\u2019ll need later. Put one line in your\u00a0.env file:ADDR=8080Make your package declaration and define your imports in main.go in your root directory:If you read our original article, you\u2019ll remember this diagram. Blocks in a blockchain are verified by comparing the previous hash in a block against the hash of the previous block. This is how the integrity of the blockchain is preserved and how a malicious party can\u2019t change the history of the blockchain.BPM is your pulse rate, or beats per minute. We\u2019ll be using the beats per minute of your pulse as the data we put in our blocks. Just put two fingers on the inside of your wrist and count how many times you get a beat in a minute, and remember this number.Some basic plumbingLet\u2019s add our data model and other variables we\u2019ll need under our imports in main.godifficulty is a constant that defines the number of 0s we want leading the hash. The more zeros we have to get, the harder it is to find the correct hash. We\u2019ll just start with 1 zero.Block is the data model of each block. Don\u2019t worry about Nonce, we\u2019ll explain that shortly.Blockchain is a slice of Block which represents our full chain.Message is what we\u2019ll send in to generate a new Block using a POST request in our REST API.We\u2019re declaring a mutex that we\u2019ll use later to prevent data races and make sure blocks aren\u2019t generated at the same time.Web serverLet\u2019s quickly wire up our web server. Let\u2019s create a run function that we\u2019ll call from main later that scaffolds our server. We\u2019ll also declare our routes handlers in makeMuxRouter(). Remember, all we need are GET to retrieve the blockchain, and POST to add new blocks. Blockchains are immutable so we don\u2019t need to edit or delete.The httpAddr\u00a0:= os.Getenv(\"ADDR\") will pull port\u00a0:8080 from our\u00a0.env file we created earlier. We\u2019ll be able to access our app through http://localhost:8080 in our browser.Let\u2019s write our GET handler to print our blockchain to our browser. We\u2019ll also add a quick respondwithJSON function that gives us back error messages in JSON format if any of our API calls produces an error.Remember, if we\u2019re going a bit too quickly, please refer to our original post that explains each of these steps in more detail.Now we write our POST handler. This is how we add new blocks. We make a POST request using Postman by sending a JSON body e.g.{\u201cBPM\u201d:60}to http://localhost:8080 with your pulse rate you took earlier.Note the mutex lock and unlock. We need to lock it before writing a new block, or else multiple writes will create a data race. The perceptive reader will notice the generateBlock function. This is our key function that will handle our Proof of Work. We\u2019ll get to it shortly.Basic blockchain functionsLet\u2019s wire up our basic blockchain functions before we hit Proof of Work. We\u2019ll add a isBlockValid function that makes sure our indices are incrementing correctly and our PrevHash of our current block and Hash of the previous block match.We\u2019ll also add a calculateHash function that generates the hashes we need to create Hash and PrevHash. This is just a SHA-256 hash of our concatenated index, timestamp, BPM, previous hash and Nonce (we\u2019ll explain what that is in a second).Proof of\u00a0WorkLet\u2019s get to the mining algorithm, or Proof of Work. We want to make sure the Proof of Work is complete before we\u2019ll allow a new Block to get added to the blockchain. Let\u2019s start off with a simple function that checks if the hash generated during our Proof of Work meets the requirements we set out.Our requirements will be as follows:The hash that is generated by our Proof of Work must start with a specific number of zerosThe number of zeros is determined by the constant difficulty that we defined at the start of our program (in our case, 1)We can make the Proof of Work harder to solve by increasing the difficultyWrite up this function, isHashValid:Go provides convenient Repeat and HasPrefix functions in its strings package. We define the variable prefix as a repeat of zeros defined by our difficulty. Then we check if the hash starts with those zeros and return True if it does and False if it doesn\u2019t.Now let\u2019s create our generateBlock function.We create a newBlock that takes the hash of the previous block and puts it in PrevHash to make sure we have continuity in our blockchain. Most of the other fields should be apparent:Index incrementsTimestamp is the string representation of the current timeBPM is your pulse rate you took earlierDifficulty is simply taken from the constant at the top of our program. We won\u2019t use this field in this tutorial but it\u2019s useful to have if we\u2019re doing further verification and we want to make sure the difficulty is consistent with the hash results (i.e. the hash result has N prefixed zeros so Difficulty should also equal N, or the chain is compromised)The for loop is the critical piece in this function. Let\u2019s walk through what\u2019s happening here:We\u2019ll take the hex representation of i and set Nonce equal to it. We need a way to append a changing value to our hash that we create from our calculateHash function so if we don\u2019t get the leading number of zeros we want, we can try again with a new value. This changing value we add to our concatenated string in calculateHash is called a \u201cNonce\u201dIn our loop, we calculate the hash with i and Nonce starting at 0 and check if the result starts with the number of zeros as defined by our constant difficulty. If it doesn\u2019t, we invoke the next iteration of the loop with an incremented Nonce and try again.We added a 1 second sleeper to simulate taking some time to solve the Proof of WorkWe keep looping until we get the number of leading zeros we want, which means we\u2019ve successfully completed our Proof of Work. Then and only then do we allow our Block to get added to blockchain via our handleWriteBlock handlerWe\u2019re done writing all our functions so let\u2019s complete our main function now:With godotenv.Load() we load up our environment variable, which is just the\u00a0:8080 port we\u2019ll access from our browser.A go routine creates our genesis block since we need to supply our blockchain with a starting point.We fire up our web server with our run() function we created earlier.We\u2019re done! Time to take it for a\u00a0spin!Here\u2019s the finished code in full.mycoralhealth/blockchain-tutorialblockchain-tutorial - Write and publish your own blockchain in less than 200 lines of Gogithub.comLet\u2019s give this baby a try!Start up your program with go run main.goThen visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser:Our genesis block has been created for us. Now open Postman and let\u2019s send a POST request to the same route with our BPM (pulse rate) we took earlier in a JSON body.After we send the request watch what\u2019s happening in your terminal. You\u2019ll see your machine chugging away creating new hashes with incrementing Nonce values until it finally finds a result that has the required number of leading zeros!When the Proof of Work is solved we get a helpful message saying work done! and we can check the hash to see that it indeed starts with the number of zeros we set in difficulty. This means that in theory, the new block we tried to add with BPM = 60 should now have been added to our blockchain.Let\u2019s refresh our browser and check:SUCCESS! Our second block has been added to our genesis block. This means we successfully sent our block in a POST request, which triggered the mining process and ONLY when the Proof of Work was solved did it get added to our blockchain!Next stepsGreat job! What you just learned is a really big deal. Proof of Work is the foundation to Bitcoin, Ethereum and many of the biggest blockchain platforms around. What we just went through is not trivial; while we used a low difficulty for demonstration purposes, increasing the difficulty to a high number is exactly how production-ready Proof of Work blockchains work.Now that you intimately understand a key component of blockchain technology, where you go from here is up to you.

While most blockchains use Proof of Work as their consensus algorithm, Proof of Stake is gaining more and more attention.

I have very few logical comebacks against the uselessness of poetry. When examining the strange, disjointed lines of Gertrude Stein, for example, the students in my Introduction to Literature Class scoffed and rebelled\u200a\u2014\u200ano, revolted.If you have ever read Gertrude, you understand. Her ceaseless repetition of basic vocabulary in subversive patterns is a bit like listening to nails on a chalkboard\u2026 only louder and more persistent.That was the point of Stein\u2019s poetry: to subvert accepted norms and institutional power (social contracts, gender, government, and even language) through ceaseless repetition and re-positioning. She played the \u201cI cannot change your mind so I will change the language you think in\u201d game. Her poetry starts off playful, even coy. Then, gradually, it grows violent, tearing through our delicate understanding of self and other, man and woman, meaning and culture, violating even the most basic of principles to make a singular point\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is that there is no point.She is infuriating and fascinating, and her poetry is all this and much worse.At least, that is what I told my students.My elaborate explanations fell on deaf ears trained by brilliant academic advisors, life experience, and practical career preparation. They called BS on my academic fluffiness. One particularly daring student wrote a single word over and over again in her final essay (meant to be a 1500-word examination of the impact of poetry on society following World War II).Touch\u00e9, daring student #1. Touch\u00e9.As for poets, there isn\u2019t much I can muster in our defense. Particularly for those like me: a poet with an MFA from a Buddhist university founded by hippies in a parking lot, hippies who simply wanted to get paid (by a government they despised) to write, meditate, and drink whiskey amongst their newly appointed gurus. Or even worse, a poet (hi!) with absolutely no measurable comprehension of computer science.Who, or what, could possibly be more useless to the data revolution and our reimagining of society through the power of technology? Given the right algorithm and basic data, any computer can write damn fine poetry. It\u2019s a simple input/output process. An equation to harmony. Why even create poetry (as a human, that is)? Why does it matter? If it\u2019s all just 0s and 1s, in some sense, why is it important? Why is it necessary? And what does it have to do with the blockchain?It\u2019s true that as a poet, it would be much easier to sit in the shadows of this revolution and emerge, from time to time, in a reflective, academic sort of way. But for me, it is important to be in the trenches, a part of and an active contributor to this space and its future. Because, poet or not, I am a firm believer that this technology is critical to a free and creative future.I need blockchain to be all that it promises. And if you\u2019re a fellow writer or artist, so do you.Now, I\u2019m not arguing that developers should cease their developing in favor of composing sonnets. Nor am I arguing that poets, artists, and philosophers should trade their art and words for lines of code and Deep Learning 101. I am, however, arguing that there are commonalities between these disciplines, and that examining this common ground would benefit the world we all happen to exist in.Shall we build the argument, then?Shall.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "MEDIA Protocol At Token 2049, Deconomy And Penn Blockchain Conferences", "author_name": "MEDIA Protocol", "link": "https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsm/media-protocol-at-token-2049-deconomy-and-penn-blockchain-conferences-9432ab47249a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 9, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "1K", "content": "MEDIA Protocol At Token 2049, Deconomy And Penn Blockchain ConferencesMEDIA ProtocolBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 9, 2018The MEDIA Protocol team have been busy travelling the globe, sharing our innovative Protocol at blockchain conferences including Immutable and Token 2049 in Hong Kong, Deconomy in Seoul (South Korea) and at Penn State University (Philadelphia, USA), as both participants and speakers.#Deconomy2018: Distributed Economy\u00a0(Seoul)The first annual blockchain forum in Seoul, South Korea, was held during 3rd and 4th April 2018. Gathering the brightest entrepreneurs, thought leaders, investors, developers, academic and policy groups, and blockchain enthusiasts, the forum offered a two-day program, with keynote presentations and panel discussions about major topics surrounding the industry.Of particular note was the first session on Day 1 of the conference: Paradigm Shift to Open Protocols. The focus of this opening session was on public or permissionless blockchain projects, enabling anyone from anywhere, at any time, to freely transact any data, without permission. MEDIA Protocol\u2019s CEO, James Tabor was in attendance, enjoying the vibrant atmosphere, interesting keynote presentations and engaging panel discussions.Speaking At The Penn Blockchain ConferenceThe inaugural Penn Blockchain Conference, held April 6th 2018, sought to promote dialogue on what it would take to build and scale blockchain to its full potential. The aims were to provide a platform for collaboration between academics and students from diverse backgrounds with professionals from various industries.Mark White, MEDIA Protocol\u2019s CTO, spoke at the event, attended by over 300 participants. Mark formed part of the discussion of the technical challenges faced when designing and building blockchain protocols.Other key areas explored during the conference included Building Decentralized Applications and Investing in Web 3.0.Growing MomentumBoth events (in Seoul and Philadelphia) were a huge success, with MEDIA Protocol continuing to generate interest and engagement globally.Watch Mr Block\u2019s interview with MEDIA Protocol\u2019s CEO, James Tabor, recorded at the Immutable Blockchain Summit in Hong Kong.

China is reversing the last 500 years of geopolitics with blockchain.Blockchain is virgin territory, a new frontier. Getting there first, exerting influence, and dominating the market matters.England, France, Spain, and Portugal all knew this when the New World was discovered.America knew this with global force projection after WWII, and most recently, the internet.But like all history, the empires of the past are not the empires of the future.For anyone that is paying attention, President Xi is standing in front of China, conducting a masterful performance of Ride of the Valkyries as he leads his country to dominating the 21st century and\u00a0beyond.He is weaving a strategic future plan in military restructuring and economic dominance on three continents with new technology for finances and society.It is a bold plan\u200a\u2014\u200areviving the silk road, harnessing blockchain, and upsetting the geopolitical status quo.Winning the blockchain race and applying the technology to their One Belt One Road Initiative (OBOR) will allow China to neutralize America\u2019s global influence.China will reemerge as the Middle Kingdom in terms of global dominance and prestige\u200a\u2014\u200aa time when China was the center of the world.President Xi calls blockchain a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d technology:\u201cA new generation of technology represented by artificial intelligence, quantum information, mobile communications, internet of things and blockchain is accelerating breakthrough applications.\u201dPresident Xi is pushing ahead on two fronts\u200a\u2014\u200ageopolitical and technology.China is unique because he can do so without being challenged politically and the Chinese are already accustomed to mobile pay, which is the same user interface blockchain technology will use.China\u2019s policy of a government and private sector hybrid approach to furthering Chinese interests which always supports the Chinese solution over the outside approach is well documented and expected to continue into the future.Image Source\u200a\u2014\u200aFlags added to denote major U.S. and Chinese military\u00a0bases.The GeopoliticsWhy would China even want to undertake a massive modern silk road project through 69 countries, connecting 40% of global GDP?To understand that, we have to understand a bit of history, geography, and the problem China currently sees for itself.Stay with me, it won\u2019t be bad. Promise.The HistoryThe original silk road was the dominant trade route from Europe to Asia from 200BC to 1500AD.1700 years of trade traveled overland. It\u2019s beautiful country. If you ever get the chance, go travel through the northern \u2018Stans and see some of the ancient cities. Highly recommend it, but go early. The mountain passes close as early as October.In the 15th century, a maritime route was found from Europe to Asia. It cost less, and was less dangerous than the overland route. Win-win.Most trade shifted to ships and the importance of the Silk Road declined.The GeographyEver wondered why Singapore and Kuala Lumpur are located where they are?Singapore and Kuala Lumpur literally sit at the intersection of maritime trade between Europe, Africa, and Asia for the last 600 years.They are located on either end of the Strait of Malacca. The strait is 500 miles long, 1.7 miles across at the most narrow.I\u2019ve been through the Strait of Malacca, and at times, you could almost walk across the decks of ships, one to another, going from Indonesia on one side to Malaysia on the other and not get your feet wet. There are that many ships transiting, over 100,000 per day.Nearly 18% of all oil produced in the world transits through the strait.This includes eighty percent of China\u2019s oil imports, with China the largest importer of oil in the world.The importance of the Strait of Malacca to the world economy and to China\u2019s economy specifically, and therefore her national security, cannot be understated.Remember, Christopher Columbus sailed right off the map to the west to find a more direct route to Asia. In a way, the Strait of Malacca has shaped the last 600 years of geopolitics and empires, and will continue to do so.The ProblemAmerica was the clear winner from World War II. Its cities, manufacturing, capital markets, and infrastructure untouched by the devastation due to it\u2019s geographical advantage of having oceans separate it from the conflict.America capitalized on this advantage by continuing to project power through maritime force, establishing military bases and friendly relations with countries surrounding China for the last 70 years.And there is the problem\u200a\u2014\u200aChina is surrounded. Held hostage by the Strait of Malacca and U.S. influence.China is keenly aware that eighty percent of their oil supply has to pass through a 1.7 mile wide strait, and even the natural gas shipping routes north from the Western Australia Gorgon and Wheatstone projects must pass through waters largely controlled by the U.S. and their allies.The first step to minimizing the risk this poses is for President Xi to continue to build bases and aircraft carriers.He\u2019s playing the hand he\u2019s been dealt, and the U.S. has been dealing for 70 years.This was the reason for the island building in the Paracel Islands, Scarborough Shoal, and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.China is building a buffer between their ports on the mainland and U.S. allies in the South China Sea to be able to guarantee keeping a shipping lane open to the Strait of Malacca and open ocean.Both of these are not permanent solutions. The One Belt One Road Initiative is the permanent solution to the problem.If you don\u2019t like the game, change the\u00a0rules.Europe bypassed the Silk Road in favor of the maritime route through the Strait of Malacca in the 15th century because it was less costly and less dangerous.What was old is new again.China will go back to the overland route for the same reason Europe went to sea. It\u2019s less costly and dangerous for them.How is building an entire economic corridors of roads, railways, powerlines, pipelines for the next 30 years less costly and dangerous?The cost they are measuring against is the total economic destruction of the country and the end of the Communist Party if 80% of their oil imports can get turned off by other countries.That makes thirty years of construction and loans to other countries for the OBOR look like a great deal.It\u2019s much less dangerous to build a road and seek mutual cooperation than to continue to build aircraft carriers and compete head on against the U.S. Navy.By reconnecting 40% of the world\u2019s GDP along a land trade route, China is going to completely reset the geopolitical power dynamics which most everyone alive today has taken as absolute\u200a\u2014\u200ain essence turning the clock back 500 years.Long live the\u00a0EmperorIn March, President Xi was elected to a second term with 100% of the vote. This was after lifting the presidential term, meaning he can now be President indefinitely.Could President Xi pull a George Washington and step down after his second term in office, retiring to his farm in peace?Maybe. We\u2019ll see.In the meantime, President Xi, and by extension, China has a distinct advantage in politics and long-term strategy over our leaders in the West.They are united in their goal of winning the Blockchain race and pursuing their long term strategic goals. Completely undistracted by the politics of election cycles.The fact that China even knows there is a race to win shows how far ahead they are than the leaders and legislators in the West.President Xi is giving clear direction to China\u2019s Central Bank and the country that China will win the blockchain race.China is the largest holders of blockchain patents in the world with the People\u2019s Bank of China submitting 41 patent applications in the last 12 months alone.China\u2019s State TV has said China expects blockchain to be 10x more valuable than the internet.The China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) officially publishes their ranking of crypto and blockchain projects consisting of the top 33 projects in their view.The CCID is under China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, a state agency of the People\u2019s Republic of China.China\u2019s Communist Party has even released a book titled \u201cBlockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aA Guide for Officials\u201d.Not only is the Communist Party expecting state officials to be studying the book and understand blockchain, but one of the cabinet-level ministries is working on a blockchain standardization for the tech\u2019s development in the country.There is no one in a western government doing anything similar to this, and at this point, the chances of catching up are slim.To put this race into scale, the current total market capitalization for the five largest internet based stocks in the U.S. are: Facebook ($470B), Amazon ($934B), Apple ($1.05T), Netflix ($157B), and Google ($813B).Widely referred to as the FAANG stocks with a total market cap of $3.404 trillion U.S. dollars.When the Chinese State TV is broadcasting to the country that blockchain will be worth 10x what the internet is worth, China believes the prize money for the country who can win the blockchain race and dominate this new frontier is at least $34 trillion U.S. dollars.China believes blockchain will be worth more than the entire U.S. Stock market which is $30 trillion.Wait a second.How is a Chinese Mayor running around Shenzhen with his \u201cBlockchain Guide for Officials\u201d and building a deep water port on the coast of Pakistan so ships don\u2019t have to go through a strait named Malacca going to make blockchain more valuable than the entire U.S. stock market?It comes down to two factors. Adoption and network effect.AdoptionChina is about four to five years ahead of the West in mobile pay. Everyone uses their phones. No one uses cash or credit cards.This is mostly due to the fact that credit cards never took off. When you\u2019re sitting in Din Tai Fung eating some of the best dumplings you ever had in your life in Beijing, you just scan the QR code and pay with your phone.Wall Street Journal video showing how widespread and easy mobile pay is in China.For comparison, China does $9 trillion per year in mobile pay, compared to $112 billion in the United States.So for China, as more blockchain comes online, the user interface isn\u2019t going to change. They are already used to scanning QR codes and paying with their phone.Network EffectThe most common way to value network effect is through Metcalfe\u2019s Law.In fact, Wall Street analysts use Metcalfe\u2019s Law to value the FAANG stocks.Essentially Metcalfe\u2019s Law says that for every person who is added to a network the increase in value isn\u2019t by one person, but exponentially by the number of interactions that one person can have with others on the network.Now, we\u2019re talking about China using blockchain along the One Belt One Road Initiative and connecting 69 countries through economic corridors, totaling 40% of the worlds GDP with trade from three continents.And before it even starts, China is already at $9 trillion on mobile pay.Thinking about the network value exponential increase, I don\u2019t think I can accurately comprehend the exponential value increase that blockchain is going to provide when multiplied by the number of people along the One Belt One Road Initiative, all using blockchain.It would only take a bit over a 300% increase to equal the U.S. stock market, and considering bitcoin has gone up over 80,000% using the network effect in the last seven years from 2011\u20132018, I would consider 300% easily doable by 2049.The Future\u200a\u2014\u200aShoes from Africa through Pakistan to Europe and Asia along the\u00a0OBORA Chinese entrepreneur opens factories in eastern Africa where they make shoes for popular brands.As a way to pre-clear customs on arrival in the deep water port of Gwadar, Pakistan, the entry point to the OBOR, as well as prove the authenticity of the shoes, a blockchain based NFC chip is installed in the shoes, and a different one on the container once inspected and sealed at the factory in Ethiopia. This helps cut down on the $400 billion per year business of counterfeiting and streamline customs and shipping.The QR code is scanned on the container upon arrival\u200a\u2014\u200atracking data, import taxes all automatically captured.The container is then loaded on a truck, leaving the port and entering onto the OBOR, in route either to Europe or to Asia.As the truck enters the OBOR, the truck passes under a sensor which records the truck number, time, date, location, insurance and registration data as well as the container data and drivers data\u200a\u2014\u200aall recorded to the blockchain which cannot be tampered with, altered, or destroyed.Every time the truck passes through a new country, same thing, blockchain sensor records the information and tolls are automatically paid. If the NFC chip is tampered with, the code doesn\u2019t work and the truck will be stopped for inspection.Along the economic corridor, as the driver stops for fuel and food at Chinese trade alliance built facilities, all transactions are paid for through mobile pay Chinese blockchain apps developed by private companies through cooperation with the Chinese government.The Middle Kingdom\u00a0ReturnsIf China wins the blockchain race and is successful with implementing it within the One Belt One Road Initiative, the money Chinese companies will make across the OBOR through the network effect will be immense.The geopolitical risk the Chinese government will mitigate for essentially pennies on the dollar by building the OBOR and bypassing the Strait of Malacca means political survival for the Communist Party while mitigating the threat posed by the U.S. Navy and allies.The increased prosperity within China, as well as the geopolitical influence along the OBOR and throughout the world will be unlike anything seen in the last 500 years.And going back to President Xi\u2019s original comment,\u201cA new generation of technology represented by artificial intelligence, quantum information, mobile communications, internet of things and blockchain is accelerating breakthrough applications.\u201dIt shows he is already thinking along these lines of what blockchain can accomplish as he pushes forward on the geopolitical and technological fronts to secure a better future for China.Seeing parts of the old Silk Road was pretty cool. Maybe I\u2019ll get a shot to ride along the 21st century version some day when China turns the clock back 500 years.Stay frosty out there.\u200a\u2014\u200aRadiganConnect with the Raven team on Telegram", "responses": "16"}, {"title": "What is this Blockchain Thing?", "author_name": "David Siegel", "link": "https://medium.com/startup-grind/what-is-this-blockchain-thing-a5d2abb99297?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 4, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "498", "content": "What is this Blockchain Thing?David SiegelBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 4, 2017I live in the world of blockchain and smart contracts. I hear people using terms that remind me of when we were building the Web back in the 1990s: they are talking, but they aren\u2019t understanding each other, because they don\u2019t have a common understanding of the terms of a new technological order.The worst part is not that they don\u2019t understand each other but that they think they do understand each other!Here, I\u2019d like to offer a few basic definitions from my keynote speech that I hope will help people get on the same page and collaborate.What is a Blockchain?There is tremendous confusion over what a blockchain is. Ask ten experts, you\u2019ll get eleven answers.I will offer my definition, hoping it will help people understand a bit better:A blockchain is a shared ledger that everyone trusts to be accurate\u00a0forever.Let me unpack that.First, it has nothing to do with blocks and chains. If you hear someone answer the question by talking about blocks and chains, I submit that this person doesn\u2019t get it. Yes, we have blocks and chains today, but the blocks and chains don\u2019t matter. When we have $500 billion in value stored on shared ledgers, I hope there will be no blocks and chains involved.The key is the shared ledger. What\u2019s a ledger? It\u2019s a record of transactions. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the \u201cone simple trick\u201d for changing the world completely, from top-down hierarchical institutions to autonomy, freedom, and self-determination.How? Sharing a ledger means we don\u2019t both keep our own books, but rather we share a common set of books. We trust each other to keep a record of transactions that we both believe represents the truth.Magically, this enables us to get rid of banks, insurance companies, most government institutions, and even media companies. I\u2019ll expand on that a bit more in another essay, but you can read many of the use cases on my web site.Building the Trust\u00a0MachineI said everyone trusts this shared ledger to be accurate, and that includes people who don\u2019t trust each other. So the blockchain and smart contracts are called \u201cthe trust machine,\u201d because we no longer have to rely on third parties to help us conduct business.Make a list of everything banks do. It comes down to trust\u200a\u2014\u200aright? The rest is mechanics. We trust them to help us manage our money.How well has that worked out? How many billions have the top banks been fined for screwing their customers to increase fees? Many. Every bank is now under heavy pressure to reduce head count and improve profits. We can do all those things now without banks, thanks to the trust we have in smart contracts.Forever. Forever is a long time. We call the blockchain \u201cimmutable,\u201d because it would take something like $1 billion to hijack the bitcoin blockchain today and start changing records of past transactions.While it\u2019s not impossible to do, it is very difficult to see how you\u2019d make any money on that $1b investment. Because it\u2019s an impractical use of hundreds of millions of dollars, we don\u2019t expect anyone to change the record. In the future, when billions of records are on the blockchain, and when the blocks and chains are all gone, we\u2019ll use trusted systems to execute smart contracts that will be as commonplace as using PayPal or ApplePay today. The difference will be that there won\u2019t be any large institutions or fees involved.What Can you Do with a Blockchain?Here\u2019s a slide I show three times during my talk:I mentioned smart contracts, the short version of which is: smart contracts let us program the assets on the blockchain, from cryptocurrencies to gold to diamonds to land to stocks and bonds and many other valuable things.Thus, the blockchain represents programmable money.If you can program money, you can replace most white collar workers with software. At my new company, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re working on.Where to Go From\u00a0Here?This isn\u2019t meant to be a complete overview. I\u2019ll talk about smart contracts and other terms in in the future if people are interested.

To start, let\u2019s discuss what Blockchain is\u2026Bitcoin has been a buzz word as a result of its explosive rise in usage and value over the past year. Though Bitcoin and blockchain are often referred to interchangeably, they are not the same. Blockchain is Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology and is built upon a version of a blockchain.A blockchain is an open, decentralized ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way without the need for a central authority. The key qualities of this distributed ledger is a time-stamped record of the transaction, speed, transparency (ledger is public), and decentralization (the ledger exists on the network and can be validated by computers in the network, often referred to as nodes).Blockchain technology has been hailed as revolutionary and can dramatically lower cost, increase speed, and present transparency of all transactions. Take, for instance, a typical stock purchase or bank wire transaction. The transaction can be executed in minutes but the settlement\u200a\u2014\u200athe ownership transfer of the stock or funds\u200a\u2014\u200atakes a few business days. This is because the parties have no access to each other ledgers and therefore can not automatically verify that the assets are in fact owned and can be transferred. A number of intermediaries (i.e. banks, escrow, credit card companies) act as guarantors of assets as the transaction is verified and the ledgers are individually updated. On the other hand, blockchain transactions reside on a public ledger and are not controlled by a central authority. Decentralizing control removes the need for intermediaries and middle-men. As a result, these transactions can be executed and settled between both parties in minutes with verification that is transparent, public, and validated by the network itself. Whether an emergency or just a normal transaction, this is particularly advantageous where the transfer and reciept of funds are required immediately. While this is just one example, these benefits will collectively alter existing business processes, disrupt industries, and create new business models; similarly as the Internet did during the digital revolution.Governments, financial institutions, non-profits, etc. are going to experience a radical change as entrepreneurs seek alternative solutions to disrupt and relinquish control of single governing bodies. Decentralization offers:Consensus\u200a\u2014 decentralization ensures a distributed model where the participants are the collective owners and decision makers of the network or organization. Thus ruling out any single authority, leader, or ruler.Fault tolerance and attack resistance\u200a\u2014\u200adecentralized systems are more expensive to attack, destroy, manipulate, or fail because they lack a single point of failureCollusion resistance\u200a\u2014\u200adecentralized systems protect collusion and prevent participants to act in ways that benefit them at the expense of others in the network or organization (as opposed to the central leadership of corporations and governments that collude in ways that benefit themselves but harm the citizens, customers, employees, and the general publicWhile still early, we are already experiencing the benefits of this technology and its principles. For example, Bitcoin itself has carved itself a place as a financial asset built upon blockchain technology. Thus resulting in a millions of transactions a day and achieving a market cap of approximately $71B at the time of this writing. I truly believe that we are only on the cusp of a new revolution that will be driven by blockchain technology and decentralization. Therefore, I challenge each of you to learn more about both and think of how you can leverage it to create impact rather than allowing it to impact you.

Then again, the major studios have always been slow to adapt.One infamous example is when Blockbuster rejected an offer to buy Netflix for $50 million back in the early 2000\u2019s. Blockbuster\u2019s executives failed to understand changing consumption patterns and stalled on the adoption of a video-on-demand strategy. Netflix, who understood the potential of online distribution, now boasts a $19.7 billion cap. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010.Things haven\u2019t changed much. Hollywood is still trying to push for its own, late to the game, video-on-demand service, and theatre owners are still hating on Netflix. It\u2019s no surprise, that major studios have very little to say on blockchain technology, despite its potential to completely annihilate the current status quo.Blockchain technology demands a rethink of the entire structure of the entertainment ecosystem; if the industry doesn\u2019t react quickly, we may see other giants fall by the wayside. Here are just some examples of how blockchain will shake up the cinematic world:Securing investmentAny independent film producer knows that one of the most difficult tasks in moviemaking is getting funding. The main reason for this is that investors see indie projects as too high-risk with a low potential for reward. In recent years, the ways in which producers raise money for their projects has changed. One of those ways is through crowdfunding. A great example of this is the comedy action martial arts movie Kung Fury, which raised $20,000 for an initial pilot and $630,019 through Kickstarter for a follow-up pledged by 17,713 backers.Usually crowdfunding participants get bonuses such as dinners with the cast or merchandise. So if the film is a smash hit, the investors get very little of real value in return, and there is the huge potential for fraud.The advent of blockchain and cryptocurrencies will enable thousands of small investors and aspiring filmmakers to enter the filmmaking industry. It will also allow professionals to group together and create films without the need for funding in exchange for a return on the profits.There are a number of blockchain projects already in the pipeline including Braid, an ICO funded horror movie, and Lizzard Maddoxx, a 3D animated feature film movie by Austrian animation studio Tectonic Slide. The latter, scheduled for release in late 2019, will be the pilot project of blockchain-based production studio and distributor Qravity.Better and more original moviesIf you are tired of the recent glut of revenue-driven reboots, you\u2019ll be glad to know that blockchain technology can also help solve that. Talented filmmakers are brimming with amazing original ideas. However, Hollywood prefers to use algorithms to try and predict what will be a success according to previous buying patterns, rather than take a chance on anything new.Acquiring investment through blockchain allows producers to bypass the studios altogether, meaning original premium-quality content gets a chance to shine.Timely distributionDistributing film and TV content is a legal quagmire resulting in huge distribution delays in some markets; and that\u2019s if the content makes it to the market at all. The number of titles you can access on Netflix in a small central European country, for example, differs greatly from vast content choice you get in the U.K.Blockchain allows for seamless digital rights management, so registrations, royalties and rights ownership can all be tracked in a transparent and secure fashion. This negates the need to delay a release based on geography.Transparent payment for all involved with no movie mogul cutsThe entertainment industry has snowballed in size over the last 100 years. A early lack of industry knowledge, coupled with the expense of the equipment, established a status quo in which movie executives and top-tier artists made enormous sums of money, whereas the rest of the crew benefitted very little in comparative terms.Blockchain-powered smart contracts enable secure and transparent revenue allocation and collection. It gives producers the ability to grant every cast and crew member a stake in the project. As soon as revenues are collected, they are automatically distributed to the stakeholders, which means waving goodbye to the middlemen who take their piece of the pie along the way, such as movie executives, agents, and the studios.Combating piracyIn the US market alone, piracy is cost the TV and film market an estimated $31.8 billion in 2017. Top reasons cited for people pirating content include regional distribution delays, lack of availability due to rights issues, or difficulty in accessing the content via the distribution platform.People often mistakenly think that piracy only affects the big-money studios, but it hurts everyone, from set designers and make-up artists to actors and directors by devaluing the cost of a production. Why would SKY pay $1 billion for a show if users can already access it for free on Kodi? Piracy even has an effect on creativity. A study by Carnegie Mellon University shows that in areas of high piracy, the production of original content slows to a crawl.Blockchain technology offers an encrypted ledger that cannot be manipulated. Its data is also resistant to manipulation, which could spell the end of the multi-billion-dollar industry losses.As it stands, rather than investing in blockchain technology itself, Hollywood is doing what Hollywood does best\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s making a movie called Bitcoin, about other people who are ahead of the curve.If you\u2019d like to know more about a blockchain based platform that has the potential to support the production, and distribution of your independent film or TV show, check out Qravity.It\u2019s a platform that uses virtual tokens on the Ethereum blockchain to track digital content creation, distribute project stakes among creative team members, and bring content direct to market.The industry is ripe for change, and the technology to support change is rapidly evolving.

Some of those ideas evolve into hit movies, chart-topping songs, must-binge TV, killer apps, best-selling ebooks, and addictive video games. In order for project founders to make innovative content concepts a reality, they usually need a creative team. They also need a means of protecting their content from hacking and piracy during production and especially during distribution.A powerful ally in the fight against cybercrimeManaging creative projects is challenging at best, a chaotic mess at worst. Project founders have access to a wide variety of applications to help them guide their teams. These task assignment and tracking tools exchange data among team members, typically in the cloud. While this is highly secure, it\u2019s not perfect, a project\u2019s centralized data storage and transmission processes are vulnerable to hacking\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s just a matter of finding a single point of entry. Cybercrime has become a major concern in the entertainment industry since the 2014 Sony Pictures data breach; media development and distribution giants including HBO, Netflix, and Steam have also fallen victim to hackers.To help protect digital content during its development and distribution, Qravity is integrating blockchain technology into its platform. This ensures that the data in each project is immutable, tamper-resistant, less prone to being lost or deleted, and highly resistant to hacking.Piracy preventionA 2017 Digital TV Research report states that the global cost of piracy of TV shows and movies alone will total $52 billion by 2022, and that\u2019s not including sport or pay TV. Somewhat oddly, the piracy of video games may actually lead to increased video game sales, according to an extensive European Commission study. Despite the anomaly of the gaming industry, piracy is a serious, and costly, concern throughout the digital media industry as a whole.Blockchain tech can help reduce, or even eliminate, the piracy of a Qravity project founder\u2019s content. With a blockchain-based smart contract integrated into it, a person can only watch a Qravity-produced and distributed movie once they\u2019ve honored the conditions of that smart contract. In this example, the viewer needs to pay a quantity of Qravity\u2019s cryptocurrency, QCO, in order to \u201cunlock\u201d the movie. The contract\u2019s immutability prevents anyone from cracking and sharing the movie either directly with others or via torrent sites.Task tracking, ownership, and fair pay for creatorsProject founders who assemble creative teams to develop their ideas on Qravity also get an efficient means of paying the creators. The platform\u2019s built-in smart contracts enable them to allocate project ownership stakes in the form of Qravity project tokens (QPT) to each task. Once a creator completes a task, and thereby honors their contractual obligation, the smart contract sends the QPT allocated to that task to the creator. On project completion, whenever someone buys the resulting content with QCO, the creator receives a portion of that payment based on their QPT. This system keeps track of royalties, and ensures timely payouts, relieving the project founder of these responsibilities. At the same time, providing creators with shares in a monetizable digital content project reduces funding requirements.A path to successful content creationProject founders that use Qravity get much more than a comprehensive project management and communication tool. As it supports them and their teams to realize their vision, the decentralized content production and distribution platform helps protect their content and ensures equitable compensation for all team members.

But, what is the blockchain?By definition:Is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.So, the blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. Each block can contain transactions, files or any data you like. The important thing is that they\u2019re chained together using hashes.Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of events, medical records, and other records management activities, such as identity management, transaction processing or voting.How does a blockchain technically work?Understanding Blockchains reading article or tutorials isn\u2019t easy. Wandering among the many online guides I found this article by Daniel van Flymen and my curiosity to understand how it really worked has grown so much to try to create a blockchain using NodeJS.1. Create a\u00a0logoThe first step to creating a new project is to create the logo. It makes everything real. To do this I used Squarespace logo creator and this is the result:Now we can really start with our project.2. Start with\u00a0ExpressTo facilitate the creation of the APIs to interact with the blockchain I started the project directly with ExpressJS using the package npm express-generator npm install -g express-generator express ./chiccocoin cd chiccocoin yarnYou can find all the code online on this repo:thecreazy/chiccocoinchiccocoin - Chicco Coin: Learn what is a blockchain by creating onegithub.com3. Create the blockchainNow we\u2019re going to create our blockchain.Rereading the definition of blockchain we can summarize that the absolutely necessary functions are:newBlock: Function that creates a new blocknewTransaction: Function that creates a transaction and queues it to be saved the next time a block is createdhash: Function that encrypts a blocklastBlock: Function that will return the last block of the chainSo we can create our blockchain.js file with this structure:Start javascript class for the blockchainThe constructor of our class will create two important variables, chain, and current_transaction. Chain will contain, in order, all our block. Current_transactions will contain all the transaction that will be added to a block at the next mining3.1 Create a\u00a0blockBut what is a block? The representation that will use of a block is a javascript object that will contain:IndexTimestampList of transactionsProofHash of the previous BlockRepresentation of a blockIn this way the idea of blockchain becomes already a little clearer. Is a set of sequential blocks (index) linked to the previous one and secured using cryptography (previous_hash). The previous_hash inside the block it\u2019s the crux of the whole blockchain. It allows us to guarantee the safety and immutability of the whole chain. If an attacker could modify a block of a chain all the hashes immediately after that block would be wrong. Obviously it could try to recalculate the hashes of the whole chain and that\u2019s why more blocks there are more the blockchain is safe. Moreover there is an (identical) copy of the blockchain in every node (instance of NodeJS in this case) this makes it almost impossible for a hacker to be able to modify all the copies at the same time.So create a new block is very simple in our case. We just need to push a new object to the chain. The function will receive the proof (then we\u2019ll talk about what it is) and the previous block hash and will return the block. The function also will add to the block all the transactions that have not yet been saved and clean up our variable current_transactions3.1.1 Hash functionThe hash function that uses for our Chiccocoin is a trivial SHA256 but you can use the hash function that you prefer. The important thing is to do the hash of the previous block, to do this we will do the hash of the serialized object3.2 Create a transactionThe function to add a new transaction is very trivial. Is to add to the current_transaction array the transaction. A transaction is an object formed of sender, recipient and amount. It will be the mining function of storing transactions within a block. For utility we will make sure that the function returns to us the index of the block on which it will be savedThe blockchain file4. The Proof of\u00a0WorkIn general, the proof of work is a function or a protocol invented and used to deter denial of service attacks, but the blockchain used it to determinate how new Blocks are created or mined on themselves. The goal of a POW is to discover a number which solves a problem. This number must be difficult to find but easy to verify, like the calculation of prime numbers, more we go on the more difficult it will be to find one, but the effort to understand if it is or not will always be very banal.To mining a Chiccocoin we decide the create a c4ff3. Our POW will be this:Find a number p that when hashed with the previous block\u2019s solution a hash which starts with c4ff3 is produced.An example:c4ff3e9373e...5e3600155e860Let\u2019s code it. The functions that will be necessary are two:validProof: given the previous POW and a p number checks if the solution to the problem is correctproofOfWork: cycle until a solution is foundfunctions for the Proof of Work5. Serve over\u00a0APIHaving started the project with expressjs serving our blockchain via API will be very simple.We\u2019ll create three API:/transactions/new to create a new transaction to a block/mine to tell our server to mine a new block./chain to return the full Blockchain.I created a Chiccocoin support class, inside /middleware/chiccocoin.js, which contains all the necessary middleware for our APIs and instantiates a new blockchain5.1 The Chain EndopointThis endpoint will be very very simple. Just will return the chain array stored inside the blockchain5.2 The Transactions EndpointThe transaction endpoint will check the data passed and will call the newTransaction function of the blockchain. In the future we could use this middleware to check if actually sender and recipient are correct and/or the transaction can be done. We will use the information returned by the newTransaction function to inform the user on which block the transaction will be saved.5.3 The Mining\u00a0EndpointOur mining endpoint is where the chiccocoin becomes reality. It has to do four things:Calculate the Proof of WorkReward the miner (us) by adding a transaction granting us 1 coinAdd any pending transactionsForge the new Block by adding it to the chainThe chiccocoin.js fileWe can test all our API\u2019s via curl or via Postman.

Your first five minutes will be spent talking about the obscene housing market, followed by chest puffing about crypto exchanges and the next new application of distributed networks. Upwardly mobile brogrammers love to explain blockchain to the uninitiated.What follows is undoubtedly the best way to explain this exciting new technology at parties, especially parties where people arrive on motorized skateboards and tend make a sport out of superiority. Blockchain can be understood by anyone\u2014it just isn\u2019t always presented in a way that\u2019s interesting or relevant to some people\u2019s lives.In an effort to do just that, I ask you to imagine a marketplace of dick.In this marketplace, we all belong to a network that allows us to trade dick and keep a complete record of all dick activity. The Cockblockchain is a network of computers that all have the same record of dick use. In this way, it is decentralized, meaning that no one computer or person holds the records of dick transactions. As a dick gets traded from user to user, it is time-stamped and encrypted, creating a complete history of all dick activity. When you have an interaction with a dick, you can access it through a private key, which only you have. As the rider of the dick, you may add new information about it, and the history will be updated in real time across the network. Nothing attributed to the dick can ever be taken away. That is to say, the dick has a permanent, unerasable, documented record.This is the Cockblockchain.While the audit trail of any given dick is unerasable and public, the users are pseudonymous. While the Cockblockchain is pseudonymous in nature, it might be possible to tell that a particular user has reviewed a particular number of dicks on the chain, and if their opsex is bad, their identity could be outed.What makes this accounting/accountability of dicks secure is that it is not held or overseen by any one entity. There is no bank of dick that can be hacked. There is also no court of dick or dick state that can interfere or intervene. Instead, there is a network of peers that validate each dick transaction. These distributed peers do not need to trust each other in order to preserve this ledger of dick, but rather they can trust in the transparency of the system. In the Cockblockchain, this means not having to place all your confidence in one previous dick user\u2019s review on Yelp; rather, you can relax knowing that all previous users have had their chance to add information to the ledger\u200a\u2014\u200ano one can fake transactions, and everyone is watching. Think of the time and energy you might spend online looking for evidence of the provenance of a dick or deciding if you consider its last user to be a trustworthy source. This technology increases the speed and security of trading dicks.The public transparency of the ledger could, in and of itself, have radical consequences. If, for instance, in reading the history of a given dick, you decided that dick was not for you, you could boycott specific dicks or divest from dicks altogether. Some argue that this would allow you to clear bad actors out of the system. This is the Cockblockchain.Now, you might be thinking to yourself: Is this technology scalable? Surely there are more dick transactions than you can keep track of. While today\u2019s computer networks can log only three to 20 transactions per second, those figures are improving daily. One could imagine that there are many possible applications and outcomes for a ledger of dick. Some say it could revolutionize health care, some hope it will destabilize entrenched power structures, and others dream of a day when we trust each other more than we trust what any one dick has to say at a party.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Why Blockchain is a Hammer Looking for a Nail and Where it Might Find\u00a0it", "author_name": "Chris Herd", "link": "https://medium.com/@ChrisHerd/why-blockchain-is-a-hammer-looking-for-a-nail-and-where-it-might-find-it-adba41facf23?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 14", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "1.3K", "content": "Why Blockchain is a Hammer Looking for a Nail and Where it Might Find\u00a0itChris HerdBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 14I\u2019m here to tell you what most people\u00a0won\u2019tYour project almost definitely won\u2019t benefit, even 1%, from choosing to use blockchain. You\u2019re not using it for anything innovative that a centralized Oracle database couldn\u2019t do twenty years ago. That\u2019s what the posturing blockchain influencers and engineers looking to make a quick buck fail to share. They\u2019re doing absolutely nothing which is new or innovative.What you\u2019re doing is building a vanity project which strokes your own ego.You\u2019re not using blockchain technology because you have to, you\u2019re using it because you want to and think that it will impress other people. That\u2019s sad.The same is almost universally true for AI and Machine learning by the way. Both have rotted to become empty adjectives used to describe functions which have no characteristics of either. They amount to little more than fancy parlor tricks involving automated bots which act in a very small, specific niche.The sad reality is that we live in the replication age, the desires to innovate are nowhere to be found. Instead, people focus mindlessly on the replication of the existing. They take what use in their analog world and espouse about how their imagination of this thing recreated for a digital decentralized age will change the world. Sure, it might sound impressive but when you analyze the details\u2026There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what decentralization even is, its purpose and why it would ever be a means to an end. Without understanding that in first principles we are sentenced to repeat the mistakes of the past. Much like the dot com explosion, crypto and blockchain will encounter it\u2019s own reconning and it is fast approaching. It becomes so difficult to see the wood for the trees that absolutely everything you encounter either looks revolutionary or like a dumpster fire about to REKT the universe.You thought the crash of 2018 was\u00a0it?Not even close. That was, in fact, public sentiment running wild and had next to no bearing on the investment or innovation in the space. Yes, ICO\u2019s were an investment but not in the way that it typically matters, i.e. the money raised came from the pockets of \u2018unsophisticated investors\u2019 (not a term I used fondly but apt for this purpose). That meant that these projects were white elephants funded on nothing but sketches on the back of a fag packet. There was no diligence done on any of them and they raised capital on a white paper. Rather than focussing on things that were real and already had working prototypes, the focus drifted to nothing but financial reward. As it turns out, greed as an incentive to participate is an unlikely route to oversized returns.Institutional capital certainly has its faults, but for the most part, it can be relied upon to fund projects which conform to a very specific set of expectations. This in no way guarantees their success, or that the investments made are to people who reflect the range of diversity in the world, but their diligence on investments fall someway above a whim and a prayer.And that is the great pity. We focussed on the low hanging fruits, which is typically fine when focussing on such novel technology, but on this occasion, it turned out that they were rotten. The low hanging fruits weren\u2019t sweet.The solution then is to demand better and develop honesty. It\u2019s about ensuring we act with integrity rather than ego. It\u2019s about being braver and bolder and embracing the possibility of failure in the hopes or arriving at a far more exciting destination.Are you recreating the wheel? If so use the wheel that already exists.Don\u2019t let your ego lead to compounding misery like so much of the projects that exploded and have now crashed and burned.Blockchains promise is clear. It could enable trust in a trustless world. A final solution to the ephemeral problem of the Byzantine general. Where intermediaries have historically been required to ensure trust, technology can first reduce our reliance before rendering them completely unnecessary. That means Airbnb without the need for the platform to take a cut of your profits. It means Uber without the faceless shark that everyone seems to hate.Blockchain\u2019s killer app hasn\u2019t been invented yet.That\u2019s because of human greed and individual selfishness. Rather than building the impossible, we shirk the responsibility and take the easy route.The brutal truth of blockchain is that, like Thor\u2019s hammer, few are worthy to wield its\u00a0power.Unlike Thor\u2019s hammer, it is your imagination and bravery to dream that dictate whether you ever\u00a0will", "responses": "20"}, {"title": "Selling Cuties in Texas Might Prove\u00a0Awkward", "author_name": "Blockchain Cuties", "link": "https://medium.com/blockchain-cuties/selling-cuties-in-texas-might-prove-awkward-adb6b04ef979?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 12", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "7.4K", "content": "Selling Cuties in Texas Might Prove\u00a0AwkwardBlockchain CutiesBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 12Everybody is tweeting about House Bill 4371 from Texas.In a nutshell, it is about verifying the identities of whomever you plan to receive cryptocurrency from.It is hilarious in a way that this kind of verification is mainly used when you come to the bank to access your account.

For those who have not seen any of my presentations; let me explain why.The adoption of blockchain technology started with Bitcoin; a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This is very important to keep in mind when we now are working on solutions for Smart Contracts and large scale decentralized applications. Proof of Work (PoW) is an algorithm built for that specific use case: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. A few intelligent individuals have since then discovered that the same algorithms and protocols can be re-used for writing Turing complete applications. However, as mentioned, PoW was designed for Bitcoin\u2019s use case, and not for running high performance Turing complete applications, which has been quite evident during the last year.The focus to resolve this problem has mainly been to invent different versions of Proof of Stake (PoS). PoS is an attempt to mimic the PoW protocol, but by using token stake instead of hashing power. This saves energy resources and prevent 51% hashing power attacks, making it a valid option for use cases similar to Bitcoin that suffer from smaller network effect. By mimicking PoW, it is in core a variant of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, that can still be used for Smart Contracts, but is in essence not designed for that purpose. It fails to fulfill requirements that are of vital importance for real world use cases. One of the main problems in both PoW and PoS is that they suffer from lack of finality in each block, causing both transaction delays and impossibility to implement use cases that rely on finality.Figure 1: Chain in PoW and\u00a0PoSBoth PoW and PoS has the possibility to fork during normal operation. Anyone who have ever transferred a token from one wallet to another, or from one exchange to another, have seen the implication of the forking possibility. You are able to track your transaction in a block explorer but need to wait 12\u201330 \u201cconfirmations\u201d before the transaction is complete. Each \u201cconfirmation\u201d correspond to a new block in the blockchain. The reason that you have to wait for confirmations is simply because these algorithms may fork during normal operation, and the receiver have to make sure that the transaction is included in the \u201ccorrect\u201d chain (green blocks in Figure 1) and not one of the branches that will be cut off (blue blocks in Figure 1). This is often referred as ensuring that your transaction is part the \u201clongest chain\u201d. Stating that block time is 5 seconds in a PoW or PoS algorithm is of little importance to the actual application. You need to know how many confirmations that are needed. If for example 20 confirmations are needed, then the actual transaction time will be 100 seconds in a blockchain with 5 second block time.This is not only a problem in terms of transaction time. From business perspective, it is a risk management decision that has to be made. With x1 number of transactions and with estimated x2 USD value, can we accept that there is a x3 % chance that the transaction is not on the longest chain and will be rejected after x4 number of blocks?Many use cases cannot even be implemented at all, especially when we discuss blockchain as a solution to build real world Smart Contracts. Take a regular IOU for example; the very core property of an IOU is that there only exists exactly one version of it. With branching and forking in PoW and PoS, that IOU will have multiple valid copies under normal operation; one on each competing fork. One IOU becomes two or more IOU\u2019s. Even if the \u201cwrong\u201d block is rejected after the longest chain has been established, that status of multiplying the IOU is in itself unacceptable when working with this and similar financial use cases.Figure 2: Chain in\u00a0dBFTIn opposite to other blockchain platforms, NEO blockchain does not try to change a peer-to-peer electronic cash system into a Smart Contract system. The original blockchain architecture for Bitcoin is not built for Turing complete Smart Contracts; we need another architecture for large scale decentralized applications that fulfill the requirements from business and economic use cases. As such, PoW and PoS are both unsuitable. To meet the requirements, NEO Blockchain is built on delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT), an adapted BFT algorithm by Erik Zhang. The advantage with dBFT is that it cannot branch. There is always one and only one block proposed at any single time. Once the block is signed, it is 100% final. More information on the consensus algorithm can be found here:http://docs.neo.org/en-us/basic/consensus/whitepaper.htmlIn practice, it means that you no longer need to wait for several confirmations when sending transactions or invocations. The transaction is completed directly after it is included in a block, in other words in one single confirmation. It also means that the transaction time is actually completely equal to block time; if block time is 5 seconds, then the transaction is received in 5 seconds.Moreover, there is no risk management needed when sending and receiving large volume and high value transactions. With no branching during operation, all transactions are 100% complete after they are included in a block, so no risk analysis on finality has to be made. The transactions will always be on the correct / longest chain, since there cannot exist a branch chain in dBFT by the nature of the algorithm.Moreover, IOU and other financial Smart Contracts can be implemented in the NEO blockchain without the awkwardness that it may exist in two branches at the same time. You can deploy the Smart Contract directly on the public MainNet or even run your own NEO blockchain as a private chain; it will still have the same behavior. Large scale applications will also need dependencies and triggers, where chained transactions become a necessity. Chained transactions without finality become very problematic both in terms of risk management and end-to-end time. This is especially true for decentralized exchanges, where we are very likely to see a very large amount of chained transactions.Another disadvantage of weak finality blockchain is an issue that we have already experienced before, and more than once; the case of voting on special transactions. There will always be occasions where morality stand against \u201ccode is law\u201d. One example is if a terrorist group\u2019s wallet address is identified; shall it be frozen or not? Weak finality blockchains may split into two camps, one where the address is frozen and one where it is not. Perfect finality blockchains such as NEO will always only have one outcome, since there never is a simultaneous choice between two blocks.Further advantages:To help adoption, NEO Smart Contracts may be written in C#, Python, JavaScript, Golang, and Java; you will get up to speed quickly with the developers you already have access to. Training your team in a new programming language or employing a whole new team of dedicated Smart Contract developers are both very extremely expensive options. If you can cut this expense, then you have a much better starting point for building a profitable business model. The second obstacle to a profitable business model are high transaction fees, and this is the very reason why NEO blockchain has two native tokens: NEO and GAS. This ensures that transaction fees will always be close to zero, see this article for explanation.Transaction speed is 1000\u201310 000 transactions per second and continuously increasing, with goal to reach 100 000 transactions per second on-chain before 2020. The plan is to achieve this by two parallel projects that has been running for over 6 months, called neo-sharp and HyperVM. neo-sharp is a re-written implementation of NEO Blockchain which follows the same protocol rules, but with a modular architecture that simplifies both unit testing and integration testing, while also allowing for upgrades of individual modules. HyperVM is a rewritten version of NeoVM, written in C++, which is a lower level programming language that allows for more flexibility in optimizing performance. Second layer scaling is being developed by third-parties and will multiply the transaction speed even far beyond 100 000 tps. NeoX, a cross-chain protocol that will allow sidechains and interaction between any blockchain using NeoVM, will enter testing later this year.If you have any specific business requirement that NEO Blockchain currently is unable to fulfill, then please leave a comment.

Neither am I a financial advisor, nor is this meant to be financial advice. Whatever follows, just reflects my understanding of the project, and my personal opinion on its future outlook.Recently we have seen a lot of debate surrounding scalability of public blockchains, partly stemming from the CryptoKitties fiasco. CryptoKitties is an online game, created by Vancouver-based Axiom Zen, that allows users to purchase, trade, and breed digital kittens. Soon after its public release on November 28, the game took the cryptocurrency world by surprise, accounting for about 11% of total transactions on the Ethereum network, the blockchain that the CryptoKitties application is built on. The volume of traffic on the platform within the first week of its release was enough to put serious strain on the Ethereum blockchain, clogging the network, causing significantly slower transactions times and higher transaction costs for all the blockchain users.Some may argue that having an application like Cryptokitties on the Blockchain is frivolous, since the application is a non-coin related gaming platform. However, I think that this is a great application of the Blockchain technology, and why the technology is so disruptive. In fact Ethereum Co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, himself tweeted in support of the application, emphasizing on the value that the blockchain technology brings:So, maybe instead of asking the question: \u2018Should we have an application like CryptoKitties on a public blockchain?\u2019, we should really be asking the question: \u2018Shouldn\u2019t public blockchains be more scalable to real world application?\u2019. The fact is that, as of today, blockchains are limited in their ability to scale, which some argue is the biggest technological barrier to global adoption of the technology.What limits scalability of blockchains?Consensus protocols on existing public blockchains (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Neo, Ripple etc.) have a critical requirement for validation of transactions: every participating node on the network has to validate each transaction sequentially, and then store transactions on the ledger, a copy of which is maintained by each node. This requirement is what imparts, to blockchains, their key characteristic\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2018decentralization\u2019.However, in such a decentralized system, as the number of transactions on the network increases (with, for example, blockchain adoption), the need for additional nodes, to process and store transactions, also increases. As the number of nodes on the network increases, the data for each transaction has to travel a lot more before being validated and stored by ALL the nodes on the network. Therefore, the network does not scale well as more nodes are added to the network due to the inter-node latency that increases logarithmically with each additional node. In effect, blockchain scalability reduces as the network size increases.Public blockchain consensus protocols, that operate in this fashion, are forced to choose decentralization over high transaction throughput.Today, approximately 900 distributed applications (dApps) are built on the Ethereum Network. With a transaction throughput of about 15 transactions-per-second (tx/s), Ethereum is barely capable of handling the current transaction volume, and would have to scale significantly to be able to handle the expected transaction volume in the near future. The Bitcoin network is even worse in terms of transaction throughput, processing only about 4 to 7 tx/s. Similar is the story for all the existing public blockchain platforms, with some being slightly more scalable than others, but all glaring into a future where blockchain transaction throughput could be a severe bottleneck, hindering mass adoption of the blockchain technology.Researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have founded a blockchain startup called Zilliqa. This new blockchain uses the \u2018sharding\u2019 technology, that is set to achieve Visa and MasterCard level transaction throughput of about 4000 tx/s.How is Zilliqa a game-changer in the domain of public blockchainsZilliqa is a high-throughput public blockchain platform designed to scale to thousands of transactions per second. The reasons, I believe, Zilliqa stands out as a public blockchain platform suitable for global adoption are as follows:Zilliqa is linearly scalable. Linear scalability means that as the number of participating nodes in the network increases, the transaction throughput also increases at an almost linear rate. Although it may sound intuitive, the fact is that, for most blockchains, the opposite is actually true, i.e. as the number of participating nodes in the network increases, each transaction now has to be broadcasted to a greater number of nodes before being validated and added to the ledger, thereby limiting transaction throughput. This is the reason why many solutions to increase transaction throughput depend on restricting the number of participating nodes on the network, which comes at the cost of a reduced degree of decentralization.Zilliqa is the first public blockchain to implement sharding. Sharding is a concept that has existed for distributed systems for a long time, where it is used to improve scalability, performance, and I/O bandwidth. However, the concept has not yet been implemented on any public blockchain. Sharding is the process of automatic splitting of a network of nodes into parallel chains called \u2018shards\u2019, where each shard processes a small portion of all transactions in conjunction with other shards, resulting in a microblock from each shard. These micro-blocks are then merged into one complete block that is added to the blockchain. Zilliqa is now leading the way in implementing this automatic network parallelization for public blockchains.In October 2017, running with 3600 nodes and 6 shards, Zilliqa has already recorded a peak throughput of 2488 tx/s on its internal testnet. This is already about 250 times higher throughput than Ethereum. With the first version of Zilliqa\u2019s public mainnet scheduled for Q2 2018, this is a remarkable feat, and goes to show how Zilliqa is well on track to make the blockchain technology practical for high throughput applications, and hence global adoption.Zilliqa uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) just to establish mining identities, and not as a consensus protocol, thereby significantly reducing the overall energy footprint. This is fundamentally different from other PoW blockchains, like Bitcoin, where PoW is performed to mine every block, making the mining process energy intensive.Zilliqa uses an optimized practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (pBFT) consensus protocol which gives finality to transactions. In other words, unlike PoW-based consensus, where multiple confirmations are required, pBFT does not allow temporary forks due to the consensus protocol, i.e. once a block gets committed to the blockchain, no other block can share the same parent as the committed block. As a result, no confirmations are required.Zilliqa\u2019s pBFT based consensus allows for efficient management of storage requirements. Because of finality, the entire transaction history does not have to be saved on the blockchain. Instead it is sufficient to store only the latest state. With smart contracts, however, the storage requirements increase significantly. But Zilliqa is exploring collaboration opportunities with distributed cloud storage networks such as Bluzelle and Genaro Network, to be able to utilize their storage for storing blocks and fetching them, when needed, for the execution of smart contracts.Zilliqa\u2019s smart contract language is easier to reason and less prone to bugs. Unlike Ethereum, Zilliqa\u2019s smart contract language is not Turing complete, and instead it uses a non-Turing complete language, which makes it simpler, easy to understand, and more receptive to formal methods-based verification.Zilliqa is the only blockchain protocol that is truly scalable without sacrificing security or decentralization. There are other blockchain protocols that claim to have higher transaction throughput, but they achieve this, either by restricting the number of participating nodes on the network, thereby increasing the degree of centralization, or by making the blockchain more vulnerable to attacks, and hence reducing the security of the blockchain.How does Zilliqa compare against its \u2018competitors\u2019?Although Zilliqa\u2019s team does not see the other existing public blockchains as competitors, and rather takes a more open approach towards them, facilitating a healthy environment of learning from each project and developing on it, I use the term \u2018competitors\u2019 here in the conventional sense to be able to compare Zilliqa head-to-head against the existing blockchains. The following comparisons are based on the information shared by Zilliqa\u2019s team with the community.Zilliqa versus Bitcoin:Bitcoin network processes about 4 to 7 tx/s, whereas Zilliqa has already processed about 500 times more transactions per second on its testnet.Since Bitcoin uses PoW as a consensus protocol, it applies PoW on each block, making mining of blocks much more energy intensive. Zilliqa, on the other hand, uses pBFT as a consensus protocol, with PoW just being applied for miner identification. Therefore, the high energy costs associated with PoW will not apply in Zilliqa.Unlike Bitcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism, Zilliqa\u2019s pBFT gives finality to transactions, requiring no confirmations, which significantly reduces the storage requirements.Unlike Bitcoin, Zilliqa has smart contract functionality and it supports the building of dApps on its platform.Zilliqa versus Ethereum:Ethereum network processes about 10 to 12 tx/s, whereas Zilliqa\u2019s transaction throughput is already about 250 times higher.Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum also uses PoW as its consensus protocol. Therefore Zilliqa\u2019s pBFT consensus protocol makes it much more energy efficient.Ethereum\u2019s PoW-based consensus does not protect it against temporary forks, and hence requires a certain number of confirmations before the block is committed. However, Zilliqa\u2019s pBFT gives finality to transactions, requiring no confirmations, which significantly reduces the storage requirements.Unlike Ethereum, Zilliqa uses a non-Turing complete language for smart contracts, making it less prone to bugs, and more receptive to formal methods-based verification.Ethereum is still exploring Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and sharding as alternatives to improve scalability. However, Zilliqa has already chosen, and implemented sharding as its approach towards solving blockchain scalability constraints, possibly allowing it to run high throughput applications long before Ethereum. Zilliqa has the first mover advantage in the arena of truly scalable blockchains.Zilliqa versus NEO:As a consensus protocol, NEO uses delegated BFT (dBFT) that requires a sub-set of nodes, called book-keeping nodes, to run consensus on behalf of the entire network. These book-keeping nodes are also required to deposit and lock a sufficiently large collateral. The disadvantage of this approach is that if the number of book-keeping nodes is too large, it significantly reduces the liquidity from the market due to the locking up of a large collateral; and if the number of book-keeping nodes is too small, it reduces the degree of decentralization of the blockchain, making it less secure from attacks. On the other hand, Zilliqa uses pBFT for consensus, with a significantly large number of nodes that are not required to lock up any collateral. Therefore, Zilliqa\u2019s consensus protocol reduces neither market liquidity, nor the degree of decentralization or security.NEO deals with the challenge of scalability by running dBFT on a subset of the nodes, thereby reducing decentralization and security. Zilliqa solves the scalability challenge by using sharding the network and the transactions into parallel chains, each chain processing its own micro-block, to be merged into a final block. Thus, Zilliqa is truly scalable, while maintaining decentralization and security.Zilliqa versus EOS:EOS uses delegated PoS (dPoS) as its consensus protocol, where a subset of 21 nodes, called block producers, are used to propose blocks. This does yield a high throughput with scalability, but induces significant centralization and security risks for the network. Zilliqa is scalable without compromising the decentralization or security of the blockchain.The dPoS of EOS does not guarantee transaction finality, the way Zilliqa\u2019s pBFT does.Team and\u00a0AdvisorsZilliqa\u2019s team consists of highly renowned scientists, entrepreneurs and engineers with significant experience in the blockchain domain and cyber-security.The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Zilliqa, Xinshu Dong, has a PhD in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore (NUS), and is a practitioner in building secure systems. He has led several national cyber-security projects in Singapore, and has extensively published his research in renowned international conferences.Prateek Saxena is the Chief Scientific Advisor for Zilliqa, and has a PhD in Computer Science from University of California, Berkeley. He is a research professor in computer science at NUS, and has received several premier awards such as the Top 10 Innovators under 35 (MIT TR35 Asia) in 2017.The advisory board of Zilliqa also includes the prominent names in the blockchain industry, like Loi Luu\u200a\u2014\u200aCo-founder of Kyber Network, Vincent Zhou\u200a\u2014\u200aFounding Partner of FBG Capital, Nicolai Oster\u200a\u2014\u200aPartner at Bitcoin Suisse AG, and Alexander Lipton\u200a\u2014\u200aFounder and CEO of StrongHold Labs.Project RoadmapThe highlights of Zilliqa\u2019s roadmap are as follows:Zilliqa has already released public testnet v1.0Public testnet v1.5 release is scheduled for Q1 2018Public mainnet release is scheduled for Q2 2018dApps release scheduled for Q3 2018Zilliqa has a very active roadmap ahead, with the biggest event being its mainnet launch.Bottom LineThe bottom line is that, for Zilliqa, truly, sky is the limit.

Also, I am very happy to have a chat or share notes, just email me at ebrunet40@gmail.comThe total crypto market cap reached $132BN, Filecoin ICO raised $200m in 60mn and crypto helped Nvidia beat its own guidance for the most recent quarter. Even CNBC Africa launched a new program called Crypto Trader.What happened over the last few months?I have no idea if we are in a bubble but lots of money is going into the crypto space; companies who could not raise VC money and sometimes without a working product are launching Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and even the SEC has released an investor bulletin about ICO including some key points to consider when determining whether to participate in an ICO. I guess the market is hot. Even coinmarketcap has more reads than the WSJ.Coinmarketcap is now ranked higher than WSJ on Alexa. Go\u00a0crypto!Last spring saw a surge in the price of the Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by geopolitical and economic reasons including, among others, Trump\u2019s presidency, rising debt levels and new crypto friendly regulations in China and Japan. The price increase led many early Bitcoin and Ether investors to suddenly have a large war chest composed of mainly Bitcoin and Ether, worth from a few hundreds to a few millions of dollars.Most of the early adopters decided to embrace a classic early stage investment strategy named \u201cSpray and Pray\u201d, investing in as many ICOs as possible in order to gain exposure to at least a few successful ones which would return their total investment. Such a strategy does not require investors to perform in depth due diligence (which is good because it is really hard to assess a pre-product, pre-team and sometimes pre-whitepaper company). Here it is a numbers game. For this reason, many companies who struggled in the past to raise VC funding turned to ICO as they could easily raise a few millions dollars.Source: https://mgstover.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/HFA_071217_DigitalCurrency-1.pdfAt the same time, the mainstream public started to hear about stories of people becoming millionaires by investing in crypto (some even wrote a book) and companies raising millions with only a website and whitepaper written in LaTex. The influx of Retail investors and HNWIs wanting not to miss their chance to become a UHNWI has pushed the total crypto total market cap to a new high. Results? $1.7bn and counting raised from ICOs and a $130bn+ Crypto market cap. Crap. I should have listened to my Bitcoin enthusiast cousin in 2013.So what\u2019s next?Well some people see an opportunity as classic institutional investors are not yet equipped to invest in crypto currencies. At the same time, HNWI, family offices, private banks and others are looking to gain exposure to this new asset class. Just in case\u2026 you know... it becomes huge.Hence, anyone wishing to be in the crypto space has two options. Either start their own crypto fund, or start a company and do an ICO as soon as possible. The rest of the post will cover the first option, crypto funds.1- Pre-Trade. Execution. Post-Trade.

One needs to gather intel from slack channels (e.g. Coinfund), listen to specialised podcasts (E.g. EpiCenter), follow niche news websites (e.g. Coindesk), read on forum like Reddit. Once you have done that you need to build relationships with the team. For example have you been to the last Token Summit or Devcon2?Let\u2019s say you have a team of research analysts with a good understanding of the Blockchain. You nailed it. Great, but do you have data scientists with blockchain background? That is hard to find. Even Polychain is looking for one. Imagine you find one. He / She would need to build connectivity with different exchanges to gather historical / live data (or use Kaiko or Coinigy) to be able to perform quantitative analysis.In addition, to quant and fundamental research analysts you also need to have people with deep cryptography expertise. Finding talents who understand what is an ERC20 token and what impact the Plasma project may have on Ethereum is not easy. Even less easy when people with such knowledge could most likely do an ICO and raise millions.Execution. I still miss Bloomberg. Where is my broker?Execution differs if you are investing pre-ICO or post-ICO. The first is quite straight forward. A company asks you to transfer either BTC, ETH or LTC to a certain address and in exchange you will receive a certain number of tokens post-ICO. Recent ICOs use Coinlist to make things even easier and regulated. They often happen with a discount of 10 to 80%. This is great but you need to have access to these deals. As TwoBitIdiot explained, the Polychain and BlueYard Capital of the world will be in this deal. Not you. Game over.How about Post-ICO? Here you need to build relationships and order flow connectivity with as many exchanges as you can. I would say at least 15. Ari Paul from Blocktower has 20+. In addition, you need to find a reliable OTC broker. There are only a handful in the world that are recognised and legit like Genesis Trading from DCG. Note, even with strong relationships there is no insurance that you can get access to liquidity to buy / sell your tokens. It is different when you want to sell $2m than when you sell $20k. Moreover, there is always a counter party risk when you do business with a private exchange / OTC broker\u2026Some other questions to keep in mind: What is your risk management? How do you deal with pumps and dumps? Are there good enough measures of VaR etc. for those markets?Very different than investing in private securities, right? Or when you bought Apple shares on Charles Schwab, right?Post-trade. Where is my custodian? Cold or hot wallet?You bought your Bitcoin or other coins / tokens. What do you do with it? JPMorgan Chase does not provide token custody. Would you let $10m+ worth of coins sit in your ledger wallet? What is an air-gapped computer and is it really safe (apparently not)? Do you store your coins at your offices? Do you use Xapo as a custodian? What if you need to do a \u201cquick\u201d trade and you need to have some coins stored on exchanges? Is that ok?Regulation. The major systemic risk.The recent judgement on the DAO case was not a surprise for anyone involved in the crypto land. What was surprising was the detailed level of understanding of the SEC. Read the DAO report of investigation. It is super well written and comprehensive. From my view the main takeaway is that the SEC understands the ICO market quite well and there is a high chance that new regulations will come in the next 12 months.Some exchanges may have to stop trading certain tokens and will need to perform serious KYC checks. A good example is the recent news from Bitfinex (Suspension of U.S. Individual Verification Requests and Bitfinex will be barring U.S. customers from trading ERC20 tokens issued through \u201cICOs).You get the point. Pre-trade, Execution and Post-trade is not straightforward. It is not rocket science but you need proper resources, an acute awareness of the evolving regulatory situation and of course, some blockchain knowledge.Summary of the questions for each stage that one needs to think about for their crypto\u00a0fund.If you like my post don\u2019t forget to forward it, recommend it, add comments and share it with your friends.Best,EtienneFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/etiennebruSubscribe to my crypto job newsletter:******************************************************************", "responses": "16"}, {"title": "Amon to take center stage at the Blockchain Economic Forum, Singapore", "author_name": "Amon Tech", "link": "https://medium.com/@amontech/amon-to-take-center-stage-at-the-blockchain-economic-forum-singapore-daeae27d5558?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 30, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "3.4K", "content": "Amon to take center stage at the Blockchain Economic Forum, SingaporeAmon TechBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 30, 2018Come meet Amon\u2019s Founders at the Blockchain Economic Forum in Singapore that runs from February 3rd to February 6th.

Projects are raising money through the token model: selling the native token needed to use their corresponding networks (Ethereum\u2019s ether, Augur\u2019s Rep, IPFS\u2019 Filecoin, and others).What is the token\u00a0model?For the basics on how this token model works and why it\u2019s powerful, you can read my introductory post. I\u2019ll refer to these tokens as protocol tokens in this post\u200a\u2014\u200aa more accurate name to what others and I have called \u201cApp Coins\u201d in the past.When considering raising money through a token, a few common questions arise:Should we consider the token model?How do we perform the token sale?Is this legal?I\u2018m going to share current approaches and then offer ideas on future approaches using increasingly decentralized, on-chain methods.Should we consider the token\u00a0model?In short: if your project has a network effect, yes.While tokens serve many functions, the biggest benefit to the token model is that it provides the economic incentives for your network to get off the ground and overcome the classic chicken and egg problem. In other words, it gives all users of your app the ability to own a little piece of your network, incentivizing them to start using it at the start. This gives it a higher chance of success with a lot less capital needed.How do we identify the network effect in our\u00a0project?In some projects the network effect and token model is obvious. For example, the network effect of Uber is the growing network of riders and drivers. So the token model for a Decentralized Uber and dUberCoin is pretty straight forward: make dUberCoin the native token of the Decentralized Uber network and reward early riders and drivers with more of it at the start.Bitcoin was the first example of the token model: early miners could mine bitcoin of unclear value at the time\u200a\u2014\u200anow worth ~$65,000 per block\u200a\u2014\u200ausing just a laptop. While that\u2019s no longer possible, it attracted the initial miners needed to bootstrap the network.It may take a little work to think about what this would look like for your project. My hunch is that a surprising percentage of current and future businesses fall into this category since most businesses rely on some kind of network effect.It\u2019s important to recognize what the network (or networks!) within your project are. At the moment many \u201capps\u201d are really a bundle of a few things. For example, a food delivery app like GrubHub is really a bundle of: a network of restaurants and consumers, another network of restaurant advertisers (for sponsored placement in the app) and consumers, and a thin end-user client \u201capp\u201d that sits on top of these networks. Each of these networks could have their own token. It\u2019s also possible some tokens don\u2019t fully encompass all elements or what feels like the full value of a project. For example, Augur\u2019s Rep token allows you to participate as an oracle to the prediction markets of the network and get compensated for it, but doesn\u2019t take a cut of all transactions in the network.Different thin clients to the Twitter\u00a0networkThese underlying networks and their user interfaces will get unbundled and re-bundled. We will see a bunch of different interfaces to the same blockchain-based networks in the same way there were a bunch of different Twitter clients early on and there are a bunch of different Bitcoin/Ethereum wallets today. Similarly, we will probably see a bunch of different networks and their tokens under the hood of what feels like a single end-user \u201capp\u201d. WeChat is a great example of this: it has many different networks in one UI.WeChat\u2019s many networks in one\u00a0UIHow do we perform the token\u00a0sale?There have been two major types of fundraising through protocol tokens:1. Pre-release salesPre-release sales have historically been most common and can be conducted in fiat, digital currency, or some combination. Examples include Ethereum (pre-sold ether for bitcoin), ZCash (pre-sold ZCash for fiat in a traditional equity fundraise from angel and institutional investors). They occur when a project needs money to develop and test a protocol to get it off the ground. Importantly, this means the protocol\u2019s native token also has not yet been created, so IOUs for those tokens are being sold, not the token itself.Augur pre-release sale2. Post-release salesPost-release sales are increasingly common. While they can be conducted through a central escrow agent, they are increasingly being conducted through a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain which accepts crypto and atomically pays out the new protocol token. A recent example is the FirstBlood project. They occur when a project has launched an initial version of their protocol and corresponding token and wants money to continue its development. The project can then use digital currency raised to fund the continued development of the project.Sales conducted on-chain through smart contracts couldn\u2019t really be done before Ethereum, which is why they are a newer concept. I think this style will become the most common over time. Ethereum.org has a simple tutorial on how to code one up. You can also create your first basic token in 15 seconds using The Token Factory.Pre-release sales make sense: it\u2019s hard work to get a well-thought-out and tested protocol off the ground. Just like a startup, funding is often needed to get to an initial release. However, there are problems with these pre-release sales: we\u2019ve gone off the blockchain and there\u2019s now an IOU for a token that doesn\u2019t yet exist. We also now need some kind of legal entity to accept these initial investments (more on that later).A potential approach to get the early funding benefits of a pre-release sale with the reduced trust required in a post-release sale is as follows:Create your protocol token as a standard Ethereum (ERC20) token, but just release to the blockchain the standard functions needed to create the token and have it fit the ERC20 standard. At this point none of the \u201chard part\u201d of writing the protocol has been done. Said another way, you modularize the development of the protocol such that you just release the standard token functionality (send, receive, basic accounting) on-chain as the first piece of the protocol developed, with the rest to be completed later.Use the digital currency raised to fund further development of the protocol.Basic Ethereum token functionality, in\u00a0codeThis approach avoids the trusted/centralized \u201cIOU\u201d portion of pre-sales by giving token purchasers the token itself, even though the protocol is not yet complete. It obviously has its risks: projects funded this way could never come to fruition, like any early project. But the forces in the world from both sides are clear: developers want to be able to raise money to create new protocols and people want access to these new protocol tokens as early as possible. The two will converge and stabilize in a way where developers and future users can fund projects to a minimum viable product more easily.How much of the token should we sell and how should we distribute the funds\u00a0raised?Different approaches will make sense for different protocols.The current norm is setting aside 10\u201320% of the protocol tokens and selling the remaining 80\u201390%. A small portion of tokens set aside immediately goes to the core developers of the protocol to recognize their work to date, with the majority set aside to fund future work. This gives the project two sources of funding: the funds raised in the initial sale, and the ability to sell or disburse the tokens held back in the future.How these allocations work is evolving and taking ideas from traditional companies. An early example of this is ZCash, where there is a \u201cFounder\u2019s Reward\u201d that looks like the 4 year vesting schedule you\u2019d typically find in a startup.Whether or not these rough allocations make sense remains to be seen. A typical startup has the opposite structure: typically 20% (not 80\u201390%) of a project is sold in its first funding.And therein lies a key point in the early stages of protocol tokens. We have yet to hit a situation where the combination of funds set aside in the initial sale and tokens held back have run out\u200a\u2014\u200ayet. This is a close equivalent to running out of cash and the options pool in a typical company. Ethereum, for example, hasn\u2019t hit this bump yet because 1) it\u2019s young and 2) the price of ETH vs every fiat currency has, more or less, been on the rise, making the ETH the Ethereum Foundation set aside last longer. As a result, we\u2019ve never seen the idea of multiple fundraises as is common with startups. Running out of funds for future development seems likely, as work on these protocols is never really \u201cdone\u201d, although they may mature and change less over time.Some combination of three things will happen in the future as a result:Protocols will hold back more than 10\u201320% of the tokens in the initial sale. This allows for more cushion to fund development. In a scenario where these funds are not really needed, token holders could vote to distribute or burn those funds so all token holders get an even share of that value back.The companies who have built value-added services on top of these protocols will directly pay for or themselves work on the protocols in the future. We\u2019ve seen some of the major internet companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple do this with current core internet protocols. The Bitcoin Foundation is an early example of this: industry members had paid memberships which funded core developers.The users of these protocols could agree on mutual dilution. This is a way of using the protocol to raise funds for further development, much in the way that everyone in a startup will dilute themselves to create more options for new employees. This requires reasonably-functioning decentralized governance. Something similar was proposed by Vitalik when the Ethereum foundation was running low on funds, but became unnecessary as the price of Ethereum climbed. I\u2019m not aware of this being done yet in practice, but I think it will become more common in the future along with the first two points.Is this\u00a0legal?As with most legal questions, it seems the answer is: it depends. This model is new and largely untested. The most important question is whether or not it will be considered a security under US securities law. Some approaches to the various properties of a token which make it feel more like a security (thus riskier) and others which make it feel less like a security (less risky).One example is is the amount of functionality of the token. If the token is only a vehicle to pay out a portion of profits it feels more like a security. If it allows you to uniquely use and access a network with a specific utility it feels less like a security. Another factor is the marketing around a token. If it\u2019s marketed as generating or even guaranteeing profit, it feels more like a security. If it is marketed as serving a specific utilitarian purpose, it feels less like a security.We are currently working on an simple legal framework to categorize the level of risk associated with different approaches along with top lawyers and industry groups like Coin Center. We hope to open source this framework in the next few weeks as part of our goal to advance the decentralized application ecosystem. This post will be updated at that time. Coin Center, a non-profit industry policy group, published a good longer form report on this in January.Legal structures used to handle funds\u00a0raisedMost groups who have raised funds through a token sale create some kind of entity to handle the funds raised. The most common structure at the moment is setting up an (often Swiss) foundation. This foundation has some governance, much like the corporate governance you\u2019d see in a normal company, which determines both the initial and ongoing distribution of funds raised. This is what Ethereum has done, more or less. Many C corporations in the US are searching for a good structure at the moment.A simple answer here may ultimately be the best one: don\u2019t create an entity at all. Allow the token holders to vote on the disbursement of the funds raised to develop the protocol in a decentralized governance style.Pulling it all\u00a0togetherTo tie up a few of the ideas mentioned in this post, here\u2019s what doing all of this on-chain without the need for a central controlling entity might look like:For launch, the community and core developers suggest an initial allocation of the tokens which is baked into the protocol. Crowdsale smart contract is released and raises funds; sets aside for future protocol development.As time goes on, token holders (not just a central company or foundation) can vote on how to distribute the funds set aside for development.Contributors can be individuals or even a series of C Corps who have bank accounts to pay rent, salaries, and other costs, as long as funding decisions are done through decentralized voting or similar. This is the case with Maker DAO\u200a\u2014\u200athey have a few small companies and a series of individuals who are funded by the community. There is a risk personal liability enters where central liability fades here, but my gut is that lessens with reasonable decentralization.In all likelihood there will be some kind of core group making recommendations to the community which, if things are progressing reasonably, will be backed by the majority of token holders.This approach replaces the need for a central foundation, company, or entity with decentralized governance. As we\u2019ve seen in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other protocols, it\u2019s early days for decentralized governance in the realm of software protocols and there will be a lot of hard work and learning to do. However, given the nature and goals of most decentralized protocols, this probably produces the best outcome for all involved long term.At GDAX we want to see new protocols and their tokens flourish.

In\u00a0Short.Chris HammerschmidtBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 27, 2017Blockchain technologies top the lists of 2017\u2019s hot trends. Many companies already back their products with blockchain technologies. Competitors use different approaches to blockchain technologies, emphasizing different aspects and pitching them as features to their customers. In this post I will provide an overview of the role of one of those particular aspects of blockchain technologies\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cconsensus\u201d.Blockchains are diverse and can be approached from a variety of perspectives. For the sake of this article, I would like to define a blockchain as a public, decentralized database, that keeps public records in an append-only fashion. Moreover, once added into the database (the blockchain) a record cannot be modified and it is very difficult to falsify entries. This last feature is called persistence. When an entry in the database (the blockchain) needs to be updated, a new record must be appended to the existing information. Finally, each of records can be viewed by any member of the public, allowing for any person to individually verify the authenticity of each transaction recorded for any single entry in the database (the blockchain). This transparency means that blockchains are auditable.CC-BY-3 Theymos from Bitcoin wiki vectorization: The main chain (black) consists of the longest series of blocks from the first (genesis) block (green) to the current block. Orphan blocks (purple) exist outside of the main\u00a0chain.But why bother with blockchains over traditional databases anyway? Blockchains become immediately appealing as soon as a database needs to be decentralized. An organization looking to avoid putting too much emphasis on a single potential point of failure and to create a generally more robust system for their information might find a blockchain database more appealing than a traditional one. A distributed database cannot be hacked, manipulated, or otherwise disrupted the way a database build on one single operator can be.In addition, a traditional centralized database requires a user-controlled access system. That is to say, it requires a system directly operated by known and trustworthy individuals (whether that is a known person, organization, computer, or any other familiar operating unit). A blockchain, on the other hand, is operated by unknown and untrusted parties (that is to say, you cannot know if it is an individual person, and organization, a computer operating automatically, or whatever else\u200a\u2014\u200alet alone know them well enough to trust their decisions and actions implicitly).The lack of trust inherent in the blockchain system is particularly noteworthy to our topic of \u2018consensus\u2019. Because any entity, individual, or party can submit information to the blockchain (that is to say, try to add information to the database), it is necessary for the distributed operators of the blockchain to evaluate and agree on all addenda before they are permanently incorporated into the blockchain (the database). Because we cannot be sure of the author\u2019s trustworthiness, it is vital that all new information must be reviewed and confirmed before being accepted. This review results in the \u2018consensus\u2019 I am examining here.There are four main methods of finding consensus in a blockchain (and all distributed systems, for that matter): the practical byzantine fault tolerance algorithm (PBFT), the proof-of-work algorithm(PoW)\u00a0,the proof-of-stake algorithm (PoS), and the delegated proof-of-stake algorithm (DPoS).The Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithm (PBFT)was designed as a solution to a problem presented in the form of an allegory (source):Imagine that several divisions of the Byzantine army are camped outside an enemy city, each division commanded by its own general. The generals can communicate with one another only by messenger. After observing the enemy, they must decide upon a common plan of action. However, some of the generals may be traitors, trying to prevent the loyal generals from reaching agreement. The generals must decide on when to attack the city, but they need a strong majority of their army to attack at the same time. The generals must have an algorithm to guarantee that (a) all loyal generals decide upon the same plan of action, and (b) a small number of traitors cannot cause the loyal generals to adopt a bad plan. The loyal generals will all do what the algorithm says they should, but the traitors may do anything they wish. The algorithm must guarantee condition (a) regardless of what the traitors do. The loyal generals should not only reach agreement, but should agree upon a reasonable plan.To clarify the allegory for our purposes: the \u2018generals\u2019 in the story are the parties participating in the distributed network running the blockchain (database) in question. The messengers they are sending back and forth are the means of communication across the network on which the blockchain is running. The collective goal of the \u201cloyal generals\u201d is to decide whether or not to accept a piece of information submitted to the blockchain (database) as valid or not. A valid piece of information would be, in our allegory, a correct opportunity to decide in favor of attack. Loyal generals, for their part, are faithful blockchain participants, who are interested in ensuring the integrity of the blockchain (database) and therefore ensuring that only correct information is accepted. The trecherous generals, on the other hand, would be any party seeking to falsify information on the blockchain (the database). Their potential motives are myriad\u200a\u2014\u200ait could be an individual seeking to spend a BitCoin that she does not actually own or another person who wants to get out of contractual obligations as outlined in a smart contract he already signed and submitted.Various computer scientists have outline a number of potential solutions to the Byzantine generals problem from the allegory. The practical byzantine fault tolerance algorithm (PBFT), which is used to establish consensus in blockchain systems, is only one of those potential solutions. Three examples of blockchains that rely on the PBFT for conses are Hyperledger, Stellar, and Ripple. Very roughly and without explaining the whole algorithm (which would take a multiple page research paper), what the PBFT does is as follows: Each \u2018general\u2019 maintains an internal state (ongoing specific information or status). When a \u2018general\u2019 receives a message, they use the message in conjunction with their internal state to run a computation or operation. This computation in turn tells that individual \u2018general\u2019 what to think about the message in question. Then, after reaching his individual decision about the new message, that \u2018general\u2019 shares that decision with all the other \u2018generals\u2019 in the system. A consensus decision is determined based on the total decisions submitted by all generals.Among other considerations, this method of establishing consensus requires less effort than other methods. However, it comes at the cost of anonymity on the system.The best-known method of reaching consensus on a blockchain is the proof-of-work (PoW) scheme, which is used by Bitcoin. In contrast to the solution in the PBFT, PoW does not require all parties on the network (all nodes) to submit their individual conclusions in order for a consensus to be reached. Rather, PoW is a system which uses a \u2018hash function\u2019 to create conditions under which a single participant is permitted to announce their conclusions about the submitted information, and those conclusions can then be independently verified by all other system participants. False conclusions are prevented by the parameters of the hash function, which ensure that false information will fail to compute in an acceptable way. (For more information, follow me here, or subscribe down below.) In the Bitcoin system specifically, the participant who publicly verified the information on behalf of the network is in turn rewarded for its participation (which is costly in real terms of energy cost and computing resources) with newly created (\u2019mined\u2019) Bitcoins. Therefore this process of searching for valid \u2018hashes\u2019 (solutions to the \u2018hash function\u2019 created by the message input), is known as \u2018mining\u2019. Incentivizing participation in the network ensures broad participation, which in turn ensures a more robust network and a safer blockchain (database).This Bitcoin-style PoW scheme allows for easy, broad participation, which in turn ensures greater network stability with minimal requirements on each participant, allowing participants to remain for example anonymous.A third variation on establishing consensus on blockchain systems is extremely similar to the aforementioned PoW system, however participation in the consensus-building process is restricted to parties identified as having a legitimate stake in the blockchain (e.g. individuals who own bitcoins or entities who have smart contracts saved in the same blockchain database). This third variation, called proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms replace the hash function calculation with a simple digital signature which proves ownership of the stake. The network selects an individual to approve new messages (that is to say, confirm the validity of new information submitted to the databse) based on their proportional stake in the network. In other words, instead of any individual attempting to calculate a value in order to be chosen to establish a consensus point, the network itself runs a lottery to decide who will announce the results, and system participants are exclusively and automatically entered into that lottery in direct proportion to their total stake in the network. As in the PoW system run by Bitcoin, the PoS system run by organizations such as Peercoin also provides an incentive to participation, which ensures broadest possible network participation and therefore the most robust network security possible. In the Peercoin system, the chosen party is rewarded with a new Peercoin in a process called \u2018minting\u2019 (rather than BitCoin\u2019s \u2018mining\u2019).This system, however, by rewarding those who already are most deeply involved in the network inherently creates an increasingly centralized system. This is inimical to a truly robust network. Therefore proponents of PoS systems have put forward a number of various modifications to help ensure the base for their networks remain as broad (and therefore secure) as possible.The final method of establishing consensus is perhaps the most centralized, however it counteracts the large stake holder power that PoS systems entail and enables the system to work much more quickly. This method, called a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) system works along the same lines as the PoS system, except that individuals choose an overarching entity to represent their portion of stake in the system. So imagine, each individual decides if entity 1, 2, or 3 (these could be, for example, computer servers, and are called \u2018delegate nodes\u2019 within a DPoS system) will \u2018represent\u2019 his or her individual stake in the system. This allows individuals with smaller stakes to team up to magnify their representation, thereby creating a mechanism to help balance out the power of large stake holders. This comes at the cost, however of greater network centralization. Bitshares is one company that employs a DPoS system.While these four systems for establishing consensus are currently the most dominant, the field is still wide open to innovation. As blockchain systems continue to gain in popularity, they will also continue to grow in scale and complexity. Which of these four consensus building systems (if any) is best equipped to handle this ongoing expansion remains to be seen. Currently, companies choose a system for their product that best meets their (or their customer\u2019s) needs for speed, efficiency, and security.It is important to note, these systems differ not only in the details of the formation of their respective consensus-building communities, but importantly they differ in how they would handle potential attacks. This is, in fact, one of the clearest distinguishing features between the four consensus-building systems: the potential size of an attack on the system that could be easily managed. To return to the Byzantine general analogy I opened with, that is to say, each of these four system can cope with a different proportion of \u2018treacherous generals\u2019 before it begins to make bad choices.The systems that don\u2019t use proof-of-work are also often called virtual mining systems because they don\u2019t have a mining activity. It is currently unknown whether or not having to solve a work problem has a real security advantage over the virtual mining systems.If you liked the article, follow me and recommend the article.

Image: Todd Dwyer CC-BY-SA\u00a02.0AI \u2661I think it\u2019s amazing that you can design algorithms that might have society-level impact. AI algorithms are in that category. And, AI is fun. Take Genetic Programming, where you write computer programs to evolve other computer programs. Moreover, AI poses exciting engineering challenges like scaling, and it asks the biggest questions, like the nature of the mind.For these reasons, AI was my first love. I started my AI reading and hacking intently in the early 90s. By 1997, I was far enough along hacking AI that people started paying me to do it. I never looked back, doing two companies and a PhD on AI.Genetic programming is code to evolve code, which (in this case) grows analog circuits. From [McC2011]Blockchain \u2661In 2013, I started hacking on Bitcoin, and got hooked. Once again, I found myself designing algorithms that might have society-level impact.Like AI, Blockchain is great fun, from learning new consensus algorithms, to vicariously watching ICO madness.Also like AI, blockchain poses exciting engineering challenges like scaling, and asks big questions like the nature of truth. What\u2019s not to love?AI \ud83d\udca5BlockchainBlockchain has been my focus for several years. But AI was always my first love, and I never let go. I kept reading AI papers, giving keynotes on AI, co-running Berlin\u2019s biggest AI meetup, and more.Would the worlds of AI and blockchain ever collide? I\u2019d always hoped so, and they finally collided for me in mid 2016. It was over drinks with my dear friends Simon de la Rouviere and Greg McMullen. We started dreaming what might happen if you unleashed AI into a decentralized substrate like Ethereum. The first AI millionaire! AIs with rights, using today\u2019s legal infrastructure! Minds blown. We wrote about it, in AI DAOs articles by me [2] and by Simon. What fun! There\u2019s more coming..\u00a0;)From that first foray into AI*blockchain, I started asking: what other ways might blockchain help AI? The number of the answers surprised me. I documented it in this piece. For example, we can address \u201cgarbage-in, garbage-out\u201d problems with provenance on training data and on building models themselves. Blockchain helps sharing datasets, for higher-accuracy models and more.DataAs I contemplated blockchains for AI, and for big data, all roads led to the same place: the problem of data. Here\u2019s the issue. Many enterprises have plenty of data but don\u2019t know how to make it available to the world. Latent value lurks everywhere. Conversely, many startups know how to turn data in to value using AI, but they\u2019re starving for data.Only a handful of companies in the world\u200a\u2014\u200aGoogle, Facebook, and the like\u200a\u2014\u200ahave both massive datasets and the AI knowledge to turn it into value. Their moat is data, not AI algorithms. Calling themselves AI companies is merely a head fake. They\u2019ve used the combination of data * AI to become the most powerful companies in the world.It\u2019s 2017. Society runs on data, yet much of it is controlled by a handful of companies with more power, resources, and reach than most nations. How can we equalize access to data, and therefore opportunity to make the most of modern AI and compute?Data Marketplace FTW?All roads lead to the same solution too: a data marketplace. A medium to connect data-haves with data-have-nots. It spreads out data-AI network effects, in turn spreading power and wealth.But the technology is not easy. It needs to store who owns what data, with tight user control & privacy. It needs to reconcile with governments and regulators on privacy and data sharing. It needs to be decentralized. It needs to be at scale, not just some shiny toy technology. Decentralized tech at scale is hard. However, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been working on since 2015: IPDB running BigchainDB. A shared planetary-scale database.This data marketplace needed to get built. We realized that we had a unique position to make a difference. First, we had the scalable blockchain database technology. Second, we had both AI and blockchain expertise, key for designing data marketplace algorithms. Third, we knew the customers\u2019 worlds, both data suppliers (enterprises) and data buyers (AI companies). Finally, we\u2019d built relationships with governments and data regulators.Something else happened as we went down this path. Others read my articles, reached the same conclusion as us (data marketplace\ud83d\udca1), and reached out. Two main projects emerged, backed by excellent people: with Chris Ballinger at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) and Chirdeep Chhabra at DEX (Data Exchange SG). We\u2019ve worked with both of them since early this year.Toyota Research Institute (TRI)With TRI, we built a prototype marketplace for self-driving car data which we announced in May 2017 at Consensus NYC. Here\u2019s the code.Autonomous vehicles prototype marketplace (AVDEX).We also used this an an opportunity to try out zero-knowledge proofs for privacy. The conclusion: brain-bending and fun, but does not meet the speed we need for industrial deployment. Yet.Data Exchange SG\u00a0(DEX)DEX is a Singapore-based startup, which has been shipping a centralized data marketplace for a few years. By 2017, their growth had stalled: customers were worried about who controlled the data. I\u2019ve known the CEO of DEX, Chirdeep Chhabra, for a few years. He reached out to me in early 2017 and said \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d He\u2019d realized that appropriate decentralization technology could make all the difference. It was the start of a great collaboration.Ocean ProtocolWe started by considering a decentralized data marketplace. But we realized that we could unlock a whole ecosystem of marketplaces, exchanges, of ways to supply data and consume data.What we needed was a protocol and network, on which data marketplaces can be built. This is Ocean. Its network (running the Ocean protocol) handles storing of the metadata (i.e. who owns what), links to the data itself, and more. On top of Ocean there can be thousands of data marketplaces and exchanges, all accessing the same data. Each marketplace acts as the last mile in connecting buyers and sellers.We hope that Ocean will unlock our dream of a world-scale data commons. Ocean\u2019s token design reflects this goal.Ocean ProtocolUp nextWe\u2019re working closely with DEX and other marketplaces, data regulators, data suppliers, data consumers, and others to make this vision a reality.In coming weeks and months, we\u2019ll be sharing more information about Ocean. Protocols. A Whitepaper. Blog posts. Code. Stay tuned:)And, welcome to the future of data.

On April 20, Mr. Charles Huang, the Investment Business and Operation Representative of Global Risk Exchange (GRE) participated in the one-day sub-forum of \u201cBlock Chain Financial Ecology\u201d, and introduced the Global Risk Exchange, an innovative insurance project based on the blockchain technology. In the follow-up roundtable discussion, he presented a few ideas and the vision of the role which blockchain technology could play in the financial industry. Finally, Global Risk Exchange (GRE) was awarded \u201cBest of Blockchain & Financial Innovation Award\u201d and won a big round of applause.The financial industry is undergoing an unprecedented fintech revolution on a global scale. It is no longer operating in the \u201ctraditional\u201d model, but in a more dynamic and efficient manner. This is a challenging turn-back. Starting from the general environment, Charles expounded the disadvantages of the traditional insurance industry, such as long industrial chain, tedious intermediaries, data retention disorder, low level of innovation, poor user experience, etc., and then proposed to solve these problems by establishing a decentralized risk exchange.Firstly, the decentralized approach of blockchain technology can significantly lower the threshold for everyone to participate in insurance activities. The insurance company is \u201cdisassembled\u201d, the sales channels, actuarial pricing and underwriting capacity, and other related factors are \u201csplit apart\u201d and \u201cdistributed\u201d onto the blockchain, and any competent individual and organization can participate and play their own role; secondly, the efficiency and stability are improved, both insurance premium and margin will be automatically locked in the chain according to smart contracts, so that the insured can obtain the deserved compensation funds even if the insurer is unable to make the payment due to any possible risks; thirdly, the insurance policy purchased or sold on the GRE platform can circulate in the secondary market, when the insured or the insurer changes its judgment on risk pricing, users can deal with each other in the secondary market which helps to promote the market liquidity; at last, the user data, processes of underwriting and claim settlement, etc. will be more secure due to the decentralized community environment of the blockchain. \u201cEventually, all insurance contracts will be made into smart contracts.\u201d Charles expressed his expectation for the insurance industry in the context of blockchain technology.The GRE project is developing smoothly at present and expected to launch the main net in May this year. GRE also cooperated with AXA\u200a\u2014\u200aan enterprise among World Fortune 500, and planned to launch an agricultural insurance based on the weather index in Southeast Asia region.On the same day, Charles and the other present blockchain elites participated in a roundtable discussion titled as \u201cDoes the block chain have the potential of becoming an industrial chain and what kind of opportunities and challenges we might be faced with\u201d. In the discussion, Charles pointed, \u201cThe infiltration of the blockchain will be relatively fast in the aspect of payment and transaction.\u201dHe said, \u201cThe relatively virtual fields, such as insurance and bond, may be a primary battlefield for development of blockchain technology. While in the fields which have a strong interaction with the real world, such as physical assets and antique assets, there will be a wide gap between the actual world and the block chain world. By far, it\u2019s not clear how to fill the wide gap. Therefore, I insist that the blockchain will be used faster in the virtual transaction. \u201cWith the expansion of cryptocurrency market, the term \u201ctoken economy\u201d is more and more recognized by the public. When it comes to how to evaluate the boom of the \u201ctoken economy\u201d, Charles preferred to understand it as a change of production relations. He claimed that in the traditional equity world, shareholders would share a large proportion of surplus value, while in the token economy, the community incentive mechanism would allow some early builders and participants to get more rewards, which is in favor of building consensus and bringing realizable expectation. This may be a possible change brought forth by the token economy. \u201cIn the future, we will have a new option to acquire wealth\u200a\u2014\u200anot by working for one company, but by joining multiple communities.\u201dWhile the summit was coming to an end, there was still a big surprise. \u201cBest of Blockchain & Financial Innovation Award\u201d was finally awarded to GRE, which brought us much more confidence and motivation. With critical thinking and down-to-earth spirit, the GRE will explore the insurance industry by using the blockchain technology, build an innovative risk exchange platform, and contribute to the industry and even the whole society.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "GEMERA Presented its Project at the World Blockchain Forum", "author_name": "GEMERA", "link": "https://medium.com/@gemeraproject/gemera-presented-its-project-at-the-world-blockchain-forum-9dcfed8620c5?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 20, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "17.4K", "content": "GEMERA Presented its Project at the World Blockchain ForumGEMERABlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 20, 2018The past 16 and 17 April, in Dubai, took place the World Blockchain Forum (WBF), where GEMERA, project that issues the only crypto-token backed by Colombian emeralds, presented its initiative to leaders, economic pioneers, enterprising investors, ICOs and other entrepreneurs which have in common the interest and passion for the blockchain technology and the crypto economy.GEMERA addressed the audience, gathered in the magnificent hotel Madinat Jumeirah, and exposed its purposes and philosophy, which mainly consist on the seek for the improvement of the emerald distribution chain in Colombia, through the benefits of the blockchain technology and the issuance of a token backed by a stable asset, as well as to contribute to the enhancement of the quality of life of the communities nearby the emerald mines and to carry out projects to protect the Colombian natural resources.\u201cThat is why part of the project funds will be used to develop social and environmental strategies, along with emerald producers, which are our main partners\u201d, said Danny Arteaga, CCO of GEMERA, who presented the project.It was also an opportunity for the project to explain the process before the issuance of the crypto-token; present its marketplace, website with information and details of the emeralds that back the tokens, which is already on line with the current stock; and the use of the tokens, including the alternative of the redemption for emeralds.World Blockchain Forum was a special scenary to share knowledge and experiences about the blockchain and its importance in the future, from different points of view, and also a spotlight for all those rising projects which have in common the purpose of transforming the world.

The platforms that dominate the burgeoning internet of value could easily command trillion dollar market caps.TL;DR: See the full list of crypto tech to pay attention to in 2019 at the bottom.At the end of 2018, developers are tired of waiting for scaling on the EVM to become a thing. Emerging technologies like Raiden Network\u2019s arrival on Ethereum mainnet bring long-anticipated hope to Ethereum developers, but it may be too little too late. This year, alternative blockchains with faster layer 1 consensus baked in are starting to attract developer attention. Where developers go, apps and users follow.It\u2019ll be hard to catch up, though. Ethereum has thousands of developer courses, tutorials, articles, and Stack Overflow answers, and that\u2019s quite a head start. They also have the largest, most active community working on improvement proposals and core protocol development.Developers may be frustrated with slow transactions and terrible user interfaces, but Ethereum still owns the developer mindshare by a wide margin. Over 3,000 ICOs have launched on Ethereum, and its closest competitors are still in the low hundreds. Ethereum has suffered some major blows in 2018, but a big rally this week serves as an answer to challengers: Don\u2019t count Ethereum out just yet.Ethereum bounces: This ain\u2019t over\u00a0yet!Top 24 hour gainers, December 28,\u00a02018Dominant ThemesThe dominant crypto theme in 2017 was the ICO big bang: The dawn of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). That explosion continued to expand through the first half of 2018, before regulatory concerns cast a chilling effect over the crypto industry.Monthly ICO funding: 2014\u20132018 source:\u00a0CoinDeskThere were two dominant themes in 2018:The BUIDL runway\u200a\u2014\u200acan we get our crypto projects to market before the money runs out? Sub theme: Waste in the crypto industry. Many companies spent outrageous money flying all over the world for conferences before they built a viable product. Spending money on marketing before you\u2019ve built an MVP is the opposite of LEAN startup philosophy that has dominated wise tech leadership since the 2001 dot com bubble burst.The crypto \u201cwinter\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aAt the end of 2017, the crypto market crossed another 10x growth marker. Every time that happens, the market pulls back before climbing to another 10x multiple higher than the last. 2018 was the first year following a 10x peak, so naturally, we took another tumble. Unfortunately, many crypto projects kept the money they raised in the market during an 80%\u201390% slump in prices, and now the money is running out. This has led to a lot of layoffs. (See also: \u201cBUIDL Christmas: The Story of the Blockchain Christmas Layoffs\u201d)What does that mean? The Crypto market has predictable ups and downs. Based on past performance, we know that after we hit the next 10x marker, the prices are very likely to tank 80%\u200a\u2014\u200a90% in the following months. What this means for treasuries is that they should plan out the project runway\u200a\u2014\u200atraditionally at least 18 months of operating expenses, and stash that money in fiat currency to protect it from the market down cycle. That way, they can keep operating no matter what the crypto market does. If there are extra funds after putting that runway into safekeeping, sure, keep that money in the market and hope for long-term gains while you BUIDL.Many projects failed to do that. Those companies are forced to cut staff, and IMO, they should start with the treasurer.Bitcoin price (log): Each new red arrow is 10x higher than the\u00a0lastSavvy crypto investors are aware of the market cycles, and plan strategies for long term investments that they expect to stay in for 7\u201310+ years. To those investors, prospects for crypto investments are starting to look good again.A note about the \u201cthe crypto winter\u201d: The crypto market has never seen a winter like the one that the AI industry experienced between 1987 and 2009, which likely inspired the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d name. During the very real AI winter, researchers used euphemisms like \u201cmachine learning\u201d, and \u201canalytics\u201d to secure funding to avoid the stigma of \u201cAI\u201d, which many had begun to see as utopian sci-fi that would never be real.

But already, a new breed of crypto apps is emerging.The crypto-enabled Brave Browser (led by Brendan Eich, cofounder of Mozilla, and the creator of JavaScript, the standard programming language of the web platform) has had more than 10 million installs in the Google Play store. Brave makes it easy for users to earn and spend the Basic Attention Token (BAT) cryptocurrency. You can earn crypto by browsing your favorite sites. If you opt in, Brave will replace the potentially dangerous tracking ads served by the ad networks with ads that won\u2019t track your behaviors. In exchange, you\u2019ll earn BAT automatically, just for doing what you always did.Screenshot: Brave browser integrated BAT\u00a0walletSliver.tv is a video game streaming site which lets video game players stream their gaming sessions live for other game lovers to watch.

With more than 20k monthly active users, Sliver.tv may be the most popular crypto-enabled app to date for use by a general audience (i.e., not an investment/exchange/wallet app).Sliver.tv is a very promising start, but it uses a centralized, custodial wallet and users can\u2019t withdraw funds.Cent.co is a look at the future of content-based social networks. Imagine the best of Twitter and Medium: Long form content presented in bite sized content streams that you can expand for the big picture. You can tip users who create the content, and you get rewarded when other people tip, too. Tipping is called \u201cseeding\u201d. When you seed content, a portion of that money goes to the original content creator, and a portion goes to everybody who seeded the content before you did. It creates a financial incentive to post high quality content, and to seed content that you think will become popular on the platform.Cent screenshotCent started life as a way to offer bounties to get some work\u200a\u2014\u200aany kind of work\u200a\u2014\u200adone by the users of the Cent ecosystem. You can ask a question and offer a bounty for the answer. You could ask for logo design help, or ask for help editing your latest post. Anything that\u2019s worth money to you. You control how much money you\u2019re offering, and the number of recipients who will receive that money, so you\u2019ll never accidentally blow your budget if your offer goes viral. The idea behind Cent was to create an economy that could allow its users to quit their day jobs and start earning money online using only their talents and the Cent platform. I\u2019m not sure how much money people are making per hour on Cent, but what I am sure of is that it looks very promising.It\u2019s also one of the most user-friendly dApps I\u2019ve seen to date, and so far, I\u2019m not seeing any signs that it\u2019s being bogged down by Ethereum scaling issues. To use Cent, you\u2019ll need a Web3 browser like Trust or Coinbase Wallet.I\u2019m still anxious to see a dApp with a user-controlled wallet reach more than 10 million users. Will it happen in 2019?Ethereum ChallengersEthereum challengers are rolling into production and community building phases in 2019. Ethereum has a huge head start, but 2019 may be the year that the competitive pressure really begins to squeeze. Ethereum challengers come primarily in two shapes: ICO platforms and dApp platforms.Potentially, many challengers will fill both roles, but it may help to look at them independently, anyway.ICO platforms\u200a\u2014\u200aAlmost since the day it launched, Ethereum has been the standard platform to build on if you want to launch an ICO. Smart contract applications have yet to gain any real user traction, but ICOs were a smash hit in 2017 and 2018.Ethereum is no longer the only choice for launching an ICO in 2019, and may not be the best choice. Competitors are starting to step up. In 2018, hundreds of cryptoassets launched on competitors. In particular, Waves recognized that launching cryptoassets was the killer app of Ethereum, and set out to make it easy. They did just that. You can issue a new token on Waves with absolutely no coding required.Screenshot: Waves token generation toolThey also have a mass transfer feature that lets you easily distribute your tokens to lots of people\u200a\u2014\u200ato conduct airdrops or distribute tokens from your ICO, for example. The hard part of conducting an ICO is exchange listing. The Waves wallet includes an integrated Decentralized EXchange (DEX) so users can start trading your new token immediately. The Waves DEX functionality compares favorably to centralized exchanges, and easily beats the user experience in any of the competitive Ethereum-based DEXs. Unlike centralized exchanges, DEX funds are managed by user-controlled keys, so they don\u2019t have to trust a centralized exchange with custody, or worry about what happens if an exchange gets hacked. The Android Waves wallet has been downloaded more than 100,000 times.Ethereum is still the most popular token launch platform by a huge margin, but Waves has managed to attract hundreds of projects. Stellar is another popular alternative ICO platform that\u2019s not far behind. A few projects have launched on other alternative platforms including NEO, EOS, etc., but it looks like Waves and Stellar may pull away from the pack in 2019 for new token launches.There\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll attract a lot more projects which would have otherwise launched on Ethereum in 2019.dAppsThe promise of the crypto space is to build the internet of value, and you might say decentralized applications play a central role. But what exactly is a dApp? Why are they important, and which dApp platforms will reshape the game in 2019?What is a dApp? dApp is short for decentralized application, and it\u2019s essentially the antithesis of what centralized applications are. A centralized application controls the user\u2019s data. For example, your banking app helps you manage your bank account balance, but you technically don\u2019t control that money\u200a\u2014\u200athe bank does.If they want to lend it to other people without asking you, they can (and do!) If they want to freeze your accounts, they can. If they want to delay your withdrawal, they can.Facebook is another great example. If Facebook wants to share your list of friends with a 3rd party developer, they can do so without your permission. If they want to share your private messages, they can. If they want to shut down a feature and kill your app, they can.Decentralized apps, on the other hand, don\u2019t store all your user data in a centralized database. Instead, they rely on decentralized technology like blockchains and other DLTs (Distributed Ledger Technologies), decentralized databases, and decentralized file storage systems. dApps can put you in control of your own identity, currency, and data. (They don\u2019t all do that yet, but I suspect the ones that do will win the Web 3.0 disruption).dApps frequently need to transact value across the network. To do so, they usually rely on a blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Waves, etc. They typically need to interface with a wallet in order to authorize transactions.My favorite current dApps have wallets built-in, and are either custodial (meaning they manage the hard stuff like the private keys for you, e.g., Sliver.tv), or integrate directly with wallets (e.g., Brave).dApp UXThe dApp user experience is getting better. There are now two popular browsers with integrated dApp support\u00a0, so there\u2019s no need for confusing browser extensions: Trust (recently acquired by Binance) and Coinbase Wallet (which was Toshi until Coinbase acquired it shortly after the Trust acquisition). Both have much better UX than alternatives like Metamask, and provide integrations with the Web3 API, which helps dApps integrate with the Ethereum blockchain.My favorite dApps use blockchains for consensus, but they connect to fast databases and load quickly, as well. My favorite dApps also don\u2019t require user approval for every little transaction that could possibly take place on the blockchain. The key to good dApp user experience is to be selective about what you hit the blockchain for. For example, it\u2019s possible to have a virtual account backed by a database that only needs to sync to the blockchain periodically, for settlement or security, or both.In the beginning of 2018, the Lightning Network launched as a 2nd layer protocol sitting on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. In December 2018, the Raiden Network launched an alpha on the Ethereum blockchain. Both networks provide peer to peer off-chain payments using payment channels connected by Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs). What this means for end users is that it\u2019s now possible to transact with your dApp almost instantaneously instead of waiting for blockchain confirmations which can take up to 10 minutes.Smart Contract PlatformsSolidity has ruled the smart contract programming language ecosystem since it became available. It\u2019s ubiquitous for smart contract programming on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). But Solidity has some serious issues, including arithmetic overflows and underflows, type errors, and the delegatecall vulnerability which froze $300 million. All of these vulnerabilities are examples of issues which exist at the programming language level. In other words, a better programming language could create more secure smart contracts.The challengers are coming.Waves RIDE: A Turing incomplete (no loops or recursion), Haskell-inspired functional programming language for the Waves blockchain features static types, lazy evaluation, pattern matching, and predicate expressions which determine whether or not a transaction is allowed to complete. A Turing complete version is also in the works. Waves\u2019 smart contracts support is currently live on mainnet. We should see the first Waves dApps appear in 2019.Plutus (Cardano) is another Haskell-inspired functional programming language, this time for the Cardano blockchain. Cardano is planning two big releases in 2019: Shelley, which provides full decentralization and staking, and Cardano-CL, the virtual machines that will support programmable smart contracts.Scilla (Zilliqa) is a formally verified smart contract language designed with separation of computation and effects in mind. This means that calculations and communication of state transitions are strictly isolated, which makes Scilla smart contracts easier to test and statically validate to minimize the chances that something will go wrong. Zilliqa\u2019s mainnet is scheduled to launch at the end of January, 2019.ewasm (Ethereum) is not a smart contract language per say, but a compiler target which will allow Ethereum programmers to program in other languages (like Rust, C++, maybe one day smart-contract specific languages like Simplicity), and compile to Ethereum flavored WebAssembly. ewasm is a safer subset of WebAssembly, which is the relatively new low-level compile target for the web platform. Conveniently, wasm (and thus ewasm) modules are usable from any JavaScript project. For most blockchain code, typically more than 75% of the code isn\u2019t in smart contracts at all\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s in JavaScript which must communicate with the smart contracts. ewasm and JavaScript share a common foundation of bindings and module support.JavaScript (Lisk) Lisk is a blockchain development platform that allows developers to code in JavaScript and create custom blockchains for specific applications, avoiding Ethereum\u2019s big scaling challenge. Lisk allows developers to create their own sidechains to manage all of a specific application\u2019s blockchain operations, so it doesn\u2019t have to compete with all the other applications for the compute resources of the main chain. Currently, Lisk is not working on a smart contract programming language or VM, and blockchain transaction capabilities are similar to Bitcoin\u2019s.Rust (via ewasm, Cardano client) is a lower level language (like C) with some of the safety features of languages like Haskell. Rust features guaranteed constant references to avoid accidental mutations, static prevention of null pointer exceptions (options must be explicitly declared), stateful types which only provide access to operations meaningful to the current state, pattern matching is analyzed to guarantee function completeness (an unmatched pattern will result in a compile-time error), etc. Basically, it\u2019s like C++ and Haskell had a baby that inherited none of the scary stuff. Rust can compile to ewasm, or be used to build client code for blockchains like Cardano. Modules for Lisk can be built in Rust and compiled to wasm to import in Lisk projects.You Might Not Need Smart ContractsYou might not need a smart contract programming language to produce a production dApp in 2019.Most dApp developers create nodes that ingest data from blockchains and pull it into a database that can be queried efficiently. That process is not a lot of fun, and adds a lot of maintenance burden to crypto apps. The Graph makes it easy to query blockchain data using GraphQL. Decentralized nodes aggregate blockchain data, supported by IPFS.You can send compute jobs to iExec, and even handle intense graphic rendering with the Render Token. With all these protocol tokens flying around, we might need to do some cross chain atomic swaps to exchange tokens across multiple blockchains.You can use verifiable claims, batched and anchored to your blockchain of choice (suggestion: Bitcoin) to record any kind of data, including ownership and transfer of assets like real estate, car titles, and NFTs. You can store those claims, supporting files, and various database records (see OrbitDB) on IPFS or Storj.The ListOK, that was a lot.

It\u2019s \u2018online money\u2019 or \u2018digital currency\u2019 that is seen as the preserve of only coders and tech geeks.More Than Just\u00a0CoinsThat definition is way too limiting, and although cryptocurrency does run on blockchain, that\u2019s only a fraction of the protocol\u2019s capabilities. As we\u2019ve demonstrated previously, blockchain technology also offers advances in security, in identity verification, and in the way publishers and consumers can exchange their data on consensual and transparent terms.Countries like Estonia are using blockchain as the fundamental tool for underwriting the functions of government at national and local levels. The technology allows for fair and regulated elections, and can even handle the tricky legal and financial processes of citizenship and taxation.In healthcare, the possibilities for portable but secure medical records is proving to be a game-changer in the way that many health organisations are run.Other Financial PossibilitiesEven the companies you\u2019d expect to be most concerned with currency have seen the wider potential in blockchain. MasterCard, as a global financial institution, is developing blockchain protocol to help verify and cut out fake identities. The financial implications are obvious, but it shows that already, the money makers are beginning to look at blockchain applications far beyond just cryptocurrency.Business On A Global\u00a0ScaleWhen it comes to moving things around the world, there are few companies who can compete with the scale and experience of Danish shipping firm Maersk. In an ideal world, they\u2019d be able to track every component of every shipment from origin point to destination, as well as any onward journeys each part or piece may take in its lifetime.Under the current ways of logging and tracking data, the load of information is too difficult to wrangle. Both the volume of data involved\u200a\u2014\u200ait would be expensive to store in one place\u200a\u2014\u200aand the fact that most shipping involves multiple privately-owned companies interacting at different points, pose problems. Multiple companies means multiple proprietorial systems and databases.Blockchain solves both of these issues. The resources of the distributed ledger mean that no single company or server has to carry the load. The open and transparent nature of the blockchain means it can be updated by private companies or government customs officials alike, and the information is accessible to all of them at any point in the shipped item\u2019s life.Content Creation TransformedA growing number of companies are starting to feel like their digital advertising spend is throwing good money after bad. Often the information they get about the patterns and actions of customers turns out to be unreliable data generated by bots. Customers are less incentivised by rewards they can only use in one place, and they get frustrated when their preferences in one location can\u2019t be carried over to another.MEDIA Protocol is changing that. Using smart URLs and smart contracts, the protocol allows content publishers and customers to interact in a completely new way. By agreeing to share their behaviours and other information with content creators, customers are giving a valuable and verifiable set of data for the creators to build on. It also allows for personalisation of content going forward, but most importantly, rewards in the form of MEDIA tokens, which can be used all across the network (to get access to paywalled content elsewhere, for example).Cut out the middleman. Be confident the data you\u2019re giving and receiving is actually worth something. Gain rewards for everyday online activity that you\u2019d be doing anyway. Doesn\u2019t that sound much better than the current model of blind ad spends for (partial, selective and often inaccurate) secondhand data?In SummaryCryptocurrency is part of what blockchain is capable of, but barely the tip of the iceberg. Even in the examples listed above, those industries are just beginning to explore what they can do with blockchain, and the use cases will only continue to grow as it\u2019s more widely understood and adopted.Decentralised, transparent, secure. The possibilities for blockchain may well be endless.For more information regarding MEDIA Protocol find us on our social channels below:Website: www.mediaprotocol.orgFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MEDIAProtocolTwitter: https://twitter.com/MEDIA_ProtocolLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/media-protocol/Telegram: https://t.me/Media_Protocol_Community and https://t.me/MP_AnnouncementsMedium: https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsmYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MEDIAProtocol", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Understanding Blockchain Fundamentals, Part 2: Proof of Work & Proof of\u00a0Stake", "author_name": "Georgios Konstantopoulos", "link": "https://medium.com/loom-network/understanding-blockchain-fundamentals-part-2-proof-of-work-proof-of-stake-b6ae907c7edb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 8, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "3K", "content": "Understanding Blockchain Fundamentals, Part 2: Proof of Work & Proof of\u00a0StakeGeorgios KonstantopoulosBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 8, 2017Articles in this Understanding Blockchain Fundamentals series:Part 1: Byzantine Fault TolerancePart 2: Proof of Work & Proof of Stake \ud83d\udc48Part 3: Delegated Proof of Stake", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "Blockchain Adoption in the Energy Sector\u200a\u2014\u200aon a Massive\u00a0Scale", "author_name": "Bluenote", "link": "https://medium.com/@social_72385/blockchain-adoption-in-the-energy-sector-on-a-massive-scale-a71c490be377?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 12, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "5.3K", "content": "Blockchain Adoption in the Energy Sector\u200a\u2014\u200aon a Massive\u00a0ScaleBluenoteBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 12, 2018Even governments are waking up to the fact that the quality and security of energy data can improve dramatically through blockchain.More and more industries are discovering the advantages of the secure, immutable and trustless properties of the distributed ledger that is blockchain.

However, for most of the people, Bitcoin is still a novel concept, which has few connections with daily life. William Jin, technical representative from GRE (Global Risk Exchange), senses this rare opportunity and vision in blockchain and devotes his energy into GRE project.From zero to one, GRE is a fun and challenging process.The previous working experience as developer in the Internet companies contributes to William\u2019s work on GRE. He indicates that he has been attracted by Blockchain technology almost a year ago. The base of Blockchain is a distributed database with service logic built on the upper side. For inexperienced people, this might take several months to complete, but for experienced professionals, they handle it real quick. It is not that difficult as everyone has imaged and this perhaps is the reason why GRE project could be developed within such a short period, updated to Beta version and realized partly OBT by the beginning of April.\u201cIt only takes us 20 days to develop this APP and realize OTA, which is quite an amazing achievement compared with other teams in this industry\u201d, says William. \u201cBesides APP, development of test net takes about a month. OBT is now on for the purpose of improving users\u2019 experience, endeavoring to solve most of the problems in the test net. GRE will quickly move to the next stage and realize decentralization then. \u201dGRE is a decentralized risk contract exchange, which builds on graphene and Bitshares as its developing underlayer. William and the technical team not only continuously optimized the GRE platform during development, but also fixed several bugs in Bitshares. One of the severe debugging relates to market prediction settlement that whether users mortgage on their core assets. That is to say, users choose to mortgage on other assets but system directly recognizes this operation as core-asset mortgage, which will possibly produce the negative value. This is not allowed. William does not turn a blind eye towards this situation, but actively come up with debugging codes that adopted by Bitshares.\u201cIdeas and open attitudes are extremely important. Only by joint efforts can we achieve something \u201csays William. When being asked for his opinion on technical staffs in blockchain field, he answered that the concept of a particular \u201cblockchain technical talent\u201d should not exist. \u201cCTO in one company shoulders certain responsibilities and also should be responsible for his employees. But blockchain project is like a community in which everyone participates for their interests and passion instead of doing a job. Here, my job has different meanings compared with a particular position in a company. In certain scene, this is a revolution in human history as well as a re-definition of social organizations. \u201cAccording to William, this attracts him the most and this is the difference between GRE project and his previous CTO positions.From product to community, GRE represents a new ecosystem.Currently, there are two smart contract products on GRE platform: the ICO Price Insurance and the Price Fluctuation Insurance. These are smart contract products provided for market participators after GRE team analyzing and evaluating the secondary market of crytocurrency and investors\u2019 demands. At present, the insured orders and insurer orders on the platform are numerous while the traded contracts are tens of millions.Scale of GRE team is quite small considering its achievements. William acknowledges that by the end of this year, the team is expected to have 20 people whose responsibilities lie in GRE DAPP as well as developing and maintaining the industry chain. GRE is a blockchain project instead of a traditional project from the Internet Company. All GRE community users share the responsibility of technical development and maintenance. Those who are capable could make contributions in GRE ecosystem and gain corresponding rewards (in form of Risk Token). This should be the rightful path of blockchain projects \u201cdecentralization\u201d, other than operating from the traditional perspective.GRE\u2019s goal is to create a \u201cblockchain-wise\u201d community. GRE project development and operation not only focus on GRE DAPP, a cryptocurrency-related international exchange for risk management contract products, but also emphasize on building the industry chain ecosystem. Operating and localizing as well as UI design would be outsourced to cooperators. GRE only provides underlying technology, the main net, DAPP development, wallet, Risk Token and transaction system support. For example, GRE is planning to develop an agricultural insurance that based on weather indexes collaborating with AXA. AXA would provide underwriting and operational capability while GRE would provide a technology platform and token economy. GRE wallet would gather users around the globe and being served like a browser in which users could collect their favorite risk management contract product.For those external participators, William suggests that they are going to give \u201cRisk Token\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe token system on GRE platform\u200a\u2014\u200ato everyone who makes contribution in the community, including but not limitated to developers, designers and those who recommend GRE community to the general public.In the blockchain world, the major differences in building a user community compared with the Internet model are the autonomous mechanism, product decentralization and a high degree of liberty in product design. Extravagant organization and monopoly in the traditional business model no longer exist in blockchain. William adds, \u201cWe do not consider ourselves as enterprises in GRE project. Instead, we are open-minded and want to build a Global Risk Exchange with everyone together. \u201dBlockchain is taking off and everyone can be the\u00a0hero.When being asked if there were any long-term vision since the kickoff of this project in 2018, William laughed and joked, \u201cBlockchain changes the world.\u201d But after then, we realized his strong determination embedded in the talk.\u201cActually, when we were trying to remould the insurance industry with the help of Internet, we had encountered many obstacles on liberty, supervision and so on. We need a brand new tool, which could help us to avoid existing problems and to expand innovative space.\u201d William, an entrepreneur with several CTO working experience has profound reflection on such issue. \u201cIf the development of AI mainly contributes to improve working efficiency, blockchain is a technology that impacts relations of production. Everyone is involved in this system, but not as employers or employees\u200a\u2014\u200aemployers hire employees while employees work for employers. Blockchain breaks this system, changes the confrontation between these two parties and creates a win-win situation. \u201dBlockchain is at the starting-up period at the moment. Compared with centralized module that we have already got accustomed to, how to improve users\u2019 experience, how to draw on strengths, how to make new concepts such as private key, mnemonic, save and SSL adopted by users, all these questions pose challenges for everyone in the blockchain industry.Afterword:GRE technical representative leaves people a sharp and reticent impression. But when it went to vision of blockchain ecosystem, he always mentioned openness, win-win and community. Changing the world seems out of reach, however, for those who have the strong determination and put this notion into actual practices, nothing is more thrilling than gradually realizing every trivial part of the\u00a0dream.Of course, he is still holding a cold face after\u00a0all.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "The future will be tokenized: how blockchain will free you to control your financial destiny", "author_name": "Justin Lee", "link": "https://medium.com/swlh/the-future-will-be-tokenized-how-blockchain-will-free-you-to-control-your-financial-destiny-2c0f31cec0ba?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 17, 2018", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "3.1K", "content": "The future will be tokenized: how blockchain will free you to control your financial destinyJustin LeeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 17, 2018I believe in freedom.I believe we should be able to make our own choices and shape our lives however we wish.I long for a world without borders, racism, sexism, and barriers of any kind.These are big dreams, but they can gain momentum with small cultural shifts.I believe blockchain is one of those shifts.I\u2019m passionate about emerging technologies like AI, machine learning and bots not just in a nerdy, code-centric way, but because of what they represent.Blockchain, specifically, promotes decentralization.

Revolutions occurred and democratic governments began to rise.The shift from a single cult of personality to a group of elected decision-makers marked our desire for more inclusive societies, where different groups of people can thrive.The invention of blockchain takes that push for inclusion to another level by decentralizing decision-making\u200a\u2014\u200aallowing token holders to have a say in how they want society to be structured.Whether you\u2019re deep in the waters of cryptocurrency or you\u2019re still confused about what these new technologies could mean for your life, I want to cover a small slice of the blockchain revolution.Tokenization is a great way to understand the philosophy behind cryptocurrency; how it works, but also what it stands for.This is the future that many blockchain pioneers and enthusiasts envision. Get ready for the Tokenization of Everything (TOE)\u200a\u2014\u200aand a lot more freedom.A quick primer on tokenizationIn today\u2019s financial world, everything you own is tied to your name. Maybe you have a house, a car, stocks, or cash in the bank.In the process of tokenization, all those assets can be broken into pieces. That means you can create a stock or a single proof of ownership tied to any asset.For example, let\u2019s start with a long-range vision for tokenization. This is the future that I might not even see in my lifetime.Image credit: distributedlab.comImagine all my personal assets add up to a million dollars. Kind of a stretch, but it makes for easy math. Those combined assets could be broken into \u201cJustin\u201d coins that represent everything I own. If I created 100 coins or tokens, each would be worth $10,000.The blockchain technology would allow anyone to trade their token(s) for a Justin coin. That means no banks, no financial managers, no complicated paperwork or red tape. It would be two people making a direct transaction.The tokenization of everything imagines a world where anything can be traded. Your liquidity isn\u2019t restricted by cash or concrete assets. Instead, it can include anything you own, and maybe even your time.TOE removes all aspects of the middleman institution. It enables online transactions through a trusted, de-centralized system. It breaks down power and access barriers.We still have to contend with inequality in terms of assets and wealth, but no one can control how or what you trade.The blockchain technology that powers these transactions also makes investing faster, cheaper and more secure. It liquefies assets and makes investing possible for people who have been restricted by means or geography.Third-generation blockchain technologies like Cardano are trying to solve the big problem of operability, which means that everything is programmable, with an automated market-maker as the intermediary.For example, imagine paying for your Starbucks order with airline miles, while the barista is paid in US dollars. That\u2019s interoperability in action.We\u2019ve already watched the internet tear down gatekeeper layers in entertainment, publishing, communication, sales, and many other industries.As we dismantle hierarchical financial systems, transaction costs go down, volumes go up, and people are more willing to trade with each other. It creates a more connected, global system.This long-term vision also (perhaps ironically) takes us back to barter trading, which is where the concept of money first originated.A collection of diverse, personal\u00a0tokensIn the near future, blockchain could give us the ability to create multiple coins for several different assets.Imagine you own a home worth $1 million (stay with me\u2026 this is all about that simple math).You could again break the ownership of that home into 100 tokens worth $10,000 each. This scenario is much like creating a real estate index or trust fund to manage multiple properties. But now, you could sell partial ownership of your home with individual tokens that you create, trade and control. There\u2019s no intermediary.So, why would I want to sell partial ownership?Great question. I would tokenize my home for two main reasons:I want to make my assets more liquid. Maybe I\u2019m traveling, starting a business, going back to school, or investing in something I think has great value. A home token would allow me to leverage some of the value in my house without selling it outright.I believe my home won\u2019t appreciate as fast as what you\u2019re giving me in return. Maybe I\u2019m trading my home token for your business token\u200a\u2014\u200aand I think your business will gain value at a much faster rate than my home.On the other side of the trade, you might want a share in my home if you believe it has better appreciation potential than your company. Our different perspectives on the asset valuation would allow us to reach a trade consensus.If we can do all these different trades, it doesn\u2019t matter where we live. Artificial geographic borders could break down when we don\u2019t rely on a single entity or regime to prove our value.For example, the global currency system determines how much our assets are worth, depending on the stability (or volatility) of our native currency and how our home country\u2019s institutions reach consensus with other markets.When assets are tokenized, that value is stored in a single profile with fully decentralized transaction paths.Technology can streamline this brave new financial worldIf these scenarios feel complicated and time-consuming, I hear you. The idea of valuing your assets, making the trades, and ensuring you\u2019re not getting duped in the process can sound more than a little overwhelming.Again, I\u2019m bullish about emerging tech because it has the power to help. I see a future where humans, aided by artificial intelligence, can make more efficient and effective financial decisions.We might trust the people who currently control and manage our money\u200a\u2014\u200aand in many cases this trust is well founded\u200a\u2014\u200abut even \u201cexperts\u201d don\u2019t have all the answers.Investment requires educated decisions. No one has a crystal ball (unless they\u2019re conducting insider trading).Technology won\u2019t provide foolproof investing, but it does remove industry greed from the equation.Running your own trades eliminates high bank and investment fees. It ensures that you\u2019re buying a stock because you think it\u2019s smart, not because it pays kickbacks to the broker.You won\u2019t question the intentions of a financial institution, because they don\u2019t have a hand in your assets.Let the bots do the\u00a0busyworkChatbots are arguably today\u2019s most relatable AI application. Most people have used Facebook Messenger or interacted with a chatbot while shopping online or asking their telecom provider about those weird mobile charges.Currently, chatbots are built to solve a specific set of problems. We\u2019ve built GrowthBot, for example, to deliver marketing and sales information without leaving your task or productivity platform (such as Slack).You can ask questions about top posts, organic site traffic, or get company overviews. And instead of switching to a web browser and getting lost in a Google spiral, you can stay focused while GrowthBot digs up the details.Now, apply this kind of \u201cassistant\u201d technology to your financial life. The bot could do everything from researching investments to calculating an asset value, in real time.Remember, the bot is not taking over. This isn\u2019t a dystopian sci-fi plot. Instead, it\u2019s providing the information you need to make a smart and highly personalized decision.Then, the chatbot could actually conduct the transaction as you instruct. That means no more calls to your bro-ish financial advisor or trying to recover a lost login password.We still have a long way to\u00a0goI do realize that the utopian future of my dreams is a long way off\u200a\u2014\u200aif it\u2019s ever going to be possible.We will still face complex, ongoing issues about who holds wealth in our society and how to level the field. I\u2019m not na\u00efve about these challenges, nor do I believe that technology is a magic solution.Even cryptocurrencies are promising, but they\u2019re still rife with problems. These are totally unregulated assets, for better and worse.At this moment, the \u201cworse\u201d is an approximately 90% rate of fraud among Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), according to the People\u2019s Bank of China.Yet, I\u2019m still motivated by the possibilities. Tokenization is just a tiny example of what a more decentralized, egalitarian, and direct financial system could enable.Technologies are ultimately just tools that we can harness to lead cultural change\u200a\u2014\u200aand whether we\u2019re talking AI, bots or blockchain, the code is inconsequential. What really matters is our intention.It\u2019s time to decide how we\u2019ll organize our society, for hundreds of years to come.", "responses": "17"}, {"title": "Blockchains for Artificial Intelligence", "author_name": "Trent McConaghy", "link": "https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/blockchains-for-artificial-intelligence-ec63b0284984?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 3, 2017", "readtime": "23 min read", "upvotes": "1.5K", "content": "Blockchains for Artificial IntelligenceFrom Decentralized Model Exchanges to Model Audit\u00a0TrailsTrent McConaghyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 3, 2017Image: Max Pixel,\u00a0CC-0[This is based on a talk I first gave on Nov 7, 2016.

In May 2017 I gave an updated talk; here\u2019s the slides & video.]In recent years, AI (artificial intelligence) researchers have finally cracked problems that they\u2019ve worked on for decades, from Go to human-level speech recognition. A key piece was the ability to gather and learn on mountains of data, which pulled error rates past the success line.In short, big data has transformed AI, to an almost unreasonable level.Blockchain technology could transform AI too, in its own particular ways. Some applications of blockchains to AI are mundane, like audit trails on AI models. Some appear almost unreasonable, like AI that can own itself\u200a\u2014\u200aAI DAOs. All of them are opportunities. This article will explore these applications.Blockchains as Blue Ocean DatabasesBefore we discuss applications, let\u2019s first review what\u2019s different about blockchains compared to traditional big-data distributed databases like MongoDB.We can think of blockchains as \u201cblue ocean\u201d databases: they escape the \u201cbloody red ocean\u201d of sharks competing in an existing market, opting instead to be in a blue ocean of uncontested market space. Famous blue ocean examples are Wii for video game consoles (compromise raw performance, but have new mode of interaction), or Yellow Tail for wines (ignore the pretentious specs for wine lovers; make wine more accessible to beer lovers).By traditional database standards, traditional blockchains like Bitcoin are terrible: low throughput, low capacity, high latency, poor query support, and so on. But in blue-ocean thinking, that\u2019s ok, because blockchains introduced three new characteristics: decentralized / shared control, immutable / audit trails, and native assets / exchanges. People inspired by Bitcoin were happy to overlook the traditional database-centric shortcomings, because these new benefits had potential to impact industries and society at large in wholly new ways.These three new \u201cblockchain\u201d database characteristics are also potentially interesting for AI applications. But most real-world AI works on large volumes of data, such as training on large datasets or high-throughput stream processing. So for applications of blockchain to AI, you need blockchain technology with big-data scalability and querying. Emerging technologies like BigchainDB, and its public network IPDB do exactly that. You no longer need to compromise on the the benefits of traditional big-data databases in order to have the benefits of blockchains.Overview of Blockchains for\u00a0AIHaving blockchain tech that scales unlocks its potential for AI applications. Let\u2019s now explore what those might be, by starting with the three blockchain benefits.These blockchain benefits lead to the following opportunities for AI practitioners:Decentralized / shared control encourages data sharing:(1) Leads to more data, and therefore better models.(2) Leads to qualitatively new data, and therefore qualitatively new models.(3) Allows for shared control of AI training data & models.Immutability / audit trail:(4) Leads to provenance on training/testing data & models, to improve the trustworthiness of the data & models. Data wants reputation too.Native assets / exchanges:(5) Leads to training/testing data & models as intellectual property (IP) assets, which leads to decentralized data & model exchanges. It also gives better control for upstream usage of your data.There\u2019s one more opportunity: (6) AI with blockchains unlock the possibility for AI DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). These are AIs that can accumulate wealth, that you can\u2019t shut off. They\u2019re Software-as-a-Service on steroids.There are almost surely more ways that blockchains can help AI. Also, there are many ways that AI can help blockchains, such as mining blockchain data (e.g. Silk Road investigation). That\u2019s for another discussion:)Many of these opportunities are about AI\u2019s special relationship with data. So let\u2019s first explore that. Following this, we\u2019ll explore the applications of blockchains for AI in more detail.AI &\u00a0DataHere, I will describe how much of modern AI leverages copious quantities of data for its impressive results. (This isn\u2019t always the case, but it is a common theme worth describing.)\u201cAncient\u201d History of AI &\u00a0DataWhen I started doing AI research in the 90s, a typical approach was:Here\u2019s your fixed dataset (typically small).Design an algorithm to improve performance, for example design a new kernel for a support vector machine classifier that reduces area-under-curve (AUC).Publish that algorithm in a conference or journal. Ten percent relative improvement is about the \u201cminimum publishable unit\u201d, as long as your algorithm itself was fancy enough. If you got a 2x-10x, you\u2019re looking at best-paper territory, especially if the algorithm was really fancy.If this sounds academic, that\u2019s because it was. Most AI work was still in academia, though there were real-world applications too. In my experience, it was like this in many sub-fields of AI, including neural networks, fuzzy systems (remember those?), evolutionary computation, and even slightly less AI-ish techniques like nonlinear programming or convex optimization.In my first published paper (1997), I proudly showed how my freshly-invented algorithm had the best results compared to state-of-the-art neural networks, genetic programming, and more\u200a\u2014\u200aon a small fixed dataset. Oops.Towards Modern AI &\u00a0DataBut, the world shifted. In 2001, Microsoft researchers Banko and Brill released a paper with remarkable results. First, they described how most work in their domain of natural language processing was on less than a million words\u200a\u2014\u200asmall datasets. Error rates were 25% for the old / boring / least fancy algorithms like Naive Bayes and Perceptrons, whereas fancy newer memory-based algorithms achieved 19% error. That\u2019s the four datapoints on the far left of the plot below.From Banko and Brill,\u00a02001So far, no surprises. But then Banko and Brill showed something remarkable: as you added more data\u200a\u2014\u200anot just a bit more data but orders of magnitude more data\u200a\u2014\u200aand kept the algorithms the same, then the error rates kept going down, by a lot. By the time the datasets were three orders of magnitude larger, error was less than 5%. In many domains, there\u2019s a world of difference between 18% and 5%, because only the latter is good enough for real-world application.Moreover, the best-performing algorithms were the simplest; and the worst algorithm was the fanciest. Boring old perceptrons from the 1950s were beating state-of-the-art techniques.Modern AI &\u00a0DataBanko and Brill weren\u2019t alone. For example, in 2007, Google researchers Halevy, Norvig and Pereira of Google published a paper showing how data could be \u201cunreasonably effective\u201d across many AI domains.Screenshot of Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira,\u00a02007This hit the AI field like an atom bomb.\u201cIt\u2019s the data, silly.\u201dThe race was on to gather way more data. It takes significant effort to get mountains of good data. If you have the resources, you can get data. Sometimes you can even lock up data. In this new world, data is a moat, and AI algorithms a commodity. For these reasons, \u201cmore data\u201d is a key imperative for Google, Facebook, and many others.Image: Simon Ledingham\u00a0, CC-BY-SA\u00a02.0\u201cMo\u2019 data, mo\u2019 money.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aEveryoneOnce you understand these dynamics, specific actions have simple explanations. Google doesn\u2019t buy satellite imaging companies simply because it likes space; and Google gives away TensorFlow.Deep learning directly fits in this context: it\u2019s the result of figuring out how, if given a massive enough dataset, to start to capture interactions and latent variables. Interestingly, backprop neural networks from the \u201980s are sometimes competitive with the latest techniques, if given the same massive datasets. See here. It\u2019s the data, silly.My own coming-of-age as an AI researcher was similar. As I was attacking real-world problems, I learned how to swallow my pride, abandon the \u201ccool\u201d algorithms, build only as much was needed to solve the problem at hand, and learned to love the data and the scale. It happened in my first company, ADA (1998\u20132004), as we pivoted from automated creative design to \u201cboring\u201d parameter optimization; which incidentally became less boring in a hurry as our users asked us to go from 10 variables to 1000. It happened in my second company, Solido (2004-present), as well, as we pivoted from fancier modeling approaches to super-simple but radically scalable ML algorithms like FFX; and once again was un-boring as our users pulled us from 100 variables to 100,000, and from 100 million Monte Carlo samples to 10 trillion (effective samples). Even BigchainDB, the product of my third and current company, emerged from the need for scale (2013-present). Zoom in on features, zoom up on scale.Opportunity 1: Data Sharing \u2192 Better\u00a0ModelsIn short: decentralized / shared control encourages data sharing, which in turns lead to better models, which in turns leads to higher profit / lower cost / etc. Let\u2019s elaborate.Left image (silos): Doc Searls, CC-BY-2.0. Right image (silo): Gnangarra, CC-BY\u00a03.0AI loves data. The more data, the better the models. Yet data is often siloed, especially in this new world where data can be a moat.But blockchains encourage data sharing among traditional silos, if there is enough up-front benefit. The decentralized nature of blockchains encourages data sharing: it\u2019s less friction to share if no single entity controls the infrastructure where the data is being stored. I give more benefits later on.This data sharing might happen within an enterprise (e.g. among regional offices), within an ecosystem (e.g. for a \u201cconsortium\u201d database), or across the planet (e.g. for a shared planetary database, a.k.a. public blockchain). Here\u2019s an example for each:Within-enterprise: data from different regional offices is merged using a blockchain technology, because it lowers the cost for the enterprise to audit their own data, and to share that data with auditors. With that new data in place, the enterprise can build AI models that, for example, predict customer churn better than their previous models which were only built at the level of regional office. A \u201cdata mart\u201d for each regional office?Within-ecosystem: competitors (say, banks or music labels) traditionally would never share their data. But it would be straightforward to show how, with combined data from several banks, one could make better models for, credit card fraud prevention. Or for organizations along a supply chain, that share data via a blockchain, one could better identify root causes of failures later in the supply chain, using AI on data from earlier in the supply chain. For example, where exactly did that strain of E. coli emerge?Within-planet (public blockchain database): Consider the sharing of data among different ecosystems (e.g. energy usage data + auto parts supply chain data); or of individual participants in a planet-scale ecosystem (e.g. the Web). More data from more sources could improve the models. For example, spikes in energy usage in some factories in China might be correlated with fraudulent auto parts emerging on the market a day\u2019s worth of shipping later. Overall, we\u2019re seeing signs of this with companies that aggregate data, sanitize it, and repackage and sell it; from good old Bloomberg terminals to the dozens (or hundreds) of startups selling data through http APIs. I explore this further in a later point.Enemies sharing their data to feed an AI. 2016 is fun!Opportunity 2: Data Sharing \u2192 Qualitatively New\u00a0ModelsIn some cases, when data from silos is merged, you don\u2019t just get a better dataset, you get a qualitatively new dataset. Which leads to a qualitatively new model, from which you can glean new insights and have new business applications. That is, you can that do something you couldn\u2019t do before.Here\u2019s an example, for identifying diamond fraud. If you\u2019re a bank providing diamond insurance, you\u2019d like to create a classifier that identifies whether a diamond is fraudulent. There are four trusted diamond certification labs on the planet (depending who you ask, of course:). If you only have access to the diamond data for one of these labs, then you\u2019re blind about the other three houses, and your classifier could easily flag one of those other houses\u2019 diamonds as fraud (see picture below, left). Your false positive rate would make your system unusable.Consider instead if blockchains catalyze all four certification labs to share their data. You\u2019d have all the legitimate data, from which you would build a classifier (below, right). Any incoming diamond, for example seen on eBay, would be run through the system and be compared to this all-data one-class classifier. The classifier can detect legitimate fraud and avoid false positives, therefore lowering the fraud rate, to benefit of insurance providers and certification labs. This could be simply framed as a lookup, i.e. not needing AI. But using AI improves it further, for example by predicting price based on color, carats, etc. then using \u201chow close is price to expected value\u201d as an input to the main fraud classifier.Top left image (silos): Doc Searls, CC-BY-2.0. Top right image (silo): Gnangarra, CC-BY\u00a03.0Here\u2019s a second example. An appropriate token-incentive scheme in a decentralized system could incentivize datasets to get labeled that could not be previously labeled, or labeled in a cost-effective fashion. This would be basically a decentralized Mechanical Turk. With new labels we get new datasets; we train on the new datasets to get new models.Here\u2019s a third example. A token-incentive scheme could lead to direct data input from IoT devices. The devices control the data and can exchange it for assets, such as energy. Once again, this new data can lead to new models (Thanks to Dimi de Jonghe for these last two examples.)Hoard vs. share? There\u2019s a tension between two opposite motivations here. One is to hoard data\u200a\u2014\u200athe \u201cdata is the new moat\u201d perspective; the other is to share data, for better/new models. To share, there must be a sufficient driver that outweighs the \u201cmoat\u201d benefit. The technology driver is better models or new models, but this driver must lead to business benefit. Possible benefits include reduced fraud for insurance savings in diamonds or supply chains; making money on the side in Mechanical Turk; data/model exchanges; or collective action against a powerful central player, like the music labels working together against Apple iTunes. There are more; it requires creative business design.Centralized vs. decentralized? Even if some organizations decide to share, they could share without needing blockchain technology. For example, they could simply pool it into an S3 instance and expose the API among themselves. But in some cases, decentralized gives new benefits. First is the literal sharing of infrastructure, so that one organization in the sharing consortium doesn\u2019t control all the \u201cshared data\u201d by themselves. (This was a key stumbling block a few years back when the music labels tried to work together for a common registry.) Another benefit is that it\u2019s easier to turn the data & models into assets, which can then be licensed externally for profit. I elaborate on this below. (Thanks to Adam Drake for drawing extra attention to the hoard-vs-share tension.)As discussed, data & model sharing can happen at three levels: within an enterprise (which for multinationals is harder than you might think); within an ecosystem or consortium; or within the planet (which amounts to becoming a public utility). Let\u2019s explore planet-scale sharing more deeply.Opportunity 2a: New planet-level data \u2192 new planet-level insightsPlanetary-level data sharing is potentially the most interesting level. Let\u2019s drill further into this one.IPDB is structured data on a global scale, rather than piecemeal. Think of the World Wide Web as a file system on top of the internet; IPDB is its database counterpart. (I think the reason we didn\u2019t see more work on this sooner is that semantic web work tried to go there, from the angle of upgrading a file system. But it\u2019s pretty hard to build a database by \u201cupgrading\u201d a file system! It\u2019s more effective to say from the start that you\u2019re building a database, and designing as such.) \u201cGlobal variable\u201d gets interpreted a bit more literally:)So, what does it look like when we have data sharing with a planet-scale shared database service like IPDB? We have a couple points of reference.The first point of reference is that there\u2019s already a billion-dollar market (recently), for companies to curate and repackage public data, to make it more consumable. From simple APIs for the weather or network time, to financial data like stocks and currencies. Imagine if all this data was accessible through a single database in a similar structured fashion (even if it\u2019s just a pass through of the API). Bloomberg x 1000. Without worrying that there was a single choke point controlled by a single entity.The second point of reference comes from the blockchain, in the concept of \u201coraclizing\u201d outside data to make it consumable by a blockchain. But we can oraclize it all. Decentralized Bloomberg is just the start.Overall, we get a whole new scale for diversity of datasets and data feeds. Therefore, we have qualitatively new data. Planetary level structured data. From that, we can build qualitatively new models, that make relations which among inputs & outputs which weren\u2019t connected before. With the models and from the models, we will get qualitatively new insights.I wish I could be more specific here, but at this point it\u2019s so new that I can\u2019t think of any examples. But, they will emerge!There\u2019s also a bot angle. We\u2019ve been assuming that the main consumers of blockchain APIs will be humans. But what if it\u2019s machines? David Holtzman, creator of the modern DNS, said recently \u201cIPDB is kibbles for AI\u201d. Unpacking this, it\u2019s because IPDB enables and encourages planet-level data sharing, and AI really loves to eat data.Image: Isabelle Blanchemain, CC-BY\u00a02.0Opportunity 3: Audit trails on data & models for more trustworthy predictionsThis application addresses the fact that if you train on garbage data, then you\u2019ll get a garbage model. Same thing for testing data. Garbage in, garbage out.Image: Harke. Public\u00a0DomainGarbage could come from malicious actors / Byzantine faults who may be tampering with the data. Think Volkswagen emissions scandal. Garbage may also come from non-malicious actors / crash faults, for example from defective IoT sensor, a data feed going down, or environmental radiation causing a bit flip (sans good error correction).How do you know that the X/y training data doesn\u2019t have flaws? What about live usage, running the model against live input data? What about the model predictions (yhat)? In short: what\u2019s the story of the data, to and from the model? Data wants reputation too.Image (etching): Irakli Chumburidze, CC-BY-SA\u00a02.0Blockchain technology can help. Here\u2019s how. At each step of the process to build models, and to run models in the field, the creator of that data can simply time-stamp that model to the blockchain database, which includes digitally signing it as a claim of \u201cI believe this data / model to be good at this point\u201d. Let\u2019s flesh this out even more\u2026Provenance in building models:Provenance on sensor data (including IoT). Do you trust what your IoT sensor is telling you?Provenance on training input/output (X/y) data.Provenance on model building itself, if you like, via trusted execution infrastructure, or TrueBit-style markets that double-check computation. At the very least, have evidence of model-building with the model-building convergence curve (e.g. nmse vs. epoch).Provenance on the models themselves.Provenance in testing / in the field:Provenance on testing input (X) data.Provenance on model simulation. Trusted execution, TrueBit etc.Provenance on testing output (yhat) data.We get provenance in both building the models, and applying them. The result is more trusted AI training data & models.And we can have chains of this. Models of models, just like in semiconductor circuit design. Models all the way down. Now, it all has provenance.Benefits include:Catch leaks in data supply chain (in the broadest sense), at all the levels. For example, you can tell if a sensor is lying.You know the story of the data and model, in a cryptographically verifiable fashion.You can catch leaks in the data supply chain. That way, if an error happens, we\u2019ll have a much better idea of how and where. You can think of it as banking-style reconciliation, but for AI models.Data gets a reputation, because multiple eyes can check the same source, and even assert their own claims on how valid they believe the data to be. And, like data, models get reputations too.Opportunity 4: Shared global registry of training data &\u00a0modelsA specific challenge in the AI community is: where are the datasets? Traditionally, they have been scattered throughout the web, though there are some lists here and there pointing to main datasets. And of course many of the datasets are proprietary, precisely because they have value. The data moat, remember?But, what if we had a global database that made it easy to manage another dataset or data feed (free or otherwise)? This could include the broad set of Kaggle datasets from its various ML competitions, the Stanford ImageNet dataset, and countless others.That\u2019s exactly what IPDB could do. People could submit datasets, and use others\u2019 data. The data itself would be in a decentralized file system like IPFS; and the meta-data (and pointer to the data itself) would be in IPDB. We\u2019d get a global commons for AI datasets. This helps to realize the dream of the open data community.We don\u2019t need to stop at the datasets; we can include the models built from those datasets too. It should be easy to grab and run others\u2019 models, and submit your own. A global database can greatly facilitate this. We can get models that are owned by the planet.Opportunity 5: Data & models as IP assets \u2192data & model\u00a0exchangeLet\u2019s build on the application of \u201cshared global registry\u201d of training data and models. Data & models can be part of the public commons. But they can also be bought & sold!Data and AI models can be used as an intellectual property (IP) asset, because they are covered by copyright law. Which means:If you have created the data or model, you can claim copyright. This is whether or not you want to do anything commercially with it.If you have copyright of data or model, then you can license usage rights to others. For example, you can license your data to someone else to build their own model. Or, you could license your model for someone to include in their mobile application. Sub-licensing, sub-sub-licensing, etc is possible too. Of course, you can license data or models from others too.I think it\u2019s pretty awesome that you can claim copyright of an AI model, and license it. Data is already recognized as a potentially huge market; models will follow suit.Claiming copyright of and licensing data & models was possible before blockchain technology. The laws have served this for a while. But blockchain technology makes it better, because:For your claim of copyright, it offers a tamper-resistant global public registry; where your claim is digitally / cryptographically signed by you. This registry can include data & models too.For your licensing transaction, it once again offers a tamper-resistant global public registry. This time, it\u2019s not just digitally signed; rather, you cannot even transfer the rights unless you have the private key. The rights transfer occurs as a blockchain-style transfer of assets.IP on the blockchain is near and dear to my heart, with my work on ascribe going back to 2013 to help digital artists get compensated. The initial approach had issues with scale and flexibility of licensing. Now, these have been overcome, as I recently wrote about. The technology that makes this possible includes:Coala IP is a flexible, blockchain-friendly protocol for IP.IPDB (with BigchainDB) is a shared public blockchain database to store rights information & other metadata at Web scale.IPFS plus physical storage like Storj or FileCoin is a decentralized file system to store the large data & model blobs.With this, we get data and models as IP assets.To illustrate, using ascribe, I claimed copyright of an AI model that I\u2019d made years ago. The AI model is a CART (decision tree) for deciding which analog circuit topology to use. Here is its cryptographic Certificate of Authenticity (COA). If you\u2019d like to license an edition from me, just email me:)Once we have data and models as assets, we can start to make exchanges for those assets.An exchange could be centralized, like DatastreamX already does for data. But so far, they are really only able to use publicly-available data sources, since many businesses see more risk than reward from sharing.What about a decentralized data & model exchange? By decentralizing data sharing in an \u201cexchange\u201d context, new benefits arise. In being decentralized, no single entity controls the data storage infrastructure or the ledger of who-owns-what, which makes it easier for organizations to work together or share data, as described earlier in this essay. Think OpenBazaar, for Deep Nets.With such a decentralized exchange, we\u2019ll see the emergence of a truly open data market. This realizes a long-standing dream among data and AI folks, including yours truly:)And of course we\u2019ll have AI-based algorithmic trading on those exchanges: AI algorithms to buy AI models. The AI trading algorithms could even be buying algorithmic trading AI models, then updating themselves!Opportunity 5a: Control the Upstream of Your Data &\u00a0ModelsThis riffs on the previous application.When you sign on to use Facebook, you\u2019re granting Facebook very specific rights about what they can and can\u2019t do with any data that you enter into their system. It\u2019s licenses on your personal data.When a musician signs with a label, they\u2019re granting the label very specific rights, to edit the music, to distribute it, and so on. (Usually the label tries to grab all of copyright, which is super onerous but that\u2019s another story!)It can be the same thing for AI data, and for AI models. When you create data that can be used for model-building, and when you create models themselves, you can pre-specify licenses that restricts how others use them upstream.Blockchain technology makes this easy, for all the use cases, from personal data to music, from AI data to AI models. In the blockchain database, you treat permissions as assets, where for example a read permissions or the right to view a particular slice of data or model. You as the rights holder can transfer these permissions-as-assets to others in the system, similar to how you transfer Bitcoin: create the transfer transaction and sign it with your private key. (Thanks to Dimitri de Jonghe for this.)With this, you have far better control for the upstream of your AI training data, your AI models, and more. For example, \u201cyou can remix this data but you can\u2019t deep-learn it.\u201dThis is likely part of DeepMind\u2019s strategy in their healthcare blockchain project. In data mining healthcare data puts them at risk of regulation and antitrust issues (especially in Europe). But if users can instead truly own their medical data and control its upstream usage, then DeepMind can simply tell consumers and regulators \u201chey, the customer actually owns their own data, we just use it\u201d. My friend Lawrence Lundy provided this excellent example (thanks Lawrence!). He then extrapolated further:It\u2019s entirely possible that the only way governments will allow private ownership (human or AGI) of data is with a shared data infrastructure with \u201cnetwork neutrality\u201d rules, as with AT&T and the original long lines. In that sense, increasingly autonomous AI requires blockchains and other shared data infrastructure to be acceptable to the government, and therefore to be sustainable in the long term. -Lawrence LundyOpportunity 6: AI DAOs\u200a\u2014\u200aAI that can accumulate wealth, that you can\u2019t turn\u00a0offThis one\u2019s a doozy. An AI DAO is AI that owns itself, that you can\u2019t turn off. I\u2019ve previously discussed AI DAOs in three posts (I, II, III); I\u2019ll summarize the \u201chow\u201d below. I encourage the interested reader to dive deeper.So far, we\u2019ve talked about blockchains as decentralized databases. But we can decentralize processing too: basically, store state of a state machine. Have a bit of infrastructure around this to make it easier to do, and that\u2019s the essence of \u201csmart contracts\u201d technologies like Ethereum.We\u2019ve had decentralized processes before, in the form of computer viruses. No single entity owns or controls them, and you can\u2019t turn them off. But they had limits\u200a\u2014\u200athey basically try to break your computer, and that\u2019s about all.But what if you could have richer interactions with the process, and the process itself could accumulate wealth on its own? That\u2019s now possible via better APIs to the process such as smart contracts languages, and decentralized stores of value such as public blockchains.A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a process that manifests these characteristics. It\u2019s code that can own stuff.Which brings us to AI. The AI sub-field called \u201cArtificial General Intelligence\u201d (AGI) is most relevant. AGI is about autonomous agents interacting in an environment. AGI can be modeled as a feedback control system. This is great news, because control systems have many great qualities. First, they have strong mathematical foundations going back to the 1950s (Wiener\u2019s \u201cCybernetics\u201d). They capture the interaction with the world (actuating and sensing), and adapting (updating state based on internal model and external sensors). Control systems are widely used. They govern how a simple thermostat adapts to a target temperature. They cancel noise in your expensive headphones. They\u2019re at the heart of thousands of other devices from ovens to the brakes in your car.The AI community has recently embraced control systems more strongly. For example, they were key to AlphaGo. And, AGI agents themselves are control systems.An AI DAO is an AGI-style control system running on a decentralized processing & storage substrate. Its feedback loop continues on its own, taking inputs, updating its state, actuating outputs, with the resources to do so continually.We can get an AI DAO by starting with an AI (an AGI agent), and making it decentralized. Or, we can start with a DAO and give it AI decision-making abilities.AI gets its missing link: resources. DAO gets its missing link: autonomous decision-making. Because of this, AI DAOs could be way bigger than AIs on their own, or DAOs on their own. The potential impact is multiplicative.Here are some applications:An ArtDAO, which creates its own digital art and sells it. To generalize, it could do 3D designs, music, videos, and even entire films.Self-driving, self-owning cars. To generalize, any previous application of AI, but now the AI \u201cowns itself\u201d. We might have a future where humans own nothing, we\u2019re just renting services from AI DAOs.Any DAO app, with AI infused.Any SaaS app, with more automation, and decentralized.More in AI DAOs Part II piece. Some of these are, well, scary\u2026SummaryThis essay has described how blockchain technology can help AI, by drawing on my personal experiences in both AI and blockchain research. The combination is explosive! Blockchain technologies\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially planet-scale ones\u200a\u2014\u200acan help realize some long-standing dreams of AI and data folks, and open up several opportunities.Let\u2019s summarize:Further readingIf you liked this, you might like the following:[Update Sept 2017] On the heels of this essay, we started building a decentralized data exchange protocol & network called Ocean.Parts I, II, III of AI DAO essays, by Trent McConaghy.

They will be fundamental pieces of the economy which nearly everyone will interact with on a daily basis. They will be so normal that we will forget they exist.We should expect that, over the next couple decades, we will see a Cambrian explosion of blockchain applications and organizations much like what happened with the internet over the past few decades or electrification in the early 20th century.If that\u2019s true, it\u2019s worth developing a basic understanding for blockchains, including why they matter and how they work.Why Blockchains Matter\u201cIt is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking [about] what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aAlfred North WhiteheadIn a blockchain, each time a transaction takes place, such as one party sending bitcoin directly to another, the details of that deal\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding its source, destination, and date/timestamp\u200a\u2014\u200aare added to what is referred to as a block.Using cryptography, blockchains dramatically increases social scalability, the ability for humans to collaborate with increasingly large numbers of other humans, a necessary feature of civilization.Historically, humans only transacted with members of a small tribe, often based on kinship alone, because there was no way for them to trust individuals outside that group.A wide variety of innovations over the last few millennia have increased social scalability by allowing humans to cooperate in larger groups.The modern legal system which lowers vulnerability to violence, theft and fraud allowing parties or individuals that have no pre-existing relationships to interact.The internet, particularly through rating systems, facilitated transactions between individuals with little or no social relationship.Blockchains have the potential to increase social scalability to a level that no previous technology has.For the first time, we have a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another internet user safely and securely without relying on a trusted third party. It\u2019s hard to overstate how big of a deal this is.Think about digital contracts, digital keys (to physical locks or online locks), and digital ownership of physical assets including cars, houses, stocks, bonds and, of course, digital money.Note: There is a lot more to be said about Why Blockchains Matter. For the sake of not making this article insanely long, I will focus this article mostly on the \u201chow\u201d rather than the \u201cwhy.\u201d If you would like to read more about why blockchain technology matters check out Why is Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technology Valuable?, Money, blockchains, and social scalability, A Letter to Jamie Dimon, Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble and Why Decentralization Matters.How Does Blockchan Technology Work?Here\u2019s the short jargon-y version:A blockchain is a ledger that uses cryptography and incentives to record transactions in a tamper-evident way. This allows for trust-minimized transactions between pseudonymous parties without requiring a trusted intermediary.Now, let\u2019s unpack the pieces in there so that by the end of the article that will make perfect sense to you.PrimitivesBefore we dive into blockchains, we need to establish a few primitives. Primitives are like building material. If you want to build a shed, you\u2019re going to need some wood, some screws, a drill, and a saw. It would be good to get a brief idea on how each of those worked before you started building. That\u2019s all we\u2019re going to do here.The building blocks of blockchains are\u200a\u2014\u200asurprise, surprise\u200a\u2014\u200acryptographic primitives.Cryptography is the study of techniques for communicating securely in the presence of third parties (AKA adversaries).Historically, a lot of cryptographic research was done by the military to ensure they could communicate securely without having their enemies be able to read their telegram or radio messages.Modern cryptography is used on every popular website, in credit card chips, and computer passwords. In all these cases, it\u2019s trying to keep a third party (read: hacker, thief, etc.) from stealing sensitive data like your credit card information.The first building block we\u2019ll start with is hash functions.Hash FunctionsA hash function is a mathematical function that lets you encrypt data.[1]A hash function has three properties:Its input can be any size.E.g. I could use the phrase \u201cI like ice cream\u201d as input or I could use the entire text of War and Peace and both would work.Using any size input, it comes up with a fixed size output determined by which particular hashing algorithm is being used. In order to keep it simple, we\u2019ll use a 256-bit output since that\u2019s what Bitcoin, the first blockchain, uses.Whether I entered the phrase \u201cI like ice cream\u201d as an input or I used the entire text of War and Peace as the input, both would produce an output of the same size.Using the SHA 256 algorithm, the one used by Bitcoin, the phrase \u201cI like ice cream\u201d (no quotes) creates the output:138F4504A873C01D0864343FAD3027F03CA9BEA2F0109005FA4FC8C7DCC12634The entirety of War and Peace (all 587,287 words) copied from project Gutenberg produces the output:57027F5B3877ABBE43ACB101D59E963BC2CC0E86A6EBCCC34DFD035BBF83B096Even though the input is 146,821 times longer, you get the same size output. Pretty cool and, it turns out, useful. More on that later.It is efficiently computable. For any given input string, you can figure out the output in a reasonable amount of time.Even if I want to use the entire text of War and Peace as my input, it can still convert that into an output in a reasonable amount of time.The above properties are for a general hash function. General hash functions let you map a large space of things to a small space which can be helpful for storing and working with different types of data.However, we\u2019re going to focus on cryptographic hash functions since those are the ones used in blockchains.A cryptographic hash function requires three additional properties:Collision ResistanceDeterministic HidingPuzzle FriendlinessCryptographic Hash FunctionsCollision ResistanceA collision is when two different inputs produce the same output. While the output size will be the same, the output itself is not going to be identical to other outputs. \u201cI like ice cream\u201d and the entire text of War and Peace produce outputs of the same size, but the characters are different.If they produced the exact same output and I sent you that encrypted text and you decrypted it, you wouldn\u2019t know if I was telling you that I liked ice cream or that you should read War and Peace.It\u2019s also notable that two \u201cnearby\u201d inputs do not result in nearby outputs. The hash of War and Peace is completely different than the hash of War and Peace with 1 character changed.Using SHA256, The entirety of War and Peace produces the hash:57027F5B3877ABBE43ACB101D59E963BC2CC0E86A6EBCCC34DFD035BBF83B096If I delete the final period, but leave everything else the same, it produces the hash:E2E2E4FFD582E20474F0310C2132EAE5F2D766C6A253C1BC4AF57861095B30FAThis is very similar to how two \u201cnearby\u201d starting points in a chaotic system very quickly lead to two completely different future trajectories. It is this \u201cchaotic scrambling\u201d property of hash functions which creates collision resistance. The outputs are appear random and so are unlikely to collide, but are able to map infinity to finite space, which allows us to compress data.This particularly matters if you are sending around money. The public key to your wallet is produced from the private key using a cryptographic hash function. You don\u2019t want someone else to be able to reverse engineer get your public key to figure out your private key (since they could then steal all your funds).A hash function is considered to be collision resistant if nobody can find a collision. In theory, we know they exist because the number of inputs is infinite, but the number of outputs is finite\u200a\u2014\u200athere are only so many ways to arrange 64 characters.In practice though, the cryptographic hash function SHA 256 is collision resistant because no one has ever found a collision and the odds of it happening are astronomical. If every computer ever made by humanity had been trying to find a collision since the beginning of the universe, the odds of it happening are lower than the odds of the Earth being destroyed by a giant meteor in the next two seconds.So, it\u2019s possible, but there are a lot of other, bigger problems we should worry about first.Deterministic HidingHashes look random but are actually deterministic. Their outputs are therefore reproducible so that as long as you use the same input, you always get the same output. This means two different parties who know the input can verify that the other person also knows the input by showing their hash to the other party.The second property that we want for a cryptographic hash function is hiding. Hiding means that if you are given the output, there is no feasible way to figure out what the input was.That is, there is no way for a third party observer to know that 138F4504A873C01D0864343FAD3027F03CA9BEA2F0109005FA4FC8C7DCC12634 means \u201cI like ice cream.\u201dHowever if I know the input is \u201cI like ice cream\u201d then I can easily verify whether or not you know that by checking your hash.However, if anyone else sees the hash, they cannot use it to figure out the input. This allows those who know the input to communicate securely about it in a public channel using the hashed output without worrying that a third party observer can figure it out.Puzzle FriendlinessThe third property we need is that they are puzzle-friendly. This means that if someone wanted to generate a hash that came up with the same output as \u201cI like ice cream,\u201d it\u2019s extremely difficult to find another value that exactly hits this target.The algorithm to generate the hash is to try every possible string, ordered by length and then by alphabetical order, until you get one that hashes to the same value. There\u2019s a very large haystack to search for a very small needle so we get probabilities that suggest an asteroid annihilating all life on Earth is a more pressing problem.Another way of saying this is that cryptographic hash functions are hard to reverse. This is the main thing which makes a cryptographic hash as compared to a hash used in data structures or a compression algorithm.This is also the arms race part of blockchains\u200a\u2014\u200ahackers are always getting better at reversing hash functions so cryptographers are always having to come up with better hash functions.Having this quality is important because the blockchain is a \u201ctamper-evident ledger,\u201d a tamper proof record of transactions.The puzzle friendliness property is what makes it tamper-evident. If I wanted to replace an entry like \u201cI like ice cream,\u201d it should be impossible for me to do so without other participants being able to know.Using a good cryptographic hash function, even slight changes in the input will results in dramatically different outputs making the input tamper-resistant.Cryptographic hash functions look random (and so lack collisions), can\u2019t be reversed, and hide inputs, but, at the same time, are completely deterministic. This is what makes them useful!This covers the basics of cryptographic hash functions. In the next section, we\u2019ll look at how these hash functions are used to build blockchains.Transitive Hash Functions within the BlockchainThe previous section about about hash functions above is really just a big introduction to how to hash a single piece of information like words in a book or a password.What if you wanted to hash collections of data like a bunch of documents or a sequence of transactions?Let\u2019s start with a linear sequence of things you might want to consecutively hash. You start with some piece of data, A, and you hash it to get A#.Now you want to \u201cmix in\u201d B. So you just add B to it (A# + B) and take the hash of the whole thing. Now you have a new hash (B#) which has some information about both A (from the hash A# you used) and B.What you need is a hash function for which changing anything about A or B would result in a different final hash. This is a transitive hash function.A blockchain is a chain of\u00a0hashes.When people talk about blockchains, one of the words that gets thrown around a lot is \u201ctrust-minimized.\u201dHashing in general, and hash pointers in particular, are a core component of the trust-minimized property of blockchains. A hash pointer is just a hash that points at some other data structure like a previous block.This is a big deal because it makes easy to see if someone tampers with the data.If we had a blockchain of 100 blocks and the tenth block contained the hash of the entire manuscript to War and Peace and I changed one letter in the manuscript, it would change the hash pointer in that block and all subsequent blocks.[2]Hash pointers ensure the integrity of the ledger (i.e. that it hasn\u2019t been modified). Blockchains have been called triple entry accounting because this hashpointer data structure is another, harder-to-forge way of making sure the ledger reflects reality.For example, if there are two people collaborating on a project and one person tries to go back and modify something so that they make more money, it is immediately clear to their partner that they are trying to cheat\u200a\u2014\u200athey will end up with a resulting hash that\u2019s different.Merkle TreesNow what if you want to hash not just a linear sequence, but a sequence of sets like Bitcoin\u2019s set of transactions in its sequence of blocks. The new thing you need is a rule for how to traverse each set of data, reducing the problem again to encrypting a consecutive series of things (A#, B#, etc.)A Merkle Tree is exactly this. It allows you to group blocks of data and hash them together into a structure that looks like, well, a tree branch with leaves.As with a blockchain, as long as we know the hash point at the \u201croot\u201d of the tree, then we can know that none of the data in the tree has been tampered with.If one bit, in one transaction is changed, then it changes every subsequent hash and the tampering is revealed.Using a Merkle tree is preferable over just a digest of all transactions because it allows for a much quicker and simpler test of whether a particular transaction is included in the set of all transactions.", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "Some Blockchain Reading", "author_name": "Nick Tomaino", "link": "https://thecontrol.co/some-blockchain-reading-1d98ec6b2f39?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 9, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "759", "content": "Some Blockchain ReadingNick TomainoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 9, 2017With the price momentum that Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital assets have experienced over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve recently heard from more people who want to get serious about learning about blockchains.To really understand the space, it\u2019s essential to explore the primary works of the leading creators that have been involved in the construction of the security, economics and governance of these systems for the past several years.

The more nodes it has the more transactions it can crunch. Eventually, it could leave Visa in the dust.It\u2019s also one of the first non-blockchain, non-DAG crypto platforms.But wait, aren\u2019t blockchains the center of the crypto universe? Aren\u2019t they essential to making the magic happen?Nope.Blockchains got it all started but they\u2019re only the beginning of decentralized money. They\u2019re the first solution, the breakthrough that made it all possible, but they\u2019re just that, the first solution.And first solutions rarely last.Blockchains are the cave man\u2019s fire of decentralized consensus technology. They\u2019re the Model T.To understand why, you just have to know there\u2019s a massive difference between an iteration of technology and a category of technology. In the long run categories of tech succeed but iterations fail.Take the steam engine category. The first concept steam engines didn\u2019t work. Later iterations of steam machines exploded, killing or maiming people. Others broke down too easy and too often.It took almost a thousand years before the first truly working steam engine revolutionized travel and work across the world. Not all tech takes that much time but it always takes longer than most people imagine, usually decades.It\u2019s hard to picture a world without the Internet but for twenty years almost nobody saw it taking off and becoming the planet spanning, life changing network it is today.Iterations are the best ideas we have at a single point in time.They\u2019re subject to the limits of imagination and the technology and materials of the time when they\u2019re invented. Tech skeptics struggle to see the future because they always mistake the iteration for the category. They see all the limitations and the flaws and they project them indefinitely into the future, as if nothing ever changes.But the future is change.Skeptics don\u2019t realize there\u2019s an engineer somewhere studying those flaws and trying to find answers, working through all the permutations in his or her mind, trying to discover the secret elixir. Eventually, one of them sees something everyone else in the world missed and a new iteration is born, better than anything that came before it.Think about digital books. The first versions sucked. They were CD-ROMs and you had to read them on big, ugly CRT screens that burned holes in your retinas. They scratched easily, skipped, were slow to load and you couldn\u2019t lug a giant computer around with you on the subway.Over the years, a number of companies tried to make e-readers and they failed miserably. Even Apple tried and failed to make an early pad.It wasn\u2019t until Amazon used its massive market power and coupled it with e-ink technology and insanely long battery life that the true digital book revolution took off running with the Kindle. They had the perfect storm of market power and tech power to make it happen.That\u2019s how it goes with every technology.The categories don\u2019t fail, just the iterations.Keys of the Crypto RevolutionA bunch of things are holding crypto back from mass adoption. I talked about the biggest ones in my article The Five Keys to Crypto Evolution but the absolute biggest one of all is how fast and far these systems can scale.We know how to build centralized systems that push 150 million credit card transactions per day. It\u2019s not easy but the big boys can do it. It takes time, money and knowledge. Those systems are the culmination of thirty years of technological breakthrough and human ingenuity.But when it comes to decentralized systems, there\u2019s no template for matching the power and performance of centralized systems. It\u2019s a computer engineering problem of the highest order and we have no idea how to do it perfectly yet. We\u2019ve only had Bitcoin for eight years. Eight measly years!Cryptocurrency is brand new technology and we just don\u2019t know everything it can and can\u2019t do yet.When people laugh at crypto and say it won\u2019t work, it\u2019s incredibly short sighted. There are no libraries to download, no papers to read that have it all figured out, no code to borrow. There\u2019s no O\u2019Reilly book on best practices for scaling decentralized systems. We\u2019re still figuring it out and we\u2019ve got a long way to go.That\u2019s what makes the Radix project so exciting.They\u2019ve hammered on the biggest problems in secret for six years, going through a thousand ups and downs and pushing past dead ends and false starts to get to where they are right now, an alpha launch with real live working code that can scale linearly like a cloud system.If you\u2019re new to crypto you\u2019re probably wondering why we don\u2019t just add more nodes to Bitcoin to make it faster, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. More miners only make Bitcoin more secure but not faster. You could add a billion more nodes and it wouldn\u2019t make Bitcoin one bit quicker. It would still push six transactions per second on-chain.Cloud systems work very differently. If you spin up a bunch of Docker containers in a distributed application you can handle more and more traffic. Eventually, you might hit the point of diminishing returns but it\u2019s almost always a limit of the code and not the underlying systems. Programmers can go back and refactor the code, break out pieces, turn a platform into microservices, and make it faster and faster.Today\u2019s crypto systems can\u2019t do that.Radix can.Add more nodes and it speeds up, processing more and more transactions per second.And if it works and nobody can break its core design, it might just be the breakthrough we\u2019ve all been waiting for, the one that opens the flood gates to mass adoption.The Joy and Pain of Creative BreakthroughsThe Radix core design was a long time coming and it wasn\u2019t easy getting there.They got there through a series of false starts, trying to bend Bitcoin into unnatural contortions. After that, they embraced the DAGs made famous by IOTA, only to abandon them and make their own consensus system inspired by quantum mechanics and special relativity.Yes, really.On my podcast, The Daily Posthuman, I talked with Dan Hughes, CTO/Lead Developer of Radix, and CEO Piers Ridyard.Hughes\u2019 journey started with Bitcoin, like so many others. Bitcoin is like a fractal that goes down forever and ever. Once you see it you want to dive into its endless depths. Hughes sensed the possibilities that it promised and dug into the white paper and code with relish, plummeting down through the hypnotic swirls of the fractal.But like so many other visionary developers he realized that Bitcoin wouldn\u2019t do everything he wanted it to do.Vitalik and the author at a recent\u00a0reunionI saw the same thing happen with Vitalik Buterin when I was writing for Bitcoin Magazine in 2013 and 2014 as he was thinking about Ethereum and talking about it on the writer\u2019s Skype channel. No matter how hard Buterin or Hughes tried they couldn\u2019t make it do backflips and somersaults.That\u2019s by design really.Bitcoin works because it\u2019s incredibly simple at its core. It doesn\u2019t want to be a giant decentralized platform for games and smart contracts and apps.It\u2019s just money.It\u2019s a way to send, save, and spend. That\u2019s it.It\u2019s beautifully simple and that\u2019s why it works and nobody managed to hack the protocol layer and pull a billion dollars out of everyone\u2019s wallets.But now it\u2019s time to do more complex things and that means starting fresh.Bitcoin only hinted at the great things to come. Hidden in its incredible depths are the shards of a thousand other ideas. It\u2019s the face that launched a thousand ships.After Hughes spent years trying to make Bitcoin do things it just wasn\u2019t meant to do, he eventually he had to abandon it.It\u2019s hard to throw a few years of work in the trash but Hughes did it. Depressed and hungry for a solution, he scoured the literature of computer science looking for answers. He turned over every rock and found every hidden passage.Eventually he discovered DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs). A lot of folks think crypto people invented DAGs but they\u2019ve been around for decades. Hughes had high hopes for DAGs and dug into them in a coding frenzy.Two years later though, he started running into brick wall after brick wall when it came to scalability and security. Things really broke down when he tried to shard it or when it came under attack as messages flooded the network and went parabolic fast. Insanely exponential garbage traffic crippled the network as it grew and grew and eventually Hughes realized he\u2019d hit a dead end.He had to start over.Again.Throwing out all your work and starting fresh once is hard but twice is brutal.It took a while to get through it but eventually he got back on the horse and started searching. He scoured papers and new developments out of cutting edge colleges like MIT.But there was nothing. Nobody had really figured out a good answer to decentralized linear scalability.Realizing that nobody figured it out was freeing in a way.It meant he could look to other inspirations and that\u2019s what Hughes did. He started to look at nature and the way the universe keeps time. After all, the universe had a few billion years of evolution to work it all out and it knows a few things about building scalable, sustainable systems.Once Hughes started to master his own ideas the code really started to come together. He realized that at every step the key was to simplify the stack. Less is more.At its core, the processes that underpin our world are deceptively simple and Hughes wanted to mirror them.From great simplicity comes complexity.It\u2019s just like we saw recently in AI. Deep learning systems are super complex while the long out of favor genetic algorithms are brutally simple. Deep learning dominates the AI landscape today but when OpenAI resurrected genetic algos they found they performed as well or better on tasks deep learning and reinforcement learning devoured with ease but with a lot less processing power needed.Genetic algorithms were inspired by nature and evolution. Nature is masterful at using the simplest ideas to spawn all of the wonders you see around you every day.Drawing from nature, Hughes looks to simplify at all costs. Instead of grafting more and more complexity onto his system he constantly tries to figure out a better, simpler and more elegant way to do something.If an exotic attack on his platform caused it to breakdown and spew 300,000 message per second he worked at it and worked at it until it only spawned two or three.All of that takes time and diligence and patience.We won\u2019t get to the promised land overnight but step by step Hughes inches towards it, locked in his coding cave, pounding away at the keyboard, doing the deepest of deep work.A New\u00a0HopeOnly time will tell if Dan Hughes missed something in his grand design and needs to go back to the drawing board again.But if it works, it\u2019s a hell of a time to be in crypto.In my article what will Bitcoin Look Like in Twenty Years, I wrote \u201cblockchain is just the beginning of decentralized consensus.\u201d I said that we\u2019d see dozens, if not hundreds of ways to do decentralized consensus in the coming years and decades.Blockchain was the breakthrough that made it all possible but there\u2019s a reason nobody owns a Model T anymore. We learned how to build better, faster, sleeker and more comfortable cars. The same happens with any technology. The initial breakthrough leads to a cascade of breakthroughs.Blockchain is the iteration. Decentralized consensus technology is the category.Decentralized consensus is the true power of crypto and it can do way more than prevent double spends.It\u2019s a way for distributed systems to come to agreement. It\u2019s how friends, enemies and frenemies decide on a state of reality. The possibilities are limitless but blockchains limit and narrow those possibilities.The very word blockchain limits our understanding of what\u2019s possible. When we substitute that iteration word for \u201cdecentralized consensus\u201d it frames our thoughts and makes us believe there\u2019s no other way to do consensus at a distance. That\u2019s because language frames how we think about ideas and about the world.That\u2019s why the Eskimos have over fifty words for snow.It\u2019s an idea popularized by anthropologist Franz Boas over a century ago but discredited by other anthropologists. Turns out he was right. The Eskimos really do have over fifty words for snow.Boas captured some of those fascinating words in journals and letters to his wife: \u201c\u2018aqilokoq\u2019 for \u201csoftly falling snow\u201d and \u201cpiegnartoq\u201d for \u201cthe snow [that is] good for driving sled,\u201d to name just two.\u201dWhy does it matter whether we have one word for snow or fifty?Because having just one word limits our ability to understand nuance and come up with fresh ideas. A word that tells us how wet or powdery the snow is and how good it is for cross country skiing brings tremendous depth and insight in a single word that would take dozens to describe in English.The inverse is true too. If we only have one word for snow, all snow is pretty much the same whether it\u2019s wet and icy or whether it\u2019s big, fat powdery flakes perfect for snowboarding.When we say blockchain we make it so we can only think one way about how to make the crypto future a reality.Think different.It took fresh thinking that went beyond blockchain to get Radix where it is today. They had to leave the prison of Satoshi\u2019s original ideas and instead take flight from the hidden possibilities of what Bitcoin promised.And that\u2019s where they are today. They\u2019re ready to show the world what they\u2019ve done.The alpha code is live.They\u2019re ready for people to try to break it and tear it apart.Dive in. Bend it. Tear it. Make it your own.All the while they\u2019re starting to move up the chain of value.They\u2019re working on abstracting all the routine tasks you\u2019ll do in crypto like writing smart contracts. Most people won\u2019t ever need or want to write a smart contract in their lives. They\u2019ll just grab a few Lego blocks that already do the heavy lifting and stack them together into something beautiful.They\u2019re also releasing Radix in a totally different way. ICOs have dominated the landscape since the early days of Ethereum but with Radix there\u2019s no ERC-20 token and no early discounts to private investors. Everyone is on the same footing.Even the staff doesn\u2019t get any tokens.That\u2019s because they\u2019re trying to build an economy with a stablecoin that moves fast and far in the network instead of flipping around wildly.All of this adds up to a next-gen platform that will contend with Ethereum, EOS and others for the crypto crown in the coming years.And competition is a beautiful thing.I\u2019ve covered a lot of platforms over the last few years but Radix may be the one I\u2019m most excited about right now.They stick to their principals and Dan Hughes continues to do the hard work to make his dream of a decentralized future a reality.Time will tell.And as the Shawshank Redemption told us:\u201cAll it takes is pressure and time.\u201dBlockchain, your days may just be numbered after all.###########################################Article Version: 20180822002.beta.3a############################################I\u2019ve got a new podcast, The Daily PostHuman, covering crypto, AI, tech, the future, history, society and more!

The important one was \u201cHow do I build applications on it?\u201d. It took a few weeks of digging up, reading and experimenting to finally get it. I couldn\u2019t find a short but comprehensive guide. Now, that I have some decent understanding, I thought of writing one that could help others. This is a light speed guide, I have kept only the important parts in order to reduce the learning curve.ChaptersThe Purpose of BlockchainHow was the Blockchain invented?Introduction to Ethereum & Smart ContractsProgramming Smart Contracts on EthereumThe Way AheadThe Purpose of BlockchainRoopa lives in one of the remote areas of Delhi. The government of India has allocated her few resources of food every month. Since she belongs to the BPL(Below Poverty Line) category. The government uses a middleman to distribute these food resources. Only one-third of the allocated food resources reach people like Roopa, the rest is sold by the middleman for profit.Sara writes fiction books, she publishes them on Amazon. She\u2019s upset because Amazon takes 50% of the sale as commission. That\u2019s unfair because she alone has put in the efforts of writing and marketing.The problem is middleman is hungry for power and money. Their motto has become \u201cprofit at any cost\u201d, to support producers and to empower the poor, we need middlemen to act ethically. That\u2019s almost impossible to achieve, but what if we can replace middleman with an autonomous system?Since computers don\u2019t have biases they neither need money or power. This could have been Satoshi Namakato\u2019s thought when he invented bitcoin using the blockchain technology in 2008.How was the Blockchain Invented?Money has evolved over time, each evolution reduced its cost of production and made their transactions more convenient. Gold coins were costly to produce. The invention of paper currency solved this problem. But, after the invention of computers and internet, people found a better way to make transactions convenient and faster.To safe keep our lifetime\u2019s earnings and to facilitate digital transactions we need a middleman(bank). This made banks powerful, they can impose a heavy fee on our withdrawals /transactions, sell our private information, etcBanks hunger for money caused the financial crisis in 2008. Banks failed to respect their customer\u2019s privacy. Their weak security systems gave rise to digital fraud.The next evolution of money had to solve the following problems.It shouldn\u2019t be stored with a central entity.It needs to be highly secure.It should ensure privacy.Since fiat currency is controlled by the government, Satoshi had no option but to invent a new currency (Bitcoin). He solved these problems with the help of peer-to-peer networks and cryptography.DecentralisationCredits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdTorrents use peer-to-peer technology to share files. The torrent app doesn\u2019t download the file from a central server or a single computer, instead, it connects to the people in its network, finds out who has the file and download it from their computers.You get the pieces of a file from different computers around the world. If one person in the network goes away, your download isn\u2019t affected because there are other people who can share the file.Satoshi adopted this technology since it stores money in a decentralized way. No single entity will have control over it.CryptographyCredits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdIn cryptography, one can digitally sign a message. In order to do this we need three things a public key, private key, and message.The public key and private key are a set of long characters that are mathematically connected. A public key is public like your username, and the private key is a secret like your password.A message is an information you want to authorise, ex: \u201cI authorise you to pay John $100\u201d.If you input the algorithm with a public key, private key and message. The cryptographic algorithm will produce a signature. That is another set of characters unique to the contents of that message.Public Key -----BEGIN EC PUBLIC KEY----- MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE50uE+YSxqDgMkFByhpcgTVqXCqHO h68Ljt1z0jklDff/WV7xo+U6o3REBtK/C0/LM+Ef3FB3wR9aXMGNMLb9EA== -----END EC PUBLIC KEY-----Private Key -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY----- MIGHAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQgwqIsXl9FqsgrzMdx axI6flBwWIev0Z7i+WF4j8BGnrKhRANCAATnS4T5hLGoOAyQUHKGlyBNWpcKoc6H rwuO3XPSOSUN9/9ZXvGj5TqjdEQG0r8LT8sz4R/cUHfBH1pcwY0wtv0Q -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----MessageHello WorldSignatureB0A9A4F641D3A2E3A65576B7311DCD62ABE78BBF4D3F5FE856598508E24FCB2E6F0277C2F8D57E9E2E108B7C493986E783F5316B8046597019951669B4EE6922To verify the message, one has to input the public key, the message, and the signature. The cryptographic algorithm can verify if the message was signed by the owner of the public key.It would take 1000\u2019s of years to break the cryptographic algorithm. This cannot be done faster because of the computational limits we have. Quantum computers in the future might challenge this. But, the Bitcoin system can be upgraded to ensure security.Satoshi incorporated cryptography in his system to help people authorise bitcoin transactions from their wallets.PrivacyCredits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdYou register to bitcoin by generating a wallet (public key/private key). The systems collect no information such as email id, full name, etc. Hence you are anonymous unless you announce your public key.Putting it\u00a0TogetherSatoshi built a shared ledger using cryptography and peer-to-peer networks. When someone sends bitcoins to someone, a message is cryptographically signed and broadcasted to the entire people in the network. They update their ledger, hence everyone in the network knows who owns what.BlockchainEvery ten minutes transactions are grouped together into a block and linked back to the previous blocks. This process makes a continuous blockchain. Mining is a process by which a block is confirmed, this involves computers in the network to solve a mathematical problem. The first computer/miner who solves the problem gets rewarded in bitcoins made out of thin air.Once the block is confirmed and added to the network, it is replicated across the entire network. Blockchain was invented in the process of making the autonomous Bitcoin system which confirmed transactions without human intervention. If you are looking for a simplified explanation for blockchain, here\u2019s a story.A Beginner\u2019s Guide to BlockchainI don\u2019t get why people find it difficult to understand Blockchain. I wonder why I myself didn\u2019t. It was in 2013 I first\u2026hackernoon.comIntroduction to Ethereum & Smart ContractsEarlier we talked about replacing middleman with autonomous systems. This can be done through programming. Bitcoin\u2019s system was difficult for people to code autonomous systems.Hence Vitalik Buterin built a new cryptocurrency called Ethereum. It was not only a decentralised cryptocurrency but a network of computers which can host code in the form of smart contracts.In smart contracts, we can program conditions. If you want to build a decentralised bookstore. You write instructions to help authors add new books, send the download link to an ebook once the customer makes a transaction etc.Smart contracts not only store conditions but also data. A smart contract of a decentralised bookstore in itself stores the book listing, purchases, etc.However, we should admit the limitations of the smart contract. Some systems need human support, computers can\u2019t handle it. In the real world implementing smart contracts isn\u2019t easy. Smart contracts once published cannot be altered, silly mistakes can be costly.Programming Smart Contracts on\u00a0EthereumCredits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdWe will build a simple smart contract that stores and retrieves grades of students. We will be coding the contract in solidity. Here\u2019s the github repo.pragma solidity ^0.4.18;contract Grades{}The first line tells the compiler which version of solidity we are using. Then we define the contract grades.We need to store two things in our contract, names of students and their grades. Hence we will create an array to store student names and an associative array to store their grades.pragma solidity ^0.4.18;contract Grades{mapping (bytes32 => string) public grades;bytes32[] public studentList;}Now, we will create a way through which we can send the contract, a list of student names. We will do that in the constructor.pragma solidity ^0.4.18;contract Grades{mapping (bytes32 => string) public grades;bytes32[] public studentList;function Grades(bytes32[] studentNames) public {studentList = studentNames;}}In Solidity we would be calling the constructor only once. We will pass student names as an argument, which would be stored in the studentList array we declared earlier.Now, we need to write a function to assign students their grade. We also need another function to check if the student is valid.pragma solidity ^0.4.18;contract Grades{mapping (bytes32 => string) public grades;bytes32[] public studentList;function Grades(bytes32[] studentNames) public {studentList = studentNames;}function giveGradeToStudent(bytes32 student, string grade) public {require(validStudent(student));grades[student] = grade;}function validStudent(bytes32 student) view public returns (bool) {for(uint i = 0; i < studentList.length; i++) {if (studentList[i] == student) {return true;}}return false;}}The \u201cgiveGradeToStudent\u201d function takes two arguments, student name, and grade. The require function checks if the \u201cvalidStudent\u201d function returns true or false. If it returns false, the execution is canceled.Finally, we need to write a function to fetch the grade of a student.

How Ontology Could Bring Big Business To BlockchainBusinesses Looking to Adopt Blockchain Face Immense Challenges\u200a\u2014\u200aOntology Provides a\u00a0SolutionNoam LevensonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 12, 2018I had the opportunity to question Jun Li for this article, founder of Ontology. A big thanks to him and to Julia Yu for connecting us.Quick SummaryA longtime-in-development project of Onchain, Ontology supports a range of advanced applications so that businesses and institutions can transition to blockchain. They allow entities to create private chains, maintain control over their information, interconnect with other private chains and the larger Ontology network, and connect into public chains like NEO. Services like customizable private chains with optional features, digital identity (ONT ID), and advanced trust issuance systems (entities can issue trust to other entities and all that can be traced backwards to the initial issuer) make Ontology an extremely ambitious project.Ontology In-DepthTrust in a trust-less system. It seems contradictory. Blockchain is supposed to inherently remove the need for trust. Place your trust in the code, with all thy heart, and all thy soul. Blockchain is built on the premise that transparent code removes the need for our institutions of trust, and along with them, the power we give to them. Smart contracts could reduce our reliance on lawyers, the justice system, corporations, and banks.With this understanding, why do we need Ontology, a solution which promises to be \u201c a decentralized trust ecosystem?\u201d It\u2019s like selling diesel to Telsa drivers\u2026But the fact is, public, open-source blockchains only enable a small portion of blockchain\u2019s use cases. While some dream of a truly decentralized world, a world where all corporations exist as DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), we have not yet reached that reality. Companies and organizations still require trust: they need to understand their user base, verify identity, manage digital assets, and control trust issuance within their ecosystem. Imagine a university operating on the blockchain or some other Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT\u200a\u2014\u200aa term encompassing all forms of decentralized protocols, not just blockchains). All their records, transcripts, invoices, and data would be stored in some capacity via DLT. They would issue digital diplomas to students, maintain a record of their students via their digital identities, and manage and delegate information access. However, institutional players like universities, hospitals, and corporations, likely won\u2019t trust the success of their institution to a truly anonymous, decentralized ledger. Entrusting your future to game theory is an enormous leap of faith, even if many blockchain enthusiasts have already done so.What is the solution? An ecosystem that supports digital identity, issuable trust, and enables a network of private, public, and consortium blockchains. A solution that allows for private enterprises to customize their blockchain solutions\u200a\u2014\u200athe governance and protocols\u200a\u2014\u200aand maintain control over their users. Ontology is looking to provide that solution.\u201cIt\u2019s too big a leap of faith for business, financial institutions, and governments to use NEO (or Bitcoin, Ethereum) to store sensitive identity information, let alone to be compliant with laws and regulations designed for the pre-blockchain world.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Ontology\u00a0TeamOntology OverviewOntology aims to build a bridge between the real world and distributed data systems. The Ontology team understands that for enterprises and companies to enter the world of DLT, they need to have an ecosystem that supports choice. Different businesses need different consensus models, different governance protocols, and different supportive applications. Ontology enables all of these.Ontology is made for business. Imagine Ontology as this multilayered network. On the lowest level, Ontology\u2019s blockchain connects with other large scale blockchain platforms (they already support the NEO Virtual Machine), like EOS, Ethereum, and QTUM. This enables companies to trade and store digital assets on NEO, interact with Ethereum dApps, and connect to other blockchain networks. The next level of Ontology is a series of pre-made APIs and protocols. These are the bricks. Companies and application developers without blockchain knowledge can build private, customizable blockchains with Ontology\u2019s protocol kits. The final layer are the companies, the corporations, the institutions, and the organizations that desire blockchain solutions, but in a permissioned and controllable manner.I think of Ontology as similar to a consultant firm. Just as companies hire consultants to overhaul their bureaucracy, Ontology provides the connections, means, development, and knowledge to bring companies into the world of DLT.OnChainOntology, though connected to NEO, is not a NEO project. Ontology was developed by a company called Onchain. I\u2019m quoting from my previous article:NEO\u2019s founders Da HongFei and Erik Zhang founded a company called Onchain. Understanding Onchain is critical to understanding NEO. They\u2019re not the same company, but their interests align. Onchain\u2019s system, known as DNA (Decentralized Network Architecture) aims to work with Chinese businesses and government. NEO acts as the foundation of DNA. If Onchain can integrate with Chinese businesses and government, that will greatly spur adoption of NEO.Ultimately, Ontology is an implementation of DNA\u200a\u2014\u200adeveloping public and private blockchains for businesses.These blockchains then link up to NEO to join the decentralized economy. Businesses then have all the benefits of both private and public blockchains. It\u2019s important to recognize that Ontology is not a new development; Onchain has been developing Ontology in secret before releasing details to the public. Despite it being in its pre fundraising phase, Ontology is already a mature project.A summary of the connections and reputation that Onchain has:Established in 2014, this is not a fresh-off-the-shelf companyFirst Chinese blockchain company to join Hyperledger\u200a\u2014\u200aa collaboration of projects that work towards integrating blockchain with established businesses.Law Chain\u200a\u2014\u200aworks with Microsoft China in digitizing and securing signatures via blockchain technology.Strategic partner of Microsoft China on multiple projectsWorked with the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and IndustryVoted as one of KPMG\u2019s top 50 Fintech Companies in ChinaPartnership with Alibaba to provide an email certification service for Ali CloudInvestment from Fosun Group\u200a\u2014\u200aChina\u2019s largest private conglomerate\u200a\u2014\u200ato integrate Onchain across their businesses.Collaboration with Chinese regional government\u200a\u2014\u200ausing Onchain to develop public services and digital identitySelected by Microsoft to be a part of their 6 month startup accelerator program.NEONEO is not directly linked to Ontology. However, for NEO to truly underpin a digital asset smart economy, they need trust protocols to facilitate the transition of enterprises to blockchain. Many question why Ontology needs their own blockchain and can\u2019t simply be a dApp built on NEO. I think that the answer is less about NEO\u2019s limitations and more about the advantages that Ontology has by remaining autonomous.Not only does Ontology support more applications by connecting with multiple blockchains, but not every blockchain enterprise application will be a smart contract. Some might simply want to utilize Ontology\u2019s business IT protocols and APIs. As a result, Ontology needs their own blockchain to provide their customers with more flexibility.TLDR: Ontology is the link between blockchain and business. Their parent company, Onchain is already well connected with Chinese enterprises and government. Ontology creates a range of advanced applications so that businesses can create private chains, maintain control over their information, interconnect with other private chains and the larger Ontology network, and connect into public chains like NEO.What Makes Ontology\u00a0Unique?Instead of just listing out what features Ontology supports without any larger, holistic view, let\u2019s focus on how a company would operate on the blockchain, and then discuss how Ontology supports this.Blockchain\u2019s first hospital?I run a hospital. I want a configurable, permissioned blockchain that supports everything from health records and prescriptions, to patient identity and data analytics for research. I need digital identity services for my employees and patients. I need to be able to maintain control over documents and secure information, granting only doctor and patient access certain files. I need connectivity with other blockchains so that I can coordinate with other private health facilities, cooperate with research ventures, and bill insurance companies. I need to be able to handle invoices and billing, payments and salaries, all within the blockchain.Some of these requirements are standard across industries. Most companies will need invoice abilities and trust protocols. However, there also has to be a level of customizability specific to healthcare.Ontology\u2019s genius is in their construction of a system that provides easy implementation and development of DLT solutions for a variety of industries. They provide the building blocks. The blocks, Ontology Common and Ontology Custom, are described in their recently released Ecosystem White Paper. Ontology Common refers to the suite of deployable blockchain kits ubiquitous across applications. Every company will need digital identity support; thus, Ontology provides a premade digital identity kit. They refer to these kits as modules. In comparison, Ontology Custom refers to blockchain features that can still be easily deployed, but allow for more customizability. These are features such as governance, consensus models, and encryption specifications. Depending on the type of business, these will be different. These modules are like a kit of Legos. You can build virtually anything you\u2019d like with a box full of Legos. Building with them is easy, actually producing the plastic brick is hard. Thus, Lego\u200a\u2014\u200aor Ontology\u200a\u2014\u200aproduces the blocks; you get to build\u2026and step on them in the middle of the night.A \u201cBlock-Chain\u201dThe Lego\u00a0BlocksOntology\u2019s blocks, or modules come in several form.ONT ID:ONT ID is a verification services for people, businesses, corporations, and other legal entities, as well as physical objects like IoT devices and mobile phones. At all times, entities maintain control over their ID and are responsible for signing their private key to permit its use. Users can also grant management rights to others. In our hospital, every doctor, patient, and service provider would have an ID, as well as equipment within the hospital. All verified and secured with the blockchain.The Trust\u00a0Trees:If you\u2019re running a hospital, you need to be able to issue trust within your ecosystem. You need to verify your employees and other entities that you work with. This verifies that actors within the industry are who they say they are. Ontology provides two solutions:Centralized Trust Trees: One entity can apply for a certificate to be a trust anchor. The certificate is created when an entity registers and verifies their personal information on the blockchain. Once they\u2019re an anchor, they can issue trust to others. The recipients can also issue trust to others, but it\u2019s all traceable back to the original anchor. This creates a tree-like structure where originating from the anchor are branches of entities entrusting others. This model would work well for an entity like a hospital.Decentralized Trust Trees: Unlike the above where a centralized entity issues trust and provides the credibility for the whole tree, this model allows for trust and reputation to instead be based on how relevant you are within the network. The more authentication you receive from others, the more credibility you will have.The Tree of\u00a0TrustThese entities\u200a\u2014\u200apeople or organizations\u200a\u2014\u200acan issue verifiable claims. Verifiable claims are simply attributes about other entities. Imagine a school issuing transcripts. Verifiable claims can be customized, so the school can define the transcript\u2019s validity period, set an automatic expiration date, and determine who can see said claim.Using zk-Snarks\u200a\u2014\u200aZero Knowledge Proofs (proving you have information without revealing said info), claims can also be verified without being made public. Perhaps you want to prove that you are in fact over 18, without publicizing other private details like your address or birthday. Today, you do this every time you show your ID. With Ontology\u2019s Zero Knowledge Proofs, the network can confirm that you are 18-years-old without you ever disclosing additional details.By connecting claims to entities and integrating external identity information, Ontology ensures that businesses have a large amount of flexibility. Identity on Ontology isn\u2019t just a static digital ID, but is comprehensive and constantly evolving.Other Modules:Ontology supports a variety of other customizable blocks. Among these are modules for security, digital copyright, encryption, and decentralized computation. Ontology supports modules for the issuance and management of verifiable claims, and modules supporting scaling solutions such as sharding and off-chain solutions.TLDR: Through digital identity, trust issuance models, and anonymous information capabilities, Ontology enables a range of enterprise applications.The Nitty\u00a0GrittyA project is nothing if the technology and protocols don\u2019t support the vision. If you walk the walk you need to talk the talk.ConsensusHow a network comes to consensus is enormously important. It influences factors such as security, reliability, efficiency, and speed. Ontology uses a Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) similar to NEO; they\u2019ve dubbed their specific version Ontorand Consensus Engine (OCE).dBFT is a modified version of Proof of Stake (PoS). You can read here more about the difference between PoS, used by NEO and more recent blockchain protocols, and Proof of Work (PoW), used by Bitcoin and Ethereum.Byzantine Fault Tolerance attempts to solve the Byzantine General\u2019s ProblemdBFT (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) sounds like a term you\u2019d see on your AP History Test. The simplest explanation of Byzantine Fault Tolerance is the issue with how to get everyone on the network to be honest and work together\u200a\u2014\u200abecause one bad apple could ruin everything.I imagine dBFT as working similar to how the U.S. Senate works (and if that analogy made you want to just give up on DLT entirely, I understand, but hold on\u2026keep reading). If every person in America\u200a\u2014\u200aall 323.1 million\u200a\u2014\u200awas allowed to directly participate in the governmental decision making process, it would be catastrophic. It would be brutally slow as millions competed for the microphone, all shouting their opinion and arguing with each other. Making decisions would also be agonizingly slow. So instead, everyone in the country gets a vote. And with this vote, they can elect their representatives, someone to speak for them. This system directly reflects dBFT governance. Instead of everyone participating in the validating process\u200a\u2014\u200awhich can be incredibly limiting in terms of transaction speed\u200a\u2014\u200athose who hold ONT tokens can vote for delegates. These delegates maintain the network for everyone.Ontology will also provide customizable consensus mechanisms so as to provide users with more flexibility such as PoW and traditional PoS models.\u201cOntology will at first be based on the NEO-like dBFT model, however, Ontology will provide different consensus algorithms such as POW, POS, dBFT, OCE, and so on. In addition, organizations can choose their preferred consensus nodes to run their own ONTX network and use chain interoperability to interact with entire Ontology network\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aJun\u00a0LiSmart ContractsSmart contracts, or Smaht Contracts (like Bostonian dad would say), are the foundation of any blockchain. Ontology runs the NEO Virtual Machine. Virtual Machines (VMs) are simply the programmed machines that translate code into action. When a command is written on Ethereum in Solidity, the Ethereum virtual machine translates that code into action: smart contracts. Virtual machines are not compatible across platforms. For two chains to communicate with each other, they must run each respective virtual machine. Only then can foreign code be read on both blockchains.Because Ontology runs the NEO Virtual Machine, Ontology\u2019s chain will be able to interact and understand NEO\u2019s data and smart contracts. This enables the interoperability that forms the foundation of Ontology\u2019s network. I expect Ontology to continue implementing other VMs in the future.Other Relevant\u00a0DetailsHydraDAO\u200a\u2014\u200aAn Ontology module that acts as a foundation for developing Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. This module provides support for smart contracts, new governance models, and big data management.Distributed Data Exchange Protocol\u200a\u2014\u200aOntology provides a framework for the exchange of data between parties. By utilizing identity and support for data laws and regulations, companies can easily and safely transact data.The Ontology Token EconomicsThe Ontology Token: ONTTotal Supply: 1 BillionMarketcap: Pre ICO\u200a\u2014\u200athus unknownToken Distribution: Ontology is not hosting an ICO. Jun Li quoted ICO regulation as the primary reason; \u201cToken sale regulation (and for that matter crypto and blockchain regulation in general) is in its early stages worldwide. We didn\u2019t want having a token sale to affect possible future partnership opportunities anywhere.\u201dCurrently, only community members who contribute extensively to Ontology will be able to receive an allocation. In addition, everyone who signed up early on Ontology\u2019s website will receive a free 1,000 airdropped tokens.In addition to the regulatory concerns around an ICO, I think Ontology really wants to facilitate community involvement. The Ecosystem White Paper really highlights their dedication to encouraging collective collaboration and I think that this fundraising model supports that vision.RoadMap and upcoming developmentsOntology recently released their Ecosystem White Paper. Currently, Ontology also has their Technical and Introductory White Paper. At some point during the remainder of Q1, 2018, Ontology will also release their roadmap, Governance White Paper, and will introduce their TestNet on GitHub.Jun Li is the quarterbackThe TeamIn terms of numbers, Ontology could likely field an entire football team. The team is spearheaded by founder Jun Li, Senior Blockchain Technology Professional, Honglei Cong, and Ning Hu, Senior Protocol Architect.Jun Li: With a background in computer science and engineering, he has a wealth of experience in technical development and Fintech.Honglei Cong: Cong has experience in distributed systems and decentralized consensus algorithm design. He has work experience at Cisco and EMC, and has designed blockchain architecture design for large business groups. He led a team that won won second place in Hyperledger\u2019s Asia Hackathon.Ning Hu: Hu worked on Project Halo, a Paul Allen project. With a background in Semantic Web development, Hu has worked on projects regarding digitization of government affairs, gaming platforms, and media streaming.Ontology also boasts a development team of over 20 engineers.Concerns and considerationsMy biggest red flags revolve around the difficulty of implementing Ontology\u2019s vision. It\u2019s a project of enormous scale and will surely encounter technical difficulties and obstacles. However, with support from NEO and backing from Onchain, I think Ontology\u2019s experienced development team is in a strong position to deliver.In addition, it will be important to watch how Ontology succeeds in competing with emerging DLT projects such as EOS and Hashgraph.For me, it\u2019s a question of when, not if, Google enters the blockchain spaceAnother concern is if companies like Google were to begin offering Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) for businesses. With their infrastructure and money, these companies would be difficult competition in this space. It is possible that Ontology could cooperate with Google, providing the modules for BaaS, but I think that would be unlikely.SummaryRome wasn\u2019t built in a day and nor will our future decentralized economy. Blockchain enthusiasts promote the benefits of blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200adecentralization, immutability, security\u200a\u2014\u200awithout considering the complicated barriers inhibiting corporate and institutional adoption. But with many of these institutions, blockchain won\u2019t replace, it will integrate. Ontology is an integration facilitator.With issuable trust, verifiable identity, and customizable modules, businesses on Ontology can construct blockchain solutions that adhere to their current framework. Ontology provides the trust for a decentralized ecosystem and without trust, there will be no adoption. As much as my libertarian idealism desires anonymity and for the mass decentralization of power, we must take one step at a time. And step one is supporting projects that work within current frameworks.If Ontology realizes its vision of a smart ecosystem and NEO fulfills its goal of creating a smart economy, we may finally see a network of businesses, institutions, schools and hospitals, all supported by distributed ledger technology. That\u2019s a future I can get behind.FOLLOW me on Twitter: @noamlevenson", "responses": "10"}, {"title": "Interest For Blockchain Has Waned.

Here\u2019s Why Blockchain Is Still Destined For\u00a0SuccessFST NetworkBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 21, 2018Despite all of the hype in the media that blockchain has been receiving recently, according to a recent report by Gartner, the world\u2019s leading research and advisory firm, it appears that overall interest in blockchain from investors and enthusiasts alike has begun to wane. Specifically, the report stated interest has passed its highest peak and started to deteriorate.Yet, while this may seem both surprising and disheartening, in this article, we will discuss why this should not be a cause for alarm for any and all members of the blockchain community. The ecosystem, and the momentous potential of the technology that makes it up, will be just fine. Here are the reasons why, plus what our team at FST Network is doing to help address the issue.This Is The Life Cycle For All Groundbreaking TechnologiesThe method of measurement Gartner used for this particular study is known as the Hype Cycle. Within the Hype Cycle, the typical trajectory of interest goes through a handful of distinct phases: technology trigger, then the peak of inflated expectations, next the trough of disillusionment (where blockchain currently sits), the slope of enlightenment, and lastly the plateau of productivity.It\u2019s important to note that after the trough of disillusionment comes a revival of interest and sustained utility, which are captured in the last two phases mentioned above. Thus, the fact interest has [waned] should not be discouraging by any means because this is precisely what happens for all innovative, groundbreaking technologies which hit the marketplace. First come the innovators who invented the technology along with the enthusiasts who are early adopters of it. Next, as traction builds for the technology in general, the media usually grabs a hold of it, and before you know it, the innovation is now mainstream.All this causes overblown hysteria and hype for the technology, resulting in speculative investing, which makes investment returns swing the other way as the market corrects itself. The trough of disillusionment is only a phase, and one that will be over soon enough.The Technology Already Has a Great Deal of Practical UsesBlockchain technology isn\u2019t just virtual kittens and digital currency for video games. Instead, despite blockchain still being young, the amount of practical uses and positive benefits the technology has to offer alone will make it endure this phase of the Hype Cycle. Whether it\u2019s giving lightning-speed internet access to citizens of third world countries, ensuring land owners stay protected against corrupt governments trying to seize their property, or something else entirely, it\u2019s clear blockchain has potential to better the lives of individuals around the globe.The same cannot be said yet for other technologies that have also entered the trough of disillusionment phase, such as AI (artificial intelligence), IoT (internet of things) and VR (virtual reality). These technologies, while certainly forward-thinking in nature and replete with possibilities, have acted more as novelty items since their inception than practical tools that solve real-world problems.What Needs to Happen to Fix the\u00a0ProblemIf blockchain wants to continue to garner the attention and fascination of investors and the public alike, then the industry must become less volatile. The unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency and blockchain space is the main hurdle standing in the way of widespread investing and mainstream adoption of the technology as a whole.The way to solve this problem is rooted in traditional economics: in order to decrease volatility within a particular marketplace, the number of buyers and sellers trading within that marketplace must increase. No matter if you are examining markets in traditional venues like Wall Street, or emerging spaces like cryptocurrency, without a high volume of people actively trading, turbulence will always be a harsh reality.What We\u2019re Doing to\u00a0HelpAs it stands today, becoming tokenized and active in the blockchain ecosystem is an undertaking which is still extremely difficult from a logistical, financial and technical standpoint. By making this process easier for people from all walks of life, the number of people who are active in the space will inevitably increase, facilitating stability as laid out in the point above.Here at FST Network, our modularized, user-friendly platform makes becoming involved in blockchain easier than ever before. By bringing scalable, seamless solutions to entrepreneurs everywhere, we believe our product can truly make a difference in the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.

We\u2019ve seen blockchain shoehorned into almost every type of business\u200a\u2014\u200afrom online marketplaces, to dating websites, to discount cards. The blockchain ecosystem is beginning to sound like a particularly bad startup pitch competition.\u2018We\u2019re airbnb but with blockchain!\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200abeetoken\u2018We\u2019re grocery delivery with our own cryptocurrency!\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aufoodo\u2018We take a perfectly legitimate business and mangle it until we can somehow justify having our own token!\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aaeronIt seems like common knowledge that the vast majority of companies are not leading the cryptocurrency disruptive charge, but capitalizing on it.In his article \u2018Ten years in, nobody has come up with a use for blockchain\u2019, Kai Stinchcombe argues:After years of tireless effort and billions of dollars invested, nobody has actually come up with a use for the blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200abesides currency speculation and illegal transactions.At Coin and Crypto we\u2019re a little more optimistic about the future of blockchain technology. For the past year, a single use case has dominated and grown exponentially. Funding new companies has never been easier. Investing in companies has never been easier.The blockchain is fundamentally changing the way people invest in companies. We could very well be looking at the next incarnation of the stock market.Is this a pipe dream or the not so distant\u00a0future?Disrupting the stock market is an ambitious but not unheard of goal. Eric Reis, startup legend and writer of The Lean Startup, plans to disrupt the stock market with his latest venture. His leap into this space has backing by major players such as Marc Andreesen and Tim O\u2019Reilly. This lends weight to the idea that stock markets are not immune to new challengers.But could the cryptocurrency market be one of these challengers? It is clear that for many people crypto trading fulfills the same niche as investing in stocks.Profit. In the simplest terms investors buy a coin because they believe it will go up. Investors buy stocks for the same reason.Ownership. Cryptocurrency acts as a metaphor for ownership of a company or commodity in the same way stocks do.Motivation. Cryptocurrency incentivizes founding teams and employees to grow a company in the same way equity does.A common colloquialism is that disruptors in a space need to be 10x better than existing alternatives to succeed. What advantages does a stock market based on cryptocurrency tokens have?The cryptocurrency market allows for truly global investments.Investing directly in stocks outside of your home country is a painstaking and high-friction process.Countries may impose limits in how much can be invested in a foreign exchange. There may be extra taxes that are applied to foreign investments. Getting access to a foreign stock market in the first place can include a string of middle men and brokers. And the entire process has to be navigated independently for each country.Even if you successfully figure out how to invest in your favorite company in Italy, expect to face an entirely different process for investing in the Malaysian market.In contrast, investing in companies through ICOs or cryptocurrency exchanges is effortlessly global. Portfolios easily boast coins with foundations or companies all over the world from Singapore (Qtum, Tron) to the Argentina (Decentraland).Country statistics from https://icobench.com/statsICObench, a company that lists and rates initial coin offerings, showcases listings from 70 different countries. Investors are no longer restricted by lines on a map.The cryptocurrency market allows investing in early stage companies.The same lack of regulation that allows investors to participate globally also confers other benefits. In many countries laws and regulations prevent all but the very rich from investing in early stage companies.In North America to be allowed to participate in company prior to their listing on the stock exchange you need to become an accredited investor. This means proving you have a net worth greater than one million dollars (excluding your home) and an annual income greater than 200,000 dollars. In the United States of America this is only 1.2% of the population.And just being an accredited investor is not enough to get you to the table. The most promising startups have investors competing to participate in their rounds. Anyone who can\u2019t throw down millions in capital isn\u2019t welcome.In the cryptocurrency market there are no such restrictions on early investors. If you have $50 and access to a computer you can invest in an early stage company. For the first time investors who can just afford to spend $500 or $1000 can attempt to pick out the next facebook or google.This has its own problems\u200a\u2014\u200ainvesting regulations were put in place to protect consumers from risks and scams, but for many investors the exclusionary regulations seem outdated and overbearing.The cryptocurrency market doesn\u2019t restrict day or pattern\u00a0traders.Another regulation sidestepped by the cryptocurrency market is the baffling restriction placed on day traders in some countries. In the United States, day traders who have less than $25,000 in their account will have their accounts frozen if they make more than 4 trades a week.This rule was put in place as a protectionary measure. $25,000 is the supposed magic number that deliminates sophisticated investors from amateurs. These rules seem unfair to many who feel they should have the same right to participate in trading regardless of their account balances.What are the largest disadvantages?Despite holding some advantages over traditional stock markets, the cryptocurrency market is not on a path to victory just yet. There are major obstacles it faces before it supplants the existing infrastructure.One of its key advantages\u200a\u2014\u200alack of regulation, is also one of its key disadvantages. Wild fluctuations, scams, trade spoofing, and insider trading are all unfortunate realities of an unregulated marketplace.Assuming we move to decentralized exchanges (and companies like Kyber Network and Loopring are working to make this a reality) it will be increasingly difficult for governments to regulate the trading of cryptocurrency.Assuming we can overcome these obstacles\u200a\u2014\u200ahow can we validate this prediction?If the crypto market is really the next iteration for the stock market what can we expect to see in one, two and five years?In the past year we\u2019ve seen promising steps in the direction of legitimizing cryptocurrency markets. Institutions dedicated to the stock market have started dealing with the cryptocurrency markets as well.Banking heavyweight Morgan Stanley estimated that 2 billion dollars were poured into crypto from hedge funds over the last year.TraderView, a social community and tools for stock traders, has listed many major cryptocurrency pairs on its site.Weiss index, a company which assigns letter grades to stocks, posted it\u2019s first cryptocurrency rankings.And Robinhood, an app that has brought stock trading to a new generation of investors, announced plans to start offering ethereum and bitcoin on its platform.2017 also saw major companies launch their own cryptocurrencies. Kik, a Canadian chat giant launched a 97 million dollar ICO in August.Overstock followed suit in December raising 100 million dollars for its OSTK token. Their token is a security and registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.Kodak, a household name in cameras and photography, announced it\u2019s plans to hold an ICO.Where we need to go\u00a0next.If trends in this industry hold true we should expect to see more public companies follow suit in the upcoming years. This could be aided by clearer laws on what is and is not classed as a security\u200a\u2014\u200aand more countries like Singapore, Estonia, and Gibraltar welcoming companies who seek to hold ICOs.Moving from stocks to tokens will be encouraged by the large number of young investors (the primary demographic involved with trading cryptocurrencies) that choose cryptocurrency markets over traditional stock markets. Over time it will become common practice to launch securities on the blockchain.A vision of the\u00a0futureIt\u2019s 2025. The cryptocurrency market is the largest investment market in the world. General motors has a GM token, Apple has an AppleCoin, and Google has a token called XYZ. Early stage companies face unprecedented access to seed funding, spawning a new burst of innovation and technology. The majority of new investors trade in cryptocurrency and nothing else. Stock markets around the world have begun to slide into obscurity.Is this a moonshot speculation? Maybe. The stock market is a large and ancient institution. But disruption of the financial sector has long been a rallying cry of blockchain enthusiasts. Until recently we\u2019ve been focussed on currency and banking. Maybe it\u2019s time we look at stocks and investment?The market has rallied behind the idea of investing in commodities and shares through blockchain tokens. We\u2019ll watch eagerly to see if this trend keeps up in 2018.Enjoy this article? We have a Telegram Signal group\u00a0now!We post simple and effective trading signals.

We use certificates as a way to recognize contributions we value, or simply to signal membership in the Media Lab family. For example, in July we issued coins and certificates to all of the Media Lab Director\u2019s Fellows. The coins are physical representations of digital certificates (see below).Designing an Open Platform for Digital CertificatesCertificates are signals of achievement or membership and some are more important than others. University degrees (a particular type of certificate) can help you get the job you want, or prevent you from getting it if you don\u2019t have the right certificate. Our current, mostly analog system for managing certificates is slow, complicated, and unreliable. There are many advantages for creating a digital infrastructure for certificates, but the stakes are high since such a system could grow to represent our professional reputations. We need to be thoughtful about its design, and the type of institutions we trust to govern it.The Journeymen History of CertificatesWhen we lived in small tight-knit communities, people knew whom they could turn to when they needed an expert (and whom to avoid). However, as we started moving around more and our lives and networks grew, we needed to come up with portable ways to signal our expertise to new acquaintances. Some of these original systems are still in place. For example, in Germany many carpenters still do an apprenticeship tour that lasts no less than three years and one day. They carry a small book in which they collect stamps and references from the master carpenters with whom they work along the way. The carpenter\u2019s traditional (and now hipster) outfit, the book of stamps they carry, and\u200a\u2014\u200aif all goes well\u200a\u2014\u200athe certificate of acceptance into the carpenter guild are proof that here is a man or woman you can trust to build your house.\u201cWandergeselle 02\u201d by Sigismund von Dobsch\u00fctz\u200a\u2014\u200aCC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikipedia CommonsIdeally we should be in charge of our own credentials, similar to the journeymen carpenters who carry around their books of stamps and references. But most of the time we have to rely on third parties, such as universities or employers to store, verify, and validate our credentials. Job seekers have to request official transcripts from their alma maters (and typically pay a small fee), and employers still need to call the university if they want to be sure that a transcript wasn\u2019t faked. It\u2019s a slow and complicated process, which is one reason why degree fraud is a real issue. (A few years back, even our very own MIT Admissions office realized that its Dean didn\u2019t actually have the undergraduate degree that she had listed in her application). Making certificates transferable and more easily verifiable is one advantage of digital systems.\u201cWanderbuch\u201d by Magistrate der K\u00f6nigl. Freystadt Oedenburg im K\u00f6nigreiche Ungarn / Public\u00a0DomainAn Open Platform for ReputationThe trail of credentials and achievements that we generate throughout our lives says something about who we are, and it can open doors that allow us to become who we want to be. Some credentials, such as university degrees, are more important than others. But at the end of the day, all of these credentials represent experiences that are part of our lives.There are many advantages for recipients to have more control over the certificates they earn. Being in control doesn\u2019t mean it would be easy to lie. Similar to the carpenter\u2019s book of references, it should not be possible to just rip out a few pages without anyone noticing. But being in control means having a way to save credentials, to carry them around with us, and to share them with an employer if we chose to do so (without having to pay, or ask for the issuer\u2019s permission or cooperation).In order to make that happen we need an open platform for digital certificates and reputation. Using the blockchain and strong cryptography, it is now possible to create a certification infrastructure that puts us in control of the full record of our achievements and accomplishments. It will allow us to share a digital degree with an employer while giving the employer complete trust that the degree was in fact issued to the person presenting it.This is exciting because it is not only a better way to deal with the way certificates work today, but it is also an opportunity to think about what certificates may look like in the future. A few years ago, I co-authored a white paper on digital badges (just another name for certificates) in which we set out some of these core ideas. What was missing at the time was the technical infrastructure that would let us reliably store and manage the certificates. Enter the blockchain.The blockchain is best known for its connection to the cryptocurrency bitcoin. But in essence it is a just a distributed ledger to record transactions. What makes it special is that it is durable, time-stamped, transparent, and decentralized. Those characteristics are equally useful for managing financial transactions, as for a system of reputation. In fact you can think of reputation as a type of currency for social capital, rather than financial capital.How It\u00a0WorksIssuing a certificate is relatively simple: we create a digital file that contains some basic information such as the name of the recipient, the name of the issuer (MIT Media Lab), an issue date, etc. We then sign the contents of the certificate using a private key to which only the Media Lab has access, and append that signature to the certificate itself. Next we create a hash, which is a short string that can be used to verify that nobody has tampered with the content of the certificate. And finally we use our private key again to create a record on the Bitcoin blockchain that states we issued a certain certificate to a certain person on a certain date. Our system makes it possible to verify who a certificate was issued to, by whom, and validate the content of the certificate itself.What\u2019s Next?We will continue to develop our software tools and issue certificates to members of the Media Lab community. We will also start releasing software under an open source license so that others can review it, extend and improve our work, or just learn from it. And we are collaborating with MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative to explore some of the privacy implications and technical infrastructure questions.In addition, we are actively looking for collaborators to build out a few example implementations outside the Media Lab. Areas in which digital certificates provide exciting opportunities include:Corporate/ enterprise training\u200a\u2014\u200aMany large companies offer a myriad of training opportunities to their employees, but they lack systems to reliably track and store the results. Existing HR systems are often monolithic and don\u2019t talk to other corporate databases, there are no consistent ways to compare skills, and accomplishments are not portable.Workforce development\u200a\u2014\u200aThere are millions of apprenticeship records and certificates, but no systems to manage them. This is especially an issue for the 36M adults in the US with low skills, who often lack other more recognized diplomas or degrees.Interested in learning more?

Everybody and their cousin began to believe that blockchain was going to disrupt every industry, change the face of the earth, and make obscure ICO investors millions in the process.This hype and excitement around cryptocurrencies led people to believe some crazy things about blockchain technology and what it can actually do.Many people now have the wrong impression about the potential of this technology, and believe it\u2019s something that it isn\u2019t.As I\u2019ve discussed before, a blockchain is just a database structure with some distinctive features.It allows multiple parties to record and share information on a database in real time, and not need to trust each other, as they are incentivised to do the right thing through tokens/coins.These features are clearly highly specific, and are therefore only really useful under a certain set of circumstances.For instance, they\u2019re brilliant when used for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, since the blockchain behind Bitcoin allows people to send money to anyone else, anywhere in the world cheaply, and without the need for a bank or other intermediary.However, blockchains aren\u2019t actually suitable for every kind of data storage, and certainly shouldn\u2019t be used as the solution to a problem nobody had.In this article I\u2019ll break down 10 things blockchain and its applications (like Bitcoin) aren\u2019t, from both the haters as well as the over-enthusiastic (in no particular order):1. Bitcoin isn\u2019t the biggest scam in history, it isn\u2019t rat poison, and it isn\u2019t\u00a0dead.Some of the biggest names in finance came out swinging against Bitcoin in 2017, including Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, as well as JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Bitcoin and the blockchain it is based on\u200a\u2014\u200alike every early-stage technology\u200a\u2014\u200ahas its flaws.The proof-of-work consensus mechanism uses mind-boggling amounts of electricity, and many people are taking advantage of the system for speculation and illegal activities.But saying the technology will fail purely because of these flaws is kind of like saying in 1995 that the internet won\u2019t work because it\u2019s clunky and unorganised.Bitcoin has been going strong for 10 years despite being pronounced deadhundreds of times over.It might seem dodgy on the surface, but in the words of Naval Ravikant:\u201cBitcoin is a tool for freeing humanity from oligarchs and tyrants, dressed up as a get-rich-quick scheme.\u201d\u00a0- Naval Ravikant on TwitterFocusing on the negatives of this technology and calling Bitcoin a fraud is to be completely ignorant of what it actually enables us to do.2. Blockchain isn\u2019t a way to increase your company\u2019s stock\u00a0priceKodak, Long Island Iced Tea and On-line Plc are all notable examples of companies adding \u2018blockchain\u2019 to their name and watching their stock price soar, without a single blockchain in sight.3. Blockchain isn\u2019t a ponzi\u00a0schemeUnless you bought into PonziCoin, which was literally a ponzi scheme.And don\u2019t even get me started on Bitconnect.4. Cryptocurrency isn\u2019t just for\u00a0scammersSure, there are plenty of well documented cases of crypto hacks and scams, and it\u2019s an area of great concern for the industry.As I\u2019ve discussed before, the anonymity afforded by blockchain tech is what enables these scammers and hackers.But it\u2019s an unfortunate side effect of the technology, not the point of it.Terrorist groups like ISIS use social media to find new recruits, that doesn\u2019t mean we have to give up Facebook and Twitter.Pablo Escobar made so many American Dollars that he would burn them just to keep his daughter warm. The whole drug industry is run on cash. Does that make cash bad?5. Blockchain isn\u2019t a way for your non-blockchain startup to raise\u00a0moneyJust because you saw a no-name company ICO and raise millions off an idea alone doesn\u2019t mean you can or should too.The point of an ICO is to distribute tokens to potential users that incentivise them to use your blockchain. The tokens are eventually supposed to do something. If your startup has nothing to do with blockchain, then you have no need for tokens, so don\u2019t even think about using it to raise money.6. Blockchain isn\u2019t going to revolutionise your\u00a0businessUnless your business needs all of the benefits that a blockchain provides, you will be no better off storing your data on one.7. Blockchain isn\u2019t going to disrupt every\u00a0industryEver heard the saying \u201cit\u2019s like Uber for (X industry)\u201d. Well that has made its way into the blockchain sphere, with companies literally trying to create Uber for blockchain among other things.The small problem with this approach is that not every industry needs blockchain.So you don\u2019t like Uber\u2019s business practices, and think the solution\u200a\u2014\u200arather than just using Lyft\u200a\u2014\u200ais the blockchain?A decentralised, peer-to-peer ridesharing network does sound pretty sexy.But that completely overlooks all the reasons why blockchain is a terrible way to organise ride sharing.By definition, there is no central authority governing a public blockchain, so who makes decisions in this distributed company?What about dispute resolution? Once data has been uploaded and verified, it\u2019s not going anywhere. Got charged for a ride you didn\u2019t take? Driver did something really bad that you need to report? Well too bad because nobody is listening.What about development? How is a distributed company with nobody in charge supposed to compete with one of the most highly-funded startups in history with a well-established market?Even if a decentralised Uber could overcome everything stacked against it and create a working service, how much better than Uber would it really be?Uber (and other centralised ride sharing apps) work pretty well right now. The alternative just isn\u2019t that much better.The potential benefit of putting many existing industries on the blockchain just isn\u2019t high enough to make users change their behaviour.8. Blockchain isn\u2019t a way to make sacrifices to\u00a0CthulhuThe less said about this the better.9. Blockchain isn\u2019t a platform for\u00a0memesDogecoin is the most well known meme coin, which forked from Bitcoin in 2013 as a joke, and proceeded to hit a $2b valuation in 2017.10. Blockchain isn\u2019t\u00a0useless.Unless your token is literally useless.So what is it\u00a0then?Even though I\u2019ve outlined all the things blockchains shouldn\u2019t be used for, there are still cases where blockchain is the perfect application.Let\u2019s take a look at the conditions that call for a blockchain:A shared, \u2018add-only\u2019 databaseMultipe writersAbsence of trustThe need to remove an intermediaryConsensus & validationAs it happens, money fits perfectly into this category. Applications like Bitcoin fulfill all of these criteria, and are therefore a fantastic application of blockchain tech.Unfortunately, as of 2018, there haven\u2019t really been many other proven, mass-market applications for blockchains.That isn\u2019t to say there never will be, we just haven\u2019t found them yet.And that\u2019s the point of this article: blockchain isn\u2019t a useless technology, but neither is it the saviour of your business, the economy and humanity as a whole.We need to all be aware of the true potential of this technology and plan for what it can realistically achieve.", "responses": "24"}, {"title": "A New World-Class Crypto Exchange: A Cross-blockchain Crypto Exchange with P2P Fiat Conversion Function", "author_name": "Kryptono Exchange", "link": "https://medium.com/@kryptono/a-new-world-class-crypto-exchange-88c27ae88b6d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 19, 2018", "readtime": "15 min read", "upvotes": "3.3K", "content": "A New World-Class Crypto Exchange: A Cross-blockchain Crypto Exchange with P2P Fiat Conversion FunctionKryptono ExchangeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 19, 2018https://kryptono.exchange1. PreambleAt the time of this Whitepaper, more than 200 crypto exchanges already exist around the world. Some focus only on crypto-to-crypto trades, while others focus on crypto-to-fiat trades. While each exchange category serves its users well, there are inherent limitations and weaknesses in each category. The crypto-to-crypto exchange category is faster and low cost in nature, offering many crypto-pairs, and allowing users to trade at ease. However, during times of market volatility, as it is the case in the past few months, existing users who face difficulty converting cryptocurrencies to fiat in a timely fashion (cashing out) will see their portfolio values drop significantly and those who have fiat find it difficult to take advantage of cheap cryptocurrencies for buying opportunity (cashing in). On the other hand, the crypto-to-fiat exchange category typically offers only limited number of cryptocurrencies that users can buy/sell. In addition to the numerous restrictions imposed by these exchanges, the amount of fiat a user can buy/sell is also often limited to small to moderate amount. Other major issues with these categories exchanges are: (1) the lack of proper security procedures and processes in place to safeguard users\u2019 assets; and (2) the lack of systematic and machine intelligence systems to prevent the price manipulation of illiquid cryptocurrencies in order to safeguard user\u2019s portfolio\u2019s values.The Kryptono Exchange [1] is created to address these shortfalls.Kryptono (a.k.a. Krypto NOW or Crypto NOW) will be a new world-class crypto exchange that places an emphasis on security and protection of users\u2019 assets. It has the advantages of a crypto-to-crypto exchange (i.e. fast and seamless user experience) and also allows users to trade cryptocurrencies and fiat via a peer-to-peer network supported by Kryptono. This is how we hope to bring crypto finance to the next level and to the masses.2. About Kryptono ExchangeAt Kryptono Exchange, we strongly believe in creating a seamless and thoughtful user experience when it comes to trading cryptocurrencies. We believe the following elements will be crucial: (i) speedy and intuitive user graphical interface (ii) world class security measures to protect user\u2019s assets (iii) transparency of the accounting system for users to track account deposits and balances (iv) organized and responsive customer service and (v) robust measures to prevent price manipulation of ill-liquid cryptocurrencies.Figure 1: Trading History Screenshot.Having these objectives in mind, the Kryptono Exchange is designed with the following technical features:Architecture: All components of the Kryptono Exchange will be built to scale to infinite traffic and workload using parallel computing technology and architecture. The workload and traffic will be distributed uniformly to servers in data centers across the world. For instance, on a top machine, our single price matching engine can reach 3.5 million orders per second. Since these engines are working in parallel, if we were to carry 1000 pairs of cryptocurrencies (within a theoretical limit), we can reach up to 3.5 billion orders per second using 1000 servers working in parallel. These load balancing operations are run automatically without the need for rewriting and re-deploying the software.Security: Kryptono manages crypto assets based on 2 tiers. The first tier is the AI-based fraud detection and prevention system for detecting frauds and manipulation. The second tier is the multi-level and multi-sig actions with human monitoring for large amounts of crypto withdrawal, a process similar to banking systems. Account access will require 2-factor authentication (2FA) with either SMS or Google Authenticator to prevent unauthorized entry. We will also require email confirmation in addition to 2FA for any withdrawal to give users a final chance to review the withdrawal and also to prevent unauthorized transactions. Industry best practices will be adopted to secure users\u2019 data and infrastructure according to ISO/IEC 27001, and the CryptoCurrency Security Standard. We realize that security tends to be inversely proportional to convenience. Hence, we believe that this measure will strike a balance between convenience, and providing adequate protection of user\u2019s assets in preventing fraud and generating trust in the system.Figure 2: our AI-based system for fraud detection and prevention with respect to the price manipulation.Customer Support: Our customer support portal will be designed to be fully integrated with the Zendesk support. Each issue reported will be processed and resolved with a ticket ID via email, and if necessary, through phone calls. Users will be able to see all of their tickets organized for easy management. Our customer support will be provided 24/7 with English, Korean, Chinese, and Vietnamese languages as a start. We will also deploy Artificial Intelligent (AI)-based price manipulation prevention systems for illiquid cryptocurrencies to help protect the users\u2019 portfolio value.AI-Based Price Watching System: We also deploy Artificial Intelligent-based price manipulation prevention systems for illiquid cryptocurrencies to help protect the users\u2019 portfolio value.Peer-to-peer Crypto-Fiat Conversion System: Please see section 3 for more info.Supported Cryptocurrencies: We will support cryptocurrencies across various blockchains such as ETH, BTC, USDT, and ERC20/ERC223 tokens.Regulatory and KYC/AML compliance: We believe in financial transparency. Traders and users will be subject to and required to pass our KYC/AML policy. It is also our aim to obtain the relevant exchange licenses where required.API support: Open API for 3rd party automatic trading will be provided. The API will allow traders and third parties to build trading programs according to their desires. We wish to become a platform for ordinary to professional investors and large institutional investors alike. We believe that API support will help bring investors from the equity markets to the crypto markets, hence potentially providing the crypto community with better liquidity.Multi-language support: Kryptono website and app will support multi-languages such as English, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, etc.Device support: Kryptono will support web browsers and major platforms such as iOS (subject to App Store approval) and Android.Figure 3: Account system with built-in security and KYC levels.Figure 4: Customer support page integrated with Zendesk for managing issues via tickets3. Peer-to-Peer Crypto-FiatTo boost convenience and liquidity, Kryptono also provides peer-to-peer crypto-fiat trading features, which allows users to trade any cryptocurrency listed on our exchange for fiat with other users within the Kryptono network. For added security, the Kryptono platform will keep the crypto on escrow while the buyer transfers the fiat directly to the seller. We believe that this function will be very helpful in lowering the entry barrier of traditional equity investors to crypto/ICO investments. This allows global market access with local trading for crypto traders.Currently, the bank accounts of the buyer and seller must be within the same country (i.e. trades are limited to domestic money transfers) to ensure ease of trading with respect to the speed and convenience, as well as customer support. We are also exploring the possibility of cross border transfers in the near future.During the peer-to-peer trading process, we will allow the buyer and seller to communicate directly with each other via our messaging system. The contents of the communications and the trade contract created by both seller and buyer will be archived in the event of potential disputes. When a dispute arises, our customer service team will step in to assist the disputing parties. This innovative peer-2-peer feature of ours is being prepared for a U.S. patent application. Upon the filing of the application, more details about this feature will be published.4. Kryptono Token\u200a\u2014\u200athe KNOW TokenWe will issue a fixed amount of 1 billion KNOW tokens (aka K NOW\u200a\u2014\u200aan ERC223 token with 10 decimal places) to incentivize the community to build a great crypto ecosystem. KNOW token will be used to pay for the transaction fees on the Kryptono Exchange, along with ETH and BTC, but at a discounted rate. The initial price is set at USD0.10 and will be traded publicly on our exchange. More information about our token can be found on our smart contract code [2] and the address at 0xb41f09a973a85c7F497c10B00a939dE667B55a78. There will be no ICO for KNOW.Figure 5: the KNOW\u00a0TokenThe KNOW tokens will be distributed as follows:15% will be given away to users on our platform, partners, and bounty programs.40% will be sold on the Kryptono exchange over time for traders to buy to pay for transaction fees. Transaction fees will be used primarily to pay for continued software platform development and maintenance, operational costs, business development and marketing.10% will be sold to private funds for strategic partnerships20% will be for management and advisors.15% will be reserved for employees and future expansion.5. Cross-Blockchain ExchangeOur support for cross-blockchain coins/tokens will make Kryptono Exchange a comprehensive exchange solution. Tokens from different blockchains will be traded seamlessly on the Kryptono Exchange.6. XPAD: The Launching Platform for Great ICO ProjectsXPAD is a platform for helping community projects with great and innovative ideas to launch their ICO projects. XPAD will have a community of fully vested and screened investors ready to participate in any ICO launch on XPAD. We will also have a team of experts to conduct thorough due diligence on the projects hosted on XPAD.7. Revenue SourcesOur revenue will come from transaction fees incurred on the platform (trading, listing, and XPAD service). Our mission is to bring crypto to the masses. We do not plan to charge more than 0.1% for crypto-to-crypto trades and 1% for peer-to-peer trades (the latter of which is more expensive as it involves more manual work and human intervention via customer services). To the best of our knowledge, this proposed fee schedule is about 50% less than what is currently charged by other leading exchanges.Users will also receive a discount when using KNOW to pay for transaction fees. Fees relating to trading, listing, XPAD services and bot trading via API usage will be published online on May 30 at the following website:https://kryptono.exchange/fees.html8. Future Work\u200a\u2014\u200aNew Blockchain Integration for Fast Payment ProcessingWe are also in the process of developing a blockchain that aims to: (1) confirm transactions at speeds comparable to the VISA/MASTERCARD networks; and (2) allow anyone with a PC or MAC to become a miner in the form of screen-saver applications using the parallel computing technology we developed in-house. This ensures the true decentralization of the blockchain network. Such mining feature has been tested on the Ethereum Ropsten Testnet [3] as a poll of PCs working together and has been successfully mined ETH and confirmed blocks.Together with the Kryptono Exchange, we aim to bring blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to the masses, serving ordinary citizens for their everyday needs.9. TimelineThe Kryptono Exchange will be released based on the following schedule:May 1, 2018: Open for account registration and KYC on https://kryptono.exchange. Early adopters will receive free KNOW tokens after completing basic KYC checks. Trading will be by-invite only.June 1, 2018: Open to the public for trading.

And rightly so, as there is no reason why anyone in their right mind would want to deviate from traditional systems if this is greeting them on the other side.As a result, the first (and most simple) infrastructure improvement necessary for blockchain systems is\u2026.. the creation of a user experience that doesn\u2019t mention blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aor cryptocurrency for that matter.It is now more important than ever to disassociate user experience language from \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 and \u2018blockchain\u2019 as they both serve as adoption buffers that cause user trepidation of false risk.Glancing at the above photo from the perspective of someone who has never interacted with the technology before can largely explain why there is a perception of volatility and exclusivity to these platforms, which hampers mainstream adoption for those simply looking for another asset class to use or invest in.Adding to this motif comes a demand for the creation of tools that allow for easy and secure private key management, more akin to the convenience of managing common day passwords.The importance of being able to interact with a blockchain without ever seeing a key is massively understated, as the creation of systems that allow users to gain value without requiring knowledge is essential to the widespread adoptability of these platforms.Another key \u201cbridge\u201d required alongside user-centric infrastructure is the need for organic, frictionless custodial services, especially for non-commercial consumers. When logging onto services like Coinbase the user experience often coincides with a distinct feeling of \u201cinvestment-platform\u201d navigation, with inherent design and messaging that conflates purchase of cryptocurrencies with the purchase of securities.Instead, exchanges should promote unencumbered access to assets like stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies that are more culturally akin to what consumers are used to dealing with in finance\u200a\u2014\u200aa relatively good store of value.\u25fc Bridge 2: A Centralized Solution to Interoperability, Scalability, and LiquidityIdeally, with the creation of user-friendly interfaces we now have something that anyone can use and manage, and we can open the doors for people to begin using it.Now, what\u2019s the problem?Well, first and most importantly there is an immediate demand for scalability that can withstand high volumes of user adoption.The fact and the matter in today\u2019s blockchain ecosystem is that the path towards long-term, complete decentralization is often started with the creation of a hybridized service; able to leverage the scalable features of central solutions and the accountability mechanisms of decentralized networks (like blockchains).Once hybridized solutions are developed, the beginnings of a scalable platform begin to appear, upon which systems would need the following:Interoperable standards that allow for user activity across supporting blockchains and decentralized applicationsFriendly marketing language to incentivize legacy players to join the systemPortable reputation systems for people, contracts, and exchanges to ensure honest behaviour and accountabilityLiquidity accessible to the public, to allow users the ability to easily purchase cryptocurrencies (like stablecoins) and onboard into the blockchain community with low riskSeen in practice:For example, say we are attempting to create a widely adopted blockchain equivalent of today\u2019s central bank. Well, for starters, as a user on this bank platform, I am going to want to be able to take my money and use it on other platforms (vs just buying cheque books or transacting with solely bank-sponsored vendors).This means being able to communicate with and transact across other applications, and even other blockchains.I also will want to have some sort of familiarity with the terminology being used when I am transacting on this platform, so I still have some awareness of what is going on in the back end of these systems.If I complete a transaction on this platform, I should expect that my transaction hashes should be akin to the format of my traditional \u2018Deposit Confirmation #s\u2019, and that the mappings of these items are made clear and apparent to me as a user.Once I hit the open market, I want to have some native mechanism in place to tell me (pseudonymously) who I am transacting with, and whether I should be worried by transacting with them.I then want to be able to pull money out of this platform whenever I see fit, so that I am not trapped in this system and disincentivized to put in significant capital.This Fiat-crypto liquidity is a massive piece of functionality that always needs to be accessible to the public. Assets like stablecoins will be a necessary step toward this direction, but there need to be standards set in place (or user experiences) that coerce one of the following:(1) that banks recognize stablecoins like DAI in a manner through which they settle liquidity between the digital currency and fiat money, and/or that startups build with stablecoin frameworks to mature how these assets are collateralized(2) that blockchain developers create ways in which fiat-to-crypto conversions occur on the backend of their applications, so that a debit card transaction can be processed on the front-end, fund converted to DAI in the backend, and then converted back into whichever currency (digital or fiat) that the seller or service desires on the other end of the transaction(3) that consumers naturally become more confident about the usage of cryptocurrencies through institutional usage. This can take shape through (a) Wall Street usage, (b) governmental acceptance (i.e accepting crypto for tax payments), or (c) redemption in global trade (i.e acceptance of crypto for carbon credits). This, however, is unlikely for the usage of stablecoins, and since the vast majority of commercial transactions take place with a recognized viable store of value, there really is no other choice than to either keep using fiat or use some bastardized CBDCWith the upcoming advent of tokenized fiat, or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), we will likely see a flurry of bank-backed and decentralized digital currencies coexisting, unless international regulations dictate that the public must used \u2018recognized\u2019 currencies in all transactions.\u25fc Bridge 3: Digital Reserves\u200a\u2014\u200ataking people out of the \u201cexchange\u201d game into the \u201cconvert\u201d gameIf we expect users to create marketplaces and move crypto or other digital assets around seamlessly we need to have a system in place that takes the arbitrage out of exchanging.Let\u2019s return to the digital bank example.If I am using this platform as a tool store and convert wealth between a number of different currencies I should not feel as if I am susceptible to losing my capital to market makers and arbitrageurs. As a crypto user I want a simple tool (i.e a bank) to exist to help me with conversions in a manner where I don\u2019t feel taken advantage of every time I transact.With upcoming innovations in reserve management, interoperability, and atomic swaps we will likely see a diversion of interactions away from the long-term holding of poorly designed utilities; thus rendering the holding value of most \u201cmedium-of-exchange\u201d tokens that are masquerading as stores of value obsolete.\u25fc Bridge 4: A Functional Stablecoin that Supports Economic\u00a0GrowthWith the above procedures in place we have taken much of the scalability and ease-of-use out of the equation\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever, we are still subject to one major area of discussion: volatility.If we expect global adoption (including crypto use from the ~50% of people in the world who are used to living on $1 a day), we need some native asset that these people can use that they can have faith in vs their native fiat currency.The process of taking those living on an income of less than $1 per day to $1 in DAI per day is not a big one, but there certainly is a problem asking users to take that dollar and place it in a more volatile digital currency that fluctuates over 10\u201315% every week.However, one core economic issue to stablecoins is that they focus so much on maintaining stability as a transactional store of value that they forget to foster mechanisms for economic growth (at least in the sense of how economic growth is generated today with the usage of moderate inflation via money creation using tools like the federal reserve and credit schemes).New age economic policy needs to be theorized to account for how we\u2019re going to redefine economic growth given the usage of stable digital currencies in a world desperate for decentralization and monopoly disruption.Leveraging the DAI system, we have the potential to see unbanked and underbanked populations diverge from the common, westernized savior mentality of \u2018banking the unbanked.\u2019With the proper trust and user experience, these new age consumers will no longer need to rely on systems that charge \u2018a cost of banking\u2019; which in turn leads to the processes of accruing savings, making transactions, and accessing integral financial services becoming simpler, fairer, and more transparent.Once platforms develop intuitive schemes for taking out loans in a stablecoin, using that stablecoin across normal vendor transactions, and, overall, integrating the use of cryptocurrency within the current, legacy system to minimize transactional friction, we\u2019ll start to see our \u2018modern\u2019 economy operationalize in ways that promote a level playing field; whereby financial services will not be issued in accordance with a predefined set of biases, but will be rather instituted based upon the pure merit of the participating parties.Standards like a portable, blockchain based FICO also need to be established in tangent to protocols like Dharma and stablecoins like DAI so that \u2018value on credit\u2019 can persist in traditional economies into the new cashless age.A Conclusion on Infrastructure ImprovementsAs we continue to explore the bridges needing to be built for widespread blockchain adoption we will find better ways to distill and generalize these concepts into actionable items.By bringing these matters into discussion we hope to see a level of \u201cproject accountability\u201d begin to develop and best practices come to fruition. In our minds, the next iteration of crypto breaking into the mainstream will come from the advent of usable tools, the leveraging of hybrid, scalable solutions, and the creation of a functional stablecoin that supports economic growth.If you are looking for more outlook from the perspectives of a VC/consultant and a social good expert check out Wesley and Robert\u2019s medium blogs\u200a\u2014\u200aand, as always, if you like what you read be sure to clap it below\u00a0:)", "responses": "17"}, {"title": "Firms need business model change, not blockchain", "author_name": "Ben Robinson", "link": "https://medium.com/aperture-hub/firms-need-business-model-change-not-blockchain-bc8b0b2466bb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 1, 2018", "readtime": "13 min read", "upvotes": "2K", "content": "Firms need business model change, not blockchainBen RobinsonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 1, 2018When Jimmy Song, a venture partner at Blockchain Capital, took to the stage at Consensus two weeks ago (wearing a black cowboy hat), he launched an attack on the blockchain-is-the-answer-to-everything mentality. He said, \u201cWhen you have a technology in search of a use, you end up with the crap that we see out there in the enterprise today.\u201dJimmy was clearly trying to be provocative and burst the bubble of blockchain fanatics, but he has a point. It\u2019s not so much about blockchain per se (although this may be where the worst offences are committed) but about the focus on technology in general. Every day we are bombarded with articles about the need to digitize or about how [Blockchain/AI/APIs/Cloud/Mobile/IoT] will transform or disrupt such and such an industry. But we forget that technology in the absence of new business models never changed anything.It wasn\u2019t the internet that transformed retail or music. It wasn\u2019t the smartphone that created Uber. Instead, it took business model change which exploited new technologies. In retail, it was the Amazon business model of one-click checkout, marketplace and next-day delivery. In music, it was the iTunes model of unbundling music to let us buy individual songs and then the Spotify rebundling model of all-you-can-listen streaming subscription service. And Uber didn\u2019t just use the smartphone to let people order cabs (as many of the incumbents did), but instead uses the power of GPS to allow anyone with a car to become a taxi driver, transforming supply in the course of transforming user convenience and experience.And so in banking we can safely predict that it won\u2019t be blockchain or APIs or AI that transform the industry. Instead, it will be new business models empowered by those technologies.Implementing technology without a clear plan risks making matters worseIn fact, we could probably go further and say that implementing new technologies without a clear idea of the future business model may make matters worse because it could well entrench existing practices.The reason for this is that these new technologies will be implemented in support of existing business models rather than in pursuit of new ones. This means\u200a\u2014\u200aas we have seen so often in banking\u200a\u2014\u200athat digital technologies are used to digitize analogue products, rather than reinventing them for the digital age. But, it means more importantly that these technologies will be used to double-down on scale.The industrial economy was all abou scale. Once a company had come up with a winning product, the challenge was to exploit economies of scale as fully as possible. This allowed unit costs to be minimized and allowed firms to undercut rivals, seeing them gain more market share and scale and thereby locking in their leadership position. So all investments were aimed at maximizing scale\u200a\u2014\u200amass marketing, mass production, mass distribution\u200a\u2014\u200aand business were organized into centralized, hierarchical structures to make this possible.But these investments in scale in the digital age are quickly moving from sources of competitive advantage to sources of competitive disadvantage.Technology and platforms have neutralized scale advantagesIn their recent book, Unscaled, Hemant Taneja and Kevin Maney talk about how the technologies of cloud and AI have turned scale economies on their head.In the world of cloud computing, IT resources are available cheaply to everyone meaning that\u200a\u2014\u200aother than for the platform providers like Microsoft\u2014 scale doesn\u2019t matter. A business can rent as little or as much IT as it needs, conferring little scale advantage in running massive operations.But it\u2019s not just IT resources, the same model is being applied everywhere. Take human resources, it is becoming increasingly easy to contract the people a company needs at the time they need them through platforms such as Malt and through a new breed of companies like Pangea, Digital Knights and WeDigitalGarden.In economic terms, technology has lowered the minimum efficient scale of production to a point that is within the reach of most SMEs. And with a monolithic business structure, diseconomies of scale kick in sooner and are more material.Artificial Intelligence is also having a profound impact on scale. If new technologies and platforms make it possible to manufacture profitably without scale, AI is making it possible to know what each and every customer wants\u200a\u2014\u200aso that product and service can be tailored to everyone.While the slight flaw in the unscaled argument is that more scale leads to more data and more data leads to better AI, it is nonetheless the case that any company offering undifferentiated products at scale will soon lose market share and scale. And so we see white space for new kinds of business models, where firms\u200a\u2014\u200aor platforms\u200a\u2014\u200aare able to take advantage of these new technologies to offer mass customization at scale.The incumbents\u2019 challengeThe incumbents challenge is, therefore, how to move away from this heritage of scale. This is likely a bigger challenge than it seems. Many companies in the industrial age missed shifts in consumer trends, but because of scale they could in many cases afford to catch up\u200a\u2014\u200acopying rivals, buying rivals, etc.In this digital age, the scaled business model is likely to lead to the double whammy of failing to spot new trends and the impossibility of catching up. Moreover, scale is so deeply embedded\u200a\u2014\u200aacross company structures, performance metrics, remuneration, processes, employee skillsets, cultures\u200a\u2014\u200athat it will be so difficult for incumbents to make the transition.Number of investments in tech companies by country\u200a\u2014\u200asource\u00a0AtomicoAnd it\u2019s not just an issue facing companies. Take Germany, for instance. For so long, its industrial sector has been admired all over the world for consistently high quality engineering. But, the German economy is struggling to make the transition to the unscaled, digital world. It doesn\u2019t (yet) have a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem from which the new unscaled models are emerging and the corporate structures and practices are very deeply ingrained.But there is hope. We do see many incumbent companies, including in the banking industry, adopting new, unscaled business models for the digital age.New banking business models for the digital ageIn many ways, the following section is an update to a piece I wrote two years ago looking at how technology and new regulations, particularly PSD 2, were likely to lead to new business models. Where back then we identified 4 business models, now we identify 5 (but now fully discount the universal banking model as a relic of the industrial age). And where back then we framed the choices around asset intensity and profitability, we now frame the choices around the size of the demographic a firm wishes to serve and the number of products it offers to this demographic (although profitability is likely to improve in correlation with these factors).Let us consider each in turn.The unbundled start-upThis is the model that most B2C fintech companies have pursued until now. They spot a niche, which could one of: a product that wasn\u2019t previously offered (e.g Coinbase), a demographic that is un- or underserved (e.g Lending Club), a much better experience (with likely cheaper pricing), combining tech and design thinking (e.g Transferwise) or all of the above(e.g. WealthFront).It is very much the embodiment of an unscaled model: using cloud infrastructure to operate at low volumes and using AI to serve small segments of the market. However, given it is both targeting a niche and targeting the consumer directly, it is often difficult to make this model profitable. The low infrastructure costs are more than offset by high customer acquisition costs which, because these tend to be single product companies, cannot be spread over many revenue lines. There are exceptions, of course, where the regulatory costs are low and the market is large (e.g WorldRemit), where there is a virality in the product design that lowers acquisition costs (e.g Revolut) or where the product solves a big issue in a big market such that it becomes a very large company (PayPal, M-Pesa, Stripe).But the much more likely outcome is that successful unblundled start-ups start to bundle multiple products under the same brand.The rebundled start-upOnce a start-up has found a strong product/market fit, it is logical for it to offer multiple products in order to boost its return on capital by cross-selling and upselling to its existing clients. It effectively moves from a single, unbundled product offering to rebundling a full banking service over time. However, it is different from a traditional universal banking model in a number of ways, such as the fact that it is digitally native but more importantly because it remains focused on serving the same demographic. In that sense, it doesn\u2019t engage in mass marketing and production, but sticks to a narrow target market. Were it to begin to offer all products to all customers, it then risks becoming the victim of unbundling itself.Examples of successful unblundled to rebundled start-ups include Zopa, Transferwise and Revolut.The platform\u00a0modelThe platform model is somewhat of an anomaly in this list since it is essentially a scale play. However, it is likely to be an enduring model since:1/ it is underpinned by strong network effects in a way that the universal banking model isn\u2019t;2/ it is often executed as part of an unscaled holding company strategy (see later); and,3/ it is offered in the service of (and helps to make sustainable) the model of unbundled start-ups.The platform model is simple. Banks rent out their back office as a service to others. For the unbundled start-ups who would be clients, it offers the advantage of not having to undertake a bunch of low value-added regulation and IT activities and it helps them to go beyond just renting IT infrastructure to renting IT applications and compliance. For the banks, it helps them to spread the largely fixed costs of IT and compliance over much larger volumes, improving economics.The challenge, as pointed out in the last blog, is that this is a difficult model to scale across borders, limiting its profitability potential and meaning that there will be likely only one or two platform players per country/geo.Examples of this model we have seen so far include Wirecard, Railsbank, Solaris and Bancorp. And it is no surprise that they are cropping up in the largest banking markets first where potential for scale economies is greatest.The aggregator modelThe aggregator model is where a firm uses its grip over distribution to introduce the consumer to the right unbundled services. Effectively it uses AI and machine learning to understand the customer\u2019s financial affairs and preferences and to anticipate their needs so that it can make the right service recommendations at the right time. With the introduction of PSD 2\u200a\u2014\u200aand similar regulation across the world\u200a\u2014\u200athis model becomes easier to operate since it forces banks to share customer data. And, theoretically, it becomes possible to operate this model without engaging in any product manufacturing or without having a banking licence or any compliance team\u200a\u2014\u200aas firms like Centralway Numbrs are trying to implement.Nonetheless, our view\u200a\u2014\u200aconsistent with the blog from two years ago\u200a\u2014\u200ais that this model will be thin, open but vertically integrated. By this we mean that aggregators will work with many different unbundled start-ups, but because of the nature of banking, they will likely manufacture some products\u200a\u2014\u200alike current accounts that require a banking licence. And because of the need to deliver exceptional customer experience, they will end up having to become more vertically integrated. We observed the same thing happening in other industries, such as with Amazon and Netflix, and now we observe the same thing happening in banking. When unbundled fintech start-ups rebundle, they tend to become more vertically integrated\u200a\u2014\u200awitness Transferwise\u2019s move off the Currency Cloud platform or N26\u2019s move off Wirecard.And so it is not a surprise that the aggregator models we are starting to observe in banking are thin and vertically integrated, such as M-Shwari and Starling Bank.However, there are a couple of potential issues with the aggregator model. The first might arise from regulation. Will regulators allow banks that offer own-labelled services to aggregate services from third-parties and trust them to do so completely impartially? Especially given the marked tendency for aggregators to move from collaboration to competition over time. Moreover, there may be a business model challenge in that, as Ben Thompson observes so clearly in his recent post, models like Starling\u2019s rely on third-parties while seeking to internalize the network effects, especially around data.Adaption of Ben Thompson\u2019s Moat\u00a0MapSo, while we continue to believe that this is a sound model, aggregators of this type will need to look to empower the ecosystem by externalizing network effects and may seek to use arms-length intermediaries, like Bud, to avoid potential pitfalls around regulation.And, where these potential issues are not addressed, aggregators leave themselves open to the threat from rebundled start-ups and from holding company models.The Holding Company\u00a0ModelThe holding company model attempts to replicate the universal banking model\u200a\u2014\u200aor conglomerate model in other industries\u200a\u2014\u200afor the unscaled world and in a way that confers competitive advantage on the subsidiaries, especially by dint of network effects.There is probably no \u201cstandard\u201d for the holding company model. Berkshire Hathway is a great example of how a holding company structure can create competitive advantage across the group companies, in its case by using the cashflows and very low cost of capital of its insurance business to provide the cheap cash for investing.Amazon is another great model to study and probably more relevant for banking. Jeff Bezos made a decision in 2002 to standardize the way information is shared across Amazon using APIs. It was a brilliant move in how to achieve control at scale. Essentially, the inputs and the outputs of every team were measurable in real time, such that their performance was instantly calculable and all other teams would get the information needed to conduct their work without bottlenecks, but it still allowed the teams autonomy in how to execute. The upside of this API model, so well documented in this post from Steve Yegge, was manifold:it allowed the different teams to operate autonomously so that that those business could be opened up to work with third-parties (as happened with AWS)It allowed each unit to be kept focused on its own KPIs, which essentially means that they are forced to remain close to customer trends. As Ben Thompson writes in another recent post, the genius of Amazon\u2019s customer obsession is that it forces every part of the business to innovate at the same time as making it practically impossible to overshoot consumer demands.It critically allows every business unit to stay focused on its niche (essentially an unscaled model) but allowing for scale at a group level (e.g IT resources, distribution and brand), positive working capital flows, and the exploitation (internalization) of network effects across group companies.This is what makes Amazon such a formidable company. It has figured out how to make the conglomerate model work in the digital age\u200a\u2014\u200athrough a holding company structure. And, furthemore, in its digital form, it overcomes one of the key shortcomings of its industrial age predecessor\u200a\u2014\u200ait can achieve increasing returns to scale thanks network effects.In the financial services space, the best example of this holding company structure is Ant Financial. Where Amazon has figured out how to adapt the conglomerate model for the digital age, Ant Financial has figured out how to recreate the universal banking model for an unscaled world. Its hub and spoke model sees the group leverage data, brand and distribution while the subsidiaries remain narrowly enough focused\u200a\u2014\u200aon unsecured lending, investing, money market funds\u200a\u2014\u200ato remain nimble and adaptive in the face of changing technologies and customer trends.The Holding Company as a model for reinventionWe see a strong trend in banking for incumbents to launch new digital banks. The examples abound, such as BNP Paribas\u2019 Hello Bank. While this model to reinvention is in many ways sound\u200a\u2014\u200ait allows these banks to transplant customers and trust into a new digitally native version of themselves\u200a\u2014\u200ait risks creating another universal banking model, albeit one built on digital foundations. A better way of going about reinvention would seem to be a holding company model. This might be built on a Berkshire Hathaway model, as seems to be the case with Equitable Bank\u2019s creation of its EQ Bank subsidiary, to create a sticky, low cost source of funds for its lending business. Or, probably more likely, it would be an Ant Financial model of having individual subsidiaries target different business lines, which is the approach that Bank Leumi seems to be taking with Pepper Bank.ConclusionThere is a clear danger that with the constant hype around technology, banks miss the need to redefine their business models before embarking on major technology renovation. In fact, technology renovation in the absence of business model renovation may well make things worse because it would entrench existing business models based on selling undifferentiated products at the greatest possible level of scale. The digital age calls for something else\u200a\u2014\u200aproducts, many of which will be new, targeted on specific demographics, made possible now thanks to technology change. In this blog, we have presented 5 models which would work in this new paradigm, of which the holding company offers perhaps the best route to success\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially for incumbent organizations looking to reinvent themselves.", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "AZ Internet", "link": "https://medium.com/az-internet-blog/az-internet-working-to-evolve-the-blockchain-59637ab701fc?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 30, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "7K", "content": "AZ InternetBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 30, 2018AZ Internet: Working to Evolve the BlockchainArticle by Mohamed Asif - Co Founder / CEO AZ\u00a0InternetBuilding the next big thing is a goal that many entrepreneurs have during their careers.This is a very achievable task, but the goal can only be reached if you can first find a product that the community truly needs or will be of use in the coming future. The due diligence, the revenue streams, and the funding all comes into play afterwards. The most important part is the product and its relevance to the people.The next important factor you need to achieve is to have a hardworking and passionate team who believes in the vision as much as you do. A team who can see the potential of the project and is willing to take on the extra effort to see the vision fulfilled in the long run. A team where your idea and vision has been passed down in its purest strongest form down to the last person.More importantly, great projects happen don\u2019t just because the idea or the founder was good. They happen because the idea was good and the founders and their team was on the same page from the beginning. If that is the case, then no matter what the scenario your idea is introduced into, it will breakout and grow with speed and strength.At AZ Internet my team and I have a different perspective. We didn\u2019t want to build the next big thing, we wanted to build the next most useful thing.A product that could create new foundations for our economic and social systems. Something that would bring an unbiased balance and financial freedom to everyone and anyone in the most transparent and safe way.We truly believe that the economy works best when it works for everyone.And to achieve this goal, we turned to the blockchain. For me, the blockchain is one of the most powerful and effective technological innovations since the invention of the Internet.The blockchain has the potential to make the world a better place by recovering the balance that society has lost.Since the first days of the Internet, it has taken a lot of forms, and it was only just 27 years ago that the World Wide Web became publicly available. After that, it witnessed growth and mass adoption on a massive scale. In short, it evolved through the years with many great product implementations, turning it into what it is today.Similarly, the blockchain is in its early stages of growth and adoption. Only through building useful products based on it will it evolve to its full potential.This is our mission at AZ Internet. We are building applications based on the blockchain with a focus on decentralized finance, which has a positive social impact on communities. We want to advance financial inclusion around the world with the help of the blockchainOur products are built based on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cutting-edge technology. In this space you have to build for the future, but sometimes what we need is not something new, sometimes we just have to perfect something that already exists. So, for that is exactly what we are doing for our first product.A large part of financial freedom is having your heart and mind free from worry about the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d of life. When the fear and worry vanishes then there is space for development, growth, and progress, which in turn uplifts the entire community. We wanted to help people and communities achieve financial freedom. In other words, we wanted to promote financial inclusion on a large scale. For this purpose, promoting and supporting entrepreneurship, social projects, ventures, and charities was crucial. The proven and successful method for doing this already existed, but it was not perfect and had many flaws. So we decided to take it and make it better and more accessible.Enter: Interest free crowdfunding & money circles on the blockchain.The first product AZ Fundchain is a donor curated fundraising application that accepts donations in cryptocurrency. We help you invest ethically and support promising projects and individuals.What makes us different from other funding platforms is that we have two processes for raising funds.One is a public-based crowdfunding and the other is a private ROSCA-based funding (also more commonly known as \u201cmoney circles\u201d).All this done using only cryptocurrency as the transaction medium.Crowdfunding platforms have created much value for entrepreneurs and investors in some parts of the world, but due to redundant geographic and regulatory restrictions, these platforms are inaccessible to most of the world. We intend to change that and make it the most accessible and transparent platform by building our own on the Ethereum blockchain and using cryptocurrency as the medium of transactions.We want to help people raise funds for their projects or ventures in the simplest possible manner by removing as many barriers as we can and making it transparent and safe.Originally published at medium.com on September 30, 2018.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Friendz on stage at the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference: Geneva get\u00a0ready", "author_name": "Friendz", "link": "https://medium.com/friendz/friendz-on-stage-at-the-blockchain-bitcoin-conference-geneva-get-ready-5483331a8dd2?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 20, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "3K", "content": "Friendz on stage at the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference: Geneva get\u00a0readyFriendzBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 20, 2018Friendz is one step away from launching it\u2019s ICO on the 1st of March, but its roadshow is far from finished.On February 21st, for the second time after Dubai and Singapore, Friendz team will split into two halves.

Both sides will cooperate closely in blockchain, smart contracts, and the construction of P2P networks, to create a new future for the development of the global art\u00a0market.Fresco is delighted to work with Elastos side by side seeing the advent of the revolution in art and technology.About ElastosElastos was founded by Chen Rong and Han Feng, who\u2019re pioneers in the global blockchain industry. It\u2019s the first operating system that can pass blockchain\u2019s credibility to user\u2019s day-to-day scenes in the world. With blockchain as the credible foundation, combined with Elastos\u2019 sandbox isolation mechanism and network isolation mechanism, digital assets can be identified, made scarce, trade-able and consumable so everyone can own digital assets and profit from it, in order to make the internet a smart economic-ecological sphere.Elastos can protect digital content and user\u2019s privacy from being compromised, leaked, or stolen. And blockchain can issue ID (warrants) for digital content to confirm the property rights and transactions. The two combined can provide the economic foundation of \u201cprivate property rights\u201d for the Internet in the information age. Only on the basis of clear property rights can we develop the economy and productive forces.Han Feng, one of Elastos\u2019 founders, is a lifetime member of the Bitcoin Foundation, the author of \u201cBlockchain: Quantum Wealth View\u201d, the General Secretary of the Asian Blockchain DACA Association, and the Chinese partner of the United States Oracle Education Foundation. He also had served as the head of one of Tsinghua University\u2019s key projects. Chen Rong is the founder/planner of the Elastos project. He has 8 years working experience in Microsoft\u2019s operating system team. He\u2019s been working on the research & development of operating systems since 2000. Elastos has established strategic partnerships with Bitmain and NEO. It\u2019s highly popular in the international society. Elastos is also in the process of negotiations with companies from USA, UK, and Japan.Chen Rong and Han Feng believe that a decentralized and fully automated smart economy requires a secure and usable operating system to reach consensus. Elastos is able to \u201cseparate trust and computing\u201d to make large decentralized apps (DApp) have both \u201cusability\u201d and \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d. It solves the issue of limitation of the existing blockchain system, which is highly coupled with the smart contract virtual machine feature. It ensures that decentralized applications can run on a high-performance, reliable and secure \u201cwealth internet.\u201dAbout FRESCOFRESCO is the world\u2019s first blockchain art digital asset network.Through blockchain technology and Elastos\u2019 operating system, FRESCO enables liquidation, promotion, and provenance of artworks at a global scale.FRESCO mainly consists of FRES artwork trust value (FRES Trust) and FRES artwork blockchain digital copyright (FRES Edition). FRES Trust is a blockchain-based art value measurement system. FRES Edition is the limited digital assets copyright issued by artwork holders on FRESCO platform.FRESCO is launching the world\u2019s first ICD (Initial Coin Distribution), distributing 300 million FRESCO tokens to the global community free of charge. Through this process, FRESCO will enable nearly 150,000 people to learn and understand the art world. This is something even world\u2019s leading art institutions can\u2019t achieve.Through FRES Trust and FRES Edition, FRESCO manages to expand the art investment population to the whole world and therefore pushes the art market to an unprecedented level.FRES Trust and\u00a0ElastosElastos enables the digital assets to be published while carrying blockchain\u2019s credibility value. This is consistent with the mission of FRES Trust.Through the irreversible process of adding tokens to artworks, FRES Trust can establish an artwork holder\u2019s record documenting a certain artwork\u2019s transaction history (Artwork Provenance) as well as being a decentralized and clear index of an artwork\u2019s market and academic value without revealing the artwork\u2019s market place. This is particularly important in the art world where most artworks\u2019 value is multi-dimensional and art transactions are based upon negotiation.At the same time, FRES Trust will be the foundation of the FRES artwork blockchain digital copyright (FRES Edition). An artwork\u2019s total volume of FRES Trust is the total value of FRES Edition. Elastos helps identify the digital assets to make a solid foundation for turning data into assets.FRES Edition and\u00a0ElastosElastos enables digital assets to release limited editions and be tradable. This is the technical foundation to achieve FRES Edition as well as the economic foundation to provide \u201cprivate property rights\u201d for the internet in the information age.Fundamentally, FRES Edition is highly consistent with Elastos in terms of the view of data wealth. Through Elastos, the collection of artworks will not only be limited to physical artwork or obscure artworks. Instead, it has been expanded to the blockchain digital asset copyrights of world-famous artists\u2019 works, which can lower the art investment threshold without affecting the physical art transactions. And it\u2019ll bring geometric growth to the art market.At the same time, based on Elastos, FRES Edition allow museums to build a more interactive model that enables visitors to not only take pictures with museum collections but also get a digital copy of a certain masterpiece\u2019s blockchain digital copyright.Han Feng said, \u201cNow we need a system to allow a large number of decentralized applications to land safely. The blockchain technology is missing a portal to the mass public. Elastos can play the role of a system that allows various applications to serve people\u2019s lives. FRESCO is the best example of how can blockchain technology play a role in the mass public\u2019s life.FRESCO can open up the art industry and make digital data become everyone\u2019s wealth.\u201d", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "Can Blockchain Solve Advertising\u2019s Supply Chain Transparency Issues?", "author_name": "MEDIA Protocol", "link": "https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsm/can-blockchain-solve-advertisings-supply-chain-transparency-issues-b48f706e3db7?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 4, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "1.1K", "content": "Can Blockchain Solve Advertising\u2019s Supply Chain Transparency Issues?MEDIA ProtocolBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 4, 2018In the current model, it\u2019s rarely clear to the businesses paying for advertising just how their money is being spent. What has become clear, however, is how much money is being wasted on methods that don\u2019t give guaranteed results.What\u2019s Wrong With The Supply\u00a0Chain?Currently, the advertiser controls all of the data gathered about their advertising, meaning they can pick and choose what to share with the customer. Additionally, many of the services they provide are reliant on third parties or intermediaries, resulting in further information that the customer can\u2019t access or check directly. In fact, the customer is presented with the results alone, with little chance to verify they\u2019re the best possible outcome.All this opacity about how money is spent and what it actually garners in return, makes the existing advertising model very susceptible to fraud. False promises or inflated numbers are hard to disprove. There\u2019s also the friction of needing different points of access to different markets and consumers. This adds to additional costs and user frustration.How Does Blockchain Solve These Problems?With transparency.It seems simple, but on a transparent system like blockchain\u2019s distributed ledger, every transaction is recorded in a readily accessible format, spread across numerous locations so that no one company or entity can take control over that information.Cutting out those costly middlemen is another benefit\u200a\u2014\u200aassets can be transferred peer-to-peer. It removes those third-parties who hoard the valuable data and hike up the costs in advertising.With a transparent record, it\u2019s much harder to try and inflate or massage the figures. Not having to mitigate for fraud also makes this blockchain model much more affordable to customers.Where Does MEDIA Protocol Come\u00a0In?By tokenising URLs, the protocol means frictionless content can be made available on multiple, nearly endless platforms. By generating rewards, customers get the direct benefit of being able to access even paywalled content, in a truly frictionless way. This builds and expands the direct economy between publishers and their customer base.What Next?At the moment, this blockchain setup doesn\u2019t quite handle the real-time processing required for trading markets, for example. But with protocols growing and developing all the time, we may soon see this change.Nevertheless, compared to the existing model, blockchain is a marked improvement. This is the closest possible solution to the current problems. And it will only get better, with improvements and fixes further down the line, as more people adopt the technology and get involved in fostering its development.For more information regarding MEDIA Protocol find us on our social channels below:Website: www.mediaprotocol.orgFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MEDIAProtocolTwitter: https://twitter.com/MEDIA_ProtocolLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/media-protocol/Telegram: https://t.me/Media_Protocol_Community and https://t.me/MP_AnnouncementsMedium: https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsmYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MEDIAProtocol", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Blockchains Need iExec: The Market Just Hasn\u2019t Realized It\u00a0Yet", "author_name": "Noam Levenson", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/blockchains-need-iexec-the-market-just-hasnt-realized-it-yet-5597c743cd0a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 19, 2017", "readtime": "18 min read", "upvotes": "5.6K", "content": "Blockchains Need iExec: The Market Just Hasn\u2019t Realized It\u00a0YetEthereum needs an off-chain computing solution: iExec is perfectly situated to\u00a0deliverNoam LevensonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 19, 2017Cowritten by Alex Price, Founding Partner of Qu CapitalDecentralized Cloud Computing. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s ever been a less sexy combination of buzzwords. But those three words should get you excited\u200a\u2014\u200avery excited. And if Decentralized Cloud Computing excites you, then iExec should have you ecstatic.Centralized Cloud ComputingTo understand the significance of iExec, we need to understand the industry as it stands today. The cloud provides access to processing power, storage, and applications to companies without the expensive equipment and more importantly, without the difficulty of fixing and optimizing hardware.Centralized cloud computing is a multibillion dollar industry\u200a\u2014\u200a$206 billion as of 2016 and by some estimates, it could break $400 billion by 2020. It\u2019s clearly a high demand product. And it\u2019s not difficult to understand why. Cloud services replace massive on location data and processing centers for companies. They allow companies to forgo expensive hardware investments and focus on running their business. To avoid paying for large IT departments, manage hardware upkeep, and pay for physical space, companies outsource to cloud companies for their processing, storage, and bandwith needs. Simple and easy. With cloud computing, companies also only need to pay for what they use meaning there is no excess spending. Netflix today is entirely powered by cloud computing provided by Amazon.Some of the biggest companies in the world provide cloud computing services. Companies like Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud account for hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue per year. These companies have enormous data centers throughout the world, each with between 50,000 to 80,000 servers.And the demand for these services is growing exponentially every year.TLDR: Instead of purchasing and maintaining large in-house servers, companies can rent computing services and storage space from cloud companies.So What About Decentralized Cloud Computing?Decentralized cloud computing in its simplest form is doing what AWS and Google are doing, but in a decentralized manner. Instead of having massive centralized data and hardware centers, the computation comes from individual computers all across the network. When your computer is off and you\u2019re getting some much needed shut eye, you help the Request Network smart audit your father-in-law.Some companies like Sia and Filecoin are providing decentralized storage solutions. With these, you can rent out your storage space to other people. But what iExec is developing, is a cloud computing solution. That means that companies can rent the idle compute power (not storage space) from the decentralized network. Now you, savvy investor and critical thinker, may ask: how can iExec compete with Google and Amazon and Microsoft? How can a blockchain startup compete with multibillion dollar corporations that effectively own our digital identities? How can they provide a cheaper and more effective solution than these global superpowers? The answer: Right now, iExec can\u2019t. But It doesn\u2019t need to compete. iExec can be the AWS for blockchain.TLDR: Blockchain enables decentralized cloud computing. This enables users with excess computing power (most of us) to rent the power out to those who need it.iExeciExec is a decentralized application (dApp) running on the Ethereum network. It enables access to decentralized computing power, not only for individuals, but for dApps on blockchains as well. In addition to my research, I interviewed Wassim Bendella, the Blockchain Business Developer for the iExec team. Specifically, I was looking for clarification on some of the technology and confirmation that my understanding was in fact, correct.The ProblemEthereum is revolutionizing the Internet by providing programmable trust, in the form of smart contracts. These smart contracts act as trustless middle men, ensuring all parties stay honest, without the added cost and delay of lawyers and contracts. With over 800 decentralized applications, Ethereum provides a secure, decentralized, and trustless development platform for the new Internet of Value. These new dApps utilize Ethereum for their smart contract and blockchain needs, storing the terms and state of the contracts on the blockchain. Ethereum\u2019s virtual machine is responsible for the execution of smart contracts. Essentially, in layman\u2019s terms, virtual machines are machines that execute smart contracts and run inside the computers of miners or other validators. The VM is the environment that the smart contract runs in. And Ethereum\u2019s VM is excellent for simple transactions and business logic\u200a\u2014\u200athings like managing the rules regarding the creation and storage of information. And although Ethereum is Turing-complete and theoretically capable of performing any computational feat given infinite time, the VM struggles when performing rigorous computations efficiently and at reasonable cost.Good luck with that car\u00a0chase\u2026That\u2019s not what Ethereum was made for. Running intensive computations on Ethereum would be like trying to run Grand Theft Auto 5 on Apple\u2019s 1987 Macintosh II.Today, this isn\u2019t really an issue because most dApps don\u2019t have a working product. The dApps only utilize Ethereum for their ICO sale and for simple transactions with their tokens\u200a\u2014\u200aEthereum is well suited for that. But once all these dApps start releasing actual products, with actual computational demands, Ethereum not only will not be able to keep up, but it will become prohibitively expensive. Since Ethereum charges ether (gas) to run the network, intensive computations would cost a fortune. Imagine when Ethereum\u2019s computational demands increase by 10x, or 100x: the network will be unusable.TLDR: Ethereum is great for simple computational processes like transactions. But the dApps on Ethereum need to do more. They need more power than the Ethereum virtual machine can provide.The SolutionThe solution to this is offchain computing. dApps need to be able to do their heavy computing offchain (meaning not on the Ethereum blockchain) and then bring the information and results back onto the Ethereum blockchain for verification. iExec enables just this. dApps can use iExec\u2019s decentralized cloud computing services to safely, simply, and cheaply, execute their computation far from the inefficient and incapable Ethereum VM.Maybe the AI could finally beat my dad for\u00a0me\u2026An interesting use case that demonstrates this relationship was an AI chessbot developed by Stockfish. The actual chess moves are a simple recording of information\u200a\u2014\u200aKnight to C6\u200a\u2014\u200aeasily accomplished by the Ethereum VM. But the actual AI decision of where to move is exceptionally complex. The amount of information that the bot needs to process is enormous\u200a\u2014\u200astrategy, combination of moves, anticipation of opponent\u2019s moves, etc.\u200a\u2014\u200athis is impossible for the VM. So iExec provides the computational power for the AI off-chain, and then transfers the move results back to the Ethereum blockchain where they stay, immutable and secure; all this happens fast: well within the time for one Ethereum block.The use cases are endless. Flixxo is a dApp that envisions itself as the decentralized YouTube. Because of all the encoding and decoding of videos on the blockchain, it requires an enormous amount of computer power. \u201ciExec will allow the platform to do [this] by providing cloud resources,\u201d says Bendella.Request is another partner. Request plans to offer automated auditing of financial records. This is also an extremely intensive computational process. iExec again provides the offchain solution for this computation\u200a\u2014\u200athe results of the audit can then be easily transferred to the Ethereum blockchain.The blockchain economy will need a service like iExec. In 2018, as dApps begin releasing their platforms, it will become increasingly clear that Ethereum will be ineffective for all that computation. With AI, smart cities, VR, and IoT all utilizing advanced smart contracts, there will need to be an offchain computing solution. iExec is that solution.I also don\u2019t want to mislead. Users and businesses will also be able to utilize the iExec services for their own projects and uses. Need more power for your fantasy football algorithms? iExec can do that. Want to play Fifa with 4k settings? iExec is your tool.TLDR: iExec processes the computations away from the blockchain and then transfers the results back to the blockchain. dApps can use this to perform complex computations like rendering, uploading, and all the requirements for AI, IoT, and VR, all without slowing down the Ethereum network.How Will iExec Actually\u00a0Work?iExec didn\u2019t create its foundational technology, it only invented a way of combining the technology with the blockchain. iExec uses XtremWeb-HEP, an advanced software developed for cloud computing. This software is a peer reviewed, open-source technology produced with the help of the iExec team during their time in cloud computing research. The technology essentially helps solve many of the issues associated with a service like this including: fault-tolerance, supporting multi-applications, multi-users, and hybrid public/private infrastructure, and ensuring security and accountability. Which is just a long way of saying: it provides solutions for all the considerations of a project like this.iExec already has a working platform. Their Software Development Kit (SDK) was a part of their V1 released during the beginning of November. The SDK allows dApps to utilize iExec\u2019s computing power. This means that today, dApps can already perform offchain computations using iExec.The TriadBy building on XtremWeb-HEP technology, iExec has constructed a trifecta of cloud computing, its Triad of Technology.iExec is broken down into three distinct platforms that all interact to bring decentralized computing to both individuals and dApps.dApp StoreThe dApp store released on December 20th. The dApp store is the equivalent of Apple\u2019s App Store where all the dApps utilizing iExec\u2019s services are featured. Users can then interact with all those applications and pay in iExec\u2019s native token: RLC. As Bendella said, \u201c[The dApp Store] allows us to link the whole dApp ecosystem powered by us. Users can browse dApps, use them, and pay for them. Application providers can list their dApps and earn money if they decide to monetize them.\u201dCurrently, the dApp store is only an interface where users can view dApps built on iExec. However, they plan to expand it beyond simply cosmetics very soon. This will allow users to actually engage with the dApps from the store.The iExec dApp\u00a0storeTLDR: The dApp store provides an organized and visual platform where users can see and interact with the dApps using the iExec service.The MarketplaceThe marketplace is the bread and butter of the iExec platform and will be released during the next update in Q1 of 2018. The marketplace essentially enables the buying and selling of computing resources. Users\u200a\u2014\u200ayou and me\u200a\u2014\u200acan sell our excess computing power in the marketplace. dApps can then purchase and utilize those resources. Right now, even with the launch of SDK, dApps are only utilizing computing resources provided by servers maintained by iExec. This centralization is a short term limitation for iExec as the computational power is currently limited. However, once the marketplace is operational, it will truly be decentralized as many users will collectively provide the necessary resources for applications.This decentralization will enable cheaper costs and superior scaling. The marketplace is based on free market economics. The more users selling their idle computer power, the more competition there will be, and thus, the cheaper the fees. iExec is only limited in how much computing power they can provide by the number of users selling those resources. As long as there is a growing base of people selling resources in the marketplace, the sky is the limit in terms of iExec\u2019s scalability.\u201cRight now,\u201d says Bendella, \u201ciExec provides computing power for free. In May 2018, computing providers will be able to monetize their own resources on our marketplace.\u201dThe marketplace will also feature a reputation system that values a user\u2019s reliability. With this, smart contracts will be able to specify price, speed, and reputation requirements for their computation needs. iExec has a complex matchmaking system that enables this service. For example, I might be willing to sacrifice reputation and speed for a cheaper computation price. Other users may be willing to pay more in exchange for a faster and more reliable computation. All this is possible with the iExec marketplace.Users pay in RLC but the iExec network charges no fee. This allows the marketplace to provide a safer, cheaper, and more reliable cloud computing solution to individuals, companies, and applications alike, especially as technology continues to scale.iExec can also provide means for massive mining pools and data centers to rent their computational power in the marketplace. There is a massive amount of available computational power in these pools.TLDR: iExec will have a marketplace where users can sell their excess computing resources to those who need more resources.The Data MarketplaceIn our world of Big Data, companies have enormous amounts of data and no idea how to utilize it. This data could be anything from stock market or medical data to enormous quantities of consumer data. There are plenty of applications and services which could utilize that data and are willing to pay for it. This data marketplace enables that matchmaking. Companies that have excess data can sell the data to any application that wants to purchase it. All of the transactions are paid in RLC. Any data legally accumulated by a company can be sold.\u201cToday in the world of Big Data, we have massive datasets waiting to be turned into value. Facebook and Google do it well, but I think this can be done by anyone. Therefore, we are building a marketplace to connect those that have data to those that don\u2019t have it but would like to leverage it. Applications running on iExec will be able to make use of an ocean of data at their disposal.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aWassim\u00a0BendellaIt is important to recognize that this service is a ways away. The dApp store is releasing soon and in early 2018, the marketplace will be operational. However, the data marketplace will not be released in the near future.TLDR: iExec will have a marketplace where companies with large stores of lawfully acquired data can sell it to businesses and applications that can make use of said data.Tying It All\u00a0TogetherImagine I have a fantasy football application\u200a\u2014\u200aOneMoreInch\u200a\u2014\u200athat provides advanced predictions for fantasy football users and scorekeeping for head-to-head games. The application\u2019s prediction algorithms use the iExec marketplace to find users who are selling their computing power. The complex algorithms are intensive and require huge inputs of computing power. With the extra power provided by iExec, OneMoreInch can smoothly run the algorithms. In addition, with the future creation of the data marketplace, OneMoreInch can aggregate player and fantasy data to effectively compute the predictions. All the scores and results are then transferred onto the Ethereum blockchain.If a user wants to use OneMoreInch, all they must do is go to the dApp store and pay in RLC to interact with the service.An overview of the iExec\u00a0triadProof of ContributionOne of the main challenges for decentralized cloud computing is how to prove who provided what computational power and compensate them accordingly. iExec has designed a system called Proof of Contribution that certifies resources and credits them to the external providers. This record is maintained on the blockchain.While the exact details of this have yet to be provided, this will hopefully provide a trustworthy system that enables accurate consensus regarding who provided what in the iExec transaction.Blockchain AgnosticWhile iExec is currently built on Ethereum and all my described use cases revolve around Ethereum, iExec transcends this specific blockchain. iExec can adapt to any other blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aNEO, EOS, Cardano\u200a\u2014\u200aand provide the same off-chain computation services. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on Ethereum right now, but we can move our technology to almost any other blockchain to suit some specific need,\u201d said Bendella.The DetailsThe iExec Token: RLCAll network fees are paid in RLC. Because there is a maximum supply of tokens, as demand for the network increases, so will the price of the token. As more dApps begin utilizing iExec and transacting with RLC, the price will increase.Total Supply: 87,000,000 tokensMarketcap: $79 millionToken Distribution:69% released in ICO17.2% held by the team and advisors6.9% held as an emergency contingency fund6.9% held by iExec for network incentives and developmentGovernanceCurrently, only authorized smart contracts will be able to be deployed on the iExec blockchain. That means that there must be a peer-review process that ensures that all smart contracts are legitimate and trustworthy. Not many details regarding this process have been released.RoadMap and upcoming developmentsV1 released according to schedule for iExec, bringing their decentralized computing solutions to dApps. It is very impressive that iExec was able to deliver their V1 on-time. It gives me much more confidence in their team and project. With all the difficulties and unforeseen obstacles of developing with a new technology, many projects in this space are unable to stay true to their timelines.Their dApp store releases tomorrow. Their V2\u200a\u2014\u200athe decentralized marketplace\u200a\u2014\u200awill release in May of 2018. This will enable users to sell their computing resources to others.The TeamThe team is one of the most exciting aspects of iExec. I like to invest in teams. Ultimately with projects, no matter how flashy their marketing or how impressive their white-paper, it is the team that is developing the project. The challenges of producing a working product in this industry are immense; it is critical that the project has a strong organization that can effectively respond to those challenges.iExec\u2019s team is the kind I look for. The two founders of the iExec project, Gilles Fedak and Haiwu He, are both powerful people in the cloud computing industry. Fedak has 14 years of experience in cloud computing research at INRIA, a public research body dedicated to digital science and technology. With a Ph.D in Philosophy and Masters in Computer Science, he has been instrumental in many technical developments and has coauthored about 80 peer reviewed scientific papers, and won two best paper awards.Haiwu He has an equally impressive job history. He is a professor at the CNIC (Computer Network Information Center), Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and a scholar of the Ministry of Education of China. He also worked as a researcher for INRIA in France and has published about 30 scientific papers. He holds a Ph.D in Computing.Together, they were instrumental in founding the Desktop Grid Foundation which is an organization that brings together experts in the field of cloud computing.The key to understand about them is that they are Ph.D holding experts in this field. They understand the industry, the requirements, and the vast considerations required for this project. They are published, accredited, and well respected. They are leaders whose over 20 years of research have been committed to distributed grid computing research. These are the people I want running this company.However, they are not marketers, and it shows. Their goal is not to advertise their product and their lack of marketing has hurt RLC\u2019s valuation. Their whitepaper is drudgery, and they don\u2019t have a strong social network presence. However, their production has demonstrated their competence in bringing cloud computing to blockchain.In addition, I expect that their media presence and marketing proficiency will improve dramatically. Their marketing team was put together only two months ago and is already showing promise; they released a website redesign that is far superior to the previous one. The iExec team will also be releasing a revised and updated whitepaper during the first half of January.TLDR: iExec\u2019s team has years of industry and research experience, has published over 110 academic articles, and helped establish a cloud computing research organization.The CompetitionGolemGolem is similar to iExec. However, they are currently focusing their marketing on a specific use case: digital rendering. Digitally rendering images and animations is a very GPU intensive process. Golem aims to use decentralized computing to enable extremely fast digital rendering. Ultimately, Golem is initially trying to attract 3D artists, animators, and designers while iExec is creating a cloud marketplace for users and dApps. Potentially, they could even cooperate. While they could one day compete, I think for Golem, their choice in marketing speaks volumes. iExec\u2019s main value lies in providing offchain computation for blockchains which is a different objective than Golem. Golem has first mover advantage with this use case and iExec has the advantage in providing dApps with decentralized computing solutions. I don\u2019t see them as being in competition at this time.SONMSONM is also working to enable a decentralized super computer. However, I have very little confidence in SONM\u2019s ability to deliver. They are attempting to provide decentralized Fog and Edge Computing (their definitions are well above the scope of this article). Fog and Edge are both enormously complicated and not realistic for initial stage development. Both iExec and Golem plan to expand into that field, but recognize that the complexity demands a serious foundation and already working platform. Any strong engineering approach should focus on slow repetitive development: carefully building each foundational block first to achieve an end goal. The fact that SONM is approaching the Fog and Edge computation from the beginning does not bode well for them.Siacoin, Filecoin, and other decentralized cloud storage companiesWhile iExec may in the future try to provide decentralized cloud storage solutions (essentially renting out computer storage space from users on the network), they are not currently doing so. iExec only deals in decentralized computation. Thus, they\u2019re not in competition with these applications.TrueBitTrueBit was intentionally not included. While they may one day compete with iExec, this is likely over a year away. With how rapidly this industry evolves, a year is like a millennium; at that point, there will be a whole new set of demands and considerations. I focused only on their competition now and in the near future.TLDR: There is no true competition for iExec. Golem is approaching decentralized cloud computing from a different direction and I have serious reservations about SONM.Could iExec One Day Compete with\u00a0Amazon?I have mentioned that I don\u2019t see iExec as needing to compete directly with Amazon, Google, or any of the cloud computing heavy hitters. And in the beginning, due to the their current centralization and the likely slow adoption of their marketplace, iExec won\u2019t be cheaper or more powerful than AWS or Google. However, iExec\u2019s decentralized model offers potential that could exceed any of the major players. If iExec can facilitate a robust free market for cloud services, it\u2019s low cost and high scalability could, in the long run, be unmatched even by Amazon. There are truly few limits to the scale that a decentralized marketplace like iExec could reach.SummaryIf there is one aspect of iExec that I hope this article highlighted, it is this: Ethereum cannot support the kind of computational needs that many of its dApps will require. This problem will compound exponentially as more dApps release their working platforms and products. Blockchains need a solution that allows them to compute offchain and bring only the results on chain. iExec is that solution. No one else is doing what iExec is doing. Not Golem, not SONM. The extreme need for offchain computing will be there soon: iExec will be well situated to service it.Sitting at close to an $80 million marketcap tells me that they are severely undervalued in comparison to their peers: SONM and Golem. Here are the reasons I think iExec\u2019s valuation should be higher. They have:A seriously impressive team with years of industry experience and research.A working product (their Software Development Kit) delivered on schedule and a soon to release dApp store.A strong need case and a lack of competition\u200a\u2014\u200ano one else can provide blockchains with offchain computing solutions.dApps that already utilize their service.The reason that it\u2019s so criminally undervalued in my opinion is that people truly don\u2019t understand iExec\u2019s functionality and potential. It honestly took me a long time to understand why decentralized cloud computing is critical to blockchains. It\u2019s not intuitive and certainly not flashy. In addition, their lack of strong marketing has significantly contributed to iExec\u2019s $80 million marketcap. I see iExec\u2019s immediate valuation as being close to Golem\u2019s (a $480 million marketcap) which would represent a 600% increase. Truthfully, I think that is conservative.It\u2019s also important to understand that iExec doesn\u2019t need to compete with Amazon and Google; and while iExec\u2019s decentralized model will offer better security and energy efficiency it likely can\u2019t compete with the cost efficiency of these global superpowers. But iExec\u2019s purpose isn\u2019t to compete. These massive, centralized cloud companies cannot service the new Internet. Decentralized applications can\u2019t have centralized computing solutions\u200a\u2014\u200athat defeats the whole purpose of decentralization. iExec is providing what Amazon and Google cannot.When people recognize that iExec is the future of offchain computing for blockchain, I am confident iExec will finally get the recognition that it deserves.A big thanks to Wassim Bendella for his comments.

(Blockchain lotto)FireLottoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 29, 2018Fire Lotto\u200a\u2014\u200aglobal blockchain lotteryFire Lotto is the world\u2019s first decentralized lottery using Ethereum smart contracts (https://firelotto.io). Think twice before cringing at the word \u2018lottery\u2019! Yes, it is true that many projects that have launched ICOs do not meet their obligations or stop developing their products, but Fire Lotto is an exception. It is a unique project whose team members have delivered on the promises made in their whitepaper for investors.On January 1, 2018, three draw lottery games were launched on the Fire Lotto platform. They will be followed by instant lotteries based on the Fire Chain technology, which are going to be launched on October 1. It means that the lottery is running successfully, with people winning real prizes and competing for big jackpots. As it does not rely on a single server, the lottery is fair, transparent, and secure. It is impossible to tamper with the lottery process. This lottery cannot be banned and people from all over the world can play it if they have access to the Internet. The prize pool is enormous and accumulates a record 70 percent of the revenue earned from ticket sales. No other lottery can boast such a figure. The project is making good progress and gaining momentum.Investors have found the Fire Lotto project attractive. We are currently working on integration with our partners and affiliates through API and iFrame. More than 120 companies have already integrated the Fire Lotto platform into their online resources, receiving 50 percent of the platform revenue. Our tokens are traded on seven exchanges. Token holders receive payouts every two months, as it was promised. Those who were the first ones to buy our tokens have already started receiving their payouts in ETH. What the lottery team promised only less than a year ago has translated into reality.The Fire Lotto team thinks a lot about how to make playing the lottery more convenient, which attracts more and more players. It is easy to buy our lottery tickets thanks to the integration with traditional payment systems such as bank cards and digital wallets. As the number of platform users is growing fast, it means that token holders will receive bigger payouts and the team will be able to launch a lot of new games soon, whose development is nearing completion.We are also planning to sell our lottery tickets offline using QR code kiosks, which will enable us to compete with traditional lotteries. Their fans will be able to try our product and see its advantages.Want more information? You can always find us at gaming exhibitions and conferences. We will be happy to make new contacts and find new partners. In the near future, we will be taking part in Global Gaming Expo, Las Vegas (http://www.globalgamingexpo.com), and Summit of iGaming, Malta (https://sigma.com.mt).Web: https://firelotto.ioTelegram chat: https://t.me/firelottoTwitter: https://twitter.com/FireLottery", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "Friendz at Dubai Unlock Blockchain Event 14\u201315\u00a0January", "author_name": "Friendz", "link": "https://medium.com/friendz/friendz-at-dubai-unlock-blockchain-event-14-15-january-869a16b2b03d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 15, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "2.6K", "content": "Friendz at Dubai Unlock Blockchain Event 14\u201315\u00a0JanuaryFriendzBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 15, 20182018 starts off with a great opportunity for startups: the Unlock Blockchain forum in Dubai, at Ritz-Carlton Hotel on 14\u201315 of January.This is a two-days event where startups and ICO have the possibility to present their projects and meet investors.It will be possible to meet us and attend Friendz ICO presentation on Monday, January15 early afternoon.We are happy to talk to everyone who is interested in knowing what we do and start a collaboration together!Learn more about Friendz at www.friendz.ioJoin our telegram chat https://t.me/friendzICO", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "Why use the blockchain instead of a database?

What gives tokens\u00a0value?A primer on blockchain and token concepts for beginners.Mathew ChanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 23, 2018I see these questions asked all the time by novice investors entering the space, either for specific projects, or as a general question. So I thought I\u2019d attempt to write a detailed yet basic explanation on the utility of tokens, and what justifies the use of a blockchain.Basically, blockchain embodies a lot of game theory and incentive models. In order for a blockchain network to be valuable or useful, it has to have participants in a network, it would be worthless if Bitcoin only had me and you using it, there\u2019s not much value there in a barren network with not much utility.In order to secure participants, there needs to be some sort of incentive to attract them, the most common method is via issuance or reward of the token used in the network, the more participants, the more decentralized it is.So why not just a database, why do these projects need a blockchain?There are a few key benefits to decentralizing things instead of keeping it in a centralized server/database:ImmutabilitySecurityRedundancyOverhead/cost reductionAccountability/transparencyImmutabilityHaving records and data decentralized, and deployed on a blockchain makes it virtually impossible for any one party to tamper with data or records. Versus how it is now, if you host your data on let\u2019s say, your computer, you can easily edit that file, before you send it to someone else, how can I ensure I can trust you?SecurityTraditional servers or data are generally centralized, making it a likely target for malicious attacks. Just look at the Equifax\u2019s security breaches and other cybersecurity concerns arising in recent times. Instead of having a single or limited # of servers hackers can attack, decentralization via the blockchain greatly increases the difficulty. The more participants/nodes in a network, the more copies of the data there is. Therefore, if you want to tamper with the data, you will need to attack every single node on the network and alter all of their data simultaneously. Not only does blockchain make data tamper proof, it is also hard to breach. Every \u201cblock\u201d on a chain contains a certain amount of data, and when that block gets filled, much like a USB drive, it is encrypted and sealed forever. To get the full picture, hackers will need to hack not just the current block, but also every block before it. This is not only technically almost impossible, but it is costly, thereby reducing the incentive for malicious activities. Different blockchains have different security measures and algorithms, this is a generalization of the concepts.RedundancyYou basically have the same set of data distributed across the world, you don\u2019t need to worry if you lose your copy. This provides data resilience to corporations which gives peace of mind from any data corruption, server downtimes, etcOverhead/cost reductionHaving a decentralized network of nodes to maintain this ledger allows companies to offset and offload hosting, security, and maintenance costs. It removes a lot of the costs of IT staffing, Dev Ops, and infrastructural overhead. For example: Apple\u2019s servers are literally under attack constantly. They have teams, and teams of people monitoring their servers 24/7/365.AccountabilityWith all of the above in place, you can be sure that everything that is logged or deployed on the blockchain, is accurate, and true.All of this results in the ease of trust, and ease of the ability to do business in a transparent manner, without needing to trust the counter-party. You can simply leverage blockchain technology to let the data and facts speak for themselves.Do currently systems and data infrastructures work? Sure, but they are not perfect. They only exist the way they do because there hasn\u2019t been technology that could come along and offer a vast improvement until the introduction of Blockchain.Ok but what gives token value? Why are they\u00a0needed?Well, it really depends on the project. 90% of the projects out there are pure bullshit, but for sake of argument, I\u2019ll simply address it for the ones that have actual utility and use cases.As mentioned above, tokens are often used as a method of incentivizing participating in a network, therefore, a successful network means there are a plethora of participants, contributing to the decentralization and securitization of a network. The more participants, the more consensus there is that the network has utility, like Bitcoin. It was worth nothing when Satoshi first introduced it to the world, and it was only him on the network. But as it gained adoption, there is increasing consensus now that Bitcoin the token, has utility as a currency, and therefore intrinsic value between participants in the network.There are generally a few classes of tokens and each class derives value differently:Currency tokens\u200a\u2014\u200aTokens like Bitcoin, Monero, Raiblocks, etcUtility tokens\u200a\u2014\u200aTokens that allow you to essentially use or perform an activity on a network, such as ETH or ZRX. On the Ethereum network you would need to spend Ether (aka gas), to run a smart contract, etcAsset tokens\u200a\u2014\u200aTokens that represent an actual asset or productEquity tokens\u200a\u2014\u200aTokens that basically act like a share, and gives you some kind of voting right or consensus participationFor a currency token like Bitcoin, it\u2019s value is derived primarily on the use case of it being a currency/store of value.For utility tokens, value could come from the adoption and usage of the network, for example, the amount of data that gets put on the blockchain, and the amount of information that it\u2019s processing, as there are parties willing to pay transaction fees to nodes to process, validate, exchange, and secure that data. This could be decentralized exchanges, or businesses putting supply chain data on the blockchain, etc.For an asset token, this could be tied to the valuation of the assets (ie: Cryptokitties could be considered an asset, yet the underlying network powering it is Ethereum, thereby giving ETH value because it is a method of trade, and it now has utility to trade this asset) that it\u2019s tied to or represents. If a CryptoKitty is traded and its value is tied to a KittyCoin, then that would make KittyCoin an asset token.Equity tokens, this could be valued closer to the investor sentiment and the progress of the project itself. Are they getting business and real world adoption? What kind of voting power will token holders have? What is the future potential and direction of the company?So now that we know where value is derived from, what affects their\u00a0price?Every project and token may have different stimuli or economic models that affect price. Speculation aside, here\u2019s a few technical factors that affect it regardless of investor sentiment:Supply & demand\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is likely the largest factor in the valuation of a token, especially today, where the market is purely speculativeAdoption/utility\u200a\u2014\u200aIs there any activity on the network? What\u2019s the usage like?Burn rates\u200a\u2014\u200aDo tokens get burned over time or upon usage? What\u2019s the rate?Circulation & lockups\u200a\u2014\u200aHow much is in circulation? Is there any lockups?Generation of secondary token\u200a\u2014\u200a(like NEO/GAS), etcStaking\u200a\u2014\u200aDo you earn additional tokens by locking up and \u201cstaking\u201d your holdings to secure the network?Mined/premined\u200a\u2014\u200aHow much of the coins are released and what\u2019s the schedule? Or is it all mined already?So as you can see there are a large number of factors that can affect the valuation and price of a token, and \u201cwhy is a token even worth anything?\u201d is quite a broad question and requires an in-depth answer.I hope I\u2019ve explained the concepts of why a blockchain is needed and the incentive structure around decentralization and its benefits, as well as why tokens are needed and what drives value. With the cryptocurrency market increasingly saturated, it\u2019s important to understand the underlying technology and principles, so you can make discerning investments, and separate the signal from the noise.If anything\u2019s unclear or if I\u2019ve made any mistakes, please make a suggestion to improve this article!Good luck, and invest wisely!", "responses": "12"}, {"title": "How does blockchain work in 7 steps\u200a\u2014\u200aA clear and simple explanation.", "author_name": "Jimi S.", "link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/blockchain-for-beginners-what-is-blockchain-519db8c6677a?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 6, 2018", "readtime": "15 min read", "upvotes": "2.9K", "content": "How does blockchain work in 7 steps\u200a\u2014\u200aA clear and simple explanation.Jimi S.BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 6, 2018In 2017 the spirit of Bitcoin really got out of the bottle.

Some, such as supply chain logistics, are running at the limit of their data capacity. To handle more information than they currently do would require far more manual labour to collect and input data, making it no longer cost-effective. Still, businesses want a model where every stage of a product\u2019s lifecycle is logged, from assembly, to shipping, to later resales.Where Else Do Current Processes Fall\u00a0Short?The other issue with many different businesses and parties combining to complete one journey or sale is that the information they need to share is rarely transparent or readily available at each stage. This hampers communication and the exchange of real-time information. More poignantly, this information is even less available to customers, who often only find out about the status of their product when they actually receive it.How Can Blockchain Improve\u00a0This?The distributed ledger opens up a whole new world of possibilities.Firstly, there\u2019s no onus on one particular business to update, store and secure all of the product data. The storage is shared across a number of nodes and is not easily tampered with.That gives transparency to the process, too. Every state change is tracked, from origin through to the current moment, meaning contractors and customers alike can check on the progress and history of one particular item or order.But doesn\u2019t that data still need manual input?No. Thanks to blockchain\u2019s smart contracts. On meeting preset goals or targets, these can self-execute and store that transaction on the blockchain, making it available to everyone who needs access.Use CasesBusinesses that rely on moving perishable products from factories to their customers can have a traceable \u2018journey\u2019 for each bottle of beer or similar item.

No more handwritten logbooks and service records. Just an instantly accessible record of every repair, where it was manufactured, and what each owner has done to it.So Why Isn\u2019t Everyone Already On Blockchain?With any new technology, there\u2019s some resistance, coupled with a fondness, familiarity and even nostalgia for the old ways of doing things. Even when they don\u2019t work. Not every company has a strong computing resource to funnel into building and developing blockchain applications, at least not directly in-house.That\u2019s all beginning to change. Major software player SAP, who provide businesses with all kinds of programs and facilities to get their jobs done, has branched out into offering blockchain assistance and expansion. Not knowing how to start from scratch won\u2019t be an issue, with existing pilots and programs letting businesses buy into the necessary expertise.What Does This Mean for the\u00a0Future?As more companies move into the blockchain space, the more publishers and content creators will already be geared up for implementing MEDIA Protocol in order to share content and rewards.

What about Golem, Polkadot, or Interledger? I often get questions like this. So, I decided to write about how I answer those questions, via a first-principles framing.The quick answer: there\u2019s no one magic system called \u201cblockchain\u201d that magically does everything. Rather, there are really good building blocks of computing that can be used together to create effective decentralized applications. Ethereum can play a role, BigchainDB can play a role, and many more as well. Let\u2019s explore\u2026BackgroundThe elements of computing are storage, compute, and communications. Mainframes, PCs, mobile, and cloud all manifest these elements in their own unique ways. Specialized building blocks emerge to reconcile tradeoffs within a given element.For example, in the storage element we have both file systems and databases, where file systems are for storing blobs like mp3s with a hierarchy of directories and files, and databases are for storing structured metadata with a query interface like SQL [1]. In the centralized cloud, we might use Amazon S3 for blob storage, MongoDB Atlas for databases, and Amazon EC2 for processing.This article focuses on the blockchain landscape: the blocks for each element of computing, and some examples of systems manifesting each block. For each block, I will focus on being illustrative over thorough.Blockchain Building\u00a0BlocksHere is each element of computing, with related decentralized building blocks:Storage: token storage, database, file system / blobsProcessing: stateful business logic, stateless business logic, high performance computeCommunications: connect networks of data, of value, and of stateBlockchain Infrastructure LandscapeBlockchain technology is manifesting in each block, as this image shows [2]:StorageThe fundamental computing element of storage has the following building blocks.Token storage. Tokens are stores of value (e.g. assets, securities) whether it\u2019s Bitcoins, air miles, or digital art copyright. The main actions on a token storage system are to issue and transfer tokens (with many variants), while preventing double-spends and the like.Bitcoin and Zcash are two prominent \u201cpure play\u201d systems focusing solely on tokens. Ethereum happens to use tokens in service towards its mission of being a world computer. These are all examples of tokens given out as internal incentives to run the network infrastructure.Other tokens aren\u2019t internal to a network to power the network itself, but are used for incentives in a higher-level network where the lower-level infrastructure actually stores the tokens. One example is ERC20 tokens like Golem (GNT) running on top of the Ethereum mainnet. Another example is Envoke\u2019s IP licensing tokens, running on the IPDB network.Finally, I have listed a \u201c.*\u201d to illustrate that most blockchain systems have a mechanism for token storage.Database. Databases specialize in storing structured metadata, for example as tables (relational DB), document stores (e.g. JSON), key-value stores, time series, or graphs; and then rapidly retrieving that data via queries (e.g. SQL).Traditional distributed (but centralized) databases like MongoDB and Cassandra routinely store hundreds of Terabytes and even Petabytes of data, with throughput that can exceed 1 million writes per second, like here.Query languages like SQL are profound because they separate implementation from specification, and are therefore not bound to any particular application. SQL has been a standard for decades. This is why the same database system can be used across many different industries.Put another way: to generalize beyond Bitcoin to more applications without any application-specific code, you don\u2019t need to go all the way to Turing completeness. You just need a database. This has corresponding benefits in simplicity and scale. There are still great reasons to have Turing completeness in some places; we discuss this further in the \u201cdecentralized processing\u201d section.BigchainDB is decentralized database software; specifically a document store. Being built on MongoDB (or RethinkDB), it inherits the querying and scale of Mongo. But it also has blockchain-y characteristics like decentralized control, tamper-resistance, and token support. IPDB is a public net instance of BigchainDB, with governance.Also in the blockchain space, we can think of IOTA as a time-series database, if we squint a bit.File system / data blob storage. These are systems to store large files (movies, mp3s, large datasets), organized in a hierarchy of directories and files.IPFS and Tahoe-LAFS are decentralized file systems that wrap decentralized or centralized blob storage. FileCoin, Storj, Sia, and Tieron do decentralized blob storage. So does good old BitTorrent, though it uses a tit-for-tat scheme rather than tokens. Ethereum Swarm, Dat, and Swarm-JS do basically both.Data marketplace. These systems connect the data owners (e.g. enterprises) with data consumers (e.g. AI startups). While they\u2019re higher-level than databases and file systems, they are nonetheless core infrastructure because the countless applications that need data (e.g. anything AI) will depend on such services. Ocean is an example protocol & network, on which data marketplaces can be built. There are also application-specific marketplaces: Enigma Catalyst for crypto markets, Datum for personal data; and DataBroker DAO for IoT streams [2].ProcessingLet\u2019s discuss the fundamental computing element of processing.\u201cSmart contracts\u201d systems are the popular label for systems that do processing in a decentralized fashion [3]. This actually has two subsets with very different properties: stateless (combinational) business logic and stateful (sequential) business logic. Stateless vs stateful gives radical differences in complexity, verifiability, etc. There\u2019s a third decentralized processing building block: high-performance compute (HPC).Stateless (combinational) business logic. This is any arbitrary logic that does not retain state internally. In electrical engineering terms, it can be framed as combinational digital logic circuits. The logic is represented as a truth table, schematic diagram, or code holding conditional statements (combining if/then, and, or, not). Because they don\u2019t have state, it\u2019s easy to verify large stateless smart contracts, and therefore to build large verified / secure systems. N inputs and one output requires O(2^N) computations to verify.The Interledger Protocol (ILP) contains the crypto-conditions (CC) protocol to cleanly specify combinational circuits. CC is good to know of because it\u2019s becoming an internet standard via the IETF, and because ILP is getting widespread adoption among both centralized & decentralized payments networks (e.g. >75 banks via Ripple). CC has standalone implementations in JavaScript, Python, Java, and more. BigchainDB, Ripple, and other systems use CCs; and therefore support combinational business logic / smart contracts.Bitshares and Eos also support stateless business logic.Since stateful logic is a superset of stateless logic, then systems that support stateful logic also support stateless logic (at the expense of additional complexity and verifiability challenges).BigchainDB, Bitshares, and Eos also support events (example). This gives a level of persistence edging the functionality closer to stateful business logic (thanks to Ian Grigg for pointing this out [2]).Stateful (sequential) business logic. This is any arbitrary logic that does retain state internally. That is, it has memory. Or, it\u2019s a combinational logic circuit with at least one feedback loop (and a clock). For example, a microprocessor has an internal register that gets updated according to machine-code instructions that are sent to it. More generally, stateful business logic is a Turing machine that takes in a sequence of inputs, and returns a sequence of outputs. Systems that manifest (a practical approximation of) this are called Turing-complete systems [4].Ethereum is the best-known blockchain system that manifests stateful business logic / smart contracts running directly on-chain. Lisk, RChain, DFINITY, Aeternity, Tezos, Fabric, Sawtooth, and many more also implement it. Running code that\u2019s \u201cjust out there, somewhere\u201d is a powerful concept, with many use cases. This helps explain why Ethereum took off, why its ecosystem has grown such that it\u2019s almost a platform in its own right, and why so much competition has arisen in this building block.Because sequential logic is a superset of combinational logic, these systems also support combinational logic.Small mistakes in code can have grave consequences, as The DAO hack showed. Formal verification can help, just like it helped the chip industry. The Ethereum Foundation is working on this. But it has scale limitations. For combinational circuits, the number of possible mappings is 2^(number of inputs). For sequential, the number of internal states, is 2^(number of internal state variables) if your internal variables are all Boolean. For example, if you have a 3-input combinational circuit, it would have \u00b2\u00b3 =8 possible states to verify. But if it\u2019s a sequential circuit with a 32-bit register, then to fully verify you have to check \u00b2\u00b3\u00b2=4.2 billion states. This restricts the complexity of sequential circuits (if you want to trust them). \u201cCorrect-by-construction\u201d is another approach to trusting stateful smart contracts, like Rchain does using rho calculus.If you want decentralized processing, for many use cases there\u2019s a simpler approach: simply have processing on the client side within the browser or the mobile device, running JavaScript or Swift. Here, you have to trust the processing going on in your client, but if that\u2019s on the device in your hand it\u2019s often acceptable. We think of this as the \u201cfat client\u201d alternative to the \u201cfat protocols\u201d framing. This architecture is easy for mainstream web developers. For example, all that many webapps need is application state. To build this you just need JS + IPDB (using js-bigchaindb-driver). Or if your app also needs have blob storage and payments, then include the JS client versions of IPFS (ipfs.js) and Ethereum (web3.js). Here\u2019s an example:High-Performance Compute (HPC). This is processing to do \u201cheavy lifting\u201d compute for things like rendering, machine learning, circuit simulation, weather forecasting, protein folding, and more. A compute job here might take hours or even weeks on a cluster of machines (CPUs, GPUs, even TPUs).I see these approaches to decentralized HPC:Golem and iEx.ec frame it as a combination of decentralized supercomputer along with associated apps.Nyriad frames it as storage processing. Basically, the processing sits next to decentralized storage (which Nyriad also has a solution to).TrueBit lets 3rd parties compute but then doing post-compute checking (implicitly checking when possible; explicitly checking if questions get raised).Some folks are simply running heavy computation on VMs or Docker containers, and putting the result (final VM state, or just computed results) into blob storage with restricted access. Then, they sell access to these containers using, for example, tokenized read permissions. This approach asks more of clients to verify results, but the good thing is that all this tech is possible today. This will naturally combine with TrueBit as TrueBit matures.CommunicationsHere, we will cover the third and final fundamental computing element, of communications. There are many ways to frame communications; I will focus on connecting networks. It comes in three levels: data, value, and state.Data. In the 60s we got the ARPAnet. Its success spawned several similar networks like NPL and CYCLADES. A new problem arose: they didn\u2019t talk to each other. Cerf and Kahn invented TCP/IP in the 70s to connect them, to create a network of networks, which we now call the internet. TCP/IP is now the de-facto standard to connect networks. OSI was a competing set of protocols, but it\u2019s long faded; though, ironically, its model has proved useful. So, despite its age, TCP/IP is nonetheless a decentralized building block, for connecting networks of data.Tor Project can be seen as a TCP/IP overlay to help protect users\u2019 privacy. However, it\u2019s it has points of centralization, not to mention funding from the DoD which raises eyebrows. Tokenized Tor-like projects are emerging; stay tuned [2].Value. TCP/IP only connects networks on a data level. You can double-spend packets\u200a\u2014\u200asend the same packet to more than one destination at once\u200a\u2014\u200aand it doesn\u2019t care. But what about connecting networks where you can send value across the networks? For example, from Bitcoin to Ethereum, or even SWIFT payments network to say Ripple\u2019s XRP network. You only want the token to be able to go to one destination at a time. One way to connect networks while preventing double-spends is to use an exchange. But that\u2019s traditionally pretty heavy. However, you can strip an exchange to its essence and remove the need for a trusted middleman, by using cryptographic escrow. Alice can send money to Bob via Mallory, where Mallory is passing on the funds but cannot spend them (and there\u2019s a timeout so that Mallory can\u2019t stall things forever). This is the essence behind the Interledger Protocol (ILP). It\u2019s the same conceptual idea as two-way pegs (think sidechains) and state channels (think Lightning & Raiden); but the focus is 100% on connecting networks with respect to value. Besides ILP, there\u2019s also Cosmos which adds a bit more complexity for more convenience.State. Can we go beyond connecting networks of value? Imagine a computer virus with its own Bitcoin wallet that can hop from one network to another. Or a smart contract in Ethereum mainnet that can move its state to another Ethereum net, or another compatible net? Or, why restrict an AI DAO to just one net?This where Polkadot comes in, to connect networks of state. Aeternity also fits somewhere between the network-of-value and network-of-state spectrum.ExamplesWe\u2019ve now reviewed the three elements of computing (storage, processing, communications), the decentralized building blocks for each, and example projects within each building block.People are starting to build systems that manifest combinations. There many combinations of two blocks at once, usually IPFS + Ethereum or IPFS + IPDB. But there are even folks using three or more blocks. Here are a couple leading edge examples:Ujo uses IPFS|Swarm + IPDB + Ethereum for decentralized music, just as envisioned here. IPFS or Swarm are for file system and blob storage. IPDB (with BigchainDB) is used for metadata storage and querying. Ethereum is used for token storage and stateful business logic.Innogy uses IPFS + IPDB + IOTA for supply chain / IoT applications. IPFS is used for file system and blob storage. IPDB (with BigchainDB) is used for metadata storage and querying. IOTA is used for time-series data.Related WorkHere are related framings by others in the blockchain community; all of whom I\u2019ve had the pleasure to have great conversations with.Joel Monegro\u2019s \u201cFat Protocols\u201d framing emphasizes each building block as a protocol. I think this is a cool way of framing, though it constrains the building blocks to be talking to each other via a network protocol. There\u2019s another way: blocks could simply be one \u201cimport\u201d statement or library call away.Reasons for using an import could be (a) lower latency: a network call takes time which could hurt or kill the usability; (b) simplicity: using a library (or even embedded code) is usually just simpler than connecting on the network, paying tokens, etc; and (c ) more mature: the protocol stack is just emerging now. We have awesome Unix libraries going back decades, even Python and JS blocks going back 15+ years.Fred Ehrsam\u2019s \u201cDapp Developer Stack\u201d has an emphasis on web business models. While it\u2019s also very helpful, it does not aim to make a fine-grained distinction among blocks for a given element of computing (e.g. file system versus database).The BigchainDB whitepaper (first released Feb 2016) Figure 1 gave an earlier version of the stack of this post. For convenience, here it is:It focused on the building blocks of processing, file system, and database. It did not frame from the perspective of \u201celements of computing\u201d, and did not distinguish the types of decentralized processing. What I\u2019ve written in this post is an evolution of my thinking from that paper over the past year and a half; with continual updates in talks such as my May 22 talk at Consensus 2017 which is very similar to this article. (Part of my reason to write this post is that I\u2019ve received many requests to put it in writing:)The image also emphasized that you there\u2019s a spectrum from fully centralized (left) to fully decentralized (right). This is helpful for updating existing software systems to be more decentralized over time, focusing on updating blocks where decentralization helps the most.Stephan Tual\u2019s \u201cWeb 3.0 Revisited\u201d stack is spiritually similar to this post, though with a bigger focus on Ethereum. It does a good service to the community by trying to make a map that groups many projects into similar building blocks. I was happily surprised by how similar the thinking was to my own. However, its layer of blocks to serve applications (blocks for messaging, storage, consensus, governance,\u00a0..) is actually mixing three things: apps, the \u201cwhat\u201d, and the \u201chow\u201d. To me, blocks should be the \u201cwhat\u201d. So, messaging is an app (should be at the application level); storage needs to be more fine-grained; consensus is part of the \u201chow\u201d (hidden within some blocks); and governance is also part of the \u201chow\u201d (therefore also hidden). It also has [network] protocols as a separate lower-level block, though I see those as one of the possible ways that blocks can talk to each other, alongside library calls. Nonetheless, I think this is an excellent article and stack:)Alexander Ruppert\u2019s \u201cMapping the decentralized world\u201d has about 20 groupings of organizations, with the x-axis giving four higher-level groupings from infrastructure layer to application layer, but with middleware and liquidity as intermediate levels. This is a great piece too; I\u2019m happy to have helped Alex map it out. It has less emphasis on core infrastructure and more on broader trends; whereas this piece is all about core infrastructure from a first-principles framing.FutureSystems like Ujo combine many blocks together, such as IPFS or Swarm (for blobs) + Ethereum (for tokens and business logic) + IPDB & BigchainDB (for database with fast queries), and therefore leverage the benefits of all of these systems.I expect that this trend will accelerate as folks get a better understanding of how the building blocks relate. It\u2019s also more productive than framing everything into one monolith called \u201cblockchain\u201d.I expect this stack to continually evolve, as the decentralization ecosystem evolves. AWS started out as just one service: S3 for blob storage. Then it got processing: EC2. And it kept going; here\u2019s the full timeline. AWS now has more than 50 blocks; though of course a small handful remain the most important. Below is a picture of all the AWS services.Screenshot of services from aws.amazon.com July 15,\u00a02017.I envision something similar happening in the decentralization space. As a first cut, one could imagine a decentralized version of every single AWS block. However, there will be differences, since each ecosystem (cloud vs mobile vs decentralized) has its own special blocks, such as token storage for decentralization. It will be a fun ride!Notes[1] You can actually put further hierarchy into these building blocks. E.g. databases sit on top of file systems, which sit on raw data (blob) storage. And distributed databases involve communication. For example, most modern databases talk to the underlying storage via a file system like Ext4, XFS or GridFS. The framing I give in this article is that of an applications programmer: what\u2019s the UX for a file system, the UX for a database, etc.[2] I added some new content here in Sept 2017.[3] I\u2019ve never really liked the label \u201csmart contracts\u201d. They\u2019re not really smart in any AI-ish sense of the word. And they usually have nothing to do with \u201ccontract\u201d in any legal sense of the word. If they do include legals, they usually state so, e.g. with Ricardian contracts. The labels \u201cdecentralized processing\u201d and within it \u201cdecentralized business logic\u201d make more sense. However, given \u201csmart contract\u201d now has widespread use, so be it. I have better things to focus on than fighting over labels:)[4] I say \u201cTuring complete\u201d here in a practical sense, not in a theoretically pure sense. That is: the machine returns a string of outgoing bits as a function of the incoming bits and its current internal state; but practical in the sense of not running infinitely long or claiming to solve the \u201cwhen does the machine stop\u201d problem (halting problem).Thanks to the countless folks who have given me feedback on this stack over the last couple years. And thanks to Carly Sheridan, Troy McConaghy, and Dimi de Jonghe for through editing.

I had heard about Bitcoin and I knew it was a digital currency, but the only news that actually got (and still get) to the mainstream were typically negative or speculative, and did little to explain the technology behind it\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain. After watching a Netflix documentary \u201cBanking on Bitcoin\u201d I was finally interested in knowing more. And what a process it is, research, read, watch videos, interviews, rinse and repeat.As I see more and more people talking about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, I realize most of them don\u2019t know the basics of how this technology works. But even if you\u2019re only buying into this hype to speculate and make some money trading it\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is a perfectly legitimate thing\u200a\u2014\u200ahave you ever wondered what this technology really is?! For someone without a technical background it can be frustrating trying to navigate through articles and videos while being bombarded with words like \u201chash rate\u201d, \u201cconsensus\u201d, \u201cproof-of-work\u201d, \u201cminers\u201d. Give this article a chance, and I promise I will keep it simple!Bear in mind, I will not attempt to discuss if Bitcoin is a bubble or not, if it\u2019s used for illegal activities or not, if there are scammers using it to fool other people or not. My answer to those questions is a definite \u201cyes\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aas it would be if we were talking about traditional money. But that doesn\u2019t mean we should simply dismiss the technology. Blockchain is the underlying technology behind Bitcoin (and other digital currencies), but Bitcoin is only a part of its potential. If you would like to learn more about it, and be able to say something else other than \u201cBitcoin is a bubble\u201d, or \u201cBitcoin is used by criminals\u201d, go ahead and read on!What is\u00a0it?Simply put, a blockchain is a ledger that contains every transaction and every account balance on that blockchain since its creation (the accounts are actually called \u201cwallets\u201d). This ledger is permanently updated and replicated throughout the whole network of miners (think of miners as the network \u201caccountants\u201d that are connected to it and validate transactions between wallets). Up until the Blockchain technology came along, every form of digital currency faced at least one particular problem, which was \u201cdouble-spending\u201d. Since we are talking about digital money, anyone with the right set of skills could copy the money and potentially spend it more than once. As an example, consider person A issues a payment of 100 coins to person B. Person A then copies the payment transaction and sends it to person C and D. It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but I\u2019m keeping it simple! Addressing this issue was one of the revolutionary features of this technology.It enabled any digital currencies to finally become a trustless decentralized system. In fact, with this technology, anyone can start their own digital currency on its own blockchain. It\u2019s like anyone can be a central bank, issuing their own currency, provided it has some kind of purpose or utility. Person B, C and D do not need to worry if person A is attempting to double-spend the 100 coins or not, because the network of miners will validate only one of the transactions and communicate with the blockchain, posting that transaction, replicating it to the whole network, and updating the balances on each wallet involved. The other copies of the transaction will be discarded as the balance on person A wallet will be updated on the whole blockchain after every transaction.How does it\u00a0work?One key aspect that is usually more difficult to explain is the miners role in all this. Why are they connected to the blockchain and validate transactions? How do they actually validate the transactions?Every blockchain relies on the miners ability to validate transactions. If there are no miners, you can\u2019t send the currency to other people. The validation process is basically using computational power from the miners to look at the transaction and solve a calculation (let\u2019s call it a \u201cpuzzle\u201d) that will then be presented as solved to the network. The first miner to validate a specific transaction will receive a reward in the form of that digital currency. This is the actual process of producing new coins (like a central bank minting coins in the traditional banking system). Newly produced coins (rewarded to the miner) will be placed in the miner\u2019s wallet inside the blockchain. This is the much needed incentive to create a big enough network that is reliable, and above all, tamper proof.If we keep rewarding miners forever, you\u2019re probably wondering if the coin supply will then be infinite. In the case of Bitcoin, the supply is finite and there will be no more than 21 million Bitcoins in circulation. When Bitcoin was created, there were only a few hundred miners and a few thousand users and it was perfectly fine. The validation \u201cpuzzle\u201d difficulty was easier then, and you could be a miner with a regular laptop running simple software, and get a few bitcoins in a short amount of time. Today, you will need an expensive dedicated piece of hardware just to get started, because the \u201cpuzzle\u201d difficulty increased a lot. This difficulty increase is part of the original algorithm described in the Bitcoin whitepaper, and it will keep increasing until the last Bitcoin is \u201cminted\u201d.If you got this far, you may already have some\u200a\u2014\u200aor actually a lot\u200a\u2014\u200aof questions!The objective for this article was to give you a basic understanding of what the Blockchain technology is and how it works.

Instead of recalling an entire year\u2019s worth of a certain model, they may only need to account for the cars that were equipped with parts from a certain supplier.As a result, supply chains will become leaner and more efficient.The technology also aids auto companies in leveraging brand value to increase consumer interest.The march towards electric vehicles will continue, with or without subsidies.Currently, 20% of Americans admit they will probably buy an EV at some point in the future. And as concerns about potential mileage and charging options abate, EVs will become more mainstream.On a global level, cities and countries around the world are talking about banning sales of cars powered by internal combustion engines. Norway, India, France, and the UK have all set timetables for doing so\u200a\u2014\u200awith Norway looking at an ambitious 2025 deadline. Even China, the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is crafting a long-term plan for phasing out vehicles powered by fossil fuels.Ford and GM alone are planning on offering thirty-four fully electric models by 2023, while industry-wide EV reports estimate an overall increase in production.As more companies begin offering electric vehicles and competition grows, brands will need to distinguish their vehicles in ways that appeal to those who are interested in buying them.One way to do this is by adding brand value through the same supply chain mechanisms that can eliminate counterfeits. Tracking individual products and components through the supply chain ensures all the participants are acting ethically and provides proof the vehicle is being produced in a sustainable manner\u200a\u2014\u200aone that is true to the central mission of EVs.Investment in emerging technologies is essential for companies to remain competitive.One of the rationales GM gave for their extensive layoffs was that they wanted to avoid another near-death company experience like the one they had in 2008.So, they say much of the savings they expect to gain from the layoffs will go toward remaining competitive in the race for a market share of autonomous vehicles and EVs.Concurrent with GM\u2019s interest in new technologies, many other auto manufacturers have begun investigating how blockchain may help them. The Mobi consortium, a working group for standards in decentralized mobility and data sharing, was launched earlier this year. Members include household names in the auto industry like BMW, Ford, GM, and Renault\u200a\u2014\u200ain conjunction with tech providers like IBM, IOTA, and ConsenSys.When consortiums like this form, players usually begin with small use cases that can benefit everyone.In this case, it may be tamper-proof odometer tracking, responsible sourcing, or trusted ownership records. But the hope is that as the initial value of the group grows, more participants will join in order to reap the benefits.The reality is that auto manufacturers who don\u2019t embrace new technology to cut costs and improve their brand value will eventually fall behind. And right now, EVs, along with blockchain, are taking center stage as the next move into tech\u200a\u2014\u200asubsidized or not.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200a7 Benefits for the Financial Industry", "author_name": "Michiel Mulders", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-7-benefits-for-the-financial-industry-e51f67a5cc05?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 7", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "111", "content": "Blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200a7 Benefits for the Financial IndustryMichiel MuldersBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 7Photo by rawpixel on\u00a0UnsplashAccenture has estimated that the biggest investment banks could save up to $10 billion implementing blockchain technology as a mean of improving efficiency. Let\u2019s take a look at how the financial industry can benefit from blockchain technology.1. Instant SettlementsTransactions can be settled in less than a few seconds, while the current financial systems can take up to a week to settle payments. Using blockchain technology, settlements can be increasingly optimized reducing the amount of time and money needed.Besides that, blockchain will remove the need for a lot of middle office and back office staff at banks, as transactions settle almost instantly. As such, banks have an important drive to explore blockchain for improving settlements and some banks explore internal options first, while others explore options between banks first.2. Better Financial ProductsCreating crowdfunding mediums using blockchain technology offers a plethora of solutions to many common problems, from accessibility to transparency, and even expenses. With the inception of blockchain technology and its inclusion into the crowdfunding sphere, many unique types of fundraising have spawned as a result.One interesting example is the improvement of money circles, also called \u201crotating savings and credit association\u201d (ROSCA) where a group of people save and borrow money together. This happens via repeated contributions and withdrawals to and from a common fund. It acts as an informal financial institution which often involves a lot of distrust. Blockchain has the power and capabilities to add trust and stability to these so-called money circles.A project like AZ FundChain uses blockchain technology to improve transparency and trust among members of a money circle. AZ Fundchain uses social badges to even increase trust and manage reputation on-chain as users can leave reviews. The project focuses on adding a positive impact on existing social money circles to improve local communities and provide a conflict-free environment.AZ FundChain makes it possible to search for a money circle outside of your local community and filter for specific amounts, goals. or reputation levels. This gives you the ability to find the perfect money circle fit towards your needs.All parameters of the money circle are set in a smart contract that handles the transactions. The transactions itself are executed using the native AZ token which is the fuel of FundChain.3. Reduced Counterparty RisksWhen transactions are settled near instantly, it will remove a significant part of the risk that the counterparty cannot meet its obligations, which could be a substantial expense for banks.4. Improved Contractual PerformanceThe use of smart contracts can shorten the time needed to finish a financial process or transaction as a smart contract allows a bank to automate a process flow including transactions.Especially complex financial asset transactions can benefit from blockchain, due to automatic settlement using smart contracts under the control of an incorruptible set of business rules.The only difficulty here is that a bank has to comply with any regulatory compliances, across jurisdictions if needed.5. Increased TransparencyTransparency greatly increases by using smart contracts and blockchain technology. The entire monetary flow is recorded on-chain and can be audited by any party.This transparency is a benefit but it can also be a threat. Financial transparency is needed, however, not every user wants to see his full private profile being disclosed on-chain. Therefore, several privacy-minded solutions have been developed.Zero-Knowledge Proof technology: Allows someone to verify your data without actually disclosing it.Enigma Secret Contracts: Encrypt data inside smart contract using Enigma protocol and network.Confidential Transactions: A scheme invented by Gregory Maxwell for hiding the transaction amounts using math called homomorphic encryption along with range proofs to completely obscure transaction amounts.Privacy focussed coins like Dash, Monero, ZCash,\u00a0\u2026Transparency is a benefit but it can also be a\u00a0threat\u20266. Money TransfersSending money to another country is an area ready for change, and banks are already using blockchain for remittances. Consumers and businesses send hundreds of billions of euros internationally every year, and the process has traditionally been slow, full of bureaucracy, and expensive.Bitcoin provided an \u201calternative\u201d way to move money, however, mainstream banks don\u2019t like the idea of using a volatile cryptocurrency without any regulations. However, several major banks have partnered with Ripple or Stellar to facilitate cross-border payments using blockchain technology.7. Reduced Fraud Via Self Sovereign IdentityBlockchain technology resists hacking, DDOS attacks, and other forms of fraud. It can also help banks and others identify individuals quickly and accurately through a blockchain-enabled digital ID.With less fraud, business operations improve and the costs decrease. Also, users have more control over their identity and the data they want to share.ConclusionBlockchain is still relatively new, although banks and other industries are already innovating with blockchain technology. At this point, the technology is probably ahead of regulations, and it\u2019s not always clear what to expect in terms of protection, privacy, potential risks, and dispute resolution. Those issues can all be solved, but it\u2019s critical to research and understand what problems may arise before using blockchain for significant transactions.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How Blockchain Technology Is Altering The Apparel\u00a0Industry", "author_name": "Samantha Radocchia", "link": "https://medium.com/betterkinds/how-blockchain-technology-is-altering-the-apparel-industry-50aaa492050?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 10, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "59", "content": "How Blockchain Technology Is Altering The Apparel\u00a0IndustrySamantha RadocchiaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 10, 2018In the past, a lack of transparency into an apparel company\u2019s supply chain could be seen as a competitive advantage. Businesses wanted to keep insight into their suppliers and manufacturers as opaque as possible.If no one knew where supplies were coming from, no one could build identical apparel. And this thinking extended to customers, out of sight meant out of mind when it came to worries about ethical sourcing and manufacturing in the fashion industry.It\u2019s clear there has been a shift in the way companies and consumers view transparency.It\u2019s now an advantage for everyone to know where your clothes come from, thanks to consumer trends and companies like Better Kinds that focus on decentralized manufacturing. Consumers increasingly demand it, while companies like Patagonia and Everlane tout sustainability and supply chain transparency as a selling point.But there\u2019s still plenty of work to be done. Many apparel companies lack ethical supply chains, and a full 10% of global emissions are produced by the industry alone.Fortunately, the blockchain has already begun transforming apparel supply chains through technology such as track-and-trace and inventory management. But as other technologies like 3D printing and AI continue to advance, the apparel industry may very well see much more dramatic changes.Here\u2019s how the industry is advancing\u200a\u2014\u200aand what\u2019s to come:Blockchain technology is already transforming the apparel supply\u00a0chain.The blockchain solutions in the industry stem from its unique ability to create a physical-digital link between goods and their digital identities on a blockchain.Often, a cryptographic seal or serial number acts as the physical identifier, linking back to the individual product\u2019s \u201cdigital twin.\u201dThis link offers opportunities for a more transparent supply chain. Every time a product changes hands, that change in custody is recorded on the blockchain. Counterfeit goods missing the physical-digital link are obvious, as are any attempts to divert goods. The chain of custody on blockchain provides a record of the last party to gain custody of the product, showing where the counterfeit product slipped in\u200a\u2014\u200aor the authentic product was diverted out.Greater transparency into supply chains will create new incentives for companies to change the way they do business and even how they view themselves as an organization.Companies like Loomia are working on solutions to collect consumer data directly from the textiles themselves and register that data on the blockchain.But truthfully, blockchain is only the beginning. The industry may be entering a new era with vastly different forms of production and consumption.Companies are rethinking their brand positioning and business\u00a0models.Millennials are not consuming as much fast fashion, and they tend to distrust spurious claims of sustainability.Too many brands have been exposed as wasteful, environmentally unfriendly, or simply unethical. The backlash to fast fashion is evident in a younger generation less impressed with labels and happy to purchase vintage pieces that have stood the test of time.Apparel companies are beginning to take note, in some cases attempting to transform their business\u00a0models.Take Nike, for example. They don\u2019t position themselves as an apparel company anymore. Instead, they talk about themselves as a tech company that just so happens to make clothes. Their clothes and shoes often come equipped with sensors for tracking heart rate, miles run, or calories burned.That\u2019s because data is now the most compelling business model. And the companies that will thrive in the coming years are those that can reinvent themselves to keep up with changes in technology and society.The entire culture is shifting to keep up with technology and\u00a0trends.Blockchain technology can help the industry track apparel through the supply chain, which in itself is a major upgrade in the way many companies do business.Yet the future of apparel is more about a change in the business model and culture of the industry, from a supply chain that prizes consumption to a demand chain that takes pride in sustainability.A shift from a supply chain to a demand chain will mean clothing production moves back to local, distributed hubs.Imagine a consumer walking into a store to buy a t-shirt. They use a screen to choose the type of fabric, the cut\u200a\u2014\u200aeven the brand. After a short wait, they have the exact shirt they want in their hands.Truthfully, this model is not that far fetched. The technology is already here to begin making clothing quickly and locally, and it\u2019s not just going to change the way apparel is made. It\u2019s going to change patterns of consumption and behavior. People will make what they need, when they need it.Brands will have to think ahead and position themselves to integrate with the technology. They\u2019ll need to answer fundamental questions about their existence. How do they maintain their brand\u2019s integrity? Do the concepts of scarcity and exclusiveness still play a role in the brand\u2019s image? What does it mean to be authentic if people can make clothing at home, on demand?The apparel industry is going to be unraveling the answers to those questions for a long time to come. But if the current trends continue, the results will dramatically change the way individuals shop for and consume clothing.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Guide to blockchain for trade finance\u200a\u2014\u200apart\u00a01", "author_name": "Hijro", "link": "https://medium.com/@Hijro/guide-to-blockchain-for-trade-finance-part-1-31e992f96d4c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 27, 2016", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "54", "content": "Guide to blockchain for trade finance\u200a\u2014\u200apart\u00a01HijroBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 27, 2016Originally Published on gtreview.comIn this weekly four-part series, Fluent Network\u2019s founders Lamar Wilson and Casey Lawlor provide GTR readers an overview of how blockchain technology provides transparency, streamlines asset transfer and lowers the operating costs of global trade finance programmes for all relevant parties. Read the entire series with Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.Part 1: Building a networkTrade finance programmes have played an integral part in supporting the increase in global commerce since the financial crisis of 2008. Their usage has led to increased output, directly correlated with lowered supplier insolvency risk. Increasingly, the focus of the industry has moved towards improving the inefficiencies of trade finance in a push towards mass adoption. Blockchain technology continues to show the greatest potential to streamline trade finance and maximise the value it delivers to business and financial institutions alike.Today the most important metric to gauge the financial health of a large business is predictable, well-managed working capital. Currently, there are three different ways to improve working capital: getting paid earlier (reducing days sales outstanding or DSO), managing inventory better (improving days inventory outstanding or DIO), or paying your suppliers later (increasing days payable outstanding or DPO). While all are viable options, increasing DPO by way of extended payment terms has proven to be the most permanent and in most cases, the most practical. Studies show that over the past 10 years, nearly every industry has increased payment terms by 0.5 to 2.5 days each year. This has led to almost all companies pushing payment terms to 90, 120, and even as far as 585 days.Unfortunately, this adds a tremendous amount of risk to the supply chains\u200a\u2014\u200athe life-blood of many of these institutions. Suppliers with high DSO must inevitably look to strenuous, rigid and sometimes expensive working capital solutions outside the buyer-supplier relationship or take early payments at a discount equivalent to extremely high annual percentage rates (APR) to continue operations.Trade financing services for smaller international suppliers, such as factoring, inventory financing, purchase order financing and short-term business loans, can include rates of up to 50% APR. These high rates lead to higher prices, an inability to expand operations to satisfy other customers and increase supplier insolvency risk. Are the benefits of increased cashflow worth the risks associated with a fragile supply chain?Blockchain and distributed ledger technology increases the speed, transparency and verifiability of digital asset transfer and ownership.When viewing supply chains holistically as collaborative entities striving for an efficient end-to-end transfer of value from raw materials to the final consumer, DPO, while extremely popular, can\u2019t be your only consideration. In recent years this perspective has led to a holistic approach to management of the global supply chain via trade finance. Lower cost of capital for even tier-3 suppliers can increase throughput, prevent disruptions and lower the cost of a supplier doing business with said buyer.Unfortunately, procurement and merchandising teams continue to rely heavily on personal relationships, paper-based processes, manual co-ordination of remittance advice and opaque, siloed systems. The collection of information, documents, and the eventual perfection of interest in the underlying asset necessary to provide financing is extremely time-consuming and costly for financial institutions.Suppliers and their enterprise counterparts must soon incorporate technical innovations to increase efficiency and lower risk, allowing them dependable access to cheaper working capital. Often those deemed too risky (primarily small international suppliers) are excluded despite having razor-thin margins, zero negotiating leverage and, thus, the highest need for these solutions.One of the most recent innovations to gain the spotlight of the trade finance industry is blockchain and distributed ledger technology that increases the speed, transparency and verifiability of digital asset transfer and ownership. Recently, Citibank highlighted blockchain in its US Digital Banking Research Report as having massive potential to improve both supply chain logistics, management and supply chain finance.A blockchain-based distributed ledger contains a multitude of properties, some of which lend themselves extremely well to trade finance programmes, such as:Immutability and timestampingProvenance of goodsStreamlining settlementP2P transfer of ownership of digital assetsSmart contracts and automationSecure distribution of \u2018single source of truth\u2019The ability to securely connect previously siloed trade finance participants across both supply chains and financial institutions allows for transparency and a massive reduction of risk, manual processes and co-ordination between institutions.Over this four-part series we will discuss the benefits of a distributed ledger with the above properties to buyers, suppliers and financial institutions participating in trade finance programmes.Next week:Streamlining payments and settlement, reducing operating costs and establishing the framework for automated payables.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Combating Illicit Markets With Blockchain: Why Smart Supply Chains Solutions Are\u00a0Needed", "author_name": "Samantha Radocchia", "link": "https://blog.chronicled.com/combating-illicit-markets-with-blockchain-why-smart-supply-chains-solutions-are-needed-c9e82d3f4380?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 24, 2018", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "54", "content": "Combating Illicit Markets With Blockchain: Why Smart Supply Chains Solutions Are\u00a0NeededSamantha RadocchiaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 24, 2018Even if you carefully check the labels, stickers, and stamps on every product you buy at retail stores or online shopping websites, chances are high you\u2019ll still end up purchasing a product from today\u2019s booming illegal economy.From eyeshadow containing unknown allergens to phone chargers that catch fire, counterfeit and fake items are everywhere.The steady rise in global consumerism has fueled these illicit markets, making it even more profitable to engage in activities that harm the environment, health of individuals and society as a whole.As former President of the OECD Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade, David Luna said:\u201cThe size of illicit markets is massive. An array of consumer goods are impacted, from medicines and electronics to shoes, apparel and auto parts. They\u2019re extremely profitable, so we see a tremendous amount of fake goods, and some, possibly dangerous. Smart products, cosmetics, movies, watches\u200a\u2014\u200ayou name it, there are counterfeits. The reality is that every IP product can be counterfeited by criminals and illicit networks.\u201dMost companies aren\u2019t thrilled with illicit products, either. They can harm brand names, deplete profits and tarnish reputations for years.That\u2019s why diversion and counterfeiting are the most frustrating roadblocks legitimate companies face. And crucially, blockchain is poised to reduce both of these issues in supply chains around the world.Here\u2019s why these issues matter and how they can be stopped:The top illicit trade markets are becoming larger every\u00a0day.1. Pharmaceuticals: The World Health Organization reports that in developing countries, 10% of medical products are either falsified or substandard. That\u2019s an alarmingly large chance a medication may be unhelpful at best\u200a\u2014\u200aand life-threatening at worst.2. Food: With the world\u2019s grocery market set to reach $11.8 trillion by 2020, there\u2019s ample reason for bad actors to counterfeit or divert food products. With more foods than ever potentially involved, consumers are learning to take a second look at everything from the olive oil on U.S. shelves to the seafood in supermarkets and restaurants.3. Luxury Apparel And Consumer Goods: The 2017 Worldwide Luxury Market Monitor report by Bain & Company predicts the annual sales for personal luxury goods will reach $312 billion by 2020.And with almost half (47%) of brands losing sales revenue to counterfeit or pirated goods\u200a\u2014\u200aaccording to new research from brand protection firm MarkMonitor\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s no small loss. For consumer goods, a 2017 report by the ICC\u2019s Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy (BASCAP) and the International Trademark Association (INTA), in partnership with Frontier Economics, estimates global economic value of counterfeiting and piracy could reach $2.3 trillion by 2022.4. Tobacco Products: According to the OECD, lost revenue to governments from illicit cigarettes are estimated at $40\u201350 billion dollars every year. In Europe, the illicit cigarette market is estimated at over 9% of total consumption, representing a \u20ac10.2 billion loss in tax revenue every year.5. Auto/Transportation: There are now more than one billion vehicles on the road around the world. According to the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA), the global automotive industry loses $12 billion annually to counterfeit auto parts including, brake pads, brake discs, tires, radiators, alloy rims, filters, cables, airbags and master cylinders. And again, the incentives to make a profit from counterfeit parts is enormous.6. Environmentally-Sensitive Goods: Every year, an estimated $133 billion of fuels are illegally stolen, adulterated or defrauded from legitimate petroleum companies. And goods such as oil, timber, diamonds and gold can be especially susceptible to diversion due to their value in secondary markets. It\u2019s also difficult to track where these commodities came from once they\u2019ve been extracted.7. Corruption And Money Laundering: The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2\u20135% of global GDP, or $800 billion to $2 trillion in U.S. dollars. Money laundering is often directly related to the rest of these issues, because the money earned from illicit activities must be \u201ccleaned\u201d before it can be used for legitimate purposes.8. International Foreign Assistance: Sadly, foreign aid isn\u2019t safe from thieves and counterfeiters. In fact, governments and organizations face massive challenges when it comes to making sure aid actually reaches those who need it most. And with the global aid business at $158 billion in 2016, the potential for loss is incredibly high.9. Defense: In 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s budget was nearly $600 billion. The DOD gives out billions of dollars worth of contracts every year. And as we recently saw with the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Logistics Agency\u200a\u2014\u200awhich couldn\u2019t account for more than $800 million\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s not always clear where the money goes.Counterfeiting is also a serious concern. When parts are being manufactured for aircraft, weapons and highly-specialized items, it\u2019s of the utmost importance that inauthentic items stay out of the supply chain.10. Art, Wine, High-Value Collectibles Fraud And Theft: High-end products and collectibles are naturally targeted by counterfeiters due to the potential for equally high returns.Fine art is one of the most notorious spaces, with the Fine Arts Expert Institute in Geneva, Switzerland estimating that half of all artworks in circulation are fakes. With the global art market measured at $63.7 billion USD in 2017, it\u2019s easy to see why thieves and counterfeiters are so attracted to the art world.But the fine art market isn\u2019t the only one counterfeiters flock to. The U.S. market for online antiques and collectibles sales is $2 billion, with an annual growth of 7.2% from 2013\u20132018. Meanwhile the global animations collectibles market is estimated to be worth $6.5 billion by 2021.Sports memorabilia is also particularly susceptible to fraudulent schemes. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, roughly 90% of sports collectibles are counterfeit. Even renowned trophies like the Heisman aren\u2019t immune.And amazingly, even wine has become a favorite target of counterfeiters, who\u2019ve opened up a booming market in China.Blockchain technology is incredibly useful for identifying and registering goods in these\u00a0markets.The blockchain is ideal for helping with counterfeits and diversion because of its ability to create unique identities for individual items.By using barcodes, serial numbers, or cryptographic seals, companies can create a link between the physical object and its digital life on the blockchain.This one-to-one link results in greater transparency and trust in the authenticity of goods. When an authentic product is first manufactured, it can be registered on blockchain. That item now has an identity attached to it, and the blockchain is updated every time the item changes hands\u200a\u2014\u200afrom a manufacturer to a distributor or from a wholesaler to a retailer.A verifiable chain of custody makes it much easier to detect where the gaps in the supply chain occur.If diversion is happening because a certain distributor is selling products to an unauthorized dealer, the disappearance of those items from the supply chain can be detected and traced back to the last party to have custody of the products.Counterfeit goods will also be easier to identify, because they\u2019ll lack a registered blockchain identity. Many will offer visible clues if they\u2019re missing the cryptographic seal that appears on authentic goods.Combating illicit trade will take more than just one technology, but blockchain is uniquely positioned to help suppress the two biggest issues contributing to the growth of these markets.For now, that\u2019s a good place to begin.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Technology Fridays: Tendermint Wants to be the Zookeeper of the Blockchain World", "author_name": "Jesus Rodriguez", "link": "https://cryptocurrencyhub.io/technology-fridays-tendermint-wants-to-be-the-zookeeper-of-the-blockchain-world-90bbe3c3f5aa?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 20, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "56", "content": "Technology Fridays: Tendermint Wants to be the Zookeeper of the Blockchain WorldJesus RodriguezBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 20, 2018Welcome to Technology Fridays! Today we are going back to blockchain land with one of my favorite technologies of the last year: Tendermint. The reason I like this platform so much is not only because they have one of the best names in the entire blockchain ecosystem( no offense anybody) but also because they solve one of the biggest problems in distributed systems in general and blockchain technologies specifically. In essence, Tendermint is a new protocol that leverages many concepts of blockchain architectures to enable the implementation of highly available and fault tolerant distributed systems.At a first glimpse, the value proposition of Tendermint doesn\u2019t seem exactly unique. After all, we have plenty of well-established technologies like Zookeeper or Consul that have proven to be very effective providing the infrastructure for highly available systems. The unique differentiator of Tendermint is that leverages a principle known as the Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) that was made popular by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. BFT was originally created in 1999 as a solution to the famous Byzantine General\u2019s Problem but it was not formally implemented until the first release of Bitcoin in 2008. In some sense, blockchain technologies can be seen as a reformalization of BFT in a more modern setting, with emphasis on peer-to-peer networking and cryptographic authentication. Tendermint, adopts BFT models to the domain of replicated state machines (blockchains), using blocks, hash-linking, dynamic validator sets, and rotating leader election.Trending Cryptocurrency Hub Articles:1. What will happen to Bitcoin and the crypto-market in\u00a020182. New Crypto Game on the\u00a0Block!3. The Bitcoin Bubble Explained to a Couple of Four-Year Old\u00a0TwinsFunctionally, Tendermint uses BFT to securely and consistently replicate the state of nodes in a network. Tendermint security model works even if up to 1/3 of machines fail in arbitrary ways. The consistency model ensures that every non-faulty machine sees the same transaction log and computes the same state. From the architecture standpoint, Tendermint consists of two chief technical components: a blockchain consensus engine and a generic application interface. The consensus engine, called Tendermint Core, ensures that the same transactions are recorded on every machine in the same order. The application interface, called the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI), enables the transactions to be processed in any programming language.The abstraction of the Tedermint architecture using those two fundamental components makes it relatively easy to understand. In Tendermint architectures, Tendermint Core (the \u201cconsensus engine\u201d) communicates with the application via a socket protocol that satisfies the ABCI. The communication protocol is based on three main types of messages:1. DeliverTx to deliver transactions2. CheckTx to validate transactions3. Commit to successfully signal the completion of a transactionHow are these messages being used? Well, Tendermint Core creates three ABCI connections to the application; one for the validation of transactions when broadcasting in the mempool, one for the consensus engine to run block proposals, and one more for querying the application state.ConsensusThe consensus protocol is the main value proposition of the Tendermint platform. Tendermint consensus algorithm begins with a set of validators. Validators maintain a full copy of the blockchain and are identified by their public keys. They take turns proposing blocks at each new block height. There is at most one proposer per voting round. Each proposal is signed by a validator\u2019s corresponding private key so that the validator responsible for it can be identified if some failure were to occur. The rest of the validators then vote on each proposal, signing their votes with their private keys. This constitutes a single round. But it may take several rounds before a new block is committed due to network asynchrony.Developers can start using Tendermint by downloading the latest release from the website and running through the simple installation process. After the install, developers will be able to build a simple application that interacts with the ABCI interface to process and commits transaction. Additionally, the current release enables the addition of new nodes such as validators or non-validators to the network.Tendermint is a new project in the blockchain world but it has already been adopted by major projects. Cosmos, BigChainDB and OmiseGo are some examples of blockchain projects using the Tendermint platform.Competitors?Tendermint is fundamentally used as a platform to ensure the high availability and fault tolerance capabilities of a distributed system. From that perspective, Tendermint competes with well-established projects such as Zookeeper or Consul. On the blockchain world, other BFT protocols such as Casper or Burrow can be seen as alternatives to Tendermint.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Combating Water Wars: What It Means To Manage Our Supply With Blockchain", "author_name": "Samantha Radocchia", "link": "https://blog.chronicled.com/combating-water-wars-what-it-means-to-manage-our-supply-with-blockchain-89b079cc925a?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 15, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "59", "content": "Combating Water Wars: What It Means To Manage Our Supply With BlockchainSamantha RadocchiaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 15, 2018When you start talking about water usage, you realize the significant complexity of the subject.Water covers about 70% of the planet. Yet less than 3% of it is drinkable freshwater. And only about 1% of that freshwater is easily accessible to humans.While many people in the U.S. don\u2019t think twice about turning on the taps, other areas of the world\u200a\u2014\u200aand the country\u200a\u2014\u200aare not so lucky.Water isn\u2019t just seen as a basic human need. It\u2019s also viewed as a commercial necessity and a commodity to be bought and sold, which leads to conflicts and debates about how best to use this valuable resource.And as water scarcity increases, a system will need to be developed in order to keep track of water usage and\u00a0rights.There are plenty of challenges when it comes to tracking water and incentivizing players to work towards the benefit of the population as a whole. However, it\u2019s more and more likely that blockchain will be a key player in creating a sustainable system of water use.Tracking water begins with understanding the challenges.Water is a basic human need. But when that need runs up against the demands of a large population, agricultural interests, and industrial uses, the decisions about who can access it become murky.The much-lauded film Water & Power: A California Heist documented some of the challenges that face governments and landowners trying to control and regulate the flow of fresh water. It shows how a few powerful land-owning interests were able to divert water to their advantage\u200a\u2014\u200abut to the detriment of several towns\u200a\u2014\u200athroughout the state of California.Questionable deals involving water supplies are not isolated incidents. Nestle has a well-documented history of profiting off water it provides to people in countries where its availability is scarce.Corporate decisions, poor policy and severe drought all test society\u2019s ability to provide fresh\u00a0water.For example, in Cape Town, South Africa, residents are on the verge of running out of water. People may soon be limited to 6.6 gallons of water, which must be picked up from distribution centers around the city. (To compare, the average American uses 60\u201380 gallons per day).And by 2025, two-thirds of the world\u2019s population may face water shortages.The solutions to the water crises are complex, and they involve an amalgam of many different participants\u200a\u2014\u200afrom individual users to multi-national corporations.Once you know the challenges, it\u2019s about utilizing the right incentives.This is not an issue that will go away without buy-in from the many people who help develop, control, and sustain fresh water sources around the globe.Infrastructure leaders, governments and corporations all need to come together around this problem to make long-term water sustainability a reality. The issue is that each player has their own incentives for managing the water supply.Some companies are already working to solve water issues. But ultimately, corporate responsibility may stem from a combination of public demand, tax breaks, or even additional, carbon-style taxes aimed at reducing the waste or pollution of water.Infrastructure leaders also have an important role to play. The way nations build and design new infrastructure will have a massive effect on water distribution and consumption in the future.Governments, too, will need to rise to the occasion and work to solve these issues. Often, legislative action is necessary to enforce changes in how people use and conserve water. The taxes, infrastructure plans and new initiatives have to be implemented by elected leaders.A blockchain system can help solve challenges and enforce incentives.Blockchain can\u2019t yet track the flow of water. But it can increase efficiency, reduce costs and evolve how physical commodities like water are distributed.Governments around the world are already considering how blockchain can be used to create smart cities that efficiently distribute utilities. The city of Fremantle, Australia is currently gearing up to experiment with a blockchain-based system for energy and water distribution. The goal is a resilient, inexpensive and energy efficient system running on a blockchain.Meanwhile, Melbourne, Australia has already partnered with the startup Civic Ledger to utilize a blockchain-based application designed to improve the water trading market in Australia.And cities aren\u2019t the only entities using blockchain to solve issues in the water\u00a0supply.Genesis Research & Technology Group has created a new water purification system for the wastewater collected after oil and gas drilling. They\u2019re building an IoT water quality sensor that will be able to store water quality records on the Ethereum blockchain. Their goals are to make the wastewater usable again and reduce the energy needed to transport the water to storage sites.All of these efforts revolve around using blockchain to increase the speed and efficiency of the projects. This saves time and money, and makes it feasible for governments and corporations to follow through on proposed solutions.Follow through is essential, because the only way to manage our water supply is by encouraging cooperation among the many players with a stake in the way people use the most precious resource on earth.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Blockchain In Entertainment Industry", "author_name": "CoinSwitch", "link": "https://blog.coinswitch.co/blockchain-in-entertainment-industry-3ddb12ccbfbe?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 2, 2018", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "175", "content": "Blockchain In Entertainment IndustryCoinSwitchBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 2, 2018Blockchain in Entertainment IndustryThis is the 6th article in the series of\u200a\u2014\u200aHow to Find Your Next Cryptocurrency Investment?Around two years ago, Bitcoin and blockchain technology took the world by storm. Not many knew what they were or what they did. What they did know was that Bitcoins were becoming more valuable by the day and the technology behind it was gaining traction everywhere. Today, after some part of the hype has died down, we have started looking at them more objectively.Blockchain technology, in particular, has come under enhanced scrutiny. People have tried to understand its concept, its flaws and looked for potential applications of blockchain in various fields. As such, a number of different applications have sprung up, some pretty surprising. Many of them are,surprisingly, in the entertainment industry.In fact, Blockchain technology is not only going to be used in the entertainment industry. It is poised to transform and revolutionize it.Role of blockchain and cryptocurrency in entertainment industryEntertainment industry and Blockchain technology\u200a\u2014\u200aWithout a doubt, this seems like a very odd pair at first. But as we dig deeper, we get to know about certain qualities of blockchains and cryptocurrencies which can completely change the face of the entertainment industry.#1Firstly, Cryptocurrencies makes micropayments possible. This is a big change which can be brought in the entertainment industry. Think about buying a single song for 50 cents. That might be difficult given the traditional systems of payments. The large amount of transaction charges would make itburdensome. However, it is completely possible using Cryptocurrencies.#2Secondly, blockchain can be used to create smart contracts. These contracts will only be executed when the system recognizes that certain criteria have been met. As such, no human intervention whatsoever would be required while doing transactions using blockchain technology.#3Finally, blockchain makes product tracking possible. So, there can be a giant public repository of records which will help sellers know who has purchased their content and when. Since the entire system will be full-proof and secured by the community itself, it will be very difficult for anyone to break in and change records.Application of blockchain technology in the entertainment industryUntil now, we have seen those qualities of blockchain technology which can change the face of the entertainment industry. Now, let us take a look at the applications of these qualities and how change can be brought about.#1 Blockchain solves the problem of content distributionTill a few years back, any artist who was serious about making a career had to be at the mercy of the big labels. Until and unless he could get a contract from them, he would have found it very difficult to break in. No doubt, we have had some changes over the past few years. YouTube has gained popularity. So,artists can showcase their talent there and create a name for themselves. Also, there are certain platforms which allow customers to pay directly for purchasing music of independent artists. However, the issue of a platform persists. Some middleman is always needed, whether it is YouTube or those big distribution companies. Blockchain technology can change that. Using smart contracts, an independent artist can make sure that a customer receives the content as soon as the payment is made.And bang! It does not require any middleman whatsoever.#2 Digital Rights ManagementAny content online has this common issue related to it; the one regarding intellectual and digital rights. Who owns the content? Who can download it? If someone pays for it and downloads it from some other source, can he keep it? The list goes on. Day in and day out, we keep hearing about some or the other issue regarding digital rights.Blockchain technology, using a giant public ledger, can put an end to this menace. Any content created can be tagged and all transactions regarding the content can be tracked. In case of any dispute, all one needs to do is check the history of that content. This will be beneficial for the customer, the artist aswell as any middleman involved in the transaction.#3 Tracking of tangible\u00a0goodsExpensive and rare goods have a special ring attached to them. People come in droves to check them out. The problem, however, is that they are attractive for fraudsters too. Today, there is rampant copying of artworks. Plus, the technology that we have today has made creating fakes even easier. Thisis a serious issue and reduces peoples\u2019 faith in the system.Blockchain can help in solving this problem to a large extent. Any work of art created can be attached with an RFID or similar tag. Now, wherever this artwork goes, genuine buyers will know about its location. In this way, buyers can cross-check the authenticity of the artwork being sold to him.#4 GamingFirstly, blockchain can help in solving issues relating to distribution and ownership as mentioned above. Consumers can sleep better and indie game developers would get a way to distribute their games. For example, any developer creating android apps can directly sell his applications to consumers. But, that is not all.Blockchain technology solves the problem of digital ownership. Conversely, it introduces the concept of digital scarcity. Previously, any digital content could have any number of copies. However, that will no more be the case after blockchain technology is used. This scarcity can be used to create games. In fact, games are already being developed on the basis of this concept.Use Cases of Blockchain technologyMany people and institutions have already started putting efforts into the above applications of blockchain technology in the entertainment industry. Many of them have been successful. They have proved that even on a large scale, something like this can be done.#1 Imogen Heap released her song on\u00a0EthereumImogen Heap has decided to release her song on the Ethereum blockchain. She is, in fact, the first artist to have done something like this. In an article, she explains why she did it and why it is a great path to take. According to her, putting her song on the blockchain gives her ability to directly compensate herstaff members for every song sale. So, if she wants, she can have a certain percentage of song sales to directly go into the bank account of her production manager. Launching her song on the Ethereum blockchain has also her complete control over the entire marketing process. Now, she can raise prices whenever she wants to. If she wants, she can even give the song away for free. In traditional systems of distribution, once the song goes out of her hand, she would have no control over it whatsoever.#2 VeChain and Everledger have tried to track tangible\u00a0goodsVeChain is a startup based in Shanghai. It has a luxury goods management solution which uses blockchain technology. Its software solution helps companies identify it their goods are legit or not. In just two years since its inception, its impact can be felt and companies have started appreciating theproduct.On, the other hand, Everledger has come to prominence for being one of the first companies to try and solve problems relating to diamond sourcing. Recently, it has also gone into the world of fine arts tocombat fraud which regularly happens there.#3 Crypto kitties, a game which uses blockchain technology has become\u00a0popularCrytpokitties is an online game which allows people to collect and breed kittens. The catch point is that it uses blockchain technology to its advantage. Once a cryptokitty is sold, it will stay with the owner forever. It cannot be copied nor can it be stolen. It is secured by Ethereum blockchain. This creates a sense of ownership in the buyer.In December 2017, a CryptoKitty sold for $100000. In fact, the game has become so popular that it has raised concerns over usage of Ethereum blockchain. People have suggested that the game is using too much space on the blockchain.Why moving to blockchain is a boon to the entertainment industryMoving to Blockchain will be extremely beneficial to the entertainment industry. They can delight customers in ways which were not possible before. If used the right way, blockchain technology can help them restore customers\u2019 faith in the system.#1 It enables new forms of entertainmentBlockchain can easily be used in creating games which are completely different than the ones we know today. Think about the game of Cryptokitties we just mentioned above. It uses the concept of digital scarcity in a very simple way.Now, we also have a connecting link between the digital world and real world. Both can have scarce resources. As such, more games connecting the digital to the physical world can be created and popularized.#2 It reinforces trust in the\u00a0systemArtistic fakes are a big cause of concern. Moreover, the industry has to bear the brunt of it. For every fake discovered by one person, ten other people stop buying expensive artwork. If blockchain can be used to guarantee the legitimacy of artworks, this problem can be solved to a very large extent. Auniversal system of identifying original pieces of art can be created. This will go a long way in helping people trust the system more.#3 Big labels can identify rising\u00a0talentsBlockchain can help individual artists showcase and sell their work directly. On the face of it, this seems like an issue for big distribution houses. Actually, it isn\u2019t. With this technology, these houses will be able to spot rising talents much more easily. When they publish their songs, they can be surer of success.To conclude, we must understand that the applications of blockchain in the media industry are only going to grow over time. As of now, people do not know much about blockchain. Plus, they do not use a lot of Cryptocurrencies. With time, as more people get to know about it and as more peopleuse Cryptocurrencies, we will find many more uses of blockchain technology in this industry. Blockchain really has the capability of solving some very big problems of this field.Here is the list of Real-world Blockchain Applications across Industries which can help you to understand uses of blockchain.The next article in this series will be on\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain in media and communicationAbout CoinSwitchCoinSwitch is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange aggregator.

In 2018, we are building multi-billion dollar blockchain projects, incentivizing humans using the same principles. We are assuming the efficient market hypothesis and the wisdom of the crowds. But what happens when the crowds are not that\u00a0wise?Elad VerbinBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 16, 2018Written by Elad Verbin and Al Esmail.Bitcoin-style cryptoeconomic incentive design is a new economic design paradigm, that has already achieved incredible results, creating the first widespread digital currency. In recent years, this paradigm has become a \u201csilver bullet\u201d, used in far-reaching ways, promising to build amazing futuristic technology by employing incentives in planning and prediction (e.g. Gnosis, Augur); in social media (Steemit); in reputation, governance and self-organization (Colony, Boardroom, Democracy.Earth); in data collaboration and insights (Ocean, Numerai), and so on. However, in taking methods developed for simple systems and extending them into complex systems, we have taken a principle that was designed to incentivize algorithms to play by the rules, and applied it to people. We implicitly assumed people will make rational decisions, will take the most high-yield actions, and will collectively form an efficient market. However, behavioral economics argues that the wisdom of the crowd often isn\u2019t all that wise, economically speaking. Behavioral economics teaches us that humans make a vast majority of their decisions based on simple mental shortcuts and rules of thumb, which are \u201cusually correct\u201d in common situations, but often turn out to be catastrophically wrong in edge cases (like when driving, voting, or transacting in complex financial markets); this is a well-documented phenomenon. In this post we argue that behavioral factors and psychology are not given enough consideration in cryptoeconomics. We think it imperative that experts in actual human economic behavior, such as public policy experts, behavioral economists and social scientists, be included in the teams designing cryptoeconomic systems, in order to ensure their long-term utility, viability and success.", "responses": "13"}, {"title": "How blockchain could change the future of disaster response\u00a0teams", "author_name": "Little Phil", "link": "https://medium.com/littlephilnews/how-blockchain-could-change-the-future-of-disaster-response-teams-2a42e9e3176?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 13, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "6.4K", "content": "How blockchain could change the future of disaster response\u00a0teamsWhen disaster strikes, response teams need to work quickly to reduce deaths and damage to property and environment.Little PhilBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 13, 2018The death toll from the earthquake which struck on the Indonesian island of Lombok has surpassed 430, this figure likely to rise as searches continue. Nearly 390,000 people are displaced and living at camps. Helicopters have been dropping food and medical supplies to isolated communities who are in urgent need of assistance.Time is the most precious commodity when a large catastrophic emergency occurs. The first 72 hours after a disaster are crucial for disaster response. First responders need to work quickly in order to maintain life, contain the spread of the emergency, relieve suffering and improve health, as well as support the morale of the population. Persons may need to be evacuated and placed into shelters, search and rescue teams deployed, damage assessed and initial infrastructure repairs may need to be started to avoid further damage.We often do not hear the news about such events for many hours, even days, before we hear news of these events due to a variety of reasons such as varying time zones and our busy lifestyles. When lives are at stake, funds need to be mobilised quickly. There is no time to wait for fundraising campaigns which could take days and weeks. Not to mention the time that it may take to transfer funds internationally after raising the funds.While developed countries may have access to government reserve funds to handle situations like this, developing countries are more likely to struggle in the case of an emergency situation. Those countries may not have reserve funds and charities which operate in that area may also not have funds easily mobilised. They may be solely relying on volunteers to save lives. In the case of the recent earthquakes in Indonesia, the economic cost has been estimated to be $342 million.In a sudden emergency, OCHA will ideally release an inter-agency flash appeal within 24 to 72 hours. Likewise, CERF aims to provide initial funding within 72 hours of a crisis. Governments, donors and NGOs are all under immense pressure to make funding decisions within hours.24 to 72 hours is a long time to wait for funding to arrive. At Little Phil, we are designing a blockchain solution that provides an opportunity for decentralised decision making which will mobilise funds in as little as two hours; much faster than currently possible.Introducing the Little Phil Emergency Relief\u00a0FundEvery time someone makes a donation using the Little Phil platform, a portion of the (maximum) 6% fee that we charge on transactions will be allocated to a user\u2019s account in the form of \u2018reward tokens.\u2019 These tokens can be gifted to an organisation of their choice, or left in their account in the case of an emergency disaster situation.In the event of an emergency, Little Phil users can democratically vote to allow first responders access of up to a third of all reward tokens on the platform. This will be used as an advance payment until additional donations are obtained. Givers will be notified of the situation and have the choice to claim back their reward tokens or leave them as a gift for the non-profit organisation. The condition of the advance payment is that the non-profit organisation will pay the cost of any token return requests. Users will have the option to select emergency boundaries in advance (for example location, causes and amounts), or opt out of this service. This means that users can contribute to a critical situation even while they sleep, waking up to the news knowing they have already responded and may have saved lives. Givers will be notified of their donation and regularly updated on the disaster situation and how their funds are being used.Voting rights are determined by the number of LPC (Little Phil Coin\u200a\u2014\u200aour app\u2019s native token) held and are capped at a maximum of 3 votes. This is to avoid monopolising the votes for the Emergency Relief Fund.The quick mobilisation of funds could be the difference that saves more lives, and it is blockchain, smart-contracts and decentralised decision making that makes this possible.This is just one of many functions we\u2019re excited to share about our revolutionary platform.

Mainly this is because core concepts tend to get lost among the complexity of non-essential details. This article tries to fill the gap between general audience literature that is entirely uninformative to computer professionals and highly specialized literature that is informative, but often overwhelming. It is written for people with some technology background but without in-depth familiarity with this particular field.The subject of this article is technology of distributed trustless consensus, for this is the one area in which blockchain systems, like Bitcoin, are indeed a major breakthrough. When it comes to other goals, such as distributed data storage, anonymity, transaction verifiability, data obfuscation, shared ledgers, micropayments, high throughput, digital contracts, and so on, cryptographic blockchain systems are, essentially, incidental. Solutions to these problems are well known outside of the blockchain space and, consequently, I will not focus on them here.The main innovation that Satoshi Nakamoto introduced in his article is using so-called proof of work (POW) to create distributed trustless consensus and solve the double-spend problem. POW is not a new idea, but the way Satoshi combined this and other existing concepts\u200a\u2014\u200acryptographic signatures, merkle chains, and P2P networks\u200a\u2014\u200ainto a viable distributed consensus system, of which cryptocurrency is the first and basic application, was quite innovative.Proof of work is a requirement that expensive computations, also called mining for reasons which later will become clear, be performed in order to facilitate transactions on the blockchain. To understand the link between computational difficulty and trustless consensus within a network implementing a distributed cryptocurrency system is a serious mental feat. With this writing I hope to help those who are attempting it.Because distributed trustless consensus is the primary innovation of blockchain technology, we start by understanding what it is. As the term suggests, there are three parts to the puzzle: (1) consensus, (2) distributed, and (3) trustless. Having explained the three terms, I will synthesize them by illustrating the problem that arises when you put all three together. In the process we will see how a distributed ledger based on POW solves this problem.What is consensus?Consider what happens when people talk to each other. If I say \u201cplease pass the salt\u201d, I know that what I mean to convey is the desire to receive the salt shaker. When you hear those words you also understand that this is their meaning. However there is more to this. Implicitly, you understand that I understand that this is the meaning and, furthermore I understand that you understand that I understand this. Imagine that I am in a country where English is not commonly spoken. I will most likely not say these words, not because they suddenly stop meaning what I know they mean, but because I no longer have assurance of our mutual consensus around the meaning\u200a\u2014\u200aI no longer know that you know what I mean.The state of consensus around meaning of language, therefore, is defined as a state where we both say X to mean Y, we both know that we say X to mean Y, we both know that we both know this and so on, ad infinitum. In other words, it requires what people call common knowledge.With money the picture is very similar, but consensus must include not just the transacting parties, but the rest of the social group where a particular currency is used. For me to receive money in payment for services or valuable goods, not only must I recognize what\u2019s presented to me as money, but I must also know with sufficient assurance that everyone else will also recognize it as such.The requirement that money supply be scarce is crucially important. If people accepted frogs in exchange for useful things\u200a\u2014\u200awe would be collecting frogs. If people took slips of paper with a hand-drawn image of a giraffe we would all be drawing giraffes. The reason why choosing a scarce resource as currency is important is that overall this provides a motivating factor in the larger social system to which we have all become accustomed. A non-scarce money will not motivate people to render services or produce goods. So hand-drawn giraffes as money won\u2019t work. This understanding for us is intuitive and places the restriction on what can be used as money.Consequently, the consensus around money (denoted Cm) can be simplistically described as follows.I will accept some token or process in payment for valuable goods or services if:\u2026 it comes from a scarce supply using one of the accepted means of value exchange and creation.\u2026 I expect that everyone else will accept this token as money of comparable value.I, additionally, believe that3.\u00a0\u2026 everyone else adheres to (1), (2) and (3)This is simplistic and is by far not a rigorous account, but for the goal of explaining digital finance it is sufficient. Notice that (3) implies an existing common knowledge of what money means, while (2) provides a requirement for there to be common knowledge around this particular token in fact being money according to the consensus laid out in (3). Logicians usually have a field day with these kinds of self-referential statements, but we shall not get distracted by marveling as they do. We shall just plow on.We must notice an important implication to which we will return later. It doesn\u2019t really matter what money is, what specific token is used, as long as Cm is obtained for it. Cm doesn\u2019t tell us what valid money is, but it does tell us some things about what it isn\u2019t: hand drawn pictures of giraffes it isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s remember this for now and move on to the next topic.DistributedDigital money can solve Cm(1)\u200a\u2014\u200athe requirement that it be in limited supply\u200a\u2014\u200aby establishing a central entity that controls the supply. This is straightforward: a database on some server holds the information about who holds what amount of money and when transactions are performed it ensures that a person doesn\u2019t overdraw his or her account. This is how digital banking works today.Leaving trust issues aside until the next section let\u2019s consider the difficulty in making this process distributed. The distributed system must ensure consistency, that is when a transfer is made using the information supplied by one of the nodes it must be correctly reflected in all other nodes. This problem is hard but we know how to solve it. We either make things slow, by waiting for the information to propagate across the network (known as strict consistency), or slightly unreliable by confirming the transaction immediately but reserving the right to cancel it if it encounters a conflict elsewhere on the network (eventual consistency).TrustlessThe third and final problem is trust. Trust is implicitly present in digital finance in many different ways. There is trust that the entity that holds your account information doesn\u2019t go about randomly subtracting value from it, the trust of safety. There is trust that the entity who ensures circulation doesn\u2019t go about randomly assigning money to itself out of nowhere\u200a\u2014\u200atrust of issuance. Finally, there is trust that the system in fact ensures consistency of information, that is it performs its main function\u200a\u2014\u200atrust of correctness.What does it mean, then, to say that a system is trustless? Obviously, we have to trust a system which we use to facilitate value exchange. When we talk about trustless systems, we mean that our ability to trust it does not depend on the intentions of any particular party, which could be arbitrarily malicious. This is a curious proposition, for how can we possibly hope to transact through a bad intermediary in a way we can rely on?Turns out, as the reader is well aware, trustless systems are not new. For example, email can not be trusted to protect your content for unintended eavesdropping. Yet, this presents little problem to those familiar with modern cryptography. An encrypted message can be safely sent through an untrusted channel, making this a trustless system.Similarly, cryptography answers the needs of trust of safety, because we can require transactions to have cryptographic signatures. If everyone in the systems is able to verify cryptographic signatures and refuses to accept payment without one\u200a\u2014\u200athe trust of safety is achieved, for it makes it impossible for anyone to transact on your funds.It is the other two kinds of trust that present a serious problem. But before we can look at that closer, we have to synthesize what we know so far.POW BlockchainA digital transaction is some event or process whose effect is to transfer money in the sense we laid out in Cm. Putting together our understanding of consensus around money with our idea of trust, we can now list the requirements we have placed on such process so far (we will refer to them as Tx).In order for our digital monetary system to work, the recipient of a transaction must be able to confirm that:The originator of the transaction is in possession of the funds being transferred.The originator of the transaction has obtained the funds by one of the means commonly recognized as valid.As an outcome of the transaction the recipient will now be recognized by everyone as being in possession of the funds being transferred.As an outcome of the transaction the sender would not be able to present itself as being in possession of the funds any more.A user\u200a\u2014\u200ahuman being or an automated device, say, a vending machine\u200a\u2014\u200auses some algorithm that ensures that Tx (1)-(4) are met. These statements expressed in a natural language describe a combined state between the user and the algorithm. For example, an algorithm may include a verification of a cryptographic signature used in a transaction. A combination of the fact that the user knows this check to be implemented, correctly, within the algorithm and the fact that the check succeeds creates a combined state of knowledge about the validity of the signature. Similarly, Tx(1)-(4) can only be true in a sense of being a combination of the user\u2019s knowledge of the details of the algorithm and the context in which it operates, together with the results of the algorithm\u2019s execution.If it is commonly known that the same algorithm (or, more generally, protocol) is used by everyone who engages in financial transactions then it implies assurances regarding what others\u2019 view of the transaction is\u200a\u2014\u200anamely the views mandated by the protocol. Consequently, whenever the description of Tx speaks of assurances about \u201cothers\u2019\u201d views, this is on condition that everyone uses the same protocol.This condition, of course, makes sense. Using the same protocol as everyone else is, naturally, a prerequisite to ensuring Cm(2)\u200a\u2014\u200aone\u2019s ability to spend money later. Consequently, circumventing the system to some malicious end must be done within the constraints of what this common protocol allows.Bitcoin approachSo far we have not said anything about exactly what a transaction is, except to posit a common understanding of its effects. In a centralized system, transactions are simply changes to a central database. Because centralized systems involve trust, Tx(1)-(4) are confirmed through a combination of what the central server reports and the common belief, based on trust, that the central server reports accurate and consistent information.In a trustless system, however, things are quite a bit more complex. For starters, one can not rely on a report by any single entity. Cryptocurrency developers take an even stronger view\u200a\u2014\u200athat one can not rely on a report by any number of entities. The reason for this is simple: we assume that there is little to no cost to creating any number of colluding malicious entities, which means that faced with conflicting information deciding whose report to believe may be impossible. (I don\u2019t find this premise to be unquestionably true, but that\u2019s what blockchain is based on, so there)The assumption that one can\u2019t trust anyone\u2019s reports leads to the conclusion that one has to be able to confirm things for oneself. This gives rise to the notion that when presented with a transaction, the recipient must ensure by personally reviewing the entire history of transactions the fact that the sender is in fact in possession of the funds and that the way this came to be is valid. This, in turn, leads us down the path of shared ledgers where the main premise is that the entire history of all transactions is completely open and public.Here is where things start to get interesting. Didn\u2019t I just say that you can\u2019t believe reports anyone makes? And if so, what about the server from which I am downloading the ledger? Can\u2019t it present me with a doctored picture?The answer has two parts.First is that it is much harder to produce a totally self-consistent ledger than a report related to a state of a single account. A self-consistent ledger requires, for instance, that transactions be cryptographically signed by the account holders, making a ledger in which you deduct someone else\u2019s money simply impossible.But producing multiple self-consistent ledgers is still not very hard. For example, you can easily create a ledger that only differs in the last transaction in the account from which you hold the cryptographic key.So the second part of the solution has to answer the question of what does one do when faced with entirely self-consistent but different ledgers? In the crypto parlance this is referred to as the double-spend problem. It is so called because of the possibility that someone malicious can present two different ledger states to two different users, or even worse\u200a\u2014\u200apresent the entire network with a ledger state and then present the entire network with a different state but one that will be ultimately accepted, negating the first one.Proof of\u00a0workThe solution that was originally proposed in Satoshi\u2019s article addresses this problem. To explain it, we first posit an assumption that the Internet is eventually connected that is every state of the public ledger will eventually be observed by everyone. In other words, hiding is impossible for a prolonged period of time.Next, we point out that the choice between conflicting states is not one where one state is a-priori good and another is a-priori bad, since we posited that both states are totally self-consistent. The difference between a good state and a bad state is that of consensus only, that is if we can all agree on which one is good and simply ignore the other one, we will have solved the problem.There is slightly more to this, though. Namely, by Cm(2) we require that consensus established in the network persist in the future. If our common way of choosing a good state out of several conflicting ones doesn\u2019t ensure this, then someone can present the network with a state of a ledger that shows them to be a sender of some transaction, receive the benefits from the recipient and then present the network with another, \u201cbetter\u201d state, that negates the earlier transaction.So what we want is a situation where once we see a state of a ledger and accept it as good, that we must all believe that it will be impossible to create a better one later. And this is where proof of work comes in. Proof of work adds artificial computational difficulty to the ledger. The common protocol requires that of any two conflicting states we observe on the network we select the one that was hardest to generate. We also require that there is a common and high level of hardness to recording transactions in the ledger.Mining is a process of generating proof of work. The way it works is that all miners compete to find a number that, when added to the block of transactions, causes this block to hash to a code with certain rare properties. Based on the cryptographic features of the hash function used in this process, finding such a rare number is hard, but verifying its validity when it is found is easy. For the ledger to be considered self-consistent we require that every block contain such rare number whose hardness we control based on the size of the participating network (a value expressed as a hash-rate).This ensures that once we observe a valid state of the ledger, transactions that have certain age can not be negated, because producing a longer ledger than the one we see requires the malicious entity to have computing power that can compete with the entire existing network. Consequently, these transactions have lasting consensus regarding their validity.One final note related to mining is to understand how the limited money supply comes into existence in the first place\u200a\u2014\u200ahow the currency is issued. Bitcoin protocol assigns a preset amount of newly issued currency for every block to the miner who first assembled it with the correct proof of work. This, along with transaction fees, incentivizes miners to perform the work that is required to create consensus for the entire network, keeping the network sufficiently large that circumventing it becomes very expensive. This is why mining is so called\u200a\u2014\u200abecause it can be paralleled to the process of \u201cdigging\u201d for new bitcoins.ConclusionWhen presented with a new cryptocurrency solution, the reader is now empowered to ask herself, based on the above explanation, how it is that the solution achieves distributed trustless consensus. Similarly, when considering using a system based on POW, the reader is in position to understand that POW is only useful when trustless consensus is required, otherwise it is an expensive and needless waste of resources.There now exist solutions which do not use blockchains, but still strive to achieve distributed trustless consensus, Iota being one example. Furthermore, there are so-called consortium blockchains, which apply some of the ideas developed in decentralized cryptofinance to facilitate transactions between mainstream financial entities. While it is not clear what exact approach they will use, it is clear from the above explanation that POW would be a feature entirely unnecessary in such systems, since they don\u2019t have to function in a trustless fashion.With all the hype around cryptotechnology I hope that this article could be helpful in navigating the complexity and diversity of this space.

Metalyfe is a blockchain browser that allows users to regain control of their personal data generated via online activities. The current state of the internet sees large technology companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook collecting and profiting from valuable user data, without compensation to the billions of people generating this information. Utilizing Lyfecoin technology, Metalyfe creates an ecosystem in which users are protected, and given the opportunity to monetize information that up until now, technology behemoths have been amalgamating free of charge.Metalyfe Browser\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain Enabled, Web 3.0 ReadyMetalyfe, a full web 3.0 enabled browser, aims to be the go-to access layer for dApps, and a portal for housing and monetizing data that current browsers collect on behalf of third parties. The first decentralized web 3.0 portal focuses on providing users with a modern, safe, and secure method to navigate the digital world, access dApps, and leverage the ownership of their personal data.Metalyfe Blockchain BrowserIn an industry full of ideas and minimal execution, Metalyfe brings product to the table. Metalyfe has implementation-ready applications across Mac, Windows and Linux, an App Store, and a mobile app. Users benefit from encrypted browser history, a built-in multi-currency wallet, and are able access dApps through the browser.Lyfe CoinThe conversion of personal data to a digital asset, Lyfe\u00a0CoinThe native token of the Metalyfe blockchain is Lyfe Coin. The primary use case of Lyfe Coin is to allow generators and purchasers of data to transact, compensating users for their data. Additionally, Lyfe Coin brings value to both digital and physical assets that reside within the Metalyfe ecosystem.DigitalBits + MetalyfeDigitalBits will serve as one of the primary use-cases of the Metalyfe data marketplace. Utilizing Metalyfe\u2019s multi-currency wallet, users will be able to spend tokenized assets on the DigitalBits blockchain towards online purchases in a one-click pay system. With DigitalBits targeting the Loyalty & Rewards sector as its first use-case, this will allow users increased flexibility to spend their points. Today consumers face a myriad of issues when it comes to using their points, from siloed programs that do not allow transfer of value, to changing rules and program requirements. These frustrations have led to in excess of $16 billion worth in points going unused annually in the United States alone. The collaboration between these two projects looks to lift limitations currently set on consumers, allowing for a wide variety of tokenized assets to be spent through a dynamic decentralized browser.Ben Tran (CEO) & Sameer Pirani (CMO) at Blockchain Futurist ConferenceCrossing the Chasm\u200a\u2014\u200aAn Ecosystem for the UserCentral to the DigitalBits philosophy is a mission to drive mass adoption through the integration of existing consumer applications. This appears simple enough, but it is a mission that goes hand in hand with the future of blockchain technology. DigitalBits took this approach because it makes blockchain inclusive and available to everyone, allowing society as a whole to benefit from revolutionary technology. The industry that stands before us right now is complex, and even those actively involved run into issues. In order to change the world, blockchain needs to be accessible and usable by all. Metalyfe shares this point of view, establishing themselves as a transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0. The Metalyfe Blockchain Browser was created with the user in mind, combining popular aspects from current browsers with blockchain and dynamic innovations like board technology. Like DigitalBits, Metalyfe purports the idea of adapting and complimenting learned consumer behaviour, and the creation of a user-centric experience.With a shared focus on enabling the user, DigitalBits is excited for the possibilities that the Metalyfe partnership brings.

New opportunities and values are emerging, business models are being improved and the existing systems of healthcare are being democratized. Now digital transformation is the main strategic priority. Having studied the Frost & Sullivan Blockchain Technologyresearches we are telling about 5 opportunities of growth of the blockchain technology in the field of digital transformation of the healthcare industry.Blockchain solves cybersecurity problems.There is strict policy, security and confidentiality standards in the healthcare industry. Healthcare systems, payers and pharmaceutical manufacturers need secure and reliable IT ecosystem. The 2017 IBM Security \u0438 Ponemon Instituteresearch states that the average cost of data leak in the sphere of healthcare has increased, the price per one document has amounted to $380 and it has declined by 10% in other spheres. It means that cybersecurity threats are becoming a serious problem of healthcare companies. For example in 2016 the Johnson & Johnson company warned its patients that a \u201cOneTouch Ping\u201d insulin pump could be hacked. The more technological healthcare are becoming the higher the risk of hacker attacks is.The systems based on blockchain work in the distribution network together with in-built methods of cryptography that makes it virtually impregnable. Potentially blockchain can minimize cybersecurity threats and increase the level of trust. Due to blockchain healthcare companies can use more reliable and secure strategy for managing devices identification and improve confidentiality of patients data.Medical data exchangeData exchange in healthcare is a complicated process. To exchange data two systems or organisations should trust each other and use data with shared responsibility. Meanwhile the real problem is the lack of security and integrity in the existing HIT systems.This trend encourages the search for technological solutions. Blockchain has become the solution. Properties of the blockchain ensure the data invariability and secure working process and guarantee integrity of medical data exchange.Consumption in healthcare sphereConsumer demand for healthcare is characterized by the emergence of digital solutions for medicine. There is lots of personalized data about health and way of living. Modern consumers of healthcare services are more serious about their health and self-care. The Frost & Sullivan research shows that approximately 69% of Americans pay attention to their state of health. 41% of respondents want to change the doctor and 74% of patients appreciate notifications and news received after the visit to the doctor. Nevertheless, most consumers rarely get access to personalized variants of treatment and reminders of the doctor\u2019s appointment in real time. It is connected with the possession of personal data, confidentiality and the existing HIT systems. New solutions in the sphere of digital healthcare have a crucial importance in this multilayer digital space.As an instrument with an open code blockchain provides functions identification management with a predetermined access of confidentiality. It gives patients more control over health data. Apart from that, storage of encrypted data about state of health allows consumers share anonymous data about health selectively, for example for the purpose of research.Economic valuesDigital democratization will require more in-depth use of IT by health care workers. The new vision of healthcare is not only available medical care, quality and reasonable cost but also predictable, preventive and the result-oriented model of treatment.Due to the reduction of healthcare costs around the world, the blockchain technology provides new opportunities for the economic advantage. Blockchain automates transaction services within business processes, for example, processing of claims, management of accounts, supply of medicines. Decentralization of blockchain makes it easier to build commercial relationships and provides new opportunities for promoting models of providing assistance that help to save billion dollars for healthcare sphere.Precision medicineThe industry estimates that about $300 billion is spent annually on ineffective medicines which do not provide the expected benefits or cause dangerous side effects. In this regard pharmaceutical companies face pressure and try to justify the value of their medicines. It\u2019s time for them to move from producing \u201cbestsellers\u201d to developing personalized medicines. The concept of precision medicine promises to change the model of treatment. Personalized data is the most important part of precision medicine, but there are problems related to interaction of medical data, confidentiality.Blockchain technology with its security infrastructure is perfect for unobstructed data exchange in healthcare. It can promote innovation in medical research and the carrying out of larger population studies. As pharmaceutical companies focus on precision medicine, the invariability of records based on blockchain can facilitate interaction between doctors, researchers and patients.ConclusionBlockchain technology can help healthcare industry to solve some of its problems such as cybersecurity, data compatibility, medicines supply, problems concerning bank account fraud. Besides blockchain provides opportunities for optimizing the existing IT-systems and introducing new business models. Despite the great potential of blockchain for healthcare it is not a panacea. Blockchain cannot solve the healthcare problems.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "So you want to start or invest in an ICO / Blockchain / Crypto Fund?

Part II/II: How does the industry invest in blockchain?Etienne BrunetBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 21, 2017This post reflects my personal views on the current crypto fund market.Like anyone working in Fintech VC, I have been trying to make sense of the recent cryptocurrency craze. In part 1 I highlighted the challenges faced by crypto fund managers around pre-trade, execution and post-trade, and here in part 2 I aim to provide my view of the current crypto fund landscape. I may be wrong, but thought it would be great to share this, and gather your feedback. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. As always, I am very happy to have a chat or share notes, just email me at ebrunet40@gmail.com.So if you have read my previous post you saw that starting a crypto fund is quite challenging\u200a\u2014\u200abut not impossible. When I first wrote my post on My Token / ICO / Blockchain Capital Markets Landscape I thought there were just two types of crypto funds: ones investing in equity, and others in tokens. Well, it\u2019s not as binary as that.From Satoshi to Polychain. From Reddit to\u00a0Forbes.In January 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block of bitcoin, rewarding him with 50 bitcoins. Even after the last few days of bitcoin meltdown, 50 coins are worth a healthy $150k+. The second Bitcoin user was Hal Finney who received 10 bitcoin from Satoshi. From that point, and until about 2013, a Bitcoin holder would most likely be a super early adopter of technology and/or a fan of Bitcointalk or other obscure internet forums.In February 2013 Coinbase reported $1m of bitcoin transactions in a single month, priced around $22 per coin. In summer 2013, the Winklevoss Twins announced their plan to launch the first Bitcoin ETF, leaving institutional investors amused. Look, it\u2019s not their fault; at the same time you had the burst of Mt. Gox and the FBI\u2019s shutdown of Silk Road. Bitcoin was not cool.Then China discovered Bitcoin. China is known for its love of gambling and for its love of new regulations. In the fall of 2013, Chinese investors discovered Bitcoin mining and exchanges and they loved both a bit too much. The results? Prices went through the roof and new regulation stopped the party. Sound familiar?Following the Bitcoin boom in 2013, VCs were just starting to rave about Bitcoin related companies. Many thought that Bitcoin was just about to become mainstream, and about $1bn of funding was poured into Bitcoin / Blockchain companies between 2013 and 2015. The problem was that Bitcoin adoption was slower than expected; the Bitcoin price was somewhat flat, and more importantly for investors there was no major M&A. Bitcoin was dead for VCs.End of 2015, VCs fall in love with Blockchain - \u201cthe technology underlying Bitcoin\u201d. More precisely, investors were getting excited for applications of private blockchains in financial services, and massive consortia deals gave birth to Digital Asset Holdings and R3. Blockchain was tipped to revolutionise the Oracle database and bring trade execution to T+0.Nevertheless, few savvy investors saw the decentralisation light.The first crypto fund was Exante - the Malta based outfit launched in 2013. Around the same time Grayscale (now part of DCG) was launched to manage the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT). In 2014, Daniel Masters launched Jersey based GABI, while Naval Ravikant and Joshua Seims started MetaStable - a macro strategy fund based in San Francisco. Shortly after, Pantera Capital launched its crypto fund backed by Ribbit Capital, Benchmark and Fortress and until fall 2016 these five funds formed the majority of institutional investment. At the same time some high frequency trading shops like DRW Cumberland Mining launched their OTC and market making arms, but none formally started crypto funds. Meanwhile, the founders of Hudson River Trading, quietly launched a bitcoin research & development group in NYC named Chain Code Labs.Then came Polychain.Polychain headed by Coinbase hire #1 Olaf Carlson-Wee, raised $5m from 30 investors in September 2016, and sparked further VC interest when they raised another $10m from USV, A16Z. I remember having a coffee with a friend in December \u201916 who tried to explain to me Polychain\u2019s token investment strategy: \u201cIt is a bit like investing in URL addresses back in 1997. Most of the names will be worthless, but some will actually be used by the community and their value will increase exponentially.\u201d I went home and bought some Ethereum - just in case.Then in April \u201917, Blockchain Capital raised $10m in six hours through an ICO. Almost ironically, this was the same time that Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins started to rise to historical levels, driven by South Korean and Japanese regulations and low interest rates... The total market cap of crypto coins hit $112bn on June 12th \u201917, and about a month later, Olaf appeared on the cover of Forbes just 12 months after launching his fund. Yes I know. Cool.Founder of Polychain Capital on cover of Forbes. 12 months after launch of the\u00a0fund.Everyone wants to be a crypto hedge fund manager. Hello GDAX. Goodbye Bloomberg.From summer \u201817, every VC, HF and money manager started to ask their analysts and associates questions like \u201cWhere can I get Bitcoin? What is an ICO? I want to buy tokens - how does it work?\u201d. Until this point, most of these investors associated the word \u2018token\u2019 with slot machines and family trips in Atlantic City.The following months were a turbulent time for Bitcoin with the Segwit discussion, and SEC letter, but that did not stop wannabe crypto fund managers. 15 crypto funds were founded in July \u201817 according to Forbes, that total now 55 according to Autonomous Next. Some bearish Bitcoiners like Marc Cuban (yes the same who thinks Bitcoin is a bubble) started to seed these newly found crypto hedge funds like 1Confirmation. Meanwhile the pioneer crypto funds like Polychain and Metastable received major interests from top VCs and other investors. Today, Polychain now has $200m+ of AuM and is backed by Sequoia, MetaStable raised from Sequoia and A16Z among others and Pantera is launching four new funds, including one dedicated to ICOs.What about the other investors you may ask. Well it\u2019s complicated.You have classic VCs still solely interested in equity, seeing tokens as just a fad, or being restricted by their LPs, or all of the above. You have HFT hedge funds that have mined Bitcoin for the past 4 years, and now starting to trade cryptocurrencies for fun. You have Long-only funds\u200a\u2014\u200asimilar to ETFs\u200a\u2014\u200athat solely focus on providing an exposure to people who do not want to buy directly on an exchange. You have algo/quant/trading shops being setup everyday by ex-bankers / high school students and crypto genius\u2019 with one aim\u200a\u2014\u200acreating alpha out of candlesticks. You have specialised crypto funds investing solely in ICOs and existing cryptocurrencies. You have crypto companies launching their own funds (like Blockstack and Tezos) to grow their community. And finally\u200a\u2014\u200amy favourite cats, VC funds able to invest in both equity and tokens. Why are these my favourite? Well, the last group are able to leverage their knowledge from non-token firms to token firms, and can add governance with equity checks.All of these funds are summarised in the landscape below:My crypto fund landscapeI will publish an updated version with detailed information on each investor group if I reach 500 fans for this post.The end of\u00a0VCs?Some people say VCs will be disrupted at their own game. I don\u2019t agree. I think a major opportunity has already arrived for early stage investors. As Kavita Gupta from Consensys Capital stated \u201cThere is still value to due diligence, and even if two PhD kids have sold tokens based on a brilliant white paper, they still have to figure out how to deliver a company. That\u2019s not necessarily something they have experience doing.\u201dICOs solve the issue of funding for open source technology. But founders need support building a team, advice on growth and guidance on how to support their community. As Yann Ranchere discussed in his post, it will be interesting to see how the company behind protocols develop their vision, through diversification, building on-platform etc..In my view, VCs can have a major impact on companies long before an ICO; helping them assemble teams, build products, improve communications. Post-ICO, VCs will continue to work with companies and they will be able to divest their tokens after a few years\u200a\u2014\u200aon a similar schedule to traditional vesting. Hedge funds, day traders and others market participants will provide liquidity to investors, users and founders.What\u2019s next? Wall street is\u00a0coming.Today the market is very volatile, mainly due to the lack of clarity around crypocurrency regulations, but a new regulatory framework may take 12\u201324 months before release. When this is done, it will allow the launch of more mainstream products like ETFs. In the meantime, this is great news for algo / quant crypto funds as they thrive of uncertainty. However, a major risk for these investors lies around the operational nuances of post-trade, custody and security, on top of to their ability to pick miss-priced tokens.How about institutional money?Well, regulation needs to be clearer before we see leading investment banks launching crypto products or blue chip hedge funds allocating resources to cryptocurrencies. However, there will be a phase of trial (and error) by hedge funds, coupled with modest money inflow.Financial services is changing, and professional investors find themselves centred in the debate of a decentralised future.Thank you for reading my post.Don\u2019t forget to share with friends and your bitcoin early adopters colleagues.Best,EtienneFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/etiennebruSubscribe to my crypto job newsletter:******************************************************************", "responses": "14"}, {"title": "200+ Thought Leaders in Crypto and Blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Ultimate Crypto List for Event Planners, Influencers and the\u00a0Like", "author_name": "Michelle Tsng", "link": "https://medium.com/@michelletsng/201-thought-leaders-in-crypto-and-blockchain-the-ultimate-crypto-list-for-event-planners-9e712186cbfb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 17, 2018", "readtime": "14 min read", "upvotes": "2.8K", "content": "200+ Thought Leaders in Crypto and Blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Ultimate Crypto List for Event Planners, Influencers and the\u00a0LikeMichelle TsngBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 17, 2018Content is available under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike unless otherwise noted.Intro: For the six (6) years when I was at PayPal, bringing PayPal to ubiquity while mitigating risk, our legal team consisted of a majority of women.

By using standard tools and conventions that the developer community have been evolving since the language\u2019s inception, we will visit the recent changes to Solidity and how to ensure your smart contracts are error free.The official Solidity documentation has fallen behind the times slightly, at least at the time of this writing\u200a\u2014\u200athe examples are still showcasing Solidity 0.4 (the current version introduces a collection of new features and breaking changes from the previous version) with out of date and somewhat uninspiring example contracts. I find Truffle Boxes a more inspiring resource to browse through.What we will cover here: IDEs & tools, importing and compiling contracts, breaking changes and conventions.In this article we will firstly overview the IDEs at your disposal to be developing Solidity smart contracts, before visiting important concepts to adhere to when writing Solidity contracts, and how to ensure we utilise them correctly. We\u2019ll also visit the structure of a smart contract and popular conventions used when writing them.If you would like to contribute to Solidity, documentation is one of the most requested aspects to be contributing to at this time. Although contributing to the language is an entirely different talk, check out the Solidity Contributing page if you\u2019d like more information on the subject.With that, let\u2019s start familiarising ourselves with Solidity 0.5 and suitable software for developing with it\u200a\u2014\u200ayou will most likely be able to integrate Solidity development into your favourite IDE.Prerequisite: Setting up your workspaceThere are a couple of notable browser-based IDEs that you can utilise to develop Solidity smart contracts in the event that you do not use a dedicated IDE: Along with the Remix online IDE recommended in the Solidity docs, we also have ETHFiddle (Similar to JSFiddle) that allows you to run contracts online and share them throughout your network.IDE Solidity\u00a0SupportI personally prefer installing support for Solidity in my favourite dedicated IDE, opting for Sublime Text over other offerings. Let\u2019s briefly visit some of the packages available for your IDE:Sublime Text: The Ethereum package is available for Sublime Text, as well as a linting package named SoliumLinter. SoliumLinter is used to analyse your Solidity code and check for errors within the Sublime Text IDE.Visual Studio: A Solidity package is available on the Visual Studio Marketplace, enabling Solidity smart contract development in the VS IDE.Atom: The language-ethereum package is available for Atom bringing syntax highlighting and snippets to Solidity and Serpent files in Atom.Emac: Enable Emac Solidity mode.Vim: Enable Solidity syntax with vim.Install the relevant package for you and fire up a new project.The next tool we will visit is Truffle. The Truffle Suite is a set of tools designed to aid in the entire Ethereum Dapp development process\u200a\u2014\u200abut Truffle itself is very good at aiding in the development of Solidity Smart Contracts\u200a\u2014\u200athis is what we will focus on in more detail here.To get up to speed with Truffle and to save repetition, check out my introductory article on the suite:Introduction to the Truffle Suite and Dapp Development PipelineBreaking down the Ethereum Dapp Development pipeline using Truffle, Ganache and Drizzlemedium.comUpdate to the latest Truffle and Solidity\u00a0versionsIt is worth mentioning the importance of keeping Truffle and the underlying Solidity compiler up to date. Run the following commands to install the latest versions of Truffle and solc (Solidity compiler) packages:npm install -g truffle@latestnpm install solc@latestTake note of the latest version of the Solidity compiler in-particularly to guarantee your smart contracts will adhere to the latest Solidity standards. They change quite frequently!Exploring & Importing Solidity\u00a0ProjectsAt this point you may wish to import some ready-made smart contracts into a Truffle project. Let\u2019s briefly do this now to get a feel for what completed contracts consist of, as well as familiarising ourselves with the import process.MetaCoin\u200a\u2014\u200aBasic Truffle\u00a0ProjectA bare-bones project we can use for familiarisation purposes is the MetaCoin project, provided as a Truffle box. Import the project in a new folder by unboxing MetaCoin with the following commands:mkdir metacoincd metacointruffle unbox metacoinThis bootstraps a Truffle project with the contracts/MetaCoin.sol contract. Not only is this contract written with Solidity 0.4, it is also incomplete and does not adhere to the ERC20 standard; not very useful.However, the contracts are valid syntax and will indeed compile. Run truffle compile now to observe a successful deployment.Take a peak at the MetaCoin.sol file and see if you understand what is happening. We will visit this syntax later on in the article in relation to Solidity 0.5.ERC721 Standard by\u00a00xcertNext, let\u2019s briefly visit a completed production-ready token, by importing the ERC721 standard into our project. Check out the contracts here on Github or the project homepage here.About the ERC721 standard:ERC721 contracts adhere to a standard for Non-Fungible tokens. Every token is unique and could have a different value. Use cases include collectables apps such as Crypto Kitties and similar offerings, whereby every Kitten is represented by a unique token ID.Within the /src/contracts/tokens folder there is a basic NFToken offering as well as two extended contracts; one for additional MetaData, and one for Enumeration. Contracts starting with erc721- contain function signatures required to adhere to the standard, whereas contracts starting with nf-token- are the actual implementations.These contracts also import utilities from the utils/ and math/ folder one level up. Let\u2019s import the entire contracts/ folder into our Truffle project.Clone the entire project outside of your local metacoin/ folder and copy the contracts into its contracts/ folder:#clone ERC721 project and copy contracts into metacoincd ..git clone https://github.com/0xcert/ethereum-erc721.gitcp -R ethereum-erc721/src/contracts/* metacoin/contractsIn order to migrate these contracts we will need to add a new migrations file. Add a 3_deploy_nftoken.js file within metacoin/migrations/, importing the MetaData NFToken contract for deployment:#metacoin/migrations/3_deploy_nftoken.jsvar Migrations = artifacts.require(\"Migrations\");var NFTokenMetaData = artifacts.require(\"nf-token-metadata\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(Migrations);  deployer.deploy(NFTokenMetaData);};And finally hop back into metacoin/ and migrate them:# migrate the contracts within metacoincd metacointruffle migrateExcellent, we already have some Solidity management workflow under our belt.Let\u2019s next talk about some underlying Solidity 0.5 conventions.Common Errors and Underlying Solidity\u00a0ConceptsRunning various Truffle commands allows us to test our smart contracts in real time: truffle compile, truffle test or truffle migrate will all summon the Solidity compiler to compile the latest version of your Solidity contracts.By utilising these features we can test the validity of our Smart Contracts and iron out bugs before they are deployed on our test blockchain, whether it be Ganache or any other client.Now, if an error is found in your contracts, useful output is provided to us by the Solidity compiler, as well as suggestions on how to fix that error. Let\u2019s explore some Solidity errors you may encounter, and talk about the underlying concepts of Solidity we need to adhere to in order to prevent such errors.These errors may range from any of the following:Forgetting to define a function as internal or external.internal functions can only be called within the contract they are defined in (as well as by internal library functions and inherited functions). external functions can be accessed by other smart contracts and via web3 calls, and consist of their own signature and address.Forgetting to define a function type as view, pure or\u00a0payable.Functions need a type to determine their scope and capabilities in terms of what contract state they have access to, and what they can manipulate.A function is of type view if no contract state is changed within that function. In other words, it cannot alter the behaviour of future interactions with any contract. They can only call other view or pure functions.A function of type pure is even more restrictive; pure functions can only depend on the arguments passed into them. Like view, they cannot utilise the msg object, send or receive ETH, or refer to the block object.payable functions have the ability to accept ETH payments, and this could also be a payment of 0 ETH. Providing an ETH amount of 0 will still be valid, the point here is that the function will accept this value and be able to process it.Forgetting to provide a reference type to function arguments or function variables, as memory, callable or\u00a0storage.This is a requirement as of Solidity 0.5.These are called reference types, and arrays and structs now need a reference type applied to them. A reference type is simply a reference to the data location of where the value is stored.Arguments of external functions will be referenced as calldata. An variable referenced as memory will indeed to stored in memory, making it temporary. A variable referenced as storage will be stored permanently. In practicality, function arguments are general memory whereas contract state variables and local variables are storage.We now begin to realise the importance of a reliable compiler with reliable error reporting. Truffle will provide us with this, letting us know where we have assigned the incorrect reference type, and which one to correctly use.Not returning the correct type from a\u00a0functionWithin Solidity we can either define a type of value (or tuple, or Struct) to be returned from a function, or the type followed by a variable. For example:function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)    external    view    returns (address _owner)  {    _owner = idToOwner[_tokenId];    require(_owner != address(0));  }In the above function we define the _owner return variable and simply write a value to it within the function block. No return statemement is needed.We could rewrite this function to just define the return type and include a return statement:function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)    external    view    returns (address)  {    address _owner = idToOwner[_tokenId];    require(_owner != address(0));    return _owner;  }Both cases are valid, and ultimately is the developers decision on which to use.Overlooking illogical syntaxOnce we have carefully designed our smart contract along with our function signatures, we then need to be sure that the logic inside them do indeed adhere to the function\u2019s type. For example, we do not want to attempt sending a transaction from within a view function.Luckily, attempting to compile contracts will fail if these errors exist. The Solidity compiler will always pick up type errors.Giving functions too much\u00a0scopeConversely, giving a function too much capability that it does not use will flag a warning. If a function is typed as payable but only adheres to a pure function, then the Solidity compiler will let us know and suggest the more suitable type.Attempting things that Solidity does not support\u00a0yetIf we attempt to return a type that is not supported within Solidity at this time, the compiler will fail and make it clear why. For example, trying to return an array from a function is not supported.Conversely, if Solidity does support such a feature, but such feature is part of an experimental feature set that you specifically have to define, the compiler will also let us know, and provide the line of code to be included at the top of your contract\u200a\u2014\u200amost likely a pragma statement.An example of this is constructing an array of a Struct type within a for loop.General syntax\u00a0errorsOf course, general syntax errors like spelling errors or missing semi-colons will be flagged, line number and code.The Structure of a Solidity Smart\u00a0ContractHow can we minimise the probability of introducing errors in our smart contracts beyond a distraction-free environment and a high dosage of coffee? By making sure our contracts are organised and adhere to some sort of structure.The high level structure of a smart contract in Solidity, with some example code, is as follows://Solidity versionpragma solidity 0.5.3;The version of Solidity being used is always a requirement.//importsimport \"./ERC721.sol\";import \"./utils/supports-interface.sol\";import \"./utils/address-utils.sol\";...Imports of other contracts. These may be utility or helper functions, for example, signatures for all the functions that adhere to the ERC721 standard.//Contract Variablesaddress internal owner;mapping (uint256 => address) internal idToOwner;uint256 internal totalTokensMinted;...Contract variables are defined next, storing contract state. These can range from public addresses of other accounts, key value indexes with the mapping type, and primitive types like unsigned integers. All the contract variables above are internal, meaning only contract functions can read and write to them, however this is not a requirement.//Eventsevent TokenCreated(    address indexed tokenAddress,    string name,    string symbol,    address owner);...Next we define the Events of our contract. Events can be called from within our contract functions for the purpose of registering that something happened within smart contract execution. This event is consequently recorded on the blockchain.This allows external applications or APIs to listen to Events from the blockchain and update their UI or databases accordingly.For example, A React app with web3 installed could listen to a Transfer event of an ERC20 token, and update its UI to reflect the balances of the sender and receiver. Events can represent anything the developer chooses, and are dependant on the design of the contract.//Modifiersmodifier isTokenAvailable(uint256 _tokenId) {    uint256 tokenStatus = idToTokenStatus[_tokenId];    require(        tokenStatus == 1,         \"Token is not available to transfer\");    _;}...function transferFrom(    address _from,    address _to,    uint256 _tokenId  )    external    isAvailable(_tokenId)  {    ...  }Modifiers are extensions of functions that execute before the function it is modifying in order to inject additional functionality, mostly in the form of checks and requirements of function arguments and contract state.In the example above we are extending transferFrom() with the isAvailable() modifier to check if a token is available to transfer. Within the modifier we use Solidity\u2019s require() method, which reverts execution upon a condition not being met. It also takes a second argument; a message to return upon a false result.See the underscore and semi-colon below this require statement?: This is where the function we are modifying is executed. We are essentially saying: I want this token\u2019s status to be available before I execute transferFrom.We can attach multiple modifiers to a function to check a range of conditions. Modifiers keep our code clean and adhering to DRY (Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself) principles. Cutting down code will also save gas fees upon deployment.//External Functionsfunction mint(address calldata _to, uint _amount)   external  payable {     ...     //call the internal minting function    _mint(_to, _amount);}External functions can now be defined. As we mentioned earlier on, external functions can be called from other contracts and public addresses. In the above example we define a mint() function. mint() handles the arguments needed to mint a token. It is payable and receives ETH in order to do so. Once the conditions are verified, mint() then calls an internal function, _mint(), in order to carry out the actual minting.Why would we have multiple mint()\u2019s consiting of internal and external functions? Well, I may wish to mint tokens in different ways.A mint(address _to) function could accept one recipient, whereas a mintMultiple(address[] _to) would accept an array of addresses, which would be looped through, but still utilise the same internal _mint() function to do the actual minting to the addresses.//Internal Functionsfunction _mint(address[] calldata _to, uint _amount)   internal {     ...     //call the internal minting function    _mint(_to, _amount);    emit TokenMinted(_to, _amount);}And finally, internal functions can be defined within our smart contracts. An emit statement is also included here, showing that an Event can be emitted within a function.Commenting syntaxBefore wrapping up this talk on Solidity 0.5, it is worth mentioning commenting syntax that the Solidity compiler can also pick up and warn you about in the event your comments are not adhering to the expected conventions.Take the following example from the ERC721 basic token transferFrom() method:/**  * @dev Throws unless `msg.sender` is the current owner, an authorized operator, or the approved  * address for this NFT. Throws if `_from` is not the current owner. Throws if `_to` is the zero  * address. Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT. This function can be changed to payable.  * @notice The caller is responsible to confirm that `_to` is capable of receiving NFTs or else  * they maybe be permanently lost.  * @param _from The current owner of the NFT.  * @param _to The new owner.  * @param _tokenId The NFT to transfer.  */function transferFrom(    address _from,    address _to,    uint256 _tokenId)...Notice the following conventions here:@dev is used to signify a comment for developers of the contract@notice is used to signify important warnings about function usage@param is used to outline each argument of a function. If we document an argument that does not exist, the Solidity compiler will warn us about this.@return is used to document the return type of the function. The above function does not return anything, therefore @return is not used.Where to go\u00a0Next?I hope this article has given you enough to whet your appetite for writing Solidity contracts.The official Solidity documentation does indeed go into the details and underlying workings of the language in a far greater depth than this article. Even though the examples are out of date it is a valuable, free resource for delving into Ethereum smart contract development.After reading this article familiarising yourself with the documentation should be more of a breeze, starting with the introduction:Introduction to Smart Contracts\u200a\u2014\u200aSolidity 0.5.3 documentationA contract in the sense of Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a\u2026solidity.readthedocs.io", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "", "link": "https://medium.com/@craig_10243/bitcoin-a-total-turing-machine-5a6c3c68f5a7?source=search_post", "post_date": "", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Celebrating Crypto Payments!", "author_name": "Vodi X", "link": "https://medium.com/@VodiX/celebrating-crypto-payments-2253e3583457?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 11", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "1.5K", "content": "Celebrating Crypto Payments!Vodi XBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 11Vodi has started accepting three new cryptocurrencies (BNB, BTC, ETH) as a form of payment!

I am always glad to share with you the most promising ideas and start-ups from the world of crypto-currencies. They are created in order to facilitate our life with you and to change the world in the future.Technological advancement has brought us many wonderful things and enhanced all aspects of our lives; a notable example being none other than entertainment. The 21st century has given us immensely powerful computers able to process games, making our entire entertainment experience interactive.Although the concept of blockchain has existed for more than a decade, the technology itself and its possibilities have only been actively realized only within the past few years. With the surge in popularity of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, now more and more people are becoming aware of the benefits of blockchain technology. Moreover, the gaming industry is still behind in the implementation of blockchain into games, although it truly does have undeniable advantages.Anyone that is playing mobile games to enjoy the gameplay experience, as well as the plot involved in it and not just playing for the mere sake of killing time will constantly face the following problems:Time loss, which leaves behind only a \u201cvirtual\u201d track.Endless in-game purchases, which in turn carry no tangible value outside of the game.The quality level of the mobile games market.These factors give Worldopo a competitive advantage and place it a leading position within a number of game categories in both the iOS and Android stores.Worldopo is a multiplayer real-time strategy. The genre is a simulator of urban construction. A unique combination of modern technologies organically entered into the gameplay of Worldopo opens to a wide audience a fascinating, fundamentally new mobile gaming experience.Worldopo is the only platform that deals with multiple players and has good gaming strategy layout. The platform allows blockchain which entertains the users of this platform. Worldopo has its own cryptocurrencies i.e. WPT. Therefore WPT motivates the economic structure and on the other hand help to build up a convincing gameplay for all users. In today\u2019s business sector gains huge profit from gaming platform and this platform gets almost 40% share of the total market. If we look into the facts and figures of the mobile gaming then we will realize that it not only gives profit to the gaming industry but also to the mobile software market entirely.In the gaming industry, with thanks to blockchain technology, we want to be able to solve the following problems:Player time LoseShortage of game assetsSecurity.With the help of tokenization and an active game token-economy, we create an opportunity for the player to turn his experience and game assets into tangible assets. Though despite all the technical complexity involved with the game, we created a game that is easily accessible and understandable to every player.Worldopo BenefitsStability The token will not have any future emissions, therefore, the guarantying stability of the token prices. Similarly, through the combination of different technologies, Worldopoly has the opportunity to reach various segments of the gaming market, which is one of the largest and that with a steady annual growth.High Liquidity Of The Tokens The game requires a high turnover of the utility tokens which is beneficial as it ensures that the supply of the tokens in the market is always minimal therefore maintaining the liquidity of the tokens.Advanced Technology Through the implementation of Blockchain / DAG in the tokens, players can monitor ownership of property within the game in a transparent manner. The blockchain technology also enables users to securely use their virtual in-game achievements to acquire actual items.Valuable Token The WPT is the first token in the gaming industry whose value is determined by pricing factors.Worldopo is a favourable starting point in comparison with other games in the same category. Unlike other AR games on the market, Worldopo is ready to offer a rich gaming experience with an interactive world, as well as many addon features to keep users captivated. With the current estimates for the gaming sector, the potential for stable growth in all directions is highly anticipated.The main advantages of the project ahead of competitorsOther games based on the blockchain Technology, are characterized by unattractive gameplay. They either target very specific niche markets (MMORPG genre), games based on casinos or simple games aimed at collecting in-game assets (CryptoKitties). At the moment there are no games on the market that focus on the main audience of casual players and offer exciting gameplay with high retention rates of players.The unique use of advanced technologies (AR, blocking, geo-positioning) effectively enriches the game process.Instead of creating a new game model that would require players to learn, Worldopo offers affordable and economical modeling within the real world. The game will be interesting and useful for people who want to understand the principles of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in a risk-free environment. Equally, people who do not want to sit still and want to immerse themselves in an alternative reality creating powerful infrastructures that they will be able to view with a mobile device.The ability to transform all the acquired gaming experience (in-game assets, resources, etc.) into cryptocurrencies. Not a minute spent in the game will be wasted.Combining the technologies of augmented reality, the blockchain, and geopositioning, Worldopo provides a unique gameplay experience that exceeds the boundaries of the current capabilities of mobile games. All these technologies are purposefully combined together to form up Worldopo, each technology plays its own unique role within the game.Augmented reality brings the user into a sense of an altered world merging the game world with reality, Blockchain provides an increased level of security, Geo-positioning brings cities around the world to your mobile device.The main goal of Worldopo is to bring the blockchain technology to the gaming industry and create new channels for the development of decentralized games, giving players the opportunity to easily evaluate all the advantages of crypto games.Worldopo users fall into two categories: First we have Cryptolords and then casual players. Each casual player, abiding by a certain strategy, can choose to move up to the rank Cryptolord, or can simply continue to enjoy the gameplay of the urban simulator as a casual player. The main goal of the game is to become a real estate mogul and proficiently manage all your assets. Players actively join clans, accumulate their own resources and forces to achieve their goals. All generated resource pools and transactions which are concluded in Worldopo are all backed by smart contracts. The identification of each unique player and all of his game assets are stored in the locker, which makes the game more secure and even more secureWorldopo WPT Token ICO DetailsParameters Of The ICOTOKEN: WPTTOKEN PROTOCOL: ERC20TOKEN SUPPLY: 200 000 000 WPTTOKEN SUPPLY DURING ICO: 120 000 000 WPTPRE-ICO PRICE: 1 WPT = 0.12 USDICO PRICE 14th round\u00a0: 1 WPT = 0.23 USDACCEPTED PAYMENT METHODS: ETH, BTC, USD, EUROHARD CAP: 18,000,000 USDConclusionWorldopo is reinventing the world of gameplay, incorporating several technologies into one integrative platform that will allow players to earn money while playing games.

You can find more details about EOSIO v1.8.0-rc1 in the GitHub repository. Documentation on the EOSIO Developer Portal will be updated by the stable release and recommendations for anyone operating a node for an EOSIO blockchain network are available in GitHub.This release candidate marks a major update for the EOSIO software platform: a consensus protocol upgrade, which implements a change to the protocol rules and requires alignment by block producing nodes for the upgrade to be successfully deployed. Please note, this is a Release Candidate for feedback, the official release will be marked stable in the coming weeks once we have finished vetting and testing the update with the community. The latest STABLE release is v1.7.3.When this release is promoted to stable, foundational mechanisms will be introduced to facilitate the activation of the consensus protocol upgrade. More specific details on these mechanisms are available in issues #6429, #6431, and #6437 in the GitHub repository for the EOSIO software. These mechanisms will allow a two-thirds majority of active block producers of EOSIO blockchains to activate individual features of the consensus protocol upgrade to modify the protocol rules. All nodes will need to be locally configured to accept these upgrades, which can be as simple as installing a new version of the nodeos software. Each feature is for the most part designed to be \u00e0 la carte, i.e. each feature can be activated independently of one another, however, some features may have dependencies on other features as noted in each issue.Continue reading below for an overview of the initial protocol upgrade features in this release and their implications to developers and users of EOSIO platforms:Protocol upgrade features in EOSIO v1.8.0-rc1 Release Candidate:(#6431) Enable protocol feature pre-activationCodename: PREACTIVATE_FEATUREThis feature is actually part of the foundational mechanisms to facilitate activation of consensus protocol upgrades and will, therefore, need to be the first feature that is activated. Some features will be configured to require pre-activation on the blockchain. This enables replacing the subjective block producer policy of when to activate a particular feature with an objective on-chain policy carried out via smart contracts. Typically this objective on-chain policy will be in the form of requiring more than two-thirds of active block producers to approve an on-chain multisig transaction proposal which would execute a special system contract action to pre-activate the particular feature. The PREACTIVATE_FEATURE feature must be activated before the new version of the system contract with that special action can be deployed since the action implementation will require a privileged intrinsic function only made available after PREACTIVATE_FEATURE is activated.(#6333) Disallow linking to non-existing permissionCodename: ONLY_LINK_TO_EXISTING_PERMISSIONThis disallows linking an action (via the eosio::linkauth native action) to a non-existing permission. Missing this check should not create any security issues; it is only to avoid an inconvenience for the user.(#6672) Fix excessive restrictions of eosio::linkauthCodename: FIX_LINKAUTH_RESTRICTIONThis relaxes the unintentionally restrictive limitations on which actions can be linked to a minimum required permission. Subjective mitigation cannot fix this bug. However, the bug is not a security issue. It simply means that until this feature is activated, contract developers should not name their actions updateauth, deleteauth, linkauth, unlinkauth, or canceldelay so that their users do not run into any trouble with setting custom minimum permissions for the contract\u2019s actions.(#6458) Disallow proposing an empty producer scheduleCodename: DISALLOW_EMPTY_PRODUCER_SCHEDULEThis disallows a contract from proposing an empty producer schedule. No subjective mitigation is needed for this bug because: proposing an empty producer schedule does no harm; and, only privileged contracts, such as the system contract, are allowed to propose producer schedules changes anyway.(#6705) Restrict authorization checking when sending actions to selfCodename: RESTRICT_ACTION_TO_SELFThis would remove the authorization checking bypass that applied when a contract sent an inline action to itself or when it sent a deferred transaction consisting of only actions to itself. Subjective mitigation to restrict the authorization bypass was already released. This feature goes further in the restriction and makes it objective so that the authorization checking behavior for all actions becomes consistent regardless of whether the actions are the original actions in an input transaction, actions included in a contract-generated transaction, or inline actions sent by a contract. Block producers should be aware that activating this feature could break existing contracts that rely on the remaining activate authorization bypass that this feature would remove.(#6103) Fix problems associated with replacing deferred transactionCodename: REPLACE_DEFERREDAn issue exists with the current mechanism to replace an existing deferred transaction using the send_deferred intrinsic function. First, the RAM used to store the original deferred transaction is not returned back to the original payer. Second, the transaction ID of the original deferred transaction persists, which means the new deferred transaction could retire in a block with the incorrect transaction ID. Fixing these issues requires a consensus protocol upgrade, which is what this feature does. This feature will also correct the RAM usage of any accounts that have already been affected by this bug. Currently, EOSIO software has a subjective mitigation to disallow replacing existing deferred transactions using the send_deferred intrinsic function. That subjective mitigation will be removed when this feature is activated.(#6115) Avoid transaction ID collision of deferred transactionsCodename: NO_DUPLICATE_DEFERRED_IDThe prior issue with replacing deferred transactions could lead to a deferred transaction retiring with a transaction ID that is a repeat of a prior retired transaction. But this is not the only way a deferred transaction could end up with the same ID as another transaction in the blockchain with the current protocol rules of EOSIO. Various stakeholders, particularly block explorers, would benefit from a guarantee of it being virtually impossible for any two distinct transactions within a blockchain to have the same transaction ID. This feature, which depends on REPLACE_DEFERRED feature, makes the changes necessary to enable that guarantee. Block producers should be aware that activating this feature will slightly change the structure of the deferred transactions provided to the onerror handlers of contracts; for details of this change and the impact it may possibly have on existing contracts, see this comment.(#6105) Modify restrictions on RAM billingCodename: RAM_RESTRICTIONSA prior released subjective mitigation disallowed unprivileged contracts executing under the context of an action notification from billing any RAM to accounts other than self. Rather than simply making this restriction objective, this feature takes a more flexible approach which still achieves the same goal of disallowing an unprivileged contract executing under a notification context from increasing the RAM usage of any other account by the end of the action. However, it also allows unprivileged contracts executing an action (whether under a notification context or not) to carry out database operations which bill RAM to another account, despite no authorization on the action from that account, as long as by the end of the action the RAM usage of the account has not increased.(#6332) Only bill CPU and network bandwidth to the first authorizer of a transactionCodename: ONLY_BILL_FIRST_AUTHORIZERThis feature changes the CPU and Network usage billing behavior of EOSIO blockchains to only charge the first authorizer of the transaction. This one change enables entrepreneuring application developers to build alternative models for paying the CPU and Network resource costs that a transaction imposes on the blockchain network. For example, an application can be designed to pay the CPU and Network costs of their users but only for transactions by the user that solely interact with the application\u2019s services.(#6988) Forward setcode action to WebAssembly code deployed on eosio accountCodename: FORWARD_SETCODEThis feature changes how the eosio::setcode action is dispatched so that, when activated, the WebAssembly system contract code has a chance to execute when a contract is set on some account. By allowing the WebAssembly code to run, it opens up different possibilities of enforcing on-chain policies regarding the deployment of contracts.(#7028) Allow contracts to determine which account is the sender of an inline actionCodename: GET_SENDERThis feature adds a new intrinsic function called get_sender which allows contracts to determine which account is the sender of an inline action. This can enable a more flexible method for a contract to notify another contract of an event by sending an inline action rather than using require_receipient while still remaining resistant to spoofing attempts thanks to the new intrinsic function.Be sure to review the EOSIO v1.8.0-rc1 repository in detail for a full explanation of all the features in this release.Recommended upgrade process for all EOSIO based blockchain networks:In GitHub, we have detailed recommendations for anyone operating a node for an EOSIO blockchain network to adequately test and update their systems for each feature to be implemented. All node operators (including non block-producing nodes) should review the suggested instructions as soon as possible because updating to EOSIO v1.8.0 will require a replay from genesis which can take some time. These steps should be followed on an additional node that you can afford to take offline for an extended period of time.Before deploying the upgrade to any non-test networks, protocol upgrades should be deployed and verified on test networks. Existing EOSIO test networks can use EOSIO v1.8.0-rc1 released today to carry out and test the upgrade process.This test upgrade process can give Block Producers of their respective EOSIO blockchain networks practice with carrying out the steps necessary to successfully coordinate the activation of the first feature, which will fork out any nodes that have not yet updated to the new version of nodeos by the time of activation. The process will also inform Block Producers of the requirements for nodes to upgrade nodeos to v1.8.x from v1.7.x and earlier, and it can help them decide on an appropriate deadline to be given as notice to stakeholders of the network for when the first feature will be activated.Stay ConnectedIf you are interested in providing feedback and working more closely with our team to improve EOSIO for developers, you can send our developer relations team an email at developers@block.one.You can also keep up to date with future updates by subscribing to our mailing list on the EOSIO Developer Portal.

While it may seem clear that we aim to do so by making it possible to transact your crypto at any point, we offer much more than that.A standard service in the Crypto community that remains an important part of community interactions is the exchange. Exchanges enable the community to have the freedom of swapping to the currency they want, but perhaps more importantly, they give people convenience. Rather than going about the city, searching for someone who may be willing to buy one\u2019s crypto for another, a person can just use an exchange to make the transfer.Exchanges provide flat convenience but there\u2019s one hick-up. Most exchanges hold a limited set of coins and tokens. Moreover, while major coins may be listed on most major exchanges, there may be differing prices and levels of liquidity at each exchange at any point of day. It\u2019s well-understood that there\u2019s plenty of major arbitrage opportunities in the Crypto market but it remains challenging to take advantage of them since it takes a good bit of time to hop from 1 exchange to another, just enough time for the prices and liquidity to completely change.TAP\u2019s not a trading app, but it is an app that intends to empower the Crypto community and allowing people to pick the highest sell price for their holding is an easy way to empower the community.Settle for only the Best\u00a0OfferGiven the inconveniences and risks involved with moving from one exchange to another to take advantage of a higher price, most people just surrender the thought of even considering to take advantage of arbitrage.TAP, however, connects to multiple exchanges and its goal is to extend the menu of exchanges it connects to. Thus, whenever you need to sell your crypto, you won\u2019t need to worry about hopping from exchange to exchange to take advantage of the best price. Rather, when transacting any crypto, TAP will innately choose the best price available on various major exchanges and will fulfill the transaction in less than 3 seconds.Even if not making a transaction, the app\u2019s users will have access to multiple exchanges and will be able to transact on the best price. This means that TAP will act as an extender of the convenience exchanges are meant to offer. One app to give the community access to all the major exchanges. Moreover, as TAP will provide a simple in-app KYC, users won\u2019t need to go through the KYC process for multiple exchanges; TAP will be the one-key access.Making Crypto more WelcomingWhile TAP\u2019s facilitation of offering easy access to exchanges is appealing to any member of the Crypto community, it may likely be most appealing to those with fresh interest.It\u2019s important to note that TAP will serve as a wallet as-well. So, whenever the Crypto community will have a new member, he/she won\u2019t be burdened to go about acquiring exchanges across multiple exchanges to get the specific tokens he/she wants, nor will the person need to go through a lengthy process to pull out fiat from a crypt-fiat exchange.Instead, new members of the community will be given a simple convenience to simply adopt a single app as a wallet that connects to multiple exchanges while allowing them to get fiat at point of will. Given that Crypto currently has a \u201cUI problem,\u201d TAP could be a major solution in the race to make Crypto more welcoming to a newer audience, especially one adjusted to the comforts of the conveniences and quick fulfillment lifestyles of today.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Qubit AG Established Partnership with p2pb2b Crypto\u00a0Exchange", "author_name": "Worldopo", "link": "https://medium.com/worldopo/qubit-ag-established-partnership-with-p2pb2b-crypto-exchange-9a8cc958dee5?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 9, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "114", "content": "Qubit AG Established Partnership with p2pb2b Crypto\u00a0ExchangeWorldopoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 9, 2018Greetings!The experts from the p2pb2b exchange will be the main Advisors on exchange listing strategy and promotion of WPT-token.Let us briefly introduce our new partner\u200a\u2014\u200ap2pb2b cryptocurrency exchange.p2pb2b is a platform for trading cryptocurrencies that was launched in 2014. 4 years later, the team of the project has introduced a completely updated exchange in accordance with the needs and requirements of crypto market players.

So first I\u2019ll talk about governance:Governance BasicsGenerally, governance is about decisions that ultimately affect people\u00b9 (people called \u201cstakeholders\u201d). It\u2019s about the processes that participants in governance use to make decisions. It\u2019s also about how they coordinate around decisions and decision-making processes. It includes the establishment, maintenance, and revocation of the legitimacy of decisions, decision making processes, norms, and other mechanisms for coordination.While there are some key terms in the above paragraph, I\u2019m only going to talk through legitimacy, because I\u2019m not using any of the other terms in a very specialized way. I say that a decision, decision-making process or coordination mechanism \u201chas legitimacy\u201d if there is common knowledge\u00b2 that participants in governance will implement the decision, or use the decision-making process or coordination mechanism.The important point here is this: if a coordination mechanism is legitimate, people will (justifiably) act like it\u2019s a fact that people will use it. When a decision is legitimate, they don\u2019t need to worry about whether other people will also implement it, they can be confident that they will. On the other hand, if it\u2019s illegitimate then they will act like it\u2019s a fact that people won\u2019t use it. I see the establishment of legitimate decisions, decision-making processes and coordination mechanisms as a clear, elegant solution to coordination problems.So when I say that governance is about the establishment, maintenance, revocation of legitimacy, I mean that it\u2019s about how people collectively coordinate (in common knowledge) on what decisions to implement, what processes to use, what norms to have, and what other mechanisms for coordination to adopt.The process of legitimizing and delegitimizing things is a coordination problem, and it can be highly political when different participants want to coordinate around competing outcomes. In my estimation, politics is a coordination \u201cgame\u201d played between participants in governance who signal their preferences over possible outcomes in an effort to get everyone to coordinate on their preferred outcome, whether it is to A) make decisions that can\u2019t be made by an already existing legitimate process, or B) establish, maintain and revoke the legitimacy of decisions, decision making processes and coordination mechanisms.In my experience, most of the work in governance is playing politics, and I think all of this discussion is directly relevant to blockchain governance. Blockchains are governed, and blockchain governance outcomes will be driven by the politics of participants in the public blockchain space.Blockchain Governance BasicsThis section has two parts, the first describing the decisions that are fundamentally a part of blockchain governance because of the nature of blockchain technology, and second about \u201cforking\u201d.Decisions in Blockchain GovernanceBlockchains are distributed systems. They are essentially consensus protocols, which means that different nodes in the network (e.g. computers on the internet) have to be running compatible software. Like really compatible software.Deployments of blockchains typically have \u201cblockchain communities\u201d that rely on them and govern the blockchain protocol.\u201cNode operators\u201d are the owners and managers of nodes that run the protocol. Most node operators don\u2019t want to write much software, and it\u2019s a technical challenge for anyone to independently write compatible implementations of any consensus protocol even if they have a specification. As a result, node operators rely on software repositories (usually hosted on Microsoft/Github servers) to provide them with the software they choose to run.\u201cCore developers\u201d of a blockchain are software developers who work on the software that implement that protocol. Developers have processes that are supposed to assure the quality of the software they release, and are generally very interested in maintaining the legitimacy of their software repositories because they want to see people using their software (as opposed to someone else\u2019s).Blockchains are normally associated with trademarks. A blockchain\u2019s trademark may or may not be registered, but blockchain communities use trademarks to market their blockchain and to make it easy for users to identify which blockchain they are interacting with.For a blockchain community to successfully govern its blockchain, the members need to coordinate, or somehow be coordinated. At a minimum this means that node operators, developers, and the users of the trademark have to coordinate.Blockchains can have big communities that form diverse ecosystems that include many participants and stakeholders that aren\u2019t core developers, node operators, and users of trademarks. These stakeholders might include block explorers and other low level service providers, exchanges, speculators, application developers, users, journalists and passive observers, just to name just a few. On the other hand, blockchain communities might also be just a team of core developers running their own nodes, promoting their protocol in hopes of one day having a bigger community.This says something about the decisions that blockchain governance necessarily makes: that core developers have to choose how to release software, that node operators have to decide what software to run, that trademark users have to decide how they use the blockchain\u2019s trademark, and that these decisions have to be coordinated by the blockchain community. But it notably says nothing about the processes, norms, coordination mechanisms, and politics that will inevitably drive these decisions for any large blockchain community.Forking in Blockchain GovernanceBlockchains have network effects, and blockchain communities generally would prefer to stay together than to fork apart. However, because blockchains are software running on the internet, a portion of the community that questions the legitimacy of a governance decision can make a copy of the blockchain network (and corresponding software repositories) and maintain a \u201cfork\u201d of the blockchain outside of the governance of the original chain. See Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic for case studies of blockchain forks.Forking a blockchain is a coordination problem because participants might have peers who are signaling their intent to go adopt different sides of the fork, and possibly because of contention about which post-fork community gets to use the pre-fork trademark.As a general rule, I recommend that the reader imagine that forking a blockchain is much easier than forking a nation-state, but much harder than forking Linux\u00b3. As another general rule, there is naturally a \u201cpower law\u201d distribution, where a majority of blockchains have relatively small communities relative to a small number of blockchains with relatively large communities.This \u201cpower law\u201d rule means that even though it is very possible to fork, there will only ever be a small number of forks that are ultimately successful enough to be considered a \u201cmajor blockchain\u201d. As a result, the blockchain governance regimes of a small number of major blockchains will determine governance outcomes for the entire blockchain space.These outcomes are high stakes outcomes for anyone participating in the space, and for people whose lives might be impacted by blockchain technology in the future. This is why we need to be concerned about the blockchain governance of every major public blockchain (existing or merely aspiring).Blockchain Governance OutcomesBlockchain governance is still nascent, so there is still a wide range of possible outcomes. Because these outcomes have the potential to have a significant impacts on people\u2019s lives, and because people have diverging interests, blockchain governance outcomes will be a result of politics.I\u2019m going to share five possible outcomes of blockchain governance, to paint some of the political landscape. These scenarios aren\u2019t all mutually exclusive, but they are distinct visions of the future of blockchain governance.Autonomous BlockchainsIn this vision for the future of blockchain governance, blockchain governance essentially does nothing other than make sure that the blockchain keeps functioning according to the pre-determined rules of protocol. This is accompanied by a norm that the protocol should not change unless absolutely necessary.In this governance outcome, the only legitimate decision in almost any circumstance is to allow the protocol to run unchanged. The appeal of this governance model is that it minimizes the cost of coordinating around the governance the protocol by minimizing the amount of governance that is done. It addresses blockchain governance by eliminating most latitude to make any decisions whatsoever.The downside to this vision is that blockchain governance will not take responsibility for harm caused by use of the blockchain, whether unintentional or caused by malicious actors. Read my blog titled \u201cblockchains considered (potentially) harmful\u201d to get an idea of what a future with autonomous blockchains could mean.Blockchain Governance CaptureIn this scenario, blockchain governance is captured by an existing governance system. I\u2019m going to briefly describe four examples of capture:Corporate capture, where blockchain governance is captured by the corporate governance of a corporation that becomes the sole source of legitimacy in blockchain governance.State capture, where blockchain governance of different \u201cregional blockchains\u201d is captured by the regulators and courts of major jurisdictions. For example one day \u201cEthereum USA\u201d might enforce US economic sanctions, \u201cEthereum Europe\u201d might enforce GDPR, while \u201cEthereum China\u201d might enforce capital control policies.Developer capture, where the blockchain core developers capture governance because their software development process becomes the only source of legitimacy in blockchain governance.Cartel capture, a cartel of participants in blockchain governance (for example, a cartel of node operators or a cartel of coin holders) collude to control blockchain governance.In this scenario, blockchain governance processes and norms are determined by the governance norms and processes of the capturing entity. In this scenario the capturing entity has control over all the important sources of legitimate blockchain governance decisions.The appeal of this governance scenario is that capture is something we\u2019re used to, and it benefits from the legitimacy, flexibility and maturity of the governance of the capturing entity. The downside is that decisions made by captured blockchain governance may represent the interests of the parties who control the entity who has captured governance, and not necessarily the interests of the stakeholders who are affected by their decisions.Internet Censorship as Blockchain GovernanceIn this scenario, rather than allowing their publics to be exposed to or to access public blockchains, major jurisdictions outlaw and censor access to the blockchain that do not comply with local regulations.The appeal of this approach is that it allows local governments to maintain sovereignty, giving the local regime more control over the public use of international blockchains. For example, this might be motivated by consumer protection, privacy and data protection, or preventing intellectual property rights infringement. If a regime needs to impose capital controls to maintain a currency peg they might find censorship to be a valuable way to prevent circumvention, for another example.The main downside of this vision is that it comes at a cost of people\u2019s free access to the global public internet, on top of denying access to any benefits that could be acquired from the use of global public blockchains. It\u2019s also technically difficult to censor access to public blockchains without censoring access to unknown IPs because it requires deep packet inspection. At the same time the censorship wouldn\u2019t be perfect, as anyone with enough motivation, knowledge, resources and/or the friends will be able to circumvent the censorship regime in most jurisdictions.Governance via Public International Law or DiplomacyIn this possible blockchain governance outcome, public blockchains are governed by international institutions from the legal tradition. This could be an entity chosen or formed by the United Nations, or established through a multilateral agreement between states.The appeal of this outcome is that it has the potential to actively govern global blockchains that are accessible to the global public, while avoiding a lot of the downside of autonomous blockchains. The downside is that legitimizing an international governance institution may be difficult in some jurisdictions, and reaching multilateral agreement on the goals of regulation and the means to enforce their terms it could be harder yet. This scenario would require that states locally enforce globally mandated blockchain governance decisions, which can be challenging if the decisions are unpopular locally.Governance via International Private CooperationIn this scenario, there is a global blockchain governance system that is open for participation by the public. That system could be driven by associations of private people, corporations and NGOs. This is arguably how we do internet governance today, through institutions like ICANN, IETF, WC3, IGF, etc.The appeal of this vision is that it allows global public blockchains to be accessible by a global public while avoiding a lot of the downsides of autonomous software. It could potentially achieve a high amount of legitimacy, because it is a multi-stakeholder governance arrangement. The downside to this vision is that it may be hard for the system to make decisions (or to legitimize any material processes or coordination mechanisms) because it brings together a wide range of stakeholders with divergent interests, and because there is a lack of international legal structures that can actually force governance outcomes.", "responses": "18"}, {"title": "What are Smart Contracts and how can they be used for\u00a0assets?", "author_name": "SharesChain Blockchain", "link": "https://medium.com/@SharesChainITO/what-are-smart-contracts-and-how-can-they-be-used-for-assets-89253a7b057c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 23, 2018", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "1.5K", "content": "What are Smart Contracts and how can they be used for\u00a0assets?SharesChain BlockchainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 23, 2018An overview of smart contracts and how real assets can be integrated with them using the SharesChain platform.A Smart Contract serves a very similar function as a contract does in the real world. Contracts, in typical cases, involve two or more parties that agree on certain terms, sign the contract, and once these terms have been carried out and both parties are content, the contract is deemed fulfilled. Smart contracts employ the same principle but are able to operate automatically via an algorithm that has the terms of the contract embedded within it. This allows for trust in a space where setting up certain types of deals can be difficult.Smart Contracts in peer-to-peer exchangesThis can be more easily illustrated through a few different types of examples, and we will begin with the simplest: A direct exchange or a tit-for-tat exchange can be the most basic way to take advantage of a smart contract. This can be likened to the case where an individual has a Bitcoin and wishes to trade this for a fiat currency by means of receiving a direct deposit into their bank account. Platforms that provide this basic smart contract system already exist and one such example would be Localbitcoins.com.The typical trouble, without smart contracts, arises immediately in the questions, \u201cWho should send the money first? And how can I be sure the other party will reciprocate?\u201d With smart contracts, however, the party that holds the cryptocurrency can deposit the appropriate amount of tokens into the smart contract and the tokens will be held there by the system. At this point we can consider the smart contract to be activated. The party involved in the activation of the contract by submitting his or her tokens will also provide the other party with their bank account details for direct deposit. The sender of fiat funds receives the contract order and activation, and then authorizes the direct deposit via their bank\u2019s website\u200a\u2014\u200aor whatever other means are available. After this step, they will provide a receipt or otherwise some proof of transfer. Once the party that activated the smart contract receives the fiat currency, they will mark the contract fulfilled by clicking a fulfillment button that releases the tokens to the other party.As a security backup, the host of the smart contract is a third-party platform or entity responsible for facilitating any problems. If the party that activated contract doesn\u2019t release the tokens after some preset or agreed upon amount of time, the third-party facilitator will request for the proof of transfer. They also possess the authority to release the funds of the smart contract depending on the terms and conditions prior to the contract\u2019s activation. This way, disputes can be made, and all initial funds will be able to be distributed to the appropriate party thus ridding the situation of any potential scams.Since SharesChain is the exemplar of an ITO aiming to digitize any type of asset by utilizing smart contracts, we can take the example of direct exchanges and examine some possible ways in which it could be utilized in other types of markets.Example of smart contract applications for real\u00a0assetsSo direct internet exchanges are simple applications for smart contract outlines, but SharesChain offers the methods, integrated service providers, tools and frameworks for bringing in real-world assets to this picture. Say a user wants to sell their car; they could create a Smart Contract. The owner of the car has a real asset that links their identity to the legal \u201ctitle\u201d of the car.This example has extensions far beyond the actual trading of the physical car, which we will outline later, but let us see how the trade of the actual vehicle from one person to another would work. The car owner would place their car in a storage unit that has a passcode to enter. The owner then, would write up a smart contract dictating: the price of the vehicle, their personal wallet account number, the passcode for the storage unit and the command to release said passcode once the value has been deposited into the smart contract account. Any disagreement would result in the smart contract returning the tokens to the original party that deposited them.As soon as a buyer agrees to the price, they would deposit the amount into the owner\u2019s account and the smart contract would execute to release the passcode to the new owner. The smart contract would also have to be backed by a legally verified document in the real world, the title, that would update to relinquish ownership of the vehicle. Thus, it legally registers the buyer on the blockchain as the new owner of the vehicle.Of course, ideally there would be some assurance that the car was in good shape, and this would be the job for specialized service providers. Otherwise, the owner could just as easily have put a big box in the storage unit where the car should be, but delegators, facilitators and service providers will be able to provide users the necessary assurances. The SharesChain network can provide access to these specialized service providers along with an integrated mechanism for paying them to employ their capabilities. Smart Contracts could potentially make buying a car as simple as buying a new pair of shoes on Amazon.To extend the impacts of this example, let\u2019s assume the seller from the previous case is instead the manufacturer. They deposit these cars in an official warehouse where people can go and pick up their new car. The greatest benefit here is that there would be no need for centralized dealerships. No need for haggling and the making of deals with questionable sellers, only to be left feeling uneasy as to whether or not it was the correct choice. It would not require much additional configuration of the smart contract to incorporate other factors of vehicle acquisition such as the test-drive factor. In the very least, the art of haggling will be left up to the individual seller and the processes can largely be completed online.Dealers and manufacturers are not the only parties that could benefit from this process as car rental companies, leasing companies or private companies that participate in temporary car-share programs would see great value in this decentralized capability. The corporate solutions available would only be limited to our imagination in how to utilize this platform and framework.There are unlimited potential applicationsThis is just one example of how a smart contract and its application to real assets can help in a variety of different ways because cars provide a nice illustration since the title transference process and the physical aspect of the car are reasonably simple to imagine. However, applications to the vast amounts of other assets available such as the different types of real estate deeds would be another. Over the coming weeks we will explore other various examples that the SharesChain ecosystem makes possible.Smart Contracts on their own can\u2019t do these things, as they are limited to the blockchain. They serve to fulfill a task that is run on the basic principle of if/then. If the money is deposited in the account, then it will release the tokens to the sender of said money. This is simple enough for a basic formula, but when one wants to place a legal asset on that smart contract, the rules and terms the contract runs from must be in line with the legal regulations that correspond to their state\u2019s local guidelines. That is why SharesChain possesses so much value in the sense that it provides the framework by which one can make the smart contract actually follow those rules.The Smart Contracts work solely within the blockchain. Thus, any information or commands it can use, or give, must be within the blockchain. If it needs to go beyond the blockchain for external data, it requires the help of an Oracle.Stay tuned for our article on how SharesChain will use smart contracts with an Oracle application for maximum utility in the real world of trading assets.Telegram:Join Our Live Conversationhttps://t.me/SharesChainOfficial", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Two more venues became the participants of Sponsy Ad\u00a0Network", "author_name": "Sponsy Blockchain", "link": "https://medium.com/sponsy/two-more-venues-became-the-participants-of-sponsy-ad-network-30a3795a8634?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 17, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "5.4K", "content": "Two more venues became the participants of Sponsy Ad\u00a0NetworkSponsy BlockchainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 17, 2018Two more restaurants signed up to join the Sponsy Digital Ad Network.\u201cTalaka\u201d restaurant.

As a result, it will not be able to run on Windows and you\u2019ll have restrictions on what you can do. I suggest setting up a virtual machine if you are running Windows before continuing.This article assumes some knowledge of Javascript. It isn\u2019t a tutorial aimed at beginner programmers, but rather at programmers who are beginners in the blockchain space.What are we building?So, you want to build a blockchain application but have no idea where to start? Don\u2019t worry. Through this tutorial, we will set up a trading cards network. Different Traders who own TradingCards of Baseball, Football, and Cricket players, will be able to trade cards among themselves.We\u2019ll also set up a REST API server to allow client side software to interact with our business network. Finally, we will also generate an Angular 4 application which uses the REST API to interface with our network.You can find the full final code of what we are about to build on this Github repoAre you ready to get started?Table of\u00a0ContentsIntroduction to Hyperledger Fabric and related applicationsInstalling the prerequisites, tools, and a Fabric runtimeCreating and deploying our business networkTesting our business networkGenerating a REST API serverGenerating an Angular application which uses the REST APIIntroduction to Hyperledger Fabric and related applicationsDevelopment environment overview for HyperledgerHyperledger Fabric is an open source framework for making private (permissioned) blockchain business networks, where identities and roles of members are known to other members. The network built on fabric serves as the back-end, with a client-side application front-end. SDK\u2019s are available for Nodejs and Java to build client applications, with Python and Golang support coming soon.Hyperledger Composer is a set of Javascript based tools and scripts which simplify the creation of Hyperledger Fabric networks. Using these tools, we can generate a business network archive (BNA) for our network. Composer broadly covers these components:Business Network Archive (BNA)Composer PlaygroundComposer REST ServerBusiness Network Archive\u200a\u2014\u200aComposer allows us to package a few different files and generate an archive which can then be deployed onto a Fabric network. To generate this archive, we need:Network Model\u200a\u2014\u200aA definition of the resources present in the network. These resources include Assets, Participants, and Transactions. We will come back to these later.Business Logic\u200a\u2014\u200aLogic for the transaction functionsAccess Control Limitations\u200a\u2014\u200aContains various rules which define the rights of different participants in the network. This includes, but is not limited to, defining what Assets the Participants can control.Query File (optional)\u200a\u2014\u200aA set of queries which can be run on the network. These can be thought of as similar to SQL queries. You can read more on queries here.Composer Playground is a web based user interface that we can use to model and test our business network. Playground is good for modelling simple Proofs of Concept, as it uses the browser\u2019s local storage to simulate the blockchain network. However, if we are running a local Fabric runtime and have deployed a network to it, we can also access that using Playground. In this case, Playground isn\u2019t simulating the network, it\u2019s communicating with the local Fabric runtime directly.Composer REST Server is a tool which allows us to generate a REST API server based on our business network definition. This API can be used by client applications and allows us to integrate non-blockchain applications in the network.Installing the prerequisites, tools, and a Fabric\u00a0runtime1. Installing PrereqsNow that we have a high level understanding of what is needed to build these networks, we can start developing. Before we do that, though, we need to make sure we have the prerequisites installed on our system. An updated list can be found here.Docker Engine and Docker ComposeNodejs and NPMGitPython 2.7.xFor Ubuntu users, Hyperledger has a bash script available to make this process extremely easy. Run the following commands in your terminal:Unfortunately, Mac users have to manually install the aforementioned tools and make sure they have all the prerequisites on their system. This page is kept up to date with installation instructions.2. Installing tools to ease developmentRun the following commands in your Terminal, and make sure you\u2019re NOT using sudo when running npm commands.composer-cli is the only essential package. The rest aren\u2019t core components but will turn out to be extremely useful over time. We will learn more about what each of these do as we come across them.3. Installing a local Hyperledger Fabric\u00a0runtimeLet\u2019s go through the commands and see what they mean. First, we make and enter a new directory. Then, we download and extract the tools required to install Hyperledger Fabric.We then specify the version of Fabric we want, at the time of writing we need 1.2, hence hlfv12. Then, we download the fabric runtime and start it up.Finally, we generate a PeerAdmin card. Participants in a Fabric network can have business network cards, analogous to real life business cards. As we mentioned before, Fabric is a base layer for private blockchains to build upon. The holder of the PeerAdmin business card has the authority to deploy, delete, and manage business networks on this Fabric runtime (aka YOU!)If everything went well, you should see an output like this:Also, if you type ls you\u2019ll see this:Basically what we did here was just download and start a local Fabric network. We can stop is using\u00a0./stopFabric.sh if we want to. At the end of our development session, we should run\u00a0./teardownFabric.shNOTE: This local runtime is meant to be frequently started, stopped, and torn down for development use. For a runtime with more persistent state, you\u2019ll want to deploy the network outside the dev environment. You can do this by running the network on Kubernetes or on managed platforms like IBM Blockchain. Still, you should go through this tutorial first to get an idea.Creating and deploying our business\u00a0networkRemember the packages yo and generator-hyperledger-composer we installed earlier?yo provides us a generator ecosystem where generators are plugins which can be run with the yo command. This is used to set up boilerplate sample applications for various projects. generator-hyperledger-composer is the Yo generator we will be using as it contains specs to generate boilerplate business networks among other things.1. Generating a business\u00a0networkOpen terminal in a directory of choice and type yo hyperledger-composerYou\u2019ll be greeted with something similar to the above. Select Business Network and name it cards-trading-network as shown below:2. Modeling our business\u00a0networkThe first and most important step towards making a business network is identifying the resources present. We have four resource types in the modeling language:AssetsParticipantsTransactionsEventsFor our cards-trading-network\u00a0, we will define an asset typeTradingCard\u00a0, a participant type Trader\u00a0, a transaction TradeCard and an event TradeNotification.Go ahead and open the generated files in a code editor of choice. Open up org.example.biznet.cto which is the modeling file. Delete all the code present in it as we\u2019re gonna rewrite it (except for the namespace declaration).This contains the specification for our asset TradingCard\u00a0. All assets and participants need to have a unique identifier for them which we specify in the code, and in our case, it\u2019s cardIdAlso, our asset has a GameType cardType property which is based off the enumerator defined below. Enums are used to specify a type which can have up to N possible values, but nothing else. In our example, no TradingCard can have a cardType other than Baseball, Football, or CricketNow, to specify our Trader participant resource type, add the following code in the modeling fileThis is relatively simpler and quite easy to understand. We have a participant type Trader and they\u2019re uniquely identified by their traderIds.Now, we need to add a reference to our TradingCards to have a reference pointing to their owner so we know who the card belongs to. To do this, add the following line inside your TradingCard asset:--> Trader ownerso that the code looks like this:This is the first time we\u2019ve used --> and you must be wondering what this is. This is a relationship pointer. o and --> are how we differentiate between a resource\u2019s own properties vs a relationship to another resource type. Since the owner is a Trader which is a participant in the network, we want a reference to that Trader directly, and that\u2019s exactly what --> does.Finally, go ahead and add this code in the modeling file which specifies what parameters will be required to make a transaction and emitting an event.3. Adding logic for our transactionsTo add logic behind the TradeCard function, we need a Javascript logic file. Create a new directory named lib in your project\u2019s folder and create a new file named logic.js with the following code:NOTE: The decorator in the comments above the function is very important. Without the @param {org.example.biznet.TradingCard} trade\u00a0, the function has no idea which Transaction the code refers to from the modeling language. Also, make sure the parameter name being passed (i.e. trade) is the one you\u2019re passing along in the function definition right after.This code basically checks if the specified card has forTrade == true and updates the card\u2019s owner in that case. Then, it fires off the TradeNotification event for that card.4. Defining permissions and access\u00a0rulesAdd a new rule in permissions.acl to give participants access to their resources. In production, you would want to be more strict with these access rules. You can read more about them here.5. Generating a Business Network Archive\u00a0(BNA)Now that all the coding is done, it\u2019s time to make an archive file for our business network so we can deploy it on our local Fabric runtime. To do this, open Terminal in your project directory and type this:composer archive create --sourceType dir --sourceName\u00a0.This command tells Hyperledger Composer we want to build a BNA from a directory which is our current root folder.NOTE: The BNA name and version come from the package.json file. When you add more code, you should change the version number there to deploy unique archives capable of upgrading existing business networks.6. Install and Deploy the BNA\u00a0fileWe can install and deploy the network to our local Fabric runtime using the PeerAdmin user. To install the business network, typecomposer network install --archiveFile cards-trading-network@0.0.1.bna --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1To deploy the business network, typecomposer network start --networkName cards-trading-network --networkVersion 0.0.1 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --file cards-trading-admin.cardThe networkName and networkVersion must be the same as specified in your package.json otherwise it won\u2019t work.--file takes the name of the file to be created for THIS network\u2019s business card. This card then needs to be imported to be usable by typingcomposer card import --file cards-trading-admin.cardAmazing. We can now confirm that our network is up and running by typingcomposer network ping --card admin@cards-trading-network--card this time takes the admin card of the network we want to ping.If everything went well, you should see something similar to this:Your network version will be 0.0.1 or whatever your package.json specifies\u200a\u2014\u200aI actually forgot to take this screenshot and uploaded it after I was done writing the tutorial and making\u00a0editsTesting our Business\u00a0NetworkNow that our network is up and running on Fabric, we can start Composer Playground to interact with it. To do this, type composer-playground in Terminal and open up http://localhost:8080/ in your browser and you should see something similar to this:Press Connect Now for admin@cards-trading-network and you\u2019ll be greeted with this screen:The Define page is where we can make changes to our code, deploy those changes to upgrade our network, and export business network archives.Head over to the Test page from the top menu, and you\u2019ll see this:Select Trader from Participants, click on Create New Participant near the top right, and make a new Trader similar to this:Go ahead and make a couple more Traders. Here are what my three traders look like with the names Haardik, John, and Tyrone.Now, let\u2019s make some Assets. Click on TradingCard from the left menu and press Create New Asset. Notice how the owner field is particularly interesting here, looking something like this:This is a relationship. This is what the --> means. We specify the exact resource type followed by their unique identifier and voila, we have a relationship pointer.Go ahead and finish making a TradingCard something similar to this:Notice how the owner fields points to Trader#1 aka Haardik for me. Go ahead and make a couple more cards, and enable a couple to have forTrade set to true.Notice how my Card#2 has forTrade == true?Now for the fun stuff, let\u2019s try trading cards\u00a0:DClick on Submit Transaction in the left and make card point to TradingCard#2 and newOwner point to Trader#3 like this:Press Submit and take a look at your TradingCards, you\u2019ll see that Card#2 now has owner Trader#3\u00a0:DGenerating a REST API\u00a0ServerDoing transactions with Playground is nice, but not optimal. We have to make client-side software for users to provide them a seamless experience, they don\u2019t even have to necessarily know about the underlying blockchain technology. To do so, we need a better way of interacting with our business network. Thankfully, we have the composer-rest-server module to help us with just that.Type composer-rest-server in your terminal, specify admin@cards-trading-network\u00a0, select never use namespaces, and continue with the default options for the rest as follows:Open http://localhost:3000/explorer/ and you\u2019ll be greeted with a documented version of an automatically generated REST API\u00a0:DGenerating an Angular application which uses the REST\u00a0APIRemember the yo hyperledger-composer generator? It can do more than generating a business network. It can also create an Angular 4 application running against the REST API we created above.To create the Angular web application, type yo hyperledger-composer in your Terminal, select Angular, choose to connect to an existing business network with the card admin@cards-trading-network, and connect to an existing REST API as well. (Edit: Newer versions of the software may ask for the card file instead of just the name of the card)This will go on to run npm install\u00a0, give it a minute, and once it\u2019s all done you\u2019ll be able to load up http://localhost:4200/ and be greeted with a page similar to this:Edit: Newer versions of the software may require you to run npm install yourself and then run npm startYou can now play with your network from this application directly, which communicates with the network through the REST server running on port 3000.Congratulations! You just set up your first blockchain business network using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer\u00a0:DYou can add more features to the cards trading network, setting prices on the cards and giving a balance to all Trader. You can also have more transactions which allow the Traders to toggle the value of forTrade\u00a0. You can integrate this with non blockchain applications and allow users to buy new cards which get added to their account, which they can then further trade on the network.The possibilities are endless, what will you make of them? Let me know in the comments\u00a0:DKNOWN BUG: Does your Angular web app not handle Transactions properly?At the time of writing, the angular generator has an issue where the purple Invoke button on the Transactions page doesn\u2019t do anything. To fix this, we need to make a few changes to the generated angular app.1. Get a modal to open when you press the\u00a0buttonThe first change we need to make is have the button open the modal window. The code already contains the required modal window, the button is just missing the (click) and data-target attributes.To resolve this, open up /cards-trading-angular-app/src/app/TradeCard/TradeCard.component.htmlThe file name can vary based on your transaction name. If you have multiple transactions in your business network, you\u2019ll have to do this change across all the transaction resource type HTML files.Scroll down till the very end and you shall see a <button> tag. Go ahead and add these two attributes to that tag:(click)=\"resetForm();\" data-target=\"#addTransactionModal\"so the line looks like this:<button type=\u201dbutton\u201d class=\u201dbtn btn-primary invokeTransactionBtn\u201d data-toggle=\u201dmodal\u201d (click)=\u201dresetForm();\u201d data-target=\u201d#addTransactionModal\u201d>Invoke</button>The (click) attribute calls resetForm(); which sets all the input fields to empty, and data-target specifies the modal window to be opened upon click.Save the file, open your browser, and try pressing the invoke button. It should open this modal:2. Removing unnecessary fieldsJust getting the modal to open isn\u2019t enough. We can see it requests transactionId and timestamp from us even though we didn\u2019t add those fields in our modeling file. Our network stores these values which are intrinsic to all transactions. So, it should be able to figure out these values on it\u2019s own. And as it turns out, it actually does. These are spare fields and we can just comment them out, the REST API will handle the rest for us.In the same file, scroll up to find the input fields and comment out the divs responsible for those input fields inside addTransactionModalSave your file, open your browser, and press Invoke. You should see this:You can now create transactions here by passing data in these fields. Since card and newOwner are relationships to other resources, we can do a transaction like this:Press Confirm, go back to the Assets page, and you will see that TradingCard#2 now belongs to Trader#1:Congratulations! You have successfully built and deployed a blockchain business network on Hyperledger Fabric. You also generated a REST API server for that network and learnt how to make web apps which interact with that API.", "responses": "39"}, {"title": "The Difference Between Blockchains & Distributed Ledger Technology", "author_name": "Shaan Ray", "link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/the-difference-between-blockchains-distributed-ledger-technology-42715a0fa92?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 19, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "1.93K", "content": "The Difference Between Blockchains & Distributed Ledger TechnologyShaan RayBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 19, 2018People sometimes use the terms \u2018Blockchain\u2019 and \u2018Distributed Ledger\u2019 interchangeably. This post aims to analyze the features of each.Distributed Ledger TechnologyA distributed ledger is a database that is spread across several nodes or computing devices. Each node replicates and saves an identical copy of the ledger. Each participant node of the network updates itself independently.The groundbreaking feature of distributed ledger technology is that the ledger is not maintained by any central authority. Updates to the ledger are independently constructed and recorded by each node. The nodes then vote on these updates to ensure that the majority agrees with the conclusion reached. This voting and agreement on one copy of the ledger is called consensus, and is conducted automatically by a consensus algorithm. Once consensus has been reached, the distributed ledger updates itself and the latest, agreed-upon version of the ledger is saved on each node separately.Distributed ledger technologies drastically reduce the cost of trust. The architectures and structures of distributed ledgers can help us mitigate our dependence on banks, governments, lawyers, notaries and regulatory compliance officers. R3\u2019s Corda is an example of a distributed ledger.Distributed ledgers present a new paradigm for how information is collected and communicated, and are poised to revolutionize the way individuals, enterprises and governments transact.Blockchain TechnologyBlockchains are one form of distributed ledger technology. Not all distributed ledgers employ a chain of blocks to provide a secure and valid distributed consensus.A blockchain is distributed across and managed by peer-to-peer networks. Since it is a distributed ledger, it can exist without a centralized authority or server managing it, and its data quality can be maintained by database replication and computational trust.However, the structure of the blockchain makes it distinct from other kinds of distributed ledgers. Data on a blockchain is grouped together and organized in blocks. The blocks are then linked to one another and secured using cryptography.A blockchain is essentially a continuously growing list of records. Its append-only structure only allows data to be added to the database: altering or deleting previously entered data on earlier blocks is impossible. Blockchain technology is therefore well-suited for recording events, managing records, processing transactions, tracing assets, and voting.Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, pioneered blockchain technology. Bitcoin\u2019s big rally in late 2017, and the ensuing media frenzy, brought cryptocurrencies into the mainstream public imagination. Governments, businesses, economists and enthusiasts are now considering ways to apply blockchain technology to other uses.ConclusionEvery blockchain is a distributed ledger, but not every distributed ledger is a blockchain. Each of these concepts requires decentralization and consensus among nodes. However, the blockchain organizes data in blocks, and updates the entries using an append-only structure. Distributed ledgers broadly, and blockchains specifically, are conceptual breakthroughs in managing information and can be expected to find application in every economic sector.Next: Find out how Blockchains will revolutionize Digital Identity!", "responses": "14"}, {"title": "Ethereum Blockchain in a Real Project with 500k+\u00a0Users", "author_name": "Nikita Savchenko", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-blockchain-in-a-real-project-with-500k-users-f85ee4821b12?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 29, 2018", "readtime": "11 min read", "upvotes": "1.8K", "content": "Ethereum Blockchain in a Real Project with 500k+\u00a0UsersNikita SavchenkoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 29, 2018This informative and technical story tells everything about Ethereum and its pitfalls that we\u2019ve encountered while binding Ethereum blockchain to our product, DreamTeam, the first esports and gaming recruitment and management network.

Enjin aims to give gamers a better choice about how and where they store, play and trade their in-game assets. Enjin\u2019s custom-branded ERC-1155 tokens will be the first in-game collectibles that can be moved between blockchain games.Introducing DAPSDAPS is an acronym for \u2018Decentralized Anonymous Payments System\u2019. The project\u2019s aim is to create the most cutting-edge privacy coin in the world. DAPS will achieve this by releasing the first of its kind fully trustless private blockchain in Q2 2019. The DAPS protocol aims to build upon the success of other privacy coins such as PivX and Monero with a unique Proof-Of-Audit consensus mechanism.As explained in the project\u2019s white paper, the goal of the DAPS protocol is to create an anonymous staking coin and payment system supported by Proof-of-Audit miners, masternodes and Proof-of-Stake nodes. The DAPS private blockchain network will offer complete anonymity, using stealth transactions, stealth addresses and RingCT.What is\u00a0Enjin?Founded in 2009, Enjin\u2019s mission is to promote the mass adoption of blockchain technology through the use of digital assets known as tokens. The Enjin Network is powered by the Enjin Coin (ENJ), a cryptocurrency that can be stored in the Enjin Wallet.Enjin\u2019s modular platform enables anyone to explore endless use-cases for blockchain technology including creating custom tokens and contracts from scratch and integrating blockchain in a matter of hours, without writing a single line of code. Enjin aims to offer a one-stop solution for anyone wanting to create and launch their own unique digital assets.What are custom-branded Enjin tokens, also known as collectibles?Enjin\u2019s custom-branded tokens follow a new standard called ERC-1155 on the Ethereum network, a global decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. Up until now, digital tokens could be either fungible (identical) or non-fungible (unique).\u2022 For example, the Ethereum network is powered by Ether, and every Ether is a fungible ERC-20 token, identical to all others.\u2022 On the other hand, blockchain games such as CryptoKitties use ERC-721 tokens, each of which has a unique identity, history, and metadata. Every cute digital cat you buy in CryptoKitties is, in fact, an ERC-721 token.But what if you want to play a different game?You can\u2019t take your ERC-721 tokens from CryptoKitties and start playing another Ethereum game such as My Crypto Heroes or Hyperdragons.That\u2019s the problem that Enjin aims to solve with their ERC-1155 tokens. The ERC-1155 Ethereum-based standard offers a highly efficient and flexible way of storing and managing fungible, semi-fungible and non-fungible blockchain assets with the minimum possible amount of data deployed on a single smart contract. This approach dramatically lowers \u2018Gas\u2019 fees and reduces congestion on the Ethereum network.The ERC-1155 standard is revolutionizing blockchain gamingERC-1155 tokens are the first collectibles that can be moved between different blockchain games. The Enjin platform currently hosts eight blockchain games that require Enjin Coins to play. However, four of these games\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin Hodler, Cats in Mechs, Age of Rust and CryptoFights\u200a\u2014\u200ahave partnered with DAPS and will offer what is known as \u2018multiverse collectibles\u2019. These are ERC-1155 tokens that can be transferred between games, a first for the blockchain gaming industry. As the token\u2019s code is stored centrally, instead of being duplicated for every token, transactions are significantly faster and cheaper than those involving ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens.DAPS launched its own Enjin-designed collectiblesDAPS has launched its own Enjin-designed collectibles so that DAPS Coin users retain ownership of any in-game asset they purchase and transfer them between games while they explore the blockchain gaming frontier. To date, DAPS has partnered with the following four upcoming games:\u2022 Bitcoin HODLerThis upcoming 2D blockchain-based game mixes \u2018endless running\u2019 gameplay with arcade-style action taking you on an exciting journey through the gamified crypto world.

Not least because of its enormous size, the Coincheck hack could go down as a seminal moment in that process.First, hackers laid bare the fact that Coincheck had opted not to implement some basic security measures. The company\u2019s executives told news reporters that the stolen coins had been stored in an internet-connected \u201chot\u201d wallet. It\u2019s far more secure to keep funds offline, in \u201ccold\u201d storage\u200a\u2014\u200aoften hardware specially designed for the task. Many exchanges already claim in their marketing material that they hold the vast majority of their users\u2019 funds offline. Going forward, this will presumably become standard practice.With that taken care of, there\u2019s a more weighty question on the table. Every public cryptocurrency address is associated with a private key; without it, money can\u2019t be moved from that address. Someone who manages to acquire your private key, though, can send your money away. That\u2019s what happened in the Coincheck heist. So how do we make the private cryptographic keys owners need to access their coins more secure?One answer, known as a multisignature address, is conceptually simple: a \u201cmultisig\u201d requires more than one cryptographic key in order execute a transaction. It\u2019s a bit like the multifactor authentication process you may use to access your e-mail account. Business partners can use multisig technology to, for example, create a wallet that requires each of them to sign off on transactions. That would make it substantially more difficult for hackers to access funds.Of course, multisig is not a silver bullet. In 2016, for example, hackers defeated a multisig system to steal $65 million from Bitfinex, one of the world\u2019s largest exchanges. How exactly the perpetrators managed the feat isn\u2019t clear, but it\u2019s possible there was a flaw in the specific implementation.Should financial regulators require exchanges to use multisig technology to secure any funds they keep in a hot wallet? Japanese officials are conducting an emergency security review of the country\u2019s exchanges, and that might be a measure they consider.Either way, a broader discussion about blockchain security is just beginning. Some say blockchains can revolutionize how we track a host of assets beyond just money, like land titles. Such a system might look different from the blockchain networks running today\u2019s cryptocurrencies, but it would still rely on cryptographic keys that could fall into the wrong hands. The techniques and processes we adopt for securing them will be crucial for keeping hackers from running off with land that isn\u2019t theirs.", "responses": "12"}, {"title": "What is\u00a0Enecuum", "author_name": "ENQ Enecuum Blockchain", "link": "https://medium.com/@ENQBlockchain/what-is-enecuum-bbb4302317e1?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 10, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "692", "content": "What is\u00a0EnecuumENQ Enecuum BlockchainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 10, 2017Enecuum is the next-generation blockchain that improves security through mathematical smart contracts, allowing instant transactions with zero commission and solving the problem of network scaling by simultaneously supporting three algorithms for mining: PoS, PoW, PoA.The Enecuum blockchain platform has been developing for the last 2 years to eliminate crypto-currencies\u2019 \u00abchildhood diseases\u00bb such as unsecured smart contracts, network expansion problems and 51% attack, low speed and high transactions\u2019 costs.Due to 3 types of maintaining consensus at the same time (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof of Activity), the platform provides operation of miners and network nodes on virtually any device connected to the network. This solves the problem of network scaling and protects it from such attacks type of 51% or other possible problems in PoW mining.Enecuum supports separate branches of blocks, one of which is the \u201cDate branch\u201d with the ability to store any files and mark them at the block level with a unique gematric code. This allows to work with files in smart contracts in the main unit of blockchain and implement services necessary for business, such as digital distribution of goods (games, music, movies, etc.), electronic document management, government services and much more.Security of smart contracts is ensured by their implementation based on the business-oriented linear logic, called SHARNELL. Smart contracts are made up of mathematical formulas, which allows to expand the functionality of the contract significantly, prescribe any conditions and stage-by-stage implementation, as well as pre-test it for vulnerabilities. Linear logic is entirely predictable, which promotes a confidential interaction with the blockchain branch. Since linear logic can be predicted and typed, its certification can be automatic. And the certification guarantees no exceeding of quotas, hang-ups, unsafe variants of operation, etc.The platform uses separate, independent branches of the transaction, which allows to make it faster and cheaper. In such branches there is an exchange of tokens taking place, and then they are automatically converted into emission units and vice versa. This solves the problem of transaction\u2019s price and speed. Plus, it allows to use the platform in any business, from the sale of gasoline at the gas station to the microtransactions in instant messengers or world transfers of corporations.The main components and advantages of Enecuum:1.

In this blog post I will take you through all the steps required in setting up a fully functioning private ethereum blockchain, inside your local network\u200a\u2014\u200awhich includes:Setting up a private blockchain with ethereum using geth.Setting up the MetaMask ethereum wallet to work with the private blockchain.Transfer funds between multiple accounts.Create, deploy and invoke a smart contract on the private blockchain using remix.Setting up ethereum block explorer over the private blockchain.Install GethGo Ethereum (or geth) is one of the three original implementations (along with C++ and Python) of the ethereum protocol. It is written in Go, fully open source and licensed under the GNU LGPL v3. Go Ethereum is available either as a standalone client called geth that you can install on pretty much any operating system, or as a library that you can embed in your Go, Android or iOS projects.To install geth on Mac OS X, we use homebrew. Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple didn\u2019t. This blog assumes you have homebrew installed already, in case not check this out. Once you have homebrew installed, following commands will install geth.brew tap ethereum/ethereumbrew install ethereumInstalling geth on Ubuntu is straightforward, you just need to use apt-get\u200a\u2014\u200athe commands are shown below.sudo apt-get install software-properties-commonsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:thereum/ethereumsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install ethereumFor Windows, you can find the corresponding geth installation here. If you find any difficulties in any of the above installations, check this out.Create a Miner\u00a0AccountFirst we need to create an account for ethereum mining. This will generate a public/private key pair for you\u200a\u2014\u200aand will be password protected. Do not lose your password, otherwise you will never be able to recover the keys. By default, keys are stored inside, <datadir>/keystore. Everything geth persists, gets written inside datadir (except for the PoW Ethash DAG). The default data directory locations are platform specific. It is always better to override the path of the datadir, and maintain your own location for your private blockchain.Mac: ~/Library/EthereumLinux: ~/.ethereumWindows: %APPDATA%\\EthereumThe Ethash DAG is stored at ~/.ethash (Mac/Linux) or %APPDATA%\\Ethash (Windows) so that it can be reused by all clients.Following command shows how to create an account, with a custom path for the datadir. Once completed, it will print your ethereum address.geth account new --datadir <path-to-data-directory>Example:geth account new --datadir /path/to/data/dirCreate the Genesis\u00a0BlockOne ethereum blockchain differs from another by the genesis block. A blockchain starts with a genesis block and keeps building on top of it, where each block refers to the one below. In the ethereum public blockchain, the genesis block was created on July 20, 2015. To build our own blockchain, we need to create our own genesis block. Use the following command to init our private blockchain with the given genesis block.geth -datadir <path-to-data-directory> init <path-to-genesis-block>Example:geth -datadir /path/to/data/dir init /path/to/genesis.jsondatadir: data directory for the databases and keystore.init: bootstrap and initialize a new genesis block\u200a\u2014\u200awith the provided json file.Following shows our genesis block, used in our private blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200ayou need to save this as genesis.json and pass it to the above command.{    \"config\": {        \"chainId\": 15,        \"homesteadBlock\": 0,        \"eip155Block\": 0,        \"eip158Block\": 0    },    \"difficulty\": \"0x400\",    \"gasLimit\": \"0x2100000\",    \"alloc\": {        \"7a69b359e86893efa3d9732e4c65ced51567edd0\":          { \"balance\": \"0x1337000000000000000000\" }         }}chainid: this provides a way to send transactions that work on ethereum without working on ETC (ethereum classic) or the Morden testnet. EIP 155 suggests following chainid values for different networks: ethereum mainnet (1), morden /expanse mainnet (2), ropsten (3), rinkeby (4), rootstock mainnet (30), rootstock testnet (31), kovan (42), ethereum classic mainnet (61), ethereum classic testnet (62), geth private chains (1337 by default). In our example we have used 15, which is not used by any of these networks.homesteadBlock: the value 0 indicates, it is using ethereum homestead release. Homestead is the 2nd major ethereum release\u200a\u2014\u200aand couple of days back on 16th Oct, 2017, ethereum did a hard fork to move to the byzantium release.eip155Block: the value 0 indicates, this block supports EIP (ethereum improvement proposal)155. EIPs describe standards for the ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.eip158Block: the value 0 indicates, this block supports EIP (ethereum improvement proposal)158.difficulty: a value corresponding to the difficulty level applied during the nonce discovery of this block. In this blog I explain how the difficulty is calculated in ethereum, in detail.gasLimit: gas is the internal pricing for running a transaction or contract in ethereum. Each instruction sent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to process a transaction or smart contract costs a specific amount of gas. If the required amount of gas is not provided to the transaction, it will fail before completion. When you do any ethereum transaction, you specify a gas limit\u200a\u2014\u200athat is the maximum gas all the operations corresponding to that transaction can consume. The gasLimit parameter in the block specifies, the aggregated gasLimit from all the transactions included in the block.alloc: this allows to pre-allocate ether to one or more accounts from the genesis block. In the above genesis block, the pre-allocation is done to the account we created at the begining.Start MiningAll set! Now we can start mining with geth using the following command. The networkid parameter here differentiates this ethereum network from the others. All the miners who want to connect to this network, have to use the same networkid along with the same genesis block.geth --mine --rpc --networkid <networkd-id> --datadir <path-to-data-directory>Example:geth --mine --rpc --networkid 1999 --datadir /path/to/data/dirnetworkid: network identifier of this ethereum network. You pick a value you want. For example: olympic (0), frontier (1), morden (2), ropsten(3).mine: enables mining.rpc: enables an HTTP-RPC server. Wallet applications can connect to this mining node over http.rpcaddr: specifies the HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: \u201clocalhost\u201d)rpcport: specifies the HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: 8545)rpcapi: specifies the API\u2019s offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: \u201ceth,net,web3\u201d)--rpcapi \"web3,eth\"rpccorsdomain: enables CORS by specifying a comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests. This is useful when using browser based solidity editors (remix) to deploy smart contracts or browser based wallets. For example, following will accept CORS from any domain.--rpccorsdomain \"*\"nodiscover: disables the peer discovery mechanism. None of the other nodes in the network will not be able to find your node. If you intend to have this private blockchain being used within your local network with others, do not use this parameter.console: with this command we can start the mining node with an interactive javascript environment. We will learn more about this in the next section.geth --mine --rpc --networkid 1999 --datadir /path/to/data/dir consoleAttach Geth\u00a0ConsoleEither you can start the mining node as a console\u200a\u2014\u200aor you run the console separately and attach it to a mining node, with the attach command. The following shows how to do it, and make sure you follow the same parameter order.geth --datadir <path-to-data-directory> attach ipc:<path-to-data-directory>/geth.ipcExample:geth --datadir /path/to/data/dir attach ipc:/path/to/data/dir /geth.ipcThe console connects to the mining node over ipc. ipc (inter-process communications) works on the local computer. In this case geth creates an ipc pipe (which is represented by the file <path-to-data-directory>/geth.ipc) on local computer\u2019s filesystem\u200a\u2014\u200aand console makes the connection to that node over ipc.View All\u00a0AccountsOnce you are connected to the geth console, you can try out the following command to list all the available accounts.> eth.accounts[\"0x7a69b359e86893efa3d9732e4c65ced51567edd0\"]View Account\u00a0BalanceFollowing command shows how to view the balance of a given account from the geth console.> eth.getBalance(\"0x7a69b359e86893efa3d9732e4c65ced51567edd0\")1.295e+21Connect MetaMask Ethereum\u00a0WalletMetaMask is an ethereum wallet, running as a chrome extension. It injects the ethereum web3 API into every website\u2019s javascript context, so that those apps can read from the blockchain. MetaMask also lets the user create and manage their own identities, so when an application wants to perform a transaction and write to the blockchain, the user gets a secure interface to review the transaction, before approving or rejecting it.To connect MetaMask to the private ethereum blockchain, we need to pick the right host name and the port. Web3 API is the ethereum javascript API implemented in web3.js. To talk to an ethereum node from a javascript application, MetaMask uses the web3.js library, which gives a convenient interface for the rpc methods. Under the hood it communicates to a local node through rpc calls. web3.js works with any ethereum node, which exposes an rpc layer. You might have noticed in the above, when we start the mining node, we can pass the parameter rpcapi to specify, which interfaces we need to expose from that node. By default, if you do not specify anything, eth,net,web3\u200a\u2014\u200awill be exposed.Transfer EtherMetaMask will create you an ethereum account\u200a\u2014\u200aa private key and an ethereum address. Following shows you how to transfer ether from the first account you created at the very beginning to the MetaMask account, from the geth console. To transfer funds from an account, we have to use that account\u2019s private key for the signature. To use the private key, we need to unlock it, as shown below.> personal.unlockAccount( \"0x7a69b359e86893efa3d9732e4c65ced51567edd0\",\"password\")personal is a management API provided by geth. In addition to personal, geth also provides management APIs: admin, debug, miner and txpool. Once we unlock the account, we can define three variables in the console, for the sender, receiver and amount to be sent. The value of the sender is the ethereum address we created at the very beginning of this blog, and the value of the receiver is the ethereum address created under MetaMask.> var sender = \"0x7a69b359e86893efa3d9732e4c65ced51567edd0\";> var receiver = \"0xA9f28458eE1170F285440990c196c1592D3a73f5\"> var amount = web3.toWei(1, \"ether\")Following command will do the funds transfer\u200a\u2014\u200ait refers the variables we defined above.> eth.sendTransaction({from:sender, to:receiver, value: amount})View Account Balance In\u00a0MetaMaskOnce we completed the funds transfer following the above steps, you can find the account balance in two ways. One way is directly from the MetaMask plugin, as shown below.The other way is via the geth console, with the following command.> eth.getBalance(\"0xA9f28458eE1170F285440990c196c1592D3a73f5\")1000000000000000000Remex Solidity\u00a0EditorSolidity is the most popular programming language to write ethereum smart contracts. Remix is an IDE for solidity and has an integrated debugger and testing environment. You can access remix online editor from here. Remix can be connected to any ethereum network. To connect it to our local blockchain, make sure that you have started your mining node with the following command, with the highlighted parameter. The meaning of this parameter was discussed before. Instead of \u201c*\u201d (which is more open) you can also use \u201chttps://remix.ethereum.org\u201d as the value of rpccorsdomain.geth --mine --rpc --rpccorsdomain \"*\" --networkid <networkd-id> --datadir <path-to-data-directory>To connect, remix to our private network, we need to change the Environment to Web3 Provider, under the tab Run. When you do this change, remix will prompt you to specify the Web3 Provider Endpoint\u200a\u2014\u200aset the value http://localhost:8545. Unless you have changed the port explicitly, the default mining node will start on the port 8545.Writing a Smart\u00a0ContractNow we are all set to write our very first smart contract to run on ethereum. Copy the following code and paste it on the remix online editor. This is a very simple smart contract\u200a\u2014\u200aand I do not wish to do a line by line explanation. In the next blog will explain solidity in detail.pragma solidity ^0.4.11;contract Hello  {      // a string variable      string public greeting;    // the function with the same name as the class is a constructor     function Hello(string _greeting) {         greeting = _greeting;     }      // change the greeting message     function setGreeting(string _greeting) {         greeting = _greeting;     }      // get the greeting message     function greet() constant returns (string _greeting) {        _greeting = greeting;     } }If you have not changed any default settings in remix, it is set to auto compile. If not you need to compile.After compiling, when you click on the Details button, it will show you the estimated gas need to create this smart contract.Introduction to Smart Contracts - Solidity 0.4.19 documentationA contract in the sense of Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a\u2026solidity.readthedocs.ioDeploying a Smart\u00a0ContractNow we can deploy our smart contract to our private blockchain. Under the Run tab, make sure you have the right ethereum account selected, and then the right gas limit is specified. You can keep gas price and value as zero.We use an ethereum transaction, signed by the selected account above to deploy the smart contract to the blockchain. To do the signing, first we need to unlock the account, via the geth console.> personal.unlockAccount( \"0x7a69b359e86893efa3d9732e4c65ced51567edd0\",\"password\")Now you can click on the Create button to deploy the smart contract. In our smart contract, we have a constructor which accepts a string parameter, that\u2019s why remix shows you an input box along with the Create button. You can type some value there (within quotes, e.g: \u201cHi\u201d)\u200a\u2014\u200aor just keep it empty. You will see the following message on the geth console when you submit the smart contract for creation. Also note that, if you have not specified the right gas limit, the above will return an error.INFO [10-19|07:31:08] Submitted contract creation              fullhash=0xf5511bb9d088672ac0d3896b8590b9a3e25484300f02deecdd739c3a549ed33a contract=0x42b7E903Fb42e191a7D623cbb4b7b4330D329d78Invoking a Smart\u00a0ContractOnce you deploy the smart contract, remix UI gets changed a bit\u200a\u2014\u200aas shown below, under the Run tab.Now you can set some value to the setGreeting method\u200a\u2014\u200aand click on it to invoke the smart contract. Once again, make sure that you have your account unlocked, because, to invoke a smart contract we use ethereum transactions and we need the signature of the initiator. Once done with the setGreeting method, you can invoke other methods too.Ethereum Block\u00a0ExplorerYou may be familiar with etherscan, which gives a lot of insights into the ethereum public blockchain. But we cannot use it to point to our local blockchain. Ethereum block explorer even though not as feature rich as etherscan, is quite useful to find out what is going on in our local blockchain.To setup ethereum block explorer first we need to get its source code from the following git repo.git clone https://github.com/carsenk/explorerThen, run the following install command from the explorer directory.npm installOnce the installation is done, start the ethereum block explorer with the following command\u200a\u2014\u200aand then you can access the web console from http://localhost:8000.npm startTo connect ethereum block explorer to our local blockchain, make sure that you have started your mining node with the following command, with the highlighted parameter\u200a\u2014\u200athe meaning of this parameter was discussed before.geth --mine --rpc --rpccorsdomain \"*\" --networkid <networkd-id> --datadir <path-to-data-directory>Update: There is a discussion on this blog on Hacker News. Please feel free to join https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15509147SummaryIn this blog post we discussed how to set up a private blockchain with ethereum using geth. Then we got MetaMask ethereum wallet to work with the private blockchain and transferred funds to the ethereum account created in MetaMask. remix online IDE was used to create, deploy and invoke a smart contract on the private blockchain. Finally we did set up ethereum block explorer over the private blockchain.Prabath SiriwardenaVisit Amazon.com's Prabath Siriwardena Page and shop for all Prabath Siriwardena books.

Other (vicious) people ask me what is the difference between \u201cblockchain technology\u201d and \u201cdistributed ledger technology\u201d. So let\u2019s clarify the conceptual & vocabulary issues that we have here.Centralized relational databasesRelational databases (RDBMS) organize data in tables and use the SQL query language. They became the norm in the 80s. Even if their architecture evolved in complexity over time (n-tier, distributed processing, etc.) they remain essentially centralized i.e. located, stored, and maintained in a single location. This category represent more than 90% of the database market in terms of revenues and includes the most well-known vendors and systems: MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, SAP, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Teradata, etc.Distributed databasesDatabases are distributed (DDBMS) when the storage devices are not all attached to a common processing unit such as the CPU, but are spread across a network. With the development of the internet, businesses needed solutions that could process huge amounts of structured & unstructured data, and that could scale across networks. DDBMS use consensus mechanisms to ensure fault-tolerant communications, and provide concurrency control through locking and/or time-stamping mechanisms. They come in different technology forms:1. Peer network node data stores are systems allowing users to replicate and share files across a network leveraging peer-to-peer protocols such as: BitTorrent, NNTP, Freenet, Mnet, etc.2. Distributed SQL data warehouses are systems designed by the major vendors (Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, IBM, etc.) to allow for the massively parallel processing of analytics-oriented tasks.3. Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications on clusters of commodity hardware. It provides massive storage for any kind of data, enormous processing power and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks.4. NoSQL databases are non-relational DDBMS, horizontally scalable, designed for real-time web applications. The most well-known solutions are: MarkLogic, MongoDB, Datastax, Apache Cassandra, Redis, Riak, Google BigTable and CouchDB.5. NewSQL databases are relational DDBMS designed to combine the best of relational databases & NoSQL databases properties (horizontal scalability & distributed processing). Examples: Google Spanner, Clustrix, VoltDB, MemSQL, Pivotal\u2019s GemFire XD, NuoDB and Trafodion.6. Distributed Ledgers (DL) are DDBMS that leverage cryptography to provide a decentralized multi-version concurrency control mechanism and to maintain consensus about the existence and status of shared facts in trustless environments (i.e. when the participants hosting the shared database are independent actors that don\u2019t trust each other). Consensus is not a unique feature of DL per se: other distributed databases also use consensus algorithms such as Paxos or Raft. Same for immutability: immutable databases exist outside DL (Google HDFS, Zebra, CouchDB, Datomic, etc.). The two differentiators of DL in my opinion: (a) the control of the read/write access is truly decentralized and not logically centralized as for other distributed databases, and corollary (b) the ability to secure transactions in competing environments, without trusted third parties. Some people call this category \u201cshared ledgers\u201d but I prefer the term \u201cdistributed\u201d because shared can mean \u201cdivided/split\u201d.6.1. The Bitcoin system was the first instance of DL, designed for one purpose: peer-to-peer bitcoin (cryptocurrency) payments. To avoid double spending, Bitcoin uses chained blocks of data (hence the \u201cblock chain\u201d) and a proof of work consensus among other mechanisms. Bitcoin is censorship resistant, its key features are: byzantine-fault tolerant, pseudo-anonymity, auditability (public), immutability, accountability (time-stamping) and non-repudiation (signature) at transaction level.6.2. Some systems are inspired by or somehow close to the Bitcoin system. They usually implement most of its features, but not all or with different characteristics. For instance:Other cryptocurrencies implement privacy mechanisms (Zcash), or different consensus protocols such as Proof of stake, Proof of burn, etc.Ethereum share many of Bitcoin features but is designed to execute programmable transactions (smart contracts)6.3. Some systems differ significantly from Bitcoin:The DL envisioned by Accenture is not immutableR3 Corda is designed to operate in regulated environments with a limited number of known participants (e.g. Financial Institutions, Regulators) where BFT is not required (security is achieved differently), auditability is based on the \u201cneed to know\u201d and consensus about a transaction is basically reduced to its validation by the two contracting partiesDisledgers: Distributed Concurrence Ledger is tailored for financial institutions dealing in capital markets and payments. Concurrence is an alternative to seeking consensus in distributed ledger systems and does not utilize cryptocurrencies, chained blocks, nor proof of work [Note: to me this approach looks similar to Corda]HashGraph Swirlds: HashGraph is based on a \u201cgossip protocol\u201d where blocks are \u201cevents\u201d: each member repeatedly chooses another member at random, and gives them all the events that they don\u2019t know yet. As the local copy of the hashgraph grows, the member runs an algorithm to determine the consensus order for the events (and the consensus timestamps). The data structure is a directed acyclic graph, where each vertex contains the hash of its two parent vertices6.4. BigChainDB aims to provide a scalable distributed data storage, by adding blockchain characteristics (decentralized control, immutability, and creation & movement of digital asset) to a standard distributed database. BigchainDB inherits characteristics of modern distributed databases: linear scaling in throughput and capacity with the number of nodes, a full-featured NoSQL query language, efficient querying, and permissioning.Here is the landscape summarized (simplified):The distributed ledgers that are \u201cdouble permissionless\u201d, such as bitcoin, are the most decentralized ones and resist to censorship. The less decentralized they are (e.g. permissioned DL in a semi-trusted environment), the closer they get to being \u201cregular\u201d distributed databases using cryptography. In this latter case, cryptography is used as a new mechanism to enforce auditability & accountability between peers:\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 -Now what is \u201cblockchain technology\u201d you might ask? Ironically, there is no consensus on the definition:Minimalists will argue it is only BitcoinSome people think it should include any DL with chained blocksSome experts think it should include any DL with some key features: chained blocks, immutability & consensus protocolMaximalists say \u201cblockchain technology\u201d equals \u201cdistributed ledger technology\u201d equals \u201ccryptographically enabled DDBMS\u201d. Also it is easier to use the term \u201cblockchain\u201d for marketing & communication purposes, even if it can be misleading\u2026The final equation is: bitcoin blockchain \u2286 blockchain technology \u2286 distributed ledger technology \u2286 distributed databases.If you like blockchain debates, let me finish by sharing 4 other interesting questions:Is Bitcoin truly BFT?How does Bitcoin & other DL handle the CAP theorem?Is it possible for a DL to be at the same time decentralized, scalable and secure? [talking about trilemma, i recommend this great post about the DCS triangle]Is a private blockchain without token really more efficient than a centralized system?Sources of inspiration for this post: Gideon Greenspan, Richard Gendal Brown, Pascal Bouvier (who uses a different taxonomy), Dave Birch, Colin Platt.", "responses": "18"}, {"title": "Bitcoin\u2019s Glory Days Over & the Future of Blockchain", "author_name": "Michael K.

SpencerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 25, 2018itsblockchainWe\u2019re still writing as if Bitcoin were supremely relevant, I see editor\u2019s picks on Medium about Bitcoin. Even as its price has slumped, from nearly 20,000 to currently around $7,500. Not just that, crypto has been dragged through the mud, as if crypto and blockchain weren\u2019t two sides of the same coin!ICO fraud, crypto pump and dump schemes, rankings in crypto and for ICOs that make little sense, poorly written spammy content about every side-angle about crypto\u200a\u2014\u200abut everyone is seemingly on the blockchain train.Bitcoin is the Jesus of\u00a0CryptoBitcoin? It\u2019s like Jesus, a martyr for its kin. There are so many altcoins and ICOs nobody seems to know what\u2019s real anymore, and what\u2019s a fad\u200a\u2014\u200awhat crypto and altcoin experiments will likely have no value in two or five years.Blockchain? Most central banks will be on it transitioning their fiat currency on to centralized blockchains. Ethereum will become even more integrated with enterprise, Facebook will likely have its own form of crypto payment, and Amazon\u2019s Cloud, AWS will be the most agile for enterprise and medium sized companies to adopt blockchain solutions.If Bitcoin was the yin, Blockchain is the\u00a0yang.The U.S. department of justice is even looking into if Bitcoin price fixing and market manipulation occured. So many cryptocurrencies are supposed to be decentralized stores of value, but their top 100 addresses usually still own the majority of the wealth. They are\u2019t managed with economics of supply and demand that makes sense that\u2019s tied to tangible assets with multiple ties to real-world indicators. In this sense many of them are speculative ponzi schemes, high-risk digital assets for retail and small-time investors. They aren\u2019t always tied to great products; that have any realistic chance of having sustainable value and that offer long-term viability.In many ways let\u2019s admit it, the Bitcoin hype created a moral vacuum, blockchain has created hype where the results may take several more months and years to the the evolution they said it would be in 2015. Bitcoin has fuelled and created a digital decentralized scarcity that is not always of this world, it\u2019s innovative, but is it even useful?Bitcoin is the Digital Gold but Ethereum is the\u00a0SiliconDecentralized app platforms with smart contacts that can be foundational, are on the other hand, useful. So why does the cryptocurrency market still go up and down with Bitcoin? A wave of innovation tethered to the origin point?So long as the ideal of decentralized payments doesn\u2019t exist, the vision that Bitcoin represents will just be monetized. Bitcoin has been hoarded, badly enough to make it feel like more of the same wealth inequality.This is what humans do to innovation.Humans think they can own blockchain, they think that if we make our central bank on the blockchain with fiat currencies, we\u2019ll own it. Perhaps this is why there is an unofficial race for countries to implement fiat blockchain solutions. For Banks to mimic and use the blockchain for their own profiteering ends. There are Bitcoin celebrities and very wealthy men who own a lot of Bitcoins. But that\u2019s not the final destiny of the blockchain, is it?Coinbase is trying to be the Facebook of cryptocurrency trading, Facebook now thinks it can be a blockchain company. It\u2019s sickening. Google offered Vitalik Buterin a job, as if he wanted to be a part of that ethical nightmare. We\u2019re forgetting all about the \u201cdecentralization\u201d part and why it matters. It\u2019s sort of fucking important, it\u2019s the liberating part of the \u201cyin\u201d of Bitcoin. Putting highly controlled transactions on the blockchain, is not using the tool we were given to its full maturity. We need to think differently about what \u201cmoney\u201d and transactions are in the post-capitalism world. Capitalism as we know it, could fail in our lifetime, we may witness the fact.Bitcoin and blockchain at their core, value statements. The world can and should work differently. Super imposing current power structures, hierarchies and wealth inequalities on the blockchain, isn\u2019t the point. Governments controlling blockchains and cryptocurrencies as they were their property isn\u2019t the ideal. The entire infrastructure of the financial order needs an overhaul. That and nothin but that, is the secret promise of the \u201cyin\u201d of Bitcoin.However we live in a materialistic world where the \u201cyang\u201d predominates, how to use blockchain to elevate our business model, is what everyone is asking, much in the same way they are using AI to power their businesses governed by data and optimize their products and customer experiences. But the blockchain and AI are just tools, tools that need to be used responsibly. In a world where algorithms and data harvesting have been abused, what hope should we have that AI and the blockchain will be used for good, towards uplifting and life-empowering ends? The internet run by Google and Facebook is advertising spam, and user monetization, a far cry from the idealism of the 90s.Unity has historically been achieved by eliminating competing religions and altcoins. However what if that\u2019s no longer the solution. While New China have gone with mobile payments of WeChat Pay and Alibaba, the U.S. dollar is the defacto value, but nothing lasts forever. Wall Street will one day crumble and a new financial center will take its place. This is another event we will witness, and the manifestation of the blockchain may play a key role in how this plays out.Bitcoin points the way to how this could be achieved. China is the most ambitious nation when it comes to State backed blockchain, blockchain startups and R&D going into blockchain innovation. Therefore it\u2019s natural it will use blockchain to achieve economic supremacy. Don\u2019t believe me? Watch it happen in the next ten years.ICOs are five years old, but crypto trading markets are really just getting started with the Bitcoin boom of December 2017, what I term the crypto singularity. At that point, altcoins and ICOs began to multiply exponentially where a battle for dApp platform smart contract utility is taking place and while Ethereum appears to be the heir apparent to Bitcoin; another may take its place.Bitcoin Shot Down in a Blaze of\u00a0GloryA Bitcoin correction of early 2018 appears to have stabilized Bitcoin in the price range of $6,500 to $9,500. However compared to the $19,500 US dollar price of mid December, 2017 the entire cryptocurrency market cap has been dropped effectively in a volatility of a semi-bear market (the opposite of bull).While it\u2019s not exactly the end of crypto\u2019s glory days, it\u2019s definately a period of regulatory oversight, more objective rankings, a clearing up of fraudulent ICOs, SEC pressure, and possibly, mainstream cryptocurrency market trading.Blockchain is supposed to be secure, and yet cryptocurrency markets and altcoins have been hacked, harming their reputation. Also for Bitcoin, the longer a bear market goes on, the more pressure there is to sell and for Bitcoin\u2019s price to potentially crash.While some analysts think Bitcoin still has potential to go up, other financial pundits are warning Bitcoin\u2019s price could still crash further.The likes of Coinbase, Robinhood and Circle evolving certainly don't\u2019 feel like the next era of the internet, either does Facebook adopting blockchain. So why is the idealism behind Bitcoin not winning, but the rules of the Silicon Valley internet of profiteering? Has adoption of cryptocurrencies just been about greed, and nothing more based on values of decentralization and the potential of dApps to change the world for the better?The Crypto singularity and ICO tsunami has made some people rich, but has it pushed crypto innovation in the right direction? If the market still determines what wins, and not the better technology and better forms of consensus, decentralization and integrity\u200a\u2014\u200ais what Bitcoin represents a failure already? You can witness this struggle with Ethereum, and even the microcosm of its own internal decision making process.The only crypto related organizations that I witness platforms scaled with idealism are actually Ethereum and Binance. While coinbase is run like a startup, it\u2019s Silicon valley to the core, without any substantial value shift that would appeal to Millennials and GenZ attracted to decentralization in the long run. This is problematic in how America is adopting cryptocurrencies, and shows how a capitalist-first approach to blockchain innovation might not be the right approach.If Banks are adopting blockchain in China, Japan and elsewhere, American financial institutions are slow, lack large innovative networks and publically slaughter Bitcoin\u2019s reputation while saying they are open to blockchain with small moves. It\u2019s not the radical blockchain adoption we are seeing in Asia, and this does not bode well for America keeping up in blockchain innovation as the financial services sector is showing to be not very agile in FinTech. U.S. banks and institutions already have low consumer trust, if you think of the scandal Wells Fargo has been through.The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, which is likely to contribute to the bear cryptocurrency sentiment, however many young American citizens are more pro cryptocurrencies than they are relating to American banks themselves. This trust problem therefore is serious for the J.P Morgan Chase\u2019s of the world. Furthermore, as wealth inequality continues to scale, this mistrust of Banks is only going to grow as student debts continue to rise, along with the cost of healthcare, housing and other living expenses without adjusted rises in wages.That\u2019s not to say that the Crypto Singularity was an honest trading environment. According to the report, the criminal probe\u2019s investigators will specifically looking into practices like spoofing (filling the marketplace with fake orders that are later canceled to manipulate others to buy or sell a particular coin) and wash trading (trading with oneself in order to falsely imply more market demand than there actually is). Traders were \u201ccheating\u201d the crypto market to make a buck, while Banks and even Big Tech work together to \u201csuppress\u201d crypto enthusiasm with Ad-bans. To say that Bitcoin is controversial, would be an understatement.Where digital, blockchain and crypto innovation is more native and integrated with existing services, such as in Japan, there\u2019s no such problem. America appear to be stuck in an old system by making Bitcoin the bad guy. Japan has adopted Bitcoin payments in retail, blockchain startups are thriving in China, cryptocurrency trading is fervent in South Korea. In America, Facebook, Amazon and even Walmart are now adopting blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aso the \u201cright people\u201d can profit from the enthusiasm. At home, the game is fixed. For America, Bitcoin\u2019s glory days might indeed be over. The American dollar as the default veto of global currency means the cryptocurrency market is monopolized and tethered to American policy and sentiment; thus easily controlled by the 1% there.There\u2019s an argument to be made that I have written about, that Bitcoin\u2019s price drop began and was achieved by the introduction of Bitcoin Futures. With the likes of Coinbase, with high trading fees ramping up aggressively, America is simply redistributing the wealth of crypto enthusiasm into its own pockets; Silicon valley types with strong ties to Wall Street and the government. Bitcoin was not something that could have been invented in America. A purely capitalistic mindset is outdated when dealing with blockchain innovation or a utility token environment. Facebook is likely a decade behind in payments innovation to China\u2019s Tencent (WeChat).If Bitcoin is the martyr, decentralization is the second-coming of the savior. But that savior will have to deal with Wall Street whose values and thinking are years behind Asia.The SEC has been slow to figure out and regulate ICOs, while blockchain innovation goes on. If Wall Street has been slow to accept cryptocurrency markets and integrate it, other cryptocurrency markets in Asia have risen to dominance. Bitcoin as a new concept is basically disrupting Wall Street and America\u2019s hold on the future of the global economy. With each year, China\u2019s influence on the global economy is growing, and as the place where the majority of blockchain startups are located, China\u2019s rise as the center of the financial world, can be correlated in the future to the rise in popularity of Bitcoin.Google offering the Ethereum founder a job in a secretive crypto project, shows the deep depravity, greed and misunderstanding of Big Tech of what decentralization actually means. Facebook wants to integrate blockchain into its business model for profit, not to further the evolution of the blockchain! Amazon\u2019s introduction of blockchain into its Cloud AWS, at least can help democratize how enterprise integrates blockchain.Misunderstandings about Bitcoin can be seen in legacy tech companies. LinkedIn usually covers negative aspects of Bitcoin and crypto, showing Microsoft\u2019s outdated editorial insights into something that young people care passionately about, not to mention young developers and entrepreneurs. The world is still run by baby boomers and GenX, while its younger values belong to an impoverished generation, permanently maimed by the great recession of 2008. The sets up a generational war for the future, where cryptocurrencies are the weapons. You cannot blame Bitcoin for problems of wealth inequality, failures of capitalism and the moral deficiency of big tech. That\u2019s just not going to fly with younger Millennials and GenZ natives who will have the final say on the interpretation and implementation of blockchain and the future era of digital innovation.I blog as a futurist and a crypto enthusiast on a publication made for futurists called Future Sin.

At the moment, there are 14 job offerings for every one blockchain developer. Although, the \u201c$/knowledge\u201d ratio increased even further this year in the blockchain space, where capital by far outpaces talent.My favorite \u2018throw money\u2019 GIF\u200a\u2014\u200agiphy.comDisclaimer: I do not guarantee you will get rich.\u201cRequests for on-demand blockchain talent are skyrocketing. Last year, freelance talent marketplace Upwork saw blockchain rise to the fastest-growing skill out of more than 5,000 skills in terms of freelancer billings\u200a\u2014\u200aa year-over-year increase of more than 35,000 percent. These requests span smart contract development, blockchain engineering projects, and overall blockchain consultancy.\u201cThis is the top three most wanted skills:Hyperledger Fabric: an enterprise blockchain framework focused on modularity and scalability to support the often changed business rules.Ripple development: a payment protocol used for distributed processes for remittances, payments and exchanges.Solidity smart contract development on the Ethereum network.The blockchain \u2018niche\u2019 has the most high-paying jobs as even classic companies of the financial sector, like Bank of America, Visa, and others are seeking to explore blockchain technology.Blockchain developers in the US earn up to $130k a year, by estimates of Computerworld. At the same time, software developers earn up to $105k a year. Such data was published by Matt Siegelman, the CEO of the data analysis campaign of the Burning Glass Technologies company performance.Source: hackernoon.com\u200a\u2014\u200aKirill\u00a0ShilovWhat can we do?First of all, iOlite is a project that helps to fill up this shortage. They are developing a product that is capable of understanding natural language and translating this to executable smart contract code. This seems to be the ideal solution, although we still need knowledgeable smart contract developers to define structures in combination with Solidity code so normal users can use this library of structures to create smart contracts based on their needs. To give developers the possibility to as well create smart contracts more easily, we offer developer plugins to translate mass programming languages to smart contract code.MOOC platform Udemy offering Ethereum & Solidity\u00a0courseMassive open online course (MOOC) platforms try to catch up with blockchain technology by providing blockchain related coding courses. This gives normal developers the possibility to jump in this new and exciting world of blockchain development. The high \u201c$/knowledge\u201d ration is another incentive for developers to become a blockchain developer.Although, we have noticed that these courses do not provide in-depth knowledge on the matter. We don\u2019t expect a MOOC graduate to develop a perfectly fine smart contract which can be used by an ICO, and they shouldn\u2019t do as we are talking about millions of dollars.At last, private talent networks like Toptal offer top quality blockchain engineering talent to be consulted by companies. This makes it easier for companies to find blockchain talent.Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, thinks blockchain developers should be employed by multiple companies to democratize the knowledge they gather so more developers can discover and explore the possibilities of the blockchain. It\u2019s easier to get started with blockchain development when you have a \u2018buddy\u2019 who can guide you on this quest.Source: techcrunch.comFeatured Image\u200a\u2014\u200aSource: gratisography.com", "responses": "17"}, {"title": "Fat protocols aren\u2019t new: What blockchain can learn from p2p file\u00a0sharing", "author_name": "John Backus", "link": "https://medium.com/@jbackus/fat-protocols-arent-new-42d2c538db41?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 29, 2018", "readtime": "16 min read", "upvotes": "2.4K", "content": "Fat protocols aren\u2019t new: What blockchain can learn from p2p file\u00a0sharingJohn BackusBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 29, 2018Starting in 1999, we saw an explosion of p2p file sharing technology. We had Gnutella (the protocol behind Limewire), FastTrack (Kazaa), eDonkey, and BitTorrent. Limewire, Kazaa, and eDonkey all died, but the protocols they helped create lived on!People have speculated on what a future with fat protocols will look like. File sharing protocols aren\u2019t exactly the same, but they have a lot of similarities we can learn from.Looking at the p2p ecosystem, a few things are clear:Fat protocol ecosystems have way more variety and experimentation when network effects don\u2019t stop people from creating new clientsProtocols live on and evolve regardless of whether the original creators are working on them or notThe application layer seems to capture little value for the protocol creator, but third party competition to build on top of the protocol may be a powerful force for finding product/market fitWhile people weren\u2019t able to figure out how to integrate a token into p2p file sharing technologies back in the day, it does seem like a properly calibrated token marketplace would have solved a lot of problems and accelerated p2p\u2019s breakneck adoption even more.Vibrant and competitive ecosystems\u2026 by replicating and storing user data across an open and decentralized network rather than individual applications controlling access to disparate silos of information, we reduce the barriers to entry for new players and create a more vibrant and competitive ecosystem of products and services on top.Fat Protocols from Union Square VenturesWhat file sharing application did you use before BitTorrent? Was it LimeWire, BearShare, Shareaza, giFT, Morpheus, Phex, or Acquisition? All of those were separate applications made by different teams that all connected to Gnutella network! There was also FrostWire, LimeWire Pirate Edition, and WireShare which were forks of Limewire\u2019s client.I\u2019m not going to do the same song and dance here listing a dozen clients for FastTrack and eDonkey, but I could. Every protocol had tons of clients. In fact, Limewire wasn\u2019t the creator of the Gnutella protocol, their app was just really popular because they added a lot of features.FeaturesPeople didn\u2019t all just build near identical clients of course. Different companies competed to build clients to the Gnutella protocol that served different needs. BearShare seemed to focus on building a good client. It had a straightforward search, a \u201ctheater\u201d to preview movies and music while they downloaded, and plenty of other features like a place to chat with other users.BearShare provided a full featured experienceQualityThe eDonkey company developed their own network (\u201ceDonkey2000 Network\u201d) and a corresponding client. Even though they developed the protocol, they had to compete with a very popular open source client called eMule which many viewed as having a better user interface!Which would you rather\u00a0use?GeneralizationSome people tried improving the user experience via better interfaces. Others tried to provide access to as much content as possible by creating clients that used multiple networks.Shareaza became popular by supporting every file sharing protocol under the sun:Shareaza\u00a0\u2026 supports the Gnutella, Gnutella2, eDonkey, BitTorrent, FTP, HTTP and HTTPS network protocols and handles magnet links, ed2k links, and the now deprecated gnutella and Piolet linksShareaza searches everythingAbstractionThe giFT project was similar to Shareaza in trying to implement every protocol, but it aimed to be a file sharing backend that others could build user interfaces for:Two totally different frontends (GiFTcurs and Apollon) using giFT on the\u00a0backendgiFT supported most protocols and was compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac.", "responses": "10"}, {"title": "The Three Eggs in a Distributed Basket: Wasm, Blockchain, and Reputation", "author_name": "Ake Gaviar", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/the-three-eggs-in-a-distributed-basket-wasm-blockchain-and-reputation-296892cdd77c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 26", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "1.1K", "content": "The Three Eggs in a Distributed Basket: Wasm, Blockchain, and ReputationAke GaviarBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 26There are undercurrents forming that in the near future will converge into a torrent of adoption, creativity and a change to the way we operate online. The change is going to feel subtle because the way it will be brought about is a natural one; but it will be fundamental all the same.And with the right kind of eye, you can see the undercurrents today. They are WebAssembly, Blockchain, and Reputation.WebAssemblyWebAssembly\u200a\u2014\u200aor Wasm\u200a\u2014\u200ais a standard designed to be a compilation target for programming languages and a binary format with the goal of near-native performance for web applications.When you think of Wasm as a compilation target for programming languages, picture it as the common meeting ground for all developers. And Wasm is moving in this direction pretty fast. There\u2019s a curated list of languages that compile to Wasm on GitHub\u200a\u2014\u200athe progress is nothing to sneeze at.That Wasm is the format targeting near-native performance for web applications means that whenever you go on the Internet to run an application in your web browser, the chances are the majority of them are going to be in Wasm in the nearest future. This is especially true for online gaming because it requires the highest number of interaction that relies on your input and performance.See, whenever you run an app in your browser, your browser downloads the application\u2019s code from the server and loads it into the browser\u2019s virtual machine, and this is where you interact with the application. This also means that the virtual machine of your browser must be able to load and run Wasm.Well, here\u2019s the thing\u200a\u2014\u200aWasm is supported and contributed to by Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, and Apple.And as noted earlier, many programming languages already compile to Wasm, and the list is growing. There\u2019s great Wasm support in the developer community.BlockchainSo, your browser loads Wasm code into its virtual machine and runs it. You know what else does that? A decentralized world computer like Ethereum.Ethereum has the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that runs the code. To compile into the code that the EVM understands and executes, a developer needs to write the dapp in Solidity. There is also the language called LLL, which is less popular, and Vyper, but Solidity is the one majorly used.This creates a bottleneck for developer adoption. A developer needs to get comfortable with Solidity before they can code and launch a dapp.There\u2019s an initiative in Ethereum called eWasm that aims to replace the current EVM with an eWasm virtual machine. eWasm is basically Wasm and offers greater and improved performance over the current EVM architecture. Not only that, but adopting Wasm in Ethereum would open the floodgates to developer adoption because any developer would be able to write a dapp in any language they are comfortable with and compile to a dapp.To quote Lane Rettig, one of eWasm core developers:I have a personal goal of getting a million or millions of developers building Ethereum smart contract\u00a0\u2026 Wasm is an important step forward, it\u2019s a massive massive massive increase in optionality for developers, they can develop using different languages, different compilers, they can develop their own languages, their own DSLs [domain-specific languages], none of which are really possible in Ethereum 1.0 today.While Ethereum has an EVM, other infrastructure projects\u200a\u2014\u200ai.e. blockchain protocols that are not solely for cryptocurrency\u200a\u2014\u200aeach have a virtual machine too. Projects like EOS, Tron, U\u00b0OS.The virtual machine of EOS understands Wasm natively. U\u00b0OS understands Wasm natively. Tron is planning to move to Wasm this year\u200a\u2014\u200aand due to Tron\u2019s consensus algorithm, the network upgrade to a Wasm-based virtual machine is going to be relatively hassle-free. It remains to be seen if eWasm will make it to the Ethereum mainnet, but it\u2019s definitely moving there.So, to reiterate, consider this:Wasm is supported by the software and the Internet\u2019s major players\u200a\u2014\u200aMozilla, Microsoft, Google, and Apple.Millions of developers comfortable with their languages will be able to compile to Wasm-based virtual machines.Wasm is on its path to becoming the common meeting ground for the majority of languages.ReputationWasm is becoming the technical backbone for how people develop and interact with applications in this vast digital space that will also be relying on blockchain.People use the technology to rely on in their interaction and the social layer\u200a\u2014\u200aand decentralized reputation, in particular\u200a\u2014\u200amust play an important role in the adoption. Dapps running on blockchain and Wasm provide execution transparency, decentralization, and trust, but people create the dapps, and people use the dapps, this is where reputation matters the most.Network members must be able to use their decentralized transparent influence score based on their contributions to the network. This will enable the network health to run not only on dapp developers and dapp consumers but on every network member and make the network autonomous and self-governing.Projects like U\u00b0OS and U\u00b0Community are filling this gap along with Wasm adoption.Time will tell if the three undercurrents\u200a\u2014\u200aWebAssembly, Blockchain, and Reputation\u200a\u2014\u200awill converge.

Maybe their boss sent them or they have read about it in the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times and they thought it was cool. Some of them may be legitimately interested in the subject, however odds are that most are just following the hypetrain.20 will claim they are experts and they have been working with it since 2007 (bitcoin was created in the end of 2008). Of course they each have a different definition.The above is fiction and should not be taken seriously. I have not been to any blockchain meetups or conferences as of yet. However, by the amount of different definitions seen on the internet, some partial truth can be found in those words. Things get even more interesting when the \u201cpublic versus private/permissioned blockchain\u201d debate heats up.Disclaimer: We are going to be refering only to public blockchains for the rest of this post. This is not going to be a \u201chow does a blockchain work\u201d post as there are already a lot of good articles online on that topic (and a lot of bad ones).First of all, to describe what a blockchain is, let\u2019s define what a database is:A database is an organized collection of data\u200a\u2014\u200aWikipediaMy definition of a blockchain:A blockchain is a database that can be shared between a group of non-trusting individuals, without needing a central party to maintain the state of the database.It is also often referred to by the name \u201cDistributed Ledger Technology\u201d, DLT for short.Centralised vs Distributed Ledger, image source: https://cdn.ripple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ledgers.pngProperties of A BlockchainTransparency: Every transaction can be inspected by anyone (keyword: block explorer)Decentralization: Every node which maintains the network has a copy of the ledger. That creates redundancy and fault tolerance (i.e if a node fails or stops working, the rest of the nodes can keep maintaining the network without interruption).Decentralization along with proper mechanisms to ensure that no faulty transactions get included in the ledger give birth to data integrity, the so-called immutability of the blockchain that everyone talks about. When a piece of information gets recorded, it is set in stone and cannot be rewritten (exceptions: hard fork,chain split).Add transparency and decentralization together and you have a ledger which has 100% uptime, cannot be manipulated by powerful adversaries to their advantage (debatable) and is fully inspectable at any time.Every single property of a blockchain on its own might not sound like too remarkable, however when combined together, new properties appear which in turn create the possibility for new revolutionary use cases.Before we get into that, let\u2019s clear some\u2026Common Misconsceptions\u201cBlockchains provide security\u201dThis one is tricky, because security is often confused with confidentiality. A blockchain does not provide confidentiality (with the exception of cases like Zcash, Monero, Dash, PIVX which are blockchains with built-in privacy features).\u201cMy business needs a blockchain!\u201dDefinitely not true. If trust and robustness aren\u2019t an issue, there\u2019s nothing a blockchain can do that a regular database cannot. In this case you are better off with a traditional centralized database with proper backups.\u201cBlockchain is\u00a0Bitcoin\u201dBitcoin was the first of the \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d that introduced blockchain technology as we know it today. Currently there are numerous different blockchains linked to different projects, each offering something unique atop the basic blockchain principles.\u2026And moreIf trust and robustness aren\u2019t an issue, there\u2019s nothing a blockchain can do that a regular database\u00a0cannot\u00b9.", "responses": "19"}, {"title": "SXSW 2018: 10 Crypto & Blockchain Takeaways", "author_name": "Lolita Taub", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/sxsw-2018-10-crypto-blockchain-takeaways-d9c397b887e4?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 16, 2018", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "1.95K", "content": "Elon Musk at SXSW 2018.

Source: CaliCrypto.As you may know, SXSW is a conference and festival that celebrates the convergence of the interactive, film, and the music industry. This year SXSW took place March 9th through 18th and attracted 300,000 people to Austin, TX. And, let me tell you, a big chunk of them were blockchain enthusiasts.On Sunday, Elon Musk was spotted with a copy of Julian Hosp\u2019s book Cryptocurrencies Explained Simply. There were 37 blockchain sessions scheduled as part of the conference. Complimenting SXSW\u2019s schedule, Crypto Summit, Initial Taco Offering, the World Tokenomic Forum, and Ethereal Lounge added several dozen more sessions on crypto and blockchain. The crypto and blockchain FOMO among individuals, startups, and enterprises was real.Here\u2019s a recap of what SXSW 2018 had to say about crypto and blockchain, in no particular order:Takeaway #1. Trustless World <> No one trusts\u00a0anyone.The 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer Global Report was cited over and over again. The phrase \u201ctrust is on the decline\u201d was shared across the board. Trustlessness was identified as the problem and blockchain as a solution.Source: 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer Global\u00a0ReportSource: 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer Global\u00a0ReportIn a talk about Business on the Blockchain, Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director at Hyperledger, and Amber Baldet, Blockchain Lead at JP Morgan, proposed that blockchain can help address the concerns of a trustless world. The underlying hypothesis: blockchain enables trust in people through its transparent platform and decentralized verification system (of what is the truth).Brian Behlendorf, Exec Dir at Hyperledger; Amber Baldet, Blockchain Lead at JP Morgan. Source: Lolita\u00a0TaubWe\u2019re moving towards a more pragmatic world where we accept that no one trusts anyone and where blockchain verification helps. We\u2019re moving towards a world of verification\u200a\u2014\u200anot trust.Call to action: Verify that what you are hearing is true and not just smoke and mirrors.Takeaway #2. Use Cases <> Finance, Supply Chain, and Healthcare will lead blockchain use\u00a0cases.While crypto investing (*cough* gambling *cough*) has grabbed the attention of the masses, enterprise blockchain is hard at work in the background. Businesses are actually trying to figure out how to materialize the value of the promise of a distributed ledger. And the first pilots are heavily focused on finance, supply chain, and health.JP Morgan talked about their advancements in finance with Quorum. SXSW also featured a panel on Blockchain and the Crisis of Healthcare. And IBM had an entire session dedicated to supply chain and focused on Transforming Global Food Supply with Blockchain.Brigid McDermott, VP of IBM Food Trust. Source: Lolita\u00a0TaubBrigid McDermott, VP of IBM Food Trust, talked through the problems that supply chains face today, including: lack of trust and transparency across suppliers, producers, retailers, regulators, and consumers. Then, she explained how blockchain could help address the latter through a specific use case: tracing contaminated items to reduce fraud, waste, and brand liability. McDermott continued by sharing benefits of adjoining data and analytics with the element of trust. She explained that the blockchain would lead to a decrease in social, financial, and time costs for companies, such as their mango pilot customer Walmart.Walmart\u2019s food safety solution using IBM Food Trust built on the IBM Blockchain Platform. Source: YoutubeCall to action: Keep an ear out for developments and consider working on projects in these areas, as they will likely have the most potential to add value (and succeed).Takeaway #3. Blockchains Quantitative Value <> You can create business value through blockchain.The Quantifiable Business of Blockchains session joked that anyone can increase the value of their business by using the term \u201cblockchain.\u201dThere are examples of that being true. Look up Kodak and Overstock.com.I wonder if Kathleen Breitman and Arthur Breitman, founders of Tezos, could have raised $232M without blockchain in its description. Ditto on Filecoin with Juan Benet\u2019s $257M ICO raise.True and sustainable blockchain value is still to be materialized. That said, there are many cited potential use cases (see a growing list of them here).Call to action: Don\u2019t use the term \u201cblockchain\u201d for the sake of using it. Find cases where blockchain technology can solve problems and create value.Takeaway #4. Crypto Quantitative Value <> You can create personal value through\u00a0tokens.At the Crypto Summit, their keynote, Tricia Martinez, founder of Wala, explained that crypto will help people in emerging markets the most. She explained that it is in countries with economic and governmental instability that people can truly make use of the power of blockchain. The sentiment was echoed in SXSW\u2019s Trust Crisis: The Need for Blockchain panel hosted by the Blockchain Trust Accelerator, NDI, Bitfury, and the New America Foundation.Lori Corpuz, Jenny Q. Ta, Anu Bhardwaj, Salome Parulava. Source: Lolita\u00a0TaubIn the State of Blockchain Tech and Investments panel, Jenny Q. Ta, founder of Sqeeqee and investor, encouraged everyone to take advantage of a low priced bitcoin, buy, and then create wealth when it goes up. And that is the way to create quantitative value from blockchain.People were excited to hear recommendations on what to buy. And in the hallways, it wasn\u2019t strange to hear people\u2019s concern about whether \u201cit\u2019s too late to get rich or not\u201d from crypto.Call to action: Know that crypto is highly speculative and you can lose anything you put in. Only put in what you\u2019re 100% willing to lose.Takeaway #5. The Driving Force of Blockchain <> Fear of missing out drives blockchain interest.Blockchain and Ethereum Meet-Up with Ron Resnick, Exec Dir at the EEA and Consensys. Source: Lolita\u00a0TaubBlockchain FOMO is real. At the Blockchain and Ethereum Meet-Up, Ron Resnick, Executive Director at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, said, \u201cfear of being left behind is what gets enterprise to look at blockchain.\u201dThere\u2019s a danger with FOMO. Businesses may jump blindly into blockchain, thinking that it\u2019s a solution to their problems, without that being the case. It\u2019s important for businesses to start by asking themselves: what problem are you solving and is blockchain the right way of addressing it? It may not be.Call to action: Use your critical thinking skill set. Focus on first identifying the problem and thinking of technology second.Takeaway #6. Blockchain Needs Community to Succeed <> The blockchain community is banding together.From the Women in Blockchain meet-up to the Blockchain and Ethereum Meet-up to the Private Blockchain Meet-Up, every blockchain meet-up invited participants to find ways to collaborate and expand the community.Austin: A Global Center of Blockchain Innovation panel. Source: Lolita\u00a0TaubAt the Austin: A Global Center of Blockchain Innovation session, the Austin Blockchain Collective, shared how their organization is headed by different players (i.e., Wanchain, Lighthouse Holdings, Multicoin Capital, Laurence Ventures) and aims to connect their local community with people, events, and resources.Given that blockchains require adoption and membership of chains, community is essential for the success of blockchain.Call to action: Join or build a blockchain community, share your resources, and collaborate.Takeaway #7. Blockchain Ignorance is Real <> People don\u2019t understand what is blockchain, but they want\u00a0in.Ignorance is not bliss. Not many hands in the audience go up when asked, \u201cwho can explain blockchain?\u201d That\u2019s a problem because we can\u2019t answer the question, \u201ccan blockchain help solve x problem?\u201d if people don\u2019t know what blockchain is.That said, I was glad to see that SXSW did their best to provide sessions to explain the fundamentals of blockchain. They invited authors of blockchain books, such as Tiana Laurence\u2019s Blockchain For Dummies (I recommend it!) and Julian Hosp\u2019s Cryptocurrencies Simply Explained.Julian Hosp in What is Blockchain? How Will it Change the World? session. Source: Lolita\u00a0TaubJulian Hosp also led the What is Blockchain? How Will it Change the World? session and educated the lay on blockchain. He broke it down by defining, giving examples of, and pointing out benefits/challenges of: (1) consensus, (2) centralized vs decentralized, (3) distributed ledger technology (e.g. blockchain, tangle, and hashgraph), (4) cryptocurrency (e.g. crypto vs blockchain), (5) bitcoin, alt coins, and shitcoins, (6) use cases (e.g. smart contracts in insurance), and (7) the philosophy of giving power back to the people (and driving to a world that\u2019s between a dictatorship and anarchy).What is Blockchain? How Will it Change the World? session Source: Lolita\u00a0TaubAll that said, people and organizations need to understand that centralized approaches are cheaper and faster (but, it\u2019s true, that we risk centralized authorities abusing their power). On the flip side, blockchains can be abused too.People want to know more. In every session I attended, there were people from both technical and non-technical backgrounds trying to understand how they could get involved. Professors of universities asked questions about what to teach their students to help them along the path. Engineers asked how they could jump into blockchain. And of course, there were many who simply wanted to know more about crypto. In more than one session, members of the audience asked, \u201cWhat coins would you suggest I buy and how do I do it?\u201dCall to action:\u00a0For the technical: start with Google and cryptozombies.ioFor the non-technical: start by reading Blockchain For DummiesTakeaway #8. Redundant Question <> But what happens to blockchain when quantum computing arrives?Someone in just about every session asked a question about the future of blockchain post quantum computing. The answer across the board: we\u2019ll know when we get there. TBD.Call to action: Figure out blockchain first. Read Medium posts, Blockchain For Dummies, and Google.Takeaway #9. Blockchain UX is bad <> We need to work on having better user experience.In Don\u2019t Sweat the Tech: Trade Explanation for UX, dylan thomas figlo, VP of UX at Sweetbridge, kicked off the session by asking about their blockchain UX experiences. Everyone raised their hand when asked if they had found using their first crypto wallet confusing. Blockchain UX is bad today, and it needs to get better.How to achieve better blockchain UX? Understand that no one is a UX expert but that the users are. So, it\u2019s important to listen to them\u200a\u2014\u200athink NPS and allow your users to give you feedback easily and painlessly.Call to action: Hire someone who is really good at UX and listen to your users.Takeaway #10. The Rise of Private Blockchains <> Public blockchains are not worth the money for enterprises.Quantifiable Business Benefits of Blockchain session. Source: Lolita\u00a0TaubIn the Quantifiable Business Benefits of Blockchain session, Karyl Fowler, CEO of Transmute Industries, believes that we will see a rise of private blockchains. Fowler explained that public chains are very expensive, are not worth it for enterprises, and that enterprise customers want to develop private blockchains. And she\u2019s bullish that enterprise will be who will ramp up blockchain adoption and drive the winners in the space.It may be the case that Fowler it correct, but then again, many blockchain projects exist outside of enterprise\u200a\u2014\u200aat blockchain startups and ICOs.Call to actions: Whether there is a rise in private or public blockchains, we (the blockchain community) must: (1) educate our customers, (2) identify customer pain points, (3) when blockchain is identified as the right solution, sandbox, and test blockchains, and only then (4) launch a blockchain intro production.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "Blockchain Payroll: It Makes Zero Sense that You\u2019re Still Living Paycheck to Paycheck (And You Don\u2019t Need to\u00a0Anymore)", "author_name": "Ivan Petrovic", "link": "https://medium.com/workchain-io/blockchain-payroll-it-makes-zero-sense-that-youre-still-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-and-you-ac9dfdc4a0ef?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 9, 2018", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "5.8K", "content": "Blockchain Payroll: It Makes Zero Sense that You\u2019re Still Living Paycheck to Paycheck (And You Don\u2019t Need to\u00a0Anymore)Ivan PetrovicBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 9, 2018What it feels like every time I finally get my paycheck\u2026 \u201cCall a press conference, and bring out the oversized novelty check, I\u2019m gettin\u2019\u00a0paid!\u201dEver had a job that pays a regular paycheck?If you have and you\u2019re not paid in shells, goats or shiny gemstones, it probably goes a little something like this.You do your hard work each week, clocking your hours or attendance as you go. Day after day.Then, as weeks pass your employer eventually tallies up the work you\u2019ve done.Your timesheet or hours are passed onto the accounting team for processing.And the bank finally deposits your earning into your account.\u201cHooray, it\u2019s finally payday!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aAnyone who\u2019s ever got a regular paycheck.By now, up to a month has passed.Bills, rent and living expenses pile up while you juggle funds to avoid missing due dates and bank overdraft fees.If this sounds familiar, you\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s the long, slow payroll cycle that\u2019s de rigueur for most of the working world.And, simply, it makes no sense when you consider the way the world now works.The Evolution of Payroll\u200a\u2014\u200aHow We Got into This Slow-Paying MessA quick look at the history of paychecks is important to understanding the issues of today (like your bank account isn\u2019t already telling you, right?).7000BC\u200a\u2014\u200aAncient payment records chiselled into stone tablets (\u201cFile this for me will you, Marie?\u201d)19th Century\u200a\u2014\u200aThe birth of the modern payroll cycle during the Industrial Revolution.1890s\u200a\u2014\u200aJeweler William Le Grand Bundy invents the early payroll time-card machine. (Presumably, diamond encrusted).1920s-1940s\u200a\u2014\u200aEmployees manually submit their time cards to clerks and paid in envelopes filled with cash or a check.1950s\u200a\u2014\u200aComputerization of payroll.1980s\u200a\u2014\u200aFax machines used to remotely lodge time-sheets, \u201cHang up the phone, it\u2019s a fax!\u201d becomes a catchphrase of a generation.1990s\u200a\u2014\u200aIntroduction of the personal computer, email and Excel for tracking and managing payroll. ALT + F4 strikes fear into payroll admins across the globe.2000s\u200a\u2014\u200aSoftware systems used to track and process payroll online.2018-onward\u200a\u2014\u200aPayroll moves into real-time on the blockchain.So, we\u2019ve come a long way from chiseling our hours into stone.But, other than some technical advances, long payroll cycles are still largely stuck in the 19th Century.Ahh\u2026 we sure have come a long\u00a0way.The Simple Fact is, We Work in Real-Time and On-Demand but Payroll\u00a0Doesn\u2019t.We do just about everything on-demand these days.We work on-demand.Watch TV on-demand.Shop on-demand.Order food on-demand.But when it comes to getting paid, it\u2019s totally out of our control. We\u2019re told when we get paid. No ifs or buts.On one hand this is due to industrial age conventions. On the other, because of technological limitations\u200a\u2014\u200areal-time processing with today\u2019s systems would be super inefficient and labor-intensive.But with blockchain technology, the entire payroll paradigm can be broken like a full-fisted karate chop through a block of wood.That means an end to weeks of empty pockets, put off bills and financial stressing. And with less time, cost and effort for employers to boot.Here, let me explain.Show Me the Money\u2026 Sure Thing, Just Head Over to the BlockchainNow, let\u2019s reimagine the typical payroll scenario.This time, instead, on the blockchain.You clock into work each day, putting in the hours of solid work. Or, as they say in French, \u201cwork your derri\u00e8re off\u201d.The end of your shift comes, and your hours or attendance are logged. But this time around, they\u2019re verified directly and immediately on the blockchain.Your earnings are then instantly released via the platform in cryptocurrency payments using a stable coin such as TrueUSD, which can easily converted to your local currency.It\u2019s the future of payroll that we\u2019re creating with the WorkChain.io platform.Now, let\u2019s put on our safari suits and explore how blockchain makes it possible.The First Step to Real-Time Payroll is Proof an Employee Has Done their\u00a0JobThe first part to bringing payroll into real-time is obtaining proof of work. Kind of like a clock-card or logged hours\u200a\u2014\u200aevidence someone\u2019s done their job and needs to be paid.All your hours, earnings and forecast work in one place via your WorkChain.io calendar.WorkChain.io does this by creating validated work records on the blockchain\u2019s distributed public ledger by connecting with the HR or workforce management systems. With this data, verified, timestamped and immutable work records can be built.Click on a particular shift to see every detail about\u00a0it.These records are linked to an employee\u2019s unique workID, a unique user identifier on the platform.workID: your unique user identifier used to accessyour pay in realtime.With a workID, your work is tied to your identity. This gives employers what they need to pay an employee: valid proof of work that triggers payments.The Paycheck of the Future Will Feature Cryptocurrency, Not Dollar\u00a0SignsAccording to some ancient \u201cpaychecks\u201d, employees in Egypt and Mesopotamiawere paid in beer (that\u2019s one way to cut out the middleman for some of us\u2026).Now, how would you like to receive your pay? Lager, draft or\u00a0IPA\u2026?The paycheck of the future won\u2019t come in stamped envelope or direct deposit from bank to bank. It\u2019ll come in the form of cryptocurrency, bypassing processing fees and delays to release your earnings instantly.We\u2019re all impatiently waiting for cryptocurrency to get a mainstream foothold.Come onnnn\u2026 hurry up already.Until then, there\u2019s still a gap between cryptocurrency and mainstream currencies to be bridged.In our case, this will be done with ACH and cryptocurrency loaded pay cards.In future, as cryptocurrencies become the norm, there\u2019ll be no divide to conquer. You\u2019ll get paid and spend in cryptocurrency. No fees or negative exchange rates in between.Blockchain Can Change the Very Meaning of\u00a0\u201cWork\u201dThere are 78 million hourly wage workers in the US. And plenty more people entering the gig or on-demand workforce daily that\u2019ll make up more than half of American workers by 2020.These two groups are the logical first-in-line users for the real-time payroll. But it\u2019s by no means just these folks set to benefit.The thing is, any segment of the workforce that gets a paycheck from an employer will eventually have the freedom to be paid in real-time. From a waiter in a restaurant, to a freelance graphic designer, to a salaried VP of marketing.And the whole concept of what it means to work can be completely redefined with blockchain payroll. No longer are we limited to a day\u2019s work, shift or set number of hours logged.It can be a job or task. A segmented, predefined block of work.This will mark a shift to a more value-based way of working.What\u2019ll that do for job clarity, direction, productivity and satisfaction?Hint: A LOT.The Massive Potential of Real-Time Payroll for Employees and EmployersGetting access to your money instantly means more control and stability. Plus, no longer needing to attempt to budget each month to cover all of life\u2019s expenses.Creating a workable budget can be a nightmare\u2026But it also means freedom and autonomy. More choice when it comes to how and when you work. Freedom from the constraints of traditional working models.And, listen here employers, there\u2019s plenty in it for you too.The blockchain is decentralized and built on trust through consensus. This is what makes it such a revolutionary technology.The way blockchain builds and operates on trust means payroll can be agreed to, verified and paid between employee and employer, and automatically triggered by set conditions without heavy loads of admin.For employees this creates a much more efficient, cost-effective way to managing payroll.And buh bye to the reliance on centralized institutions and third-party intermediaries like banks and payment processors. It can remove these layers entirely, creating less touch-points and reducing time and fees.Believe it or Not, Most of the HR World is Already Setup and Ready for Real-time PayrollI can hear all those payroll officers grumbling\u2026 \u201cYeah but we already have our systems in place\u2026\u201d *Taps on calculator, slurps coffee, looks dreamily at spreadsheets*Alright, I hear ya.But, here\u2019s the thing\u2026 those super fangled payroll and HR systems mean you\u2019ve got everything you need.Gosh darn, how can that be?Through integrations.We can create real-time compensation for many of the systems that are already used by the bulk of today\u2019s HR world.Let\u2019s look at hourly workers for instance.Getting verification of their hours or shift is easy. We simply integrate with popular HR systems their employers use to manage employee schedules and payroll and voila! Workchain.io has the data it needs for validated work records.And we don\u2019t need to imagine things here. Because it\u2019s already starting to happen.Take for example our team\u2019s previous companies Humanity and WorkPuls(smart guys, huh?). Between them, the two companies manage the schedules of more than one million employees.Soon to be integrated with WorkChain.io, that\u2019s a million people getting access to real-time earnings.Early integrations with Humanity and WorkPuls will bring a user-base of more than one million employees.And to take it even a step further, in future we\u2019ll be able to integrate with task management software like JIRA, and as soon as a task is marked \u201cdone\u201d it can automatically trigger a payment.See, nothing to worry about payroll people. But plenty to be excited about.No More Waiting Weeks to Get Paid.

This scenario further aggravates the greed and digital exploits by the middleman who are high on generating transaction fees or hidden charges over every single transaction made from the common man.Bitbose.comThe mushrooming world of BlockchainsAfter the coining of Bitcoin, Blockchain technology found a separate world for itself and continued (and still continues) to grow maturely and rapidly. With the ability to script, Blockchains have delved a new hacker-proof era, which is the reason behind most of the entrepreneurs and professionals investing into this highly profitable industry. The essence of Blockchain is that it is free from any intermediary or middlemen (broker/agency) to verify and authenticate the transactions. The modern cryptographic and hashing techniques have resulted in data being 100% tamper-proof and giving a solution to the problem of \u2018double-spending\u2019 as well. As the system is de-centralized over a peer-to-peer network, any risks pertaining to single-point failures are ruled out.The emergence and fabrication of\u00a0BitBoseBitBose offers an incredible and technically superior trading platform eliminating all the traditional inefficiencies of the current financial sector.

I would tell them even if they don\u2019t ask me what I do. I have an urge to occasionally add the word \u201cBlockchain\u201d in my conversations. It\u2019s supposed to make me sound cool. I don\u2019t know if it works but I keep trying. But, that\u2019s not bad when compared to people who use Blockchain for all their problems. Yes, Blockchain does solve some hard problems. That doesn\u2019t mean you can use it for everything. If you do then you will be creating more problems like your solution would be expensive and slow.Credits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcdThankfully Kurl Wust and Arthur Gervais, researchers from Switzerland have written a paper and explained when to use Blockchain. This story is a derived work. Here are a few questions you need to answer to figure out if your ideas need a Blockchain. The researchers have considered the current limitations of Blockchain (like cost and through output). In the future, Blockchain will be more efficient. These questions have a limited validity.1. Is data storage required?\u201cJohn wants to build a speed reading app. Does he need a Blockchain?\u201dIn John\u2019s situation, he is developing a speed reading app, there is no data to be stored. Blockchain is a distributed database and purpose of a database is to store and access data. If you don\u2019t have any data to be stored then no need of Blockchain. If you have data to be stored then let us continue our validation by asking the next question.2. Are you the only one who is writing\u00a0data?\u201cJohn wants to build an app to summarise news from different sources.\u201d\u201cMary\u2019s business involves two other small businesses and an accounting firm. They involve in regular transactions with each other.\u201dAccording to the researchers, if you are the only person who is writing data, there is no need of Blockchain. In John\u2019s situation, he doesn\u2019t need a Blockchain. He can build an Android or an IOS app, use apple push or google messaging to push summaries. It would be cheaper. The purpose of a distributed database is to avoid inconsistencies. If you are the only person who wants to write data, there will be no inconsistency. Hence, no need for a blockchain. I would slightly disagree with them, if you are a university who wants to certify students, I think Blockchain would make sense here. Since you don\u2019t have to build the tech infrastructure to certify students, instead you can use a Public Blockchain like Ethereum.If multiple entities are regularly involved in financial transactions, each of you has to maintain a ledger. Here there are possibilities of inconsistencies since multiple people are involved and transactions need to be tallied. A Blockchain would make sense here. In Mary\u2019s situation, the entities had to maintain a separate ledger before Blockchain. Here there are chances of inconsistencies, a Blockchain is required. If you have multiple writers, then let us move on to the next question.3. Do you have trusted third\u00a0party?\u201cDuring my childhood me and my brother involved in continuous trades (clothes, chocolates, etc). When there is a dispute our mom would interfere and settle it.\u201dIn this situation, our mom is a trusted third party. We don\u2019t need a Blockchain. If you can trust a third party who can be a mediator in your deal, then you don\u2019t have to use a Blockchain. Of course, the fee should be nominal. If you don\u2019t have a trusted third party, let us move on to the next question.4. Are your writers anonymous?\u201cMark wants to build an app where anyone can voice their opinion about political parties. He wants to protect the privacy of its contributors.\u201dWe don\u2019t want to reveal our identity when we purchase from a local store. Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. solve the problem of revealing identity during a financial transaction. If you want to protect the privacy of your writers, use a Permissionless Blockchain like Ethereum. It would make sense in Mark\u2019s situation because he can protect the identity of users (It again depends on the Blockchain, identities of several bitcoin users have been revealed). If people involved are not anonymous, let us ask the next question.Persmissionless BlockchainIn a Permissionless Blockchain, there is no authority who is validating a transaction. It\u2019s validated by the people involved in the network. For eg, when Bitcoin transactions are made.There is no authority who sanctions a transaction instead, the transactions are validated by miners in the network. If people involved are anonymous then you need a Permissionless Blockchain.Credits\u00a0:\u00a0xkcd5. Do the writers mutually trust each\u00a0other?\u201cI can\u2019t believe a few drivers on Uber have a rating of 4.5 stars. Am I being manipulated?\u201dBlockchain solves the problem of trust. For eg. In a centralised database, the authority can manipulate data to its viewers. In Uber\u2019s situation, this could be a possibility. Maybe the riders are generous. In a Blockchain, all viewers will see the same data. If the data is contributed by people is within your circle of trust. Then you don\u2019t need a Blockchain. If your writers don\u2019t trust each other, let us ask the next question.6. Do you need public verification?\u201cSara wants to bring transparency to Tuna fish supply chain. She wants people to know where the fish was caught, processed, packaged, etc\u201dDo you want to make your data be transparent? In that case, you need to use Public Permissioned Blockchain. Here public will be allowed to read the data in your Blockchain. In Sara\u2019s case, the person who buys tuna can be assured it doesn\u2019t have any health risks. If you don\u2019t want your data to be public and it should be only visible to the parties involved then you can use a Private Permissioned Blockchain (Hyperledger).Answering these question will help you identify if your ideas need a Blockchain. Blockchain can be costly if you use it inappropriately. Since Blockchain would be slow in retrieving data when compared to a centralised server. But, if you use it for the appropriate problems it would be rewarding.We need your claps\ud83d\udc4f to reach more people since this is a new publication.

The decisions made by the agency are limited to skills of the people they hired. The package of services is standardizedSponsy:Decentralizes the decision-making, allows parallelizing the work. People of other cultures, countries and customs can unite their skills to work on the same sponsorship deal, greatly increasing the quality of the result.LitigationsCentralized Agency:Despite many years of experience, agencies make fatal mistakes in design of legal documents, which lead to multimillion-dollar litigations. Costly MasterCard vs. FIFA case is only one of examples.Sponsy:Not a limited team of full-time lawyers, but wide distributed network of experts works on the legal side of a sponsorship deal. As the work finishes, a voting will be made among other experts to make sure the contract is correct.Appropriateness of a sponsorship dealCentralized Agency:Decisions regarding the expediency of a certain sponsorship deal is taken solely on the basis of the experience of the agency. The advancements in technology and highly variable tastes of target audience do not allow agencies to keep up-to-date with the changing views.Sponsy:Tokenholders vote on the appropriateness of each future sponsorship partnership and can propose their ideas. This is the most effective approach, because the tokenholders represent the target audience of any sponsorship deal.Clients discriminationCentralized Agency:Agencies undertake a careful filtering of incoming requests before agreeing to work with some client. As a rule, only major brands and successful events that can bring significant financial returns are selected.Sponsy:Ready to work with any company. Moreover, we observe frighteningly low penetration of sponsorship deals into small and medium business. We intend to fight this. The small size of profit does not prevent us from it, since we can boast automated processes with minimal expenditures.Services priceCentralized Agency:The price for services includes the agency\u2019s wild commission.Sponsy:The costs of expert services are compensated up to 25% of the amounts charged.Time requiredCentralized Agency:Centralization of decision-making and a limited range of employees leads to intolerably long time required to complete a sponsorships deal. Large partnerships can take more than 10 months to settle!Sponsy:The work is parallelized; the processes are verified and automated. Quality control is carried out through decentralized voting.

In its first few days it has firmly established itself, and begun a steady growth trend. The total trade turnover has now reached more than 5 million dollars a day. Traders agree on one point: new tokens don\u2019t usually start so strongly and confidently.The week before listing our office worked deep into the night. The tension grew. And finally the x-hour came. To start we chose small decentralized exchanges: Tidex, IDEX and Ether Delta.\u201cOur team is acting strictly in line with the developed long-term strategy for listing,\u201d said Dmitry Sheludko, Head of Investor Relations at CREDITS. \u201cThus we will constantly enter new exchanges, while raising the bar. Right now we are negotiating with the well-known independent sites. The ultimate goal is: CREDITS can be bought as easily on small local exchanges as on large global markets.\u201dBecause of high demand for CS tokens during the ICO and pre-ICO periods, not all keen investors could make a purchase, and the stock exchange began at a minimal and affordable price. On IDEX it started with 0.00042 eth for 1 CS. On Tidex\u200a\u2014\u200afrom 0.00020 eth for 1 CS. As soon as the tokens were unfrozen, some investors immediately dropped some of the coins on the exchange. They made a profit in relation to the price of ICO, and a predicted decrease of the value of the token occurred. The drawdown, however, was barely perceptible, and the price did not fall below the ICO price. This fact shows that users and serious investors are really very interested.Trading is now proceeding in a measured way. There is a consistent upward trend taking into account some fluctuations. At Tidex CREDITS reached peak at 0.00084997 eth., a 324.985% increase to the price of the token at ICO. At IDEX, the peak was 0.0007899, which was 294.995% growth. Later, the price adjusted to 0.00061999 eth. Currently the trading volume has reached approximately 4500 ETH on IDEX and 1200 ETH on Tidex. And in total, it has already exceeded $5 million per day. Additionally, it is important to notice that CS showed this growth during a neutral or downward market situation.How can people use the CREDITS cryptocurrency and what is its secret? Igor Chugunov, the project\u2019s founder, thinks that:- Any company will be able to develop its own smart contract on our platform and program its cycles and schedules. All payments inside this smart contract will be made in CS. Our platform can be used in logistics, banking, IOT, insurance, casinos and many other industries.In the opinion of experts and traders, CREDITS shows all the hallmarks of a future market leader: the unlimited scalability of the network, the fast transactions up to 1 000 000 per second, the variety of use cases.In the IDEX and Tidex chat rooms, CS discussions have become popular since the first day of listing on March, 2.", "responses": "16"}, {"title": "Fundamental Challenges Faced By\u00a0Events", "author_name": "Sponsy Blockchain", "link": "https://medium.com/sponsy/fundamental-challenges-faced-by-events-633ab804771b?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 11, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "284", "content": "Fundamental Challenges Faced By\u00a0EventsSponsy BlockchainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 11, 2017Sponsorship has evolved into a sophisticated marketing technique that goes much beyond promoting awareness and association of an event to a brand. Sponsors now know that the most authentic way in which they reach their goals is to provide and support an exceptional experience that the target audience will receive during the event and their interaction with the sponsored product. However, nowadays sponsorship industry is undergoing multiple storms and transformations.For event organizers, recruiting effective sponsors has become very complicated. Cramming an event with hundreds of brands, each competing for the same audience, doesn\u2019t work. Who wants to share their logo with 50 other brands jammed on a billboard? Getting some business venture, project, or event sponsorship can be the difference between a successful and exciting collaboration and a failure.Potential sponsees should be aware of vast amount of pitfalls on their way to landing a deal. In this article, we would like to examine key challenges across sponsorship industry that events and properties face today.Providing a great sponsor\u00a0proposalThe proposal must be absolutely compelling. Event\u2019s founders should understand, that sponsorships are not just about their business: the company they want to partner with will want to know what\u2019s in it for them. How will the company reap benefits it wouldn\u2019t otherwise get? Of course, event\u2019s holders must include information about event\u2019s demographics, potential audience, its key features. Essentially, sponsors are buying the audience. Target company should be able to clearly see how precisely this event will help the corporation to reach its desired audience.Sponsy platform offers event organizers and sponsors the opportunity to get their brand or venue professionally evaluated by a group of distributed experts. Experts are incentivized to exercise competent and effective evaluation, because of receiving benefits in case of successful contract conclusion.Such an approach allows event organizers not to worry about paper work and let all possible issues to be solved by professionals, while devoting their valuable time to things that work best for them\u200a\u2014\u200ato holding exceptional events.Finding a right person to approach in the\u00a0companyMarketing department is recommended to be visited first. However, in some companies, the appropriate department might be public relations, community affairs, public affairs, supplier diversity or brand management. One can spend long days of tedious searches while trying to arrange a meeting with a person who is entitled to making money-related decisions. Given many companies a typical event organizer must talk to, simple hunt for contacts may take unacceptable time span.Sponsy frees event organizers from the burden of finding the right people. Thanks to maximum optimization of operational processes, all the necessary contacts can be discovered inside our online interface. Sponsy clients can communicate with partners through a convenient chat. In case of necessity, one can easily arrange a telephone conversation. All these interactions can be done with a couple of mouse clicks.It\u2019s finally time to forget about the manual search for the right people.Asking for suitable sum of\u00a0moneyMany small businesses make the mistake of not asking for enough money in sponsorships. They often forget that they are offering these corporations value and direct access to the customers they want to reach. In addition, many of these corporations are used to making deals in the tens of thousands. That\u2019s why asking for $1,000 from a company that has the pockets to give $10,000 is certainly not a good venture. Event should value their connection to the target demographic and charge accordingly.It\u2019s important not to sell yourself short. The first impression is the most powerful impression. Events don\u2019t have chance for a\u00a0mistake.Sponsy\u2019s clients can relax again. Thanks to large amount of competing proposals from sponsors, which are listed on our platform, event organizers get access to real-time market prices and can immediately estimate sum of money they need. Moreover, the availability of experienced consultants inside our platform will allow sponsors and sponsees to instantly obtain proper advice on any question.Targeting companies with the right\u00a0fitCompanies are interested in reaching audiences they typically do not have at their fingertips. It\u2019s less expensive than purchasing traditional media advertising and helps them target these individuals through an intermediary that already has their attention and trust. Event holders should make sure they can articulate exactly who they serve. Are your customers male or female? How much income do they make? Do they have children? Do they travel frequently? These are some basic questions corporations are sure to ask.In the modern complex corporate world, full of M&A and giant relentlessly competing brands, it is extremely tough to find a suitable\u00a0sponsor.Sponsy is proud to be developing a unique solution that will allow events to discover appropriate brands that are relevant to them. This is an AI algorithm called SponsyMatch \u00a9. SponsyMatch\u00a9 guarantees a statistically significant coincidence of brand\u2019s interests and sponsor\u2019s interests. It allows us to instantly drop up to 85% of brands and events that are very likely not to be able to collaborate productively if a sponsorship was to be negotiated.Sponsor seeming spotty or unreliableSometimes brand may turn out to be broken. It means the publicity of business has grown so negative and the reputation has become so poor, that most people would not love to see some event being affiliated with it. Basically, it\u2019s important for event organizers to look into what people around are saying about a sponsor before agreeing to work with him. If event associates itself with an individual or group that later gets bad press, event\u2019s reputation might be temporarily sullied or the value of your sponsorship greatly diminished. It\u2019s always a good practice to check out any organization deeply before signing a contract.", "responses": "6"}, {"title": "5 Thoughts Following Credit Suisse\u2019s 2017 Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Symposium", "author_name": "Lou Kerner", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/5-thoughts-following-credit-suisses-2017-blockchain-cryptocurrency-symposium-b6fb33e47f9e?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 16, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "977", "content": "Breakfast With Joey\u00a0Krug5 Thoughts Following Credit Suisse\u2019s 2017 Blockchain & Cryptocurrency SymposiumLou KernerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 16, 2017On October 10th last week, along with over 200 others, I attended my first major Wall Street event on cryptocurrency. Here are my five thoughts from the event:1. Wall Street Is Coming & Credit Suisse Is Leading The\u00a0WaySimply put, Credit Suisse CRUSHED IT. All you need to do is look at this sick agenda packed with crypto luminaries to appreciate why.I was planning on going to BlockCon in Los Angeles (my hometown) to sit on a panel and be at, what I assumed would be, the center of the crypto world for a few days. But I ended up bailing due to workload and the fact I\u2019m back in L.A. in three weeks for the ICO 2.0 Summit. Trading in the BlockCon zoo, for the Credit Suisse bliss, was my best bail in a long time.I got to the event early enough to enjoy breakfast in a room packed with suits. No one was immediately familiar, so I intuitively sat next to the only guy in the room wearing a t-shirt, and had the pleasure of meeting Joey Krug. That\u2019s how the entire day went.The event started with a brief introduction by Emmanuel Aidoo, Head of Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Strategy for Credit Suisse. Who even knew anyone at a major bank had a title like that? Kudos Credit Suisse.But the content really kicked off with an inspiring and insightful keynote by Balaji S. Srinivasan, and maintained a tremendous level of quality, ending with a thoughtful keynote by Michael Novogratz, and a great after party thrown by Brian Kelly.To date, Wall Street has sat back and let firms like The Argon Group and others emerge as bankers to the crypto world. Undoubtedly, there\u2019s still a lot of regulatory work that will need to occur before the major banks risk their reputations and balance sheets diving in to the deep end of the crypto pool. But make no mistake, the major banks aren\u2019t asleep at the wheel as they were in the mid 90\u2019s when firms like Hambrecht & Quist, Alex Brown, Montgomery Securities, and Robertson Stephens emerged as internet banking juggernauts, until they were bought at, or near, the peak by the big banks that were largely still playing catch up. The big banks know their world is changing faster then ever, due to a broad range of technologies, none with more disruptive potential than blockchain, cryptocurrency, and decentralization. The major investment banks are going to be major players in the crypto industry, with bespoke crypto services they provide like they do with the hedge fund industry and prime brokerage services. And from where I\u2019m sitting, Credit Suisse is leading the way.2. The Next Silicon Valley Will Be In The\u00a0CloudsBalaji S. Srinivasan spun a lot of gold in his keynote, but I was most struck by his statement about the next Silicon Valley. Even though I spend my time investing in tech/crypto companies founded by Israelis, I\u2019ve long believed that there will never be another Silicon Valley. Similar to how I believe that great movies can be made all over the world, but there will never be another Hollywood, the Valley still attracts many of the world\u2019s best and brightest in tech in a way that no other city in the world can begin to match.But with the emergence of technologies enabling decentralized organizations, it now seems obvious that the next Silicon Valley will be in the clouds3. Get Your\u00a0.eth Domain Name\u00a0TodayOnce a domainer, always a domainer, and ever since starting the\u00a0.tv TLD in 2000, I\u2019ve been a domainer. While it looked like the space was dead multiple times, DNS is so core to how the internet works, that the domain name space just reinvents itself again and again. Now with the emergence of ENS (the Ethereum Name Service) you can get names ending in\u00a0.eth (e.g. loukerner.eth) that allows you to use a unique domain name for your wallet address (replacing the current 42-digit wallet address). While it\u2019s important to note that ENS is not a domain system as managed by ICANN (i.e. there is no claim on the \u201c.eth\u201d TLD), it can be used in a similar fashion on apps that replicate browser functionality, like Mist or Metamask. In other words, ENS is an Ethereum-based dapp built on smart contracts, addressing the ease-of-use issue that remains a barrier to mainstream crypto adoption. You can learn more about ENS domains at ENS.domains.4. Everything Else\u2026..The truth is there weren\u2019t five things I learned at the conference, there were 500+. The last two points I noted above I learned 10% of the way in to Balaji\u2019s opening keynote. The content ran from legal (custody of crypto remains the major impediment to institutional adoption) to macro (nation states outside the U.S. will adopt cryptocurrencies before the U.S.). I was fascinated by what I learned abut about Ripple from Miguel Vias (Head of XRP Markets). I was really impressed by Hadley Stern from Fidelity Labs (a Fidelity Investments company), who explained why Fidelity is mining Bitcoin and Ethereum. It was fascinating to learn some crypto investing history when Catherine Wood of Ark Invest talked about being the first public fund manager to invest in bitcoin (in September 2015).I could literally go on and on and on. Listening to Michael Novogratz give the closing keynote and talk about the coming heard of institutional money finished the official session on a high note.5. A Personal Highlight\u2026 And\u00a0ThanksWhile in a sea of crypto stars, a highlight for me was when Alex Yamashita from TLDR Capital introduced himself after reading my name tag. Alex told me he was a fan of my writing, and proved it, by showing me a print out of a recent Medium post of mine he was carrying around to read at a later time. I\u2019m now a fan of his as well. You can sign up for his newsletter\u00a0\u2026 here.Me With Alex Yamashita Holding A Print Out Of A Blog Post Of\u00a0MineI can\u2019t thank Bob Peck (Head of Global Interent Investment Banking), Daniel Wirtz (Head of Blockchain at Credit Suisse) and the rest of the Credit Suisse team for hosting such a great event\u2026\u2026. and sending me an invite.If you got at least 0.00000001 Bitcoin worth of value from this post please \u201cClap\u201d below so others will see the post.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "What Blog/Media Would Be on Blockchain Era?", "author_name": "CBNT Official", "link": "https://medium.com/@cbntofficial/what-blog-media-would-be-on-blockchain-era-425cca482?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 19, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "7.1K", "content": "What Blog/Media Would Be on Blockchain Era?CBNT OfficialBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 19, 2018On September 17th, the CBNT Roadshow was successfully held at the Shanghai Grand Hyatt Hotel. The conference was on The Future of Media on Blockchain and attracted a lot of Academic Organizations, blockchain media, institutional investors, and Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). They gathered in Shanghai to discuss win-win cooperation and the new direction of Media with blockchain technology.At the event, Chris Chen the CEO of CBNT, REG the COO of CBNT, both Co-founders of well-known media companies and Trenton Creamer, a blockchain investment analyst and advisor gave a speech at the show.Reg the COO of CBNT, introduced the trend of value sharing with the Apple iPhone. Apple fans contribute every year to the tremendous revenue of Apple Inc. This boosts the price of Apple shares, while only the Apple shareholders get profit from it but not the apple social media users. We think this business model is not sustainable. CBNT will improve upon this traditional media platform and build a decentralized win-win community with blockchain technology and their token incentive mechanism.

Even though the questions from the media and capitals were challenging, the team always satisfied them with proper and professional explanations, along with detailing the advantages of the CBNT model. The debate among the project team, institutional investors, and media pushed the event to a climax; Chris from CBNT, Zhou Huan from IPFS Fund, and Jin Mu from Height Finance, respectively represented each party and presented a heated and wonderful discussion, ignited with enthusiasm from all of the participants. Everyone who commented at this event was very interested in the topic too, which was totally different from other boring conferences.The development of blockchain technology accelerated the coming of a new era in the token economy. This conference aimed to explore the future of content ecosystems on the blockchain, promote the collaboration of thinking among the industries and dig deep into the blockchain+\u201d Specific applications\u201d.

What you may already know is that Satoshi Nakamoto combined existing techniques like digital signatures, peer-to-peer networks, and public-key cryptography to create Bitcoin, the world\u2019s first real cryptocurrency. But what the Bitcoin system brought into the world, more importantly than the cryptocurrency, is a new kind of recordkeeping.Whenever people need to know whether or not something happened\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone depositing money in a bank account, changing the title of a house, or voting in an election\u200a\u2014\u200awe set up institutions to guarantee that it happened. For important transactions, we have multiple layers of authority to make those guarantees. We have the Fed, credit agencies, the passport office, the DMV, notaries public, government licensing and regulatory bodies\u200a\u2014\u200amany, many institutions whose purpose it is to know what happened.Blockchain technology can be used to make those guarantees automatically, by distributing a shared, verified public record to as many people as are interested in seeing that record. Anyone interested can join a computer network and download the record. Each new set of entries to the record\u200a\u2014\u200aeach block\u200a\u2014\u200ais added by all the computers in the network, and then verified and timestamped. Because new information is added on block by block, no one can go back and alter what has already happened. The record is incorruptible.It\u2019s obvious why this sort of recordkeeping is valuable for journalism: it allows us to maintain archives that can\u2019t be censored or altered after the fact. We can amend previous records only through addenda, in other words: not through erasure. This is the first benefit of blockchain technology to the free press, and this benefit alone makes it worth moving our news media into blockchain-based publishing systems. But there is more.Our media have grown dangerously vulnerable to tampering in the Internet age. The vuvuzela of propaganda drowns out the work of real journalists. Platform companies like Facebook and Google take advertising money for showing you news stories they did not pay to produce. They\u2019re not journalists, and they have failed, catastrophically, and are still failing, to understand the importance of impartial media in a free society. Mark Zuckerberg claimed that it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to suggest that his company had affected the results of the 2016 U.S. election. At the moment he spoke these words, his company\u2019s political ad sales pages were bragging about Facebook ads\u2019 power to affect elections, as they still do (\u201cinfluence online and offline outcomes through DR and video\u201d).There is no exaggerating the irresponsibility of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech titans, who somehow wound up being in charge of your information, who are accountable to nobody, and who have no earthly idea what they are doing.By creating an ad-free publishing economy on Civil\u2019s Ethereum-based platform, instead of on the traditional web, Popula is putting up a wall against tampering. Popula is accountable to its readers alone, and is impervious to the interests and agendas of advertisers or other intermediaries or \u201cinfluencers\u201d of any kind. Readers, and readers alone, provide our community, our platform, and the funding for our journalism.In addition to this, Popula\u2019s readers and their interactions with the publication will be part of a larger, novel experiment in cryptoeconomics. This sounds scary, but I promise you, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s useful and fun.Consider Internet comments. At the moment, you can\u2019t be sure whether a Facebook comment on your feed came from a bot paid for by some Dr. Evil freak billionaire, a Russian troll farm, or your cousin\u2019s friend from work. Some hidden percentage of what you are seeing online is not commentary from real people, but bought-and-paid-for, computer-generated propaganda.Now imagine for a moment that commenting on a news story wasn\u2019t free to every Tom, Dick and Yuri, but was instead a privilege that comes only with a paid subscription to a responsible publication. It would be worth paying something to know that the comments are real, right?Commenters can earn tips on the Civil platform, so there will be a point to being smart and careful about what you write. Imagine adding information to a news story you\u2019re interested in, and not just getting thumbs up or \u2018likes\u2019 for it, but getting paid for it. Same with comments: make a comment that others find interesting, and your subscriber account can be credited with microtips that will accrue for as long as they continue to read and value your contribution. And, when someone comments, the microtipping system forwards a portion of every tip to all subscribers, meaning that all subscribers benefit from an active network.By the time the stories of November 2016 are told in full, from Cambridge Analytica to the truth about the mass dissemination of propaganda on social media, I believe it will be even more obvious that the free press in America is in a state of crisis.If we want information that is true to the best of our ability to report it, unaffected by commercial or political interests, we need to remove the influence of advertisers or sponsors on editorial concerns. Money never comes without strings. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t allow anyone but our readers to pay the bills.On Civil\u2019s Ethereum-based platform, we can make very nearly certain that only individual readers are paying for our work: Blockchain technology is as valuable for the hidden tampering it forbids, as for the verifiable gathering and dissemination of information it permits.

Sponsoring an event is a great way of acquiring new clients, building a corporate reputation and increasing brand\u2019s visibility.Choosing the right sponsorship opportunityWhat should a potential sponsor look for in a sponsorship deal and how should it decide what to sponsor? Intelligent sponsorship involves much more than placing a sponsor\u2019s logo on a T-shirt or event program. A sponsorship partnership involves identifying a shared set of objectives, and leveraging a set of additional benefits from the relationship. There are several issues\u200a\u2014\u200aboth legal and commercial\u200a\u2014\u200ato consider before entering into a sponsorship deal. On a business level, the main issue is whether a sponsorship proposal represents good value for its financial cost. Since sponsorship is a business arrangement, standard evaluative criteria can be used to determine the suitability of a proposed sponsorship.Sponsorship is not an act of charity, and should show some form of positive return on investment. Before getting involved in a sponsorship deal, a sponsor should be confident that the sponsee will be successful, has a proven track record, good prospects and is generally aligned with the sponsor\u2019s brand and business objectives. A sponsorship arrangement should be considered an extension of a company\u2019s overall marketing strategy. Thus, there should be a clear link between a sponsor\u2019s own target market and the sponsee\u2019s consumers or audience.Sponsy was conceived with a heavy use of blockchain. Both brands-sponsors and companies willing to get financed, are obligated to provide us with their financial information derived from audit, which is always to remain in secret thanks to use of encryption and decentralization. At the same time, smart contracts will allow people who might get interested in sponsoring or, on the other hand, in getting sponsored, to receive information about potential partner and his financial results.We provide a way for sponsors and events to peek into both parties\u2019 financial details to see whether this deal would make sense at all.Today, a company looking for sponsorable properties with which to identify its products and services has a myriad of choices. In theory, almost anything can be sponsored, as long as it is capable of promotion. Regretfully, today\u2019s sponsorship agencies prefer to deal with primary and well-known sponsorship opportunities, like sports events, musical fairs etc. Practically speaking, since promotion is often connected to media, a useful sponsorable product may be one that is likely to attract media coverage. A sponsor should also consider whether the sponsee is already well serviced by other major sponsors. If so, the addition of a new sponsor may not attract the same degree of publicity and the costs may be higher.Smart Discovery System, which is being developed by Sponsy, allows for scanning online-space in order to discover older references to some brand or organization. This provides sponsors with an opportunity to instantly respond to emerging information and evaluate aspects and challenges.Moreover, all the previously signed deals with sponsors, which were completed with the help of our platform, are forever to stay in blockchain. This enables our future clients to quickly assess previous sponsors\u2019 experience, read the never-deleted reviews, created by them, and make a final decision.Existence of articulation between sponsor and\u00a0sponseeArticulation of the nature of the event and sponsor relationship was shown to be effective in making consumers to form strong memories regarding branded content.There was an experiment trying to figure out whether each sponsored event leave the same impression on visitors / future sponsor\u2019s consumers. The results of the experiment strongly supported the value of congruency and of articulating a relationship between a sponsor and an event. It means that events and brands should be selected carefully based on their unique characteristics and features. That is the point usually overlooked in traditional sponsorship deal but taken into consideration at Sponsy.End-consumers are literally the only people to be able to provide brands and events with truly independent and robust assessment of their potential interactions. After all, these end-consumers are the very people called target audience, which is a holy grail of any sponsorship endeavor.Evaluation of potential sponsorship deal way before it occurs allows both brands and sponsored organizations to explore the feasibility of an idea and refrain from non-performing ideas, saving time and money.Sponsy solves this problem by offering a possibility for our token holders to vote for future events and sponsorships. Token holders will be able to make money in case their opinions prove to be correct. All the voters sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).Event sponsorship is not a commodity. It is an important investment, which requires work and dedication from both the event manager and the\u00a0sponsor.Sponsy\u2019s decentralized network of core specialists in sponsorship marketing will help brands and sponsored parties to craft a truly unique and unrepeatable branding experience.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "BitNautic Sails To Dubai\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Futurama Blockchain Innovators Summit", "author_name": "BitNautic", "link": "https://medium.com/bitnautic/bitnautic-sails-to-dubai-the-futurama-blockchain-innovators-summit-ca1370cd1bd4?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 9, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "322", "content": "BitNautic Sails To Dubai\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Futurama Blockchain Innovators SummitBitNauticBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 9, 2018Another prestigious invitation for the BitNautic Team, that last night has traveled 6000 Km to showcase our project in Dubai, one of the world\u2019s top centers for Startup and ICO investing.The event, held in partnership with Coinsbank, leader company in the crypto exchange sector, will span four days from the 3rd to the 6th of May, and will be hosted at the Meydan Hotel, a five star wonder in the heart of Dubai.The program will include networking dinners, sunset trips in the desert, private meetings with investors and conferences from the most prominent experts in the ICO and crypto sector, with names like Brock Pierce and Miko Matsumura among the speakers.

(http://www.nrcc.net.cn)We are excited to announce that under the guidance of DNV GL, VeChain has signed an exclusive strategic partnership agreement with NRCC to develop and implement blockchain related solutions across their business network.One of the partnership\u2019s focus is to develop solutions for China\u2019s tobacco industry via their partnerships with the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration and the China National Tobacco Corporation.VeChain will be providing proof of origin and anti-counterfeit technology to track Chinese produced tobacco products throughout the entire supply chain. This partnership came into place as China announced a crackdown on smuggled counterfeit cigarettes.The other focus of this partnership is more long term strategic and significantly more disruptive. The current model of tobacco product distribution includes manufacturers, distributors, retailers and end users.VeChain will work with tobacco regulatory bodies and manufacturers to create specific blockchain+IoT solutions to collect end user data so that manufacturers can utilize the data collected to management internal supply chain more effectively and to develop products which are more fitting to end users\u2019 likings. This disruption can save increase transparency for regulators, save manufacturer costs, increase revenue, and eventually eliminate layers of distribution bottleneck.China\u2019s tobacco market accounts for roughly 30% of the world\u2019s total consumption of cigarettes and is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of tobacco products measured in revenue. In the first half of 2017, China sold 24,752,000 cases of cigarettes (a standard case in China is 250 cartons), in the amount of approximately producing 772.712 billion yuan in sales.About NRCCNRCC is among the most prestigious consulting companies across China.

Said another way, an oracle provides a connection between real world events and a blockchain. In my opinion, all of the really interesting complex smart contracts require outside information\u200a\u2014\u200afinancial derivatives, gambling, stablecoins, identity\u2026literally anything where you want to incorporate something happening in the real world. Turns out, transparently representing real-world events in precise digital terms is a challenge. To better conceptualize oracles, this post will build our intuition around why it\u2019s difficult to represent reality, digitally.Smart Contracts with Street-SmartsA smart contract is a digital agreement that enforces itself. The common example is a vending machine. You insert money and you can either (1) get your money back, or (2) acquire merchandise. Like a smart contract, vending machines are programmed once and then run forever.Smart contracts have many advantages. They\u2019re written in unambiguous computer code and are entirely self-contained. Unlike legal contracts, there is absolutely no need for an external authority to make decisions\u200a\u2014\u200asmart contracts are run by a group of equal peers. No judges, no juries, no mediators. However, smart contracts are very hard to write correctly, once written are irreversible, and their influence is limited to cyberspace.A smart contract is a way of making a deal by unambiguously specifying the parties and conditions involved. But what if some details about the past, present, or future are unknown? Like yesterday\u2019s exchange rate of BTC/USD (according to the top 5 exchanges)? Or whether your flight will land on time tomorrow? This is where oracles enter into the equation. Smart contracts need oracles to resolve details that cannot be precisely known at the time the contract is written.With an oracle, we can give our smart contracts street smarts. Like a vending machine that only dispenses hot chocolate if the oracle says the temperature dropped below freezing. Or a flight insurance agency that gives instant payouts if the oracle says that the flight was delayed by more than 30 minutes. By including a connection to real world events, smart contracts get much smarter.Truth is Subjective, Oracles Delegate SubjectivityOutside the very narrow domain of science, people typically perceive events as true relative to their model of the world:What\u2019s the temperature in Springfield, Massachusetts?According to which weather station(s)?How should the measurements be averaged and combined? Daily, hourly? Mean, median?Should one sensor be given more weight than the others if there\u2019s a disagreement?2. Did this building burn down?Insurance agency perspective: a building is considered incinerated only according to a very specific set of criteria\u200a\u2014\u200athey even train and deploy specialists to assess whether a fire passes their very high bar.Regular person perspective: your shit\u2019s burned down.3. What did Google say about Trump yesterday?Google shows its users different results based on their location, browsing history, interests, etc.There\u2019s no way to verify this claim retroactively without time-traveling to yesterday, so we need a way of recording search results beyond a shadow of a doubt.In general, you can think of an oracle as a \u201chuman\u201d that a smart contract can ask for a subjective interpretation of an event. The oracle problem resides here: how do we resolve subjective events in a provable, consistent, transparent, and minimally trusted way?Metaphors for\u00a0Oracles1. A Whiteboard for DecisionsThe beauty of blockchain technology is that it forces everybody to work in the open. We take a whiteboard, we take turns writing something on the whiteboard, and everybody can see what we\u2019ve written. For example, anyone can download the Bitcoin \u201cwhiteboard\u201d, pick a wallet address, and examine every interaction involving that wallet.Whether taking a class, explaining an idea to coworkers, or working through a problem\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019ve probably relied on a whiteboard to share thought processes and decisions. A coworker will not only supply a final decision but also draw out their decision process on a whiteboard (or something similar).When a smart contract is placed on the Ethereum \u201cwhiteboard\u201d, it is completely visible to all parties of the deal. There\u2019s no ambiguity about how the contract will operate\u2014except when important events aren\u2019t known.In a smart contract, decisions about these details are specified via an oracle. In order to be blockchain compliant, this service must describe its work. Where did the data come from? How was the data processed?In the case of temperature, you might make your decision by specifying the following details: which weather sensors, which averaging function, and what temperature format. The point is to detail as much of the decision process as possible. Next, when the event occurs everything involving this decision would be written on the whiteboard by the oracle service for all to see and (cryptographically) verify.When asking an oracle a question about the world, you must be specific about your perspective. In return, the oracle will show its steps and have accountability.2. A Judicial Court for InformationLong before computers, our society invented a way to make all contracts smart: allow users to appeal to some Authority (court, king, mob boss,\u00a0\u2026) who would settle the matter with finality. If the Authority were \u201cjust\u201d, then there was little reason to escalate a dispute to the Authority. Anyone who knew they\u2019d lose, wouldn\u2019t bother trying. For example, the merchant revolution of the middle ages was made possible by the development of merchant courts as an Authority\u2014 effectively, trusted oracles that allowed traders to enforce agreements privately.In a smart contract, when you specify an oracle, you are choosing a \u2018court\u2019 that will decide how your data is interpreted and what it means in the context of your contract. If this is a smart contract for an insurance agency, then its oracle \u2018information court\u2019 will try to resolve the question \u2018did the house burn down?\u2019 according to the agency\u2019s definition.The traditional contracting system is, of course, quite expensive. A paper contract requires courts to interpret contracts and resolve disputes. These courts require all sorts of external enforcement\u200a\u2014\u200awardens, police, judges, and attorneys. This enforcement requires taxes, which imply a whole other set of rules, means of enforcement, and government infrastructure. And so on across all aspects of our society. At these scales, significant corruption is inevitable.Just like the middle ages, these information courts, or \u201coracles\u201d, have the potential to reduce much of the wasted work around enforcing traditional paper contracts.3. A Padlock Securing the Real and\u00a0DigitalTo arrive at a \u201cresult,\u201d raw data often needs to be aggregated, filtered, combined, and made consistent according to some model of the world. These are processes too expensive to occur on the blockchain, so they should be performed off-chain and secured with a cryptographic padlock.For example, let\u2019s say we want to know yesterday\u2019s temperature. How can an oracle prove \u201cwhat was yesterday\u2019s temperature?\u201d to others without time-traveling? Somehow, oracles must return an acceptable padlock that ties these details down in a way that can\u2019t be forged or fabricated. There\u2019s no single way to do this, and it\u2019s an area of ongoing research.We do know that the padlock must be cryptographic in its nature. The lock should specify everything that goes into the final result as precisely as possible. If a random person wants to know what happened and why, they should be able to run and explore every detail of of the oracle\u2019s decision on their computer\u200a\u2014\u200awithout recourse to anything like a discussion with the author.4. Institutions with Skin in the\u00a0GameMost infrastructure we use today implicitly trusts a sprawling stack of institutions that don\u2019t suffer risk from their own failure. These institutions hide risks in ways that are impossible to discover until it is too late. The 2008 bailouts of the ratings agencies and the banks, Equifax leaking 150 million social security numbers, and thousands more. Users have no recourse, and the institutions remain unharmed.One of the many asymmetries between users and institutions today.Unhappily for us peasants, bureaucracy is a construction by which an institution is conveniently separated from the consequences of its actions. But there\u2019s potential for blockchain-based institutions to reduce bureaucratic bloat by forcing everything to operate in a completely transparent, untrustworthy, and anonymous environment. As digital technologies have reduced the barrier to entry for information creation and distribution, it has become extremely important to be able to authenticate information as originating from a known, trusted source.For oracles, this means we must make cheap talk expensive and force institutions to share in the risk of publishing bad information. Skin in the game means consequences when you are wrong as much as when you are right. Oracles try to do this today with some combination of staking money on their claims, building reputation over time, signing data, and, in worst-case scenarios, third-party arbitration. There\u2019s no single correct way to structure these interactions. Just like relationships in the real world, oracles will have differing codes of ethics that depend on commercial context.The idea of skin in the game comes down to this: if you give an opinion, and someone follows it, you are morally obligated to be exposed to its consequences. This localizes risk and makes the relationship more robust to failure. Exposing both parties to similar risks keeps the system from rotting. An oracle should be expected to share in the consequences of its determinations\u200a\u2014\u200askin in the game is necessary for fairness, commercial efficiency, and risk management.Localizing our Future: Symmetric RelationshipsMetaphors aren\u2019t just the basis of our language\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re also how we conceptualize the world. They leave out the hairy details and give structure to our thoughts. I hope these metaphors\u200a\u2014\u200aa whiteboard, a court system, a padlock, and institutions with skin in the game\u200a\u2014\u200awill ground your understanding as you dive deeper into oracles.We all have a stake in the truth. Society functions on an assumption that people stake their reputation on their word. In this way, truth prevails over lying\u200a\u2014\u200aand, for the most part, it does. If it didn\u2019t, relationships would have a short shelf life and commerce would cease. All of us depend on truth because when honesty is lacking, we suffer, and society suffers. With improved tools for scaling trust and truth, we will do better.(Thanks to Nassim Nicholas Taleb for the Skin in the Game metaphor. A good deal of this post is inspired by his latest work.

But one recent political development in the United States could have disastrous effects for this emerging industry.All smiles at the\u00a0FCCThe FCC voted to repeal their enforcement of net neutrality by a 3\u20132 vote on Thursday. In 2014, the FCC ruled in favor of upholding net neutrality, but that\u2019s gone now.Net neutrality is the fair and equal workplace of the internet. You know how parents aren\u2019t supposed to pick favorites? Without net neutrality, the internet could become the equivalent of Mom taking Becky to a movie while Brian stays home and cleans the toilets\u200a\u2014\u200aif there\u2019s even a toilet left to clean. Net neutrality ensures that service providers\u200a\u2014\u200ayou know, the ones you pay every month and curse when your videos are buffering\u200a\u2014\u200acan\u2019t charge differently for different internet data.In a simple sense, net neutrality stops companies from slowing down or blocking access to competing sites. What keeps AT&T from creating their own video streaming platform and then slowing or blocking access to YouTube in order to stifle competition? And despite FCC Chairmen Ajit Pai\u2019s patronizing assurances, this isn\u2019t a hypothetical; ISPs (service providers) have a history of doing this. In 2005, Comcast slowed speeds (throttling) to certain file sharing and torrent sites. In 2014, Verizon blocked access to Google Wallet to encourage users to use Verizon\u2019s own Isis Wallet. And while a name change certainly would have been a better business decision, the fact remains: without net neutrality, the internet is not a free place. Today, the internet is not a luxury, it is a basic human right. No one can legally deny people equal access to water. Critics respond that the free market will ensure that ISPs don\u2019t do this\u200a\u2014\u200ausers will object and move to a different ISP.Nothing is more assuring than Ajit Pai in a Santa suit.The question then is, is it truly a free market? This assumes that the internet is an open and fair market. In reality, 51% of Americans only have one ISP to choose from. For the remaining 49% of Americans, what prevents the competing companies from internet throttling and removing choice altogether? There is nothing keeping ISPs from providing substandard internet to certain competitor\u2019s sites, censoring information, and forcing people to pay expensive rates for their favorite sites. Portugal is already doing this:In Portugal, you pay according to which sites you want access\u00a0toWhat this means for BlockchainThere is nothing more anti-decentralized than having only one internet provider. With no level playing field, the very fabric of the internet startup and community corrodes.\u201cISPs could potentially have the power to control access to exchanges, the speed of transactions, and even create and prioritize accessibility to their own cryptocurrencies, which is not such a crazy idea when you think of all the places in this country where a single ISP has a monopoly,\u201d Justin Tabb, CEO of internet startup Substratum Network, told International Business\u00a0Times.To accomplish this would not be difficult. Most cryptocurrency transactions occur via exchanges and ISPs could target exchanges, slowing them down or banning them altogether. Assuming cryptocurrencies continue their historic rise, ISPs investing in or developing exchanges could limit access to their competition. They could also throttle connections to blockchain websites and the user interface of the blockchain applications. Slowing down the API that the user interacts with would effectively slow the entire application. It doesn\u2019t matter how fast and smooth Candy Crush runs if the entire App Store is unusable. The incentive to do this is there, especially to websites like Substratem and others that work towards decentralizing the internet and removing censorship ability.Decentralized cloud computing and storage companies like Golem and iExec rely on the cloud to coordinate. A slower internet connection for the network users would result in dramatically less productive ecosystems\u200a\u2014\u200aa potential benefit for their cloud competitors: Google and Apple. Blockchain will disrupt industries; the more power we give to those industries, the more difficult the adoption battle will be for blockchain.Potential UpsidesNet neutrality could push adoption of blockchain as an alternative to ISP monopolies. Ethereum and other blockchain networks could enable on a large scale, a mesh network. Mesh networks are essentially decentralized ISPs, where users connect directly to each other and enable an internet network. Ethereum and other blockchain platforms are perfect for enabling a mesh network and sidestepping ISPs. Blockchain\u2019s main use cases revolve around disrupting centralized corporations such as banks and financial institutions; net neutrality demonstrates that ISPs are yet another important target for disruption. It also demonstrates that blockchain companies should look for a way to engage and cooperate with governments on this topic. As Mohamed Abedelmalik, Executive Director of the Columbia Blockchain Lab said, \u201cI see [net neutrality] as a clear sign for [the need for] new disruptive technology to work closely with regulators to insure the easiest path to success. The recent issue of net neutrality shows how regulatory agencies can act in ways that are completely at odds with public opinion. It\u2019s slightly na\u00efve for developers of blockchain products to think that a grassroots movement is immune to the influence of government.\u201dConclusionThe net neutrality battle may have been lost for now, but the war certainly has not. And if there\u2019s one thing that this development signifies, it is that the need for decentralization is now more relevant than ever. The road will be rough, the obstacles large, the resistance intense. But the world needs decentralization. People need decentralization. People need to be empowered again and feel that they have a voice in a system that today ignores them. People need to feel that they have power to protect themselves, their assets, and their future from corporations and from governments who enable said corporations. People need blockchain and cryptocurrency. Net neutrality should be our wakeup call.", "responses": "9"}, {"title": "The Ghost Advisors of the Blockchain", "author_name": "Fieldcoin", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/the-ghost-advisors-of-the-blockchain-7d6552951a91?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 20, 2018", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "5.6K", "content": "The Ghost Advisors of the BlockchainOr a guide for management teams on how to choose your\u00a0advisorsFieldcoinBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 20, 2018Six months before Mr X. was barely known, he might not even know about the Blockchain. And now he is proudly broadcasted in major rating websites as one of the top ten best advisor of the sector. He is one of the ghost advisors of the Blockchain\u2026 They work for private multinational companies as employees or middle managers, more than 10 hours per day, they are often family men with many kids, and end up as advisors of more than 30 projects in less than 3 months (one might ask where they find the time). With credential related to their new positions, they are asking high upfront and percentages on ICOs. But, once you have dealt with them and send them your tokens\u2026 You will hardly heard of them (or just when it is time to cash in).This is the new obscur face of the Blockchain. A new kind of financial vampires who is only here to suck the workforce of ICO team members and benefits of token holders. They have no genuine passion or vocation for the Blockchain technology and this amazing paradigm shift. With no real experience as CEO or real operational job in the Blockchain, they nonetheless, position themselves as the utmost experts.For the last 3 years, Initial Coin Offerings has set up a new kind of company financing for companies using the Blockchain Technology. The technology application is still at an early stage, and changes occur at fast pace. The need for advisors to guide in each development section of the project has become vital for a project to succeed.Surfing on this wave, a new kind of opportunists people have emerged far from the legitimate and genuine advisors. Entrepreneurs entering the sector must really be aware of the new practices settled by some unscrupulous advisors asking for shockingly huge compensation schemes.In this context, it is sometimes difficult for CEOs and Blockchain project founders to find the right experts to assist and consult to develop the project. But there are solutions. And bear in mind that it is not the \u201cbest\u201d advisor meaning the one with the most hyped reputation that will push your ICO to the next level, but the hard working and committed person that loves your project. I have being talking with many CEOs and experts as have been confronted with those Ghost Advisors over the last year. Here are few hints that will avoid traps and save you time.If you are a CEO like I do and you get propositions from those people (and trust me if you have a legitimate project with growing reputation, they will come to you to propose their services). Hiring those persons is the worse things an Entrepreneur may do. They will suck the ressources needed to develop your project without tangible worked done in exchange. At Fieldcoin, in collaboration with our CLO and the management team we have seen this from the early beginnings. In order to avoid the traps, we have put a series of safeguards to protect the project and get the most of our Advisory team.Signs that you are in front of a ghost\u00a0advisorHigh percentages of the ICO allocated to Advisors Some CEO\u2019s are tempted to allocate high percentages of the ICO to Advisors. If you see an ICO with more than 3% allocated to its advisors it is one of the sign you may be in front of a weak ICO who push for a marketing hype rather than implementing its project. Advisors are not team member, they should be paid correctly but in any case should never work regularly and many hours for the project. High compensation for advisors is a red flag.Bulk messages. the person only send you pre-formatted messages with in bulk messages stating the scope service which is not adapted to your project or your need, followed by upfront and high percentage compensation scheme.Acts only as an intermediary. He won\u2019t participate in any event with you and you will never see this person physically, not even on a skype call. He will call some friends to pretend they will do some work for you and the ghost advisor we ultimately take credits once the ICO is over and successful.The person want you to sign his contract. The person has already made model of contracts that will give him full freedom to do what he wants, so far as to steal information from your project and sell it to another ICO.Ask a series of simple questions to the Advisor. Usually if the Advisor is not willing to work for you, he or she will not answer your messages asking for an interview or answering your questions about the project. They are more interesting in a marketing hype, in the upfront and to sell once the tokens have hit the exchange rather than hold and follow the project.Provide a contract with a release of the tokens on the long run, a part before and after the ICO on a monthly basis. Make an obligation for the Advisor to keep his token for a certain period after the ICO.Avoid by any means upfront payments. This is also one of the worst thing you would do as a Entrepreneur on the Blockchain. The upfront has to reflect a certain cost. They should not be given without a real need behind such as financing a meet-up or a marketing campaign. Advisors only in rare cases should pay for those. The CEO is in charge of paying the bills.Make a clear scope of work/services even on hourly basis. In order to clarify things, especially if you need an Advisor just for few hours, it can be better to put it in writing on the agreement. It is also a relief for the Advisor who won\u2019t have to justify more than the hours he has agreed on.Choose someone with a real experience inside a project. Do not hire an advisor who hasn\u2019t worked before in a project at an operational or managerial level. It sounds obvious but too many so-called advertised top advisors haven\u2019t. Moreover, the person should have the specific skills that you need for your project.Obligations of results. One could also provide a high percentage to your Advisor in case the person has achieved outstanding results. This is the case for instance when an advisor has leveraged your ICO campaign by finding the right financial partners. In any cases, an advisor should be paid for his work. A good monitoring system based on time spent and tasks achieved reflecting the work done by the advisors should be implemented.Reactivity. One week for answering an email. When you have this kind of issue, it is a sign your Advisor might not be committed but not always. Because it could simply be that the person is overwhelmingly busy. This happens for the best people of the Blockchain. However, is it better to have someone with high reputation but not available or someone available and with less reputation? That\u2019s another question.If the person is advising more than 5 projects at the same time it is usually a red flag. Well, this also depends. If you have somebody working 15 hours a day with no other jobs than advising, the person could really do the job for 10 projects. This has to be reviewed case by case.And finally use common sense and intuition\u2026These people are far from the Blockchain spirit of decentralization, do not mix with them.Always keep in mind that even if legally speaking the use of ICO fundraising is not legally binding (you only have an obligation of mean and not results), it will however harm your reputation and the one of your organization at early stages if you not bind to some kind of rules regarding your Tokenomics.In fact, CEOs with good business manners and practices are accountable towards their token holders. They should spot those ghost advisors and in any case never use this system that might give a slight bump to their ICO but on the mid term and long term harm the project.Those Ghost Advisors are creating shadows around the most interesting projects investing in smart and productive workforce. As long as CEOs won\u2019t take a step towards a real accountability of their finances, the ghost advisor system could prevail. However, token holders due diligences are becoming more and more sharp and decision-makers will have to adapt accordingly.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "The Blockchain Effect: Network Effects without Market Power\u00a0Costs", "author_name": "Cathy Barrera, PhD", "link": "https://medium.com/mit-cryptoeconomics-lab/the-blockchain-effect-86bd01006ec2?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 29, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "2.5K", "content": "The Blockchain Effect: Network Effects without Market Power\u00a0CostsCathy Barrera, PhDBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 29, 2018The recently launched MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab is the first academic research initiative in the blockchain and crypto space bridging the fields of economics, computer science, and business.

For those who have not read it, please go have a look as it explains these \u201ctough sounding\u201d concepts in a very simplified manner.In this article, we will mainly talk about blockchains. I have taken references from some resources on the internet and rightfully mentioned them after the article. This is just my take on the explanation they have provided. Writing something I have learned helps me retain the knowledge longer and also helps me spread the knowledge to others who might not know about it\u00a0:)In the next article, we will set up our development environment in under a minute! [Available here]Darth VaderWe are 2 friends sitting in a park. You are Alice, I am Bob.I have a toy. You have none.I give the toy to you.Now you have a toy. I have none.Pretty Straightforward, right?I had a toy. I gave it to you. We did not need a third person to make the transfer for us. I can\u2019t give the toy to someone else because I don\u2019t have it anymore. Whereas you can give it to whomsoever you wish to. And they can give to whoever they want to and so on.Digital Darth\u00a0Vader!Now suppose I have a digital toy.I give you my digital toy.Wait.How do you know I didn\u2019t give the digital toy as an email attachment to Charlie first? Or I saved a million copies on my laptop and gave it to everyone on the internet?So, sending digital toys is not the same as giving physical toys.This problem is called the double-spending problem!But isn\u2019t the solution very\u00a0simple?We can maintain a ledger. Similar to what people at shops maintain. An account book, where all the transactions are recorded.So, there will be a ledger where all the transactions of digital toys will be recorded. Someone, say Danny will be in charge of it.Problem Solved, right?No.Because how do we know if Danny is not cheating and adding digital toys to his and his girlfriend\u2019s account anytime he wants?Also, why do we need to involve Danny in transactions that concern only you and me?Enters BlockChain!What if everyone had a copy of the accounting book on their computer and all the transactions that ever happen are recorded there.This is tough to beat. Now Danny can\u2019t add toys that he doesn\u2019t have to his account. Because then it wouldn\u2019t match with everyone else\u2019s book.Everyone who has a copy of the ledger on their system and maintains it by validating the transactions get digital toys as rewards. This is the way digital toys are ever produced.This is blockchain. And these toys that I was talking about are bitcoins or for that matter anything of value.The ledger is visible to everyone.Now we don\u2019t rely on a third person (Danny) to maintain our balances for us.We don\u2019t need to worry about the double spending problem.This is a very simplified story but if you understand this well, you know more about blockchains than many people in the industry.

Lexicon is capable of delivering more than 1.2 million transactions per second (TPS), fully decentralized and on-chain. Security firm Null Bash has conducted a third party verification of Ternio\u2019s Lexicon architecture and that report is available on our website. This article explains why it was necessary to build a solution of this scale and why this isn\u2019t the end result, but rather the beginning of something revolutionary. A summary is available by scrolling to the end of this article.Ternio sits at the apex of two industries\u200a\u2014\u200ablockchain and programmatic advertising. We have a unique perspective on how both industries function and the opportunity to educate the public on the nuances of each. At blockchain conferences, we find ourselves explaining the inefficiencies of the programmatic advertising market\u200a\u2014\u200aa lack of transparency, lengthy payment terms, and advertising fraud. When attending advertising conferences, we find ourselves going on about how blockchain will revolutionize the industry by solving these problems. By building a solution to solve problems in advertising, we inadvertently developed tech that can be applied in any industry.Ternio\u200a\u2014\u200aThe World\u2019s Fastest BlockchainWhat is Programmatic Advertising?Most people are familiar with digital advertising because it\u2019s how many websites fund their operation. What many don\u2019t know is that 70% of all digital advertising is bought and sold programmatically. Programmatic advertising is similar to high frequency trading on the stock market. When an advertiser like BMW wants to buy a banner ad on NY Daily News, they don\u2019t contact NY Daily News directly, but instead work through a series of middlemen and intermediaries.When a web user visits NY Daily News, they generate an ad impression. This impression is then \u201cspeed traded\u201d through 20\u201330 intermediaries who auction it the highest bidder and take a small cut to facilitate the trade. The impression ultimately reaches BMW who purchases the ad spot as the highest bidder. This process occurs in hundreds of milliseconds, behind the scenes, as not to disrupt the NY Daily News visitor.Analytics for NY Daily\u00a0NewsIf you look at the visitor statistics for New York Daily News you can see that over the course of one year approximately 1.2 billion page loads are generated. If each page has two ads then that\u2019s almost 5 billion ad queries for just one website. Consider that 10 intermediaries are in the buying and selling process on NY Daily News. Then multiply that by the number of websites that run advertising.It\u2019s easy to see how the amount of queries being generated quickly scale to obscene levels. In fact, programmatic advertising has more transactions than Visa and Mastercard, combined. This is why a high transaction per second is so important for programmatic advertising. It needs to support the immense queries per second being generated.What problem does blockchain solve?Well, quite a few:Lack of transparency\u200a\u2014\u200aBoth BMW and NY Daily News don\u2019t know how many middlemen are involved in the supply chain.This is a problem because approximately 50% of every dollar goes to middlemen.Ad Fraud\u200a\u2014\u200aAd fraud accounted for $18 billion of the $224 billion spent on advertising in 2017. Fraudsters thrive in the obscurity!Lengthy Payment Terms\u200a\u2014\u200aPublishers wait between 30 to 120 days to be paid and the average is 60 days. This means a publisher delivers an ad impression and isn\u2019t paid until two months later.We go into greater detail on the issues above on Ternio\u2019s youtube channel as well as the articles found on our homepage. However, the image below should provide an idea of the amount of companies operating in the digital ad space which leads to the inefficiency.The current state of companies in online advertising/marketingIs 1 Million TPS\u00a0Enough?Yes, to start! The biggest ad buying platforms currently generate 11 million QPS across their entire client base. The programmatic ad industry won\u2019t migrate 100% overnight to blockchain. Based on our conversations with the biggest ad agencies in the world, 1 million TPS will be more than sufficient to begin testing. However, we know that once they see the results, the shift will occur rapidly. That\u2019s why we\u2019re ready to go over 1 million TPS!Our blockchain solution has reached 1.2 million TPS in tests and is capable of scaling to more than 10 million (10x) TPS when required.Our blockchain solution has reached 1.2 million TPS in tests and is capable of scaling to more than 10 million (10x) TPS when required. We believe our highly scalable solution will revolutionize not only the multibillion dollar programmatic advertising industry, but also other industries\u200a\u2014\u200aenabling mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. Ternio is focused on the programmatic advertising industry for now. However, we\u2019re happy to support other leading companies with our scalable blockchain solution.Summary:Programmatic advertising generates a tremendous amount of QPS (queries per second) because each URL load generates multiple ad impressions. A URL with four ads on it would generate four unique ad impressions and thus four queries. Middlemen further inflate these queries by facilitating more calls that need to be routed. Ternio records every single query to the blockchain, which requires immense scale to record in a decentralized manner. Ternio\u2019s blockchain solution has reached 1.2 million TPS in tests and is capable of scaling to more than 10 million (10x) TPS if it is required. We believe our highly scalable solution will revolutionize not only the multibillion dollar programmatic advertising industry, but also other industries\u200a\u2014\u200abringing blockchain mainstream.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Can I order some Blockchain?", "author_name": "An\u0131l Akarsu", "link": "https://medium.com/commencis/can-i-order-some-blockchain-9f35450e24b7?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 20, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "1.6K", "content": "Can I order some Blockchain?Part 1: A Tale of Magical\u00a0BoxesAn\u0131l AkarsuBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 20, 2017The revolution will not be televised.While you enjoy the great song by the Fab Four, let me tell you something: The revolution will not be centralized either. Thanks to Blockchain technology which is a hot topic around the world these days, we are about to see many things we\u2019re accustomed to be changing or shape-shifting soon. Shopping, trading, transferring money, listening to music, voting and even getting married.However, does Blockchain really have the power and ability to change the whole world? The answer to this question is not that simple. Before finding an answer, I\u2019ll try to explain why we need this newish kid in town and how it gets things done.A Day In The\u00a0LifeWe make payments several times a day. We pay for the meals we eat, the songs we listen to, the series we watch, and even the money we send to someone else. If you\u2019re not paying with cash directly to the cafe or restaurant for the meals, to the artist for the song or to the director for the movie, there must be at least one intermediary involved in the transaction. And you know what we are exactly paying for? The trust they provide. However is it truly necessary to pay for this service?Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, answered this question with a bold No in his white paper, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.So Blockchain is the Bitcoin,\u00a0right?Blockchain is something much bigger, and more important than the Bitcoin itself. You can think of Blockchain as the internet and Bitcoin as the Arpanet. In the late 1960s, U.S. Department of Defense funded the invention of a single network, Arpanet, alowing multiple computers to communicate. This invention later evolved into WWW (World Wide Web) and there are millions of different applications of the internet technology now.Bitcoin was the first use case of Blockchain technology therefore telling the story of Bitcoin helps to explain how Blockchain works. Although there are many different versions and implementations of Blockchain technology out there, the tale I will tell below is how it was born and how it works in general today.A Chain of\u00a0Blocks?For those who know a little bit about Data Structures, a blockchain, which is the core structure of Blockchain technology, is a singly linked list with a slight variance in each block referring to another by a hash value rather than a pointer. (To learn more about Linked Lists and other data structures, please check this article by Alp Avanoglu.)The ones who are not really familiar with data structures and linked lists, just think of wooden boxes chained one by one. That\u2019s really what a blockchain is. The key question here is of course: what do these boxes hold inside them? Anything of value can be held. The decision is up to the developer. I told you there are many different implementations of Blockchain technology. While Bitcoin blockchain boxes hold transaction information between parties, Ethereum blockchain boxes hold smart contracts in addition to transactions. Your own blockchain box may hold anything you want. Perhaps it could hold your friends\u2019 names or the phone numbers of people calling you. Why do we keep these things inside these boxes? Because these boxes and the information inside them can not be changed or destroyed once they are added to the chain.So, a blockchain is an incorruptible and immutable digital ledger recording everything of value. Distribution of this ledger among every network joiner makes it decentralized which means there is no central control unit on the chain. Every single unit has an equal voice and authority. Keeping this in mind, let\u2019s move on with the Tale of Magical Boxes.A Tale of Magical\u00a0BoxesOnce upon a time, there was a wizard called Satoshi and he decided to come up with a new way of transferring gold. He created an orange box and cast a magic spell to turn colorless boxes orange by carving a random number on them. He claimed that his box would be the first box of a special chain and anyone could extend it by adding another orange box. Besides being orange, every new box also must have included a small picture of the previous box and people\u2019s transfer requests written on a piece of paper. The first person packing these in a colorless box and then finding the random number to turn it orange would be awarded with a bag of gold.A guy named Anil from Satoshi\u2019s village, wanted to try this method to send some gold to his friend Mertcan and he let everyone holding the chain know about the transaction. Some chain holders didn\u2019t want to spend their time and energy to find the random number and they just checked if Anil had enough gold by skimming through the previous papers inside the boxes on the chain. As he had enough, they confirmed the transaction so the people willing to spend their time and energy on a box could include this transaction inside their boxes.Blue background people are just confirming the transaction while pink backgrounds are willing to enter the contest to find the random\u00a0number.Enthusiastic chain holders in the village collected transactions like these into a colorless box and they tried numbers one by one to find the magical random number that would turn their box orange. A guy named Alp was the quickest to do that and he found the number 12345. He quickly let the others know that he found the number and he passed the number along with his box. His box would not be added to the chain immediately as he had to convince majority of the chain holders that his number or box was not fake. When all the other chain holders were convinced that Alp has really worked and found the number, they added this box to their chains and start working on the new one.Convincing the other chain holders is easy as they will only try the number on the box Alp sends and see if it becomes orange or\u00a0not.ConclusionBy telling this tale, I wanted to show how Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology behind it works. Bitcoin and the majority of the other coins are working as Proof of Work systems which basically relies on proving you that have found the special number, just like Alp did in our tale. There are many other alternatives to this system (eg. Proof of Stake) and I will talk about them and their advantages in later parts of this article.I will also give some technical details by referring to this tale and I am sure it will help you understand why this chain and the boxes in it are impossible to change or destroy. For now, let\u2019s be happy for that Anil and Mertcan could made their transfer without any intermediaries and that Alp got his prize.Stay decentralized folks!", "responses": "13"}, {"title": "cryptoFi\u200a\u2014\u200aGet Paid in\u00a0Crypto", "author_name": "Gaurav Agrawal", "link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/cryptofi-get-paid-in-crypto-f51ef584423e?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 9", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "92", "content": "cryptoFi\u200a\u2014\u200aGet Paid in\u00a0CryptoBuild for freelancers and businesses.

It shows our confidence that we are creating value for our community of token holders and that we are in this for the long term,\u201d notes Miner One CEO Pranas Slusnys.The listing of Miner One\u2019s MIO token on a major centralised exchange has been hotly anticipated since late spring, when the crowdfunded cryptocurrency mining operation finished its ICO. Miner One raised about US $4.5 million to build a cryptocurrency mining centre and distribute profits to MIO token holders.Miner One began mining bitcoin and made its first payouts to MIO holders in August of this year. The company is currently operating at just under 20% of full initial capacity and is awaiting news on availability and pricing of next generation (7nm) ASIC miners before ordering and deploying a larger, second batch of miners. This second batch will bring Miner One operations to full initial capacity. After that, a portion of profits are to be used for ongoing equipment upgrades to keep Miner One profitable.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the environment has been a challenging one. The support and advice of our community has been vital. We can all be proud that, even in such challenging conditions, we have delivered on our commitments, including a listing on a major centralised crypto exchange, and are generating a modest profit for MIO holders as we await a crypto rebound,\u201d says Slusnys.LATOKEN is a rapidly growing crypto exchange and tokenization platform focusing on providing liquidity for new tokens and asset classes, with:\u25cf US$35m in daily turnover\u25cf 85,000 registered traders\u25cf 90+ crypto pairs available for trading\u00a0Besides crypto trading, LATOKEN users can participate in selected token sales at pre-sale and crowdsale stages.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Sia Community Update\u200a\u2014\u200aApril\u00a02019", "author_name": "Steve", "link": "https://blog.sia.tech/sia-community-update-april-2019-f683812b4245?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 7", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "168", "content": "Sia Community Update\u200a\u2014\u200aApril\u00a02019SteveBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 7It\u2019s hard to say the last two months have been anything short of exciting. We released one of our most important updates ever. We\u2019re making progress on our next big move. And we\u2019ve never had better ways to get help.Sia will be changing over the year. You\u2019ll see new team members, new features, and a bigger community. The network will become more robust and flexible, and be able to do more things than ever.What won\u2019t change is our commitment to you, and to ourselves.

It included a large number of updates, notably: file snapshot backups, eliminating any single point of failure; scalability improvements over 5 TB; and a completely redesigned UI.This release also includes a number of updates that position Sia well for big improvements in the coming year. The rest of 2019 will bring good things for the network, and you can use these resources to learn more about 1.4.0 and get ready.Community contributor tbenz9 wrote about the update.Sia dev Eddie wrote up a guide to get started with Draco.I updated our support center with over a dozen new and updated articles on 1.4.0, and created a new Sia User Guide section to guide you through getting started. We also have a snazzy looking video to introduce Draco to the world.Updates from\u00a0the\u2026Over the past two months, 78 issues were closed and 127 pieces of code were added to the core codebase.

Ask anyone that requires you to enter their email before sending a connection request on LinkedIn. The haters say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t message strangers on LinkedIn\u201d and \u201cI get so many messages from people selling me something\u201d and \u201cLinkedIn isn\u2019t for that.\u201dI\u2019m here to tell you that the haters are wrong. I\u2019m only one person, but I\u2019ve sent messages to over 3,000 people on LinkedIn to start my business. Wouldn\u2019t you know it, some of them actually responded. The first time 3% responded and the read-rate rivaled that of late 90s email (in the 90-percentile).LinkedIn Messaging has also led me to land a client in the Fortune 10, but that\u2019s a different story.How LinkedIn Has Helped Transform My\u00a0BusinessOver LinkedIn, especially thanks to the direct messaging feature, I\u2019ve built a business that is on pace to become 6-figures within the 2nd year. Besides the one childhood friend that connected me to the founders of Buying.com, I have built my entire career in blockchain over the last year and a half through LinkedIn and Medium. (Special thank you to Medium and Medium Staff).You need to be on LinkedIn. You should be reaching out to people over it, even if it\u2019s just a quick question to an opinion leader in your field. Put yourself on the radar. However, you should not be spamming people on it. Think of LinkedIn as a platform that promotes and encourages content that is valuable, reliable, and genuine. What you give to LinkedIn, it will be reciprocated. But that\u2019s not really why I\u2019m writing to you to encourage you to get on it. My reason is much more simple than that, actually.Photo by NeONBRAND on\u00a0UnsplashLinkedIn is Seriously UndervaluedIf you aren\u2019t spending time on LinkedIn every single day, especially if you\u2019re in an emerging tech industry (even if it\u2019s just for emerging news and information), you need to do yourself a favor. You need to get on there while it\u2019s still undervalued and under-utilized. Here\u2019s the thing. Unlike platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, LinkedIn\u2019s growth rate is not flattening.If you like what you read, please subscribe to my blog to get the latest updates.It\u2019s a HOT platform if you\u2019re in some emerging industries, such as the following (broken down by the number of users in the industry on the platform as made available by the search result):Blockchain: 356,002Enterprise Cloud: 36,500Machine Learning: 1.1MThese numbers and industries are continually growing.Reasons why LinkedIn is crushing it right\u00a0nowThe social platform is actually the total opposite of how someone might approach, for example, Facebook. I scrutinize every Facebook request I get. LinkedIn on the other hand, I\u2019m much less selective (as long as you seem like you\u2019re in Blockchain, Crypto, Digital Assets, Tech and Information Services, I\u2019ll probably add you). People are generally more accepting to new requests. My requests per day and follows are much higher on LinkedIn compared to Facebook (I\u2019m at 8.3K LinkedIn Followers).LinkedIn is also a gem because it connects industries that aren\u2019t closely connected geographically. American tech has Silicon Valley and Austin. But what about Blockchain? Of course, we have Malta and other havens like Estonia and Berlin, but they aren\u2019t as influential and representative of the entire blockchain community yet.LinkedIn Brings Together an Otherwise Siloed\u00a0IndustryThe thing about my industry, Blockchain, is that it\u2019s very siloed. Developers want to work from home. Freelancers want to be digital nomads. CEOs are splitting time between companies, sometimes roles are in 2 different countries. LinkedIn is an easy way for all of these isolated groups to connect, and to stay connected with local gatekeepers and community leaders.The inter-connectedness allows people to reach out to opinion leaders and see what they are posting about or sharing. It\u2019s also a sneaky way to understand more about the target segments that I work with.An Unconsidered Factor that Will Allow LinkedIn to Continually GrowThe global rise of freelancing is expected to rise in the coming decade. In countries like the USA, in which it\u2019s expected to reach as high as 57%* within 10 years, freelancing will become a serious supplementary or full-time income. It\u2019s the natural progression of the gig economy.I\u2019d even encourage LinkedIn to cater to this user base more, going as far as to create a payment mechanism that beats UpWork\u2019s high transaction rate, and allows freelancers to complete work and/ or payment all in one place.If you like what you read, please subscribe to my blog to get the latest updates.*57% of all workers are expected to have at least some exposure to freelancing by 2027.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "AMA with Mike Chen, Founder of STP\u00a0Network", "author_name": "Standard Tokenization Protocol", "link": "https://medium.com/@StandardTokenizationProtocol/ama-with-mike-chen-founder-of-stp-network-d2b2b26c4e3c?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 9", "readtime": "11 min read", "upvotes": "161", "content": "AMA with Mike Chen, Founder of STP\u00a0NetworkStandard Tokenization ProtocolBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 9Standard Tokenization Protocol\u2019s STP-Standard is an open-source standard that defines how tokenized assets are generated, issued, sent, and received while complying with all necessary regulations. The protocol allows assets of all kinds to be tokenized in a way that makes them fully compliant across jurisdictions and transferable across any ERC20 platform.Tokens built on top of the STP-Standard will use the protocol\u2019s on-chain Compliance Validator to verify compliance with relevant regulations (i.e. KYC, AML, Accreditation, etc.) as well as any issuer-specific requirements (i.e. ownership concentration, holding periods, voting). The Validator Committee will serve an advisory function to ensure the Compliance Validator is enforcing the most up-to-date legislation at all times.Exchange Listing/\u00a0IEOHave you decided which exchange will do your IEO? Is there any specific timeline for IEO listing?We are actively talking with all the exchanges. We are planning to do an IEO on at least two platforms: a main IEO place plus few light IEO locations like Bitmax and Huobi, which cover different regions to ensure maximum momentum. Late May will be our target timeline for IEO.Which exchanges have the highest chance?Huobi, OKex, Upbit, BitmaxInvestmentRegarding various rounds of funding: Can you shed some light on previous rounds, Seed, earlier round and future round prices. Also, on current status of project how advanced is the project and what is your next 100 days goals for project.We did an equity raise ~$1m a few months ago. FBG and Draper are our major equity holders. For equity holders, they will get some tokens but none of them are liquid for the next 3 years. And for tokens, we did two rounds, we closed $5m at 1 cent for Round 1 two weeks ago and we are doing another $2m at 2 cents, which is halfway through. For our next 100 days, we will focus on two things: 1) listing / liquidity for STP holders, and 2) integrate STP into our business i.e. launch our mobile appWhat is the current vesting for private investors and how likely is it to change in the near future?For Round 1, 50% unlocks initially and the rest will be unlocked over a year. For round 2, 50% will be unlocked faster than Round 1 in initial unlocking period. Currently we are working with exchanges to finalize terms for IEO. Definitely we will balance both the interests of community investors and IEO platforms.I heard that you guys have sold tokens at the effective price of $0.005 including bonus or discount. Is that true?This is not true. the lowest price is 0.01 cents. They are definitely scammers. Ask them to show their SAFT.How much are you planning to raise in total? What is the total hard cap?We raised $6m so far. Hard cap will be $8m or $9m depending on how much we raise in the IEO.1c and 2c are 100% difference, any idea why such a big discount for the first group of investors?To be honest, we didn\u2019t plan the 2 cents round. The first round was the only round planned and we made it community focused. The distribution is wide, so we capped each party at $100k. Average allocation for this round is very small. So, some VC saw this, and request bigger ticket sizes. They were willing to pay double the price, so we closed $1m in 1 cents and sold to most VC at 2 cents. NGC and BlockVC are leading the 2 cents round and committed half each. So the 2 cents round is more like a VC round, $40m network valuation is still cheap, and they can pay more in price for the large ticket size.What is the discount you offered to Big VCs? Being prominent VC why would they want to buy at 2c?No discount because they can\u2019t put large amount in the 1 cent round.Will you change the lockup time and % if the exchange host STP IEO asks?There is always a balance between community and exchanges interests. Most exchanges only care their own interest for IEO. We will not sacrifice community interest for small exchanges with no good return guarantee.Project Fundamental / Logic / TokenmatrixWhy should I choose STP over another project right now? There are plenty of projects raising and trying to IEO now.I think we are very special. At the protocol level, we may have a similar concept competitor. But we have been working with our core issuance business for a while. And our global footprint will enable us to take a more aggressive approach than them in business and customer acquisition. We are not newly formed team just want to take the ride of IEO and make quick bucks. Compared other IEO team, check our global footprint, we have 25 employees in China Korea and US, Moreover, we have running business in crypto for 2 year +. Our track record also speaks for us.Who do you see as the biggest competitor and what is your advantage compared to them?At the protocol level, our competitors may be Polymath, Harbor, however, we already have a strong business which will lead technology adoption. We are a business-driven protocol, which means we are more like Binance. They have users, a business model, and traffic first, then they built Binance chain. So once the Binance chain launched, it has lots of users and transactions from day one. On the other hand, there are so many tech driven public chains, that no one uses them even after the mainnet launches. I strongly believe Business success will lead technology adoption.If ICO x uses STP for their tokenization, would we expect STP token transaction between STP and ICO x rather than ETH/BTC/USDT?It\u2019s a good question, a project that uses STP tokenization service can still choose the currency they want to raise their capital in. STP can be part of the contribution method. Moreover, STP will have token economics that include refunding insurance, buying qualifications, etc. around it. Those use cases will consume a lot of STP tokens.Can STP be used for IEOs on other exchanges?Yes, you can think of STP itself as a launchpad and we will work with top exchanges like BitMax to ensure post-issuance liquidity.How soon will STP be ready to offer tokenization services?We are ready right away, but right now our team is focused on IEO and liquidity. We will start to offer tokenization as a service after our listing.STP will refer to regulated token offerings, meaning the tokenization of traditional assets to enable certain previously impossible features. Would you please elaborate more?Yes, tokenized security will be our US team mainly focus. We will launch a compliant token service platform like Coinlist or bitcoin suisse in US. And we want to bring more traditional assets from wall street to token community.STP Whitepaper says it\u2019s too offering asset management services. Will it be different than UltrAlpha\u00a0?Yes, we will be more passive side and UAT will focus more on the trading sideWhat are all the use cases that you are targeting on in your initial days?I will say STP will be a platform token like BNB or HT, but we are a platform token for investment banking not exchanges. In Wall Street, Goldman Sachs has a much higher (almost 10x higher) valuation than Nasdaq. It means something. When the crypto market gets mature, Investment banking will play a very important role in the ecosystem. STP will be deeply integrated with the Block72 platform in many ways and will be used as how BNB is used when we issue a new asset in our network. It will have different token economics to ensure the supply is deflated. We will have more info released on this. Please, check our official medium.Who are developers in STP?We have a dev shop in Beijing with 5 full-time developers. The website only listed founders. We have close to 30 employees including devsIs there staking program in STP? If so, what are the benefits?Yes, we will have delegation/staking in STP wallets\u200a\u2014\u200apeople can earn rewards by staking and also we will work with BitMax on its bittreasury product. STP will have revenue when we do token issuance, just like Binance launchpad, all the fee will go to the staking pool. Besides that, STP will also has staking methods like DPOS to STP rewards.How many clients you have in queue?We have 25+ clients in contract withWill there be validators nodes? How are they selected if yes?Yes, validator nodes will be happening after we launch mainnet in Q4. Like other DPOS systems, a validation committee will be elected to ensure our onchain validator works.What are your projected expenses of STP for the next 2\u20133 years, what areas would require most of the funds? also Is there any forecast for STP revenue for year 1\u20135?Good questions. Just like I said, it\u2019s also a strength on our team. Block72 is making strong cash flow every month and it also has money from equity raised. Currently our 25+ employees are all under Block72 payroll and it will be the same one in the future. The money we raised for STP will only spend on activities that benefit the STP community, like listing, liquidity provision, development, etc. Our runway is +3 years. In this case, we really expect a bear market like last November can continue for a few months. STP won\u2019t have revenue at first\u200a\u2014\u200aall STP revenue will be given back to the community through our token economic design. Block72 will have revenue, for 2018, Block72 made about $10m USD.Will STP consider launching its own exchange?Yes, but two conditions: 1) STP price is good, and 2) we have lots of retail trafficDo u have token burning in plan?Yes all use cases in STP will directly lead to STP burnWhy not giving STP tokens to bounty hunters like other projects?It\u2019s not good, airdropped tokens will be sold at no price floor for bounty hunter. We will pay USDT/ETH for bounties.How STP is different than CHX and SWARM?They are very regional teams and only focus on STOs. Our plan is to raise $8m, which is $6m at 1 cent and $2m from IEO. Currently, we raised $5m at 1 cent, so the $1m less in 1cents round will be $2m at 2 cents for the same amount of tokens. IEO is either 1 or 2.When are you going to launch the mobile app & what are the accomplishments to be done in the roadmap before IEO\u00a0?Around July. IEO and listing is our 100% focus now. It should happen very soon.What does it mean when you mention STP-Standard token? Is it different than ERC-20?We will enhance ERC20 standard by adding an extra layer for compliance. Compliance is #1 key for token issuance now.PartnershipHow did STP meet George of Bitmax\u00a0? How\u2019s he helping STP\u00a0?I\u2019ve known George since before he founded Bitmax. He was my old friend in New York. Bitmax is a long term strategic partner to STP. And block72 has been helping Bitmax in user acquisition and asset sourcing for a year.How are STP UAT and Bitmax connected?We are partners and we all have one goal: to bring transparency to the lifecycle of token issuance. STP will be the gate of finding good assets, Bitmax will provide liquidity infrastructure of the assets, and UAT will provide asset management. It will be end-to-end lifecycle. Block72 STP BITMAX UAT covers a whole life cycle of a digital assets from issuance to 2nd market, end to endWhy are you not doing IEO on bitmax Even though you are closely associated with bitmax?We will do a light IEO on bitmax. Our market cap is a little bigger than Bitmax typically does. Bitmax definitely will be one of the premier listing exchanges as well.How are you guys partnered with UAT? You both offer asset management services together or independently?Yes, we are focusing more on asset sourcing and insurance. UAT is focusing more on post insurance management.Legal / ComplianceAccording to your portfolio, some of you guys are from the USA. Don\u2019t you get any fear of operating from New York despite STP is registered in Singapore? We all know New York is home of SEC.We are compliant in the US and in the US we only focus on compliant token issuance. We are also arming ourselves with a broker-dealer license. And our Asian team will focus more on utility token issuance.We don\u2019t see any KYC related services offered in Tokenization. Are there any plans for KYC related services?Yes, for KYC STP will launch a KYC portal soon for all our private investors. This KYC portal also will be used in the future issuance on STPHave you identified any region with favorable regulatory terms for tokenization for the mass market?Yes, Asia is definitely a blue sky now, and Singapore is a premium jurisdictionMarket OverviewBut aren\u2019t ICOs already dead and STOs are only a distant dream?There are different methods of ICO. I think just private placement like what happened in 2018 is dead for ICO. RIght now there is IEO. Maybe in 6 months after, there will be Initial wallet offering. Our Asian team will make sure STP will catch the latest trend of any formats of token insurance. For STO, yeah, the liquidity infrastructure is not there yet, but tokenized security definitely will happen in a few years.ICOs had at least some of true believers of the projects, and they tend to hold the token and supported the projects believing long-term vision of the projects, whereas IEOs make 100% flippers, and I guess 100% IEOs happened to justify this, so not sure how IEOs would benefit the ecosystem except for just teams (and exchanges) getting funds and not genuine communities supporting the projects, what\u2019s your take on the IEOs and their influence to the crypto ecosystem?IEO is more than a fundraising method, it\u2019s more like a token distribution method plus a good PR event. its a two-sided sword depending on a project use it. If you use well, you will get tremendous attention and a big number of tokens holders\u200a\u2014\u200athen it requires a project to have a strong use case to convert the flipper community to the users. Most IEO projects now just don\u2019t have instant utility, so of course flippers will just sell tokens and move to the next one. STP is different, we will have business utility on day one.Most of the core teams of STP Network come from Blockchain Venture Capital industry. Why do you enter the development blockchain project area? What are the challenges in this emerging market?We have been in space for a while. We are very good B2B, as you know we are in VC institutional side for a while. Crypto is still a 90% retail market, B2C is what we want to break into. With STP, a token can incentivize a community to engage our asset issuance process, all parties will be benefiting from it.Community EventWill you have a community incentive program to have a personal meet and greet, where STP will host and arrange everything?we currently doing a small social media growth hacking bounty in USDT. We have 5% community reward tokens reserved. We will plan to distribute that to the community over the next year.What kind of community events do you have in mind?Some meetups and we will bring some assets with us and do it together. For ppl who attend our meetup, they may get the priority to invest assets issued on STP at a very discounted price.How do you engage Chinese and Korean community?I am influential in China and my partner Sinhae is the same in Korea. We will kick off our marketing activities in China and Korean very soon.For more details on Standard Tokenization Protocol:Website: stp.networkWhitepaper: linkTelegram: https://t.me/STPofficialTwitter: https://twitter.com/STP_NetworksReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/STP_Networks/", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Game of stablecoins, who shall have the most reserves?", "author_name": "Spencer Yang", "link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/game-of-stablecoins-who-shall-have-the-most-reserves-69a51bad3e47?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 6", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "57", "content": "Game of stablecoins, who shall have the most reserves?Spencer YangBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 6What a month it\u2019s been for stablecoins in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The against camp are of course having their own field day, emphasizing better alternatives such as USD Coin issued by Circle and Coinbase as well as Paxos Standard Token by Paxos that\u2019s not only regulated in the US but also maintains a monthly report validating the 1:1 reserve to deposit ratio. It\u2019s clear that stablecoins is one of the hottest battlegrounds in the cryptocurrency space today, even regulators are joining the battle for better transparency.With derivatives poised to help users capitalize on or hedge against volatility, stablecoins have an interesting position of ensuring low volatility. Counterintuitive as it sounds, low volatility stablecoins represent the third billion dollar trend for exchanges. When you trade BTC to USD on Bitfinex, you may not even notice it but you\u2019ve just traded a stablecoin\u200a\u2014\u200aUSDT.Stablecoins are essentially cryptocurrency assets with a peg to another asset such as fiat currency, gold, cryptocurrency or a market system. The inherent design of having reserves or other mechanisms to stabilise price is what gives it the notion of being a stable coin. Primarily, it\u2019s used by traders when they wish to speculate against the price of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency assets. While they can be used to pay for goods and services, due to the lack of integrations, we rarely see stablecoins being used in our day-to-day lives.Stablecoins largely fall into three main baskets. Fiat or commodity collaterised stablecoins tend to mirror the price of USD, JPY, EUR, Gold, Silver or other real world assets. Crypto-collaterised stablecoins such as DAI have mechanisms against another cryptocurrency that\u2019s required as deposit. Through the use of equity shares, bond structures and other market mechanisms, proposals have been put forth by projects such as Basis (discontinued), Fragment and Carbon to introduce non-collaterized stablecoins.USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization currently sits at $2.6B. USDT trading volumes over the past 24 hours sit at $11B, over 5X it\u2019s total market cap. The deposits are held in banks such as Deltech, which could of course be also used to purchase short term treasuries or other liquid financial assets to generate an interest rate on the massive deposit amount of $2.6B.From the analysis by CryptoCompare for Q1 2019, we can observe that over 80% of trading of Bitcoin into fiat/ stablecoins result in trading via the stablecoin mentioned above\u200a\u2014\u200aUSDT. The other country currencies that are in demand are JPY, EUR and KRW. This is a good indication of the dispersion of trading volumes of cryptocurrencies across these multiple markets.With the various stablecoins in the market such as USDT, PAX, USDC, TUSD, DAI and GUSD, USDT still comprise up to 99% of trading volumes in Q1 2019. Since of the trading volumes of BTC is against USDT, trading via USDT indeed accounts for a significant percentage of total trading volume across all exchanges for all cryptocurrencies.USDT in circulation today are issued on the Bitcoin blockchain with the Omni embedded consensus system as the middle layer. Issuance, wallet and custodian is held by Tether Limited. We\u2019ve also seen similar models and structures emerge in other fiat collaterized stablecoins such as TrueUSD, USDC, PAX and GUSD. Banks such as MUFG and JPM are also evaluating models in this area. It will be exciting to observe which of these implementations will gain the biggest adoption in the next 5 years.Hashtag Capital is a multi-strategy electronic trading fund for crypto assets.

There is no requirement to have specialised computer chips or expensive mining rigs since increased computing power does not lead to increased mining rewards. At the beginning of 2017 the NavPi was released, a Raspberry Pi computer the size of a credit card, loaded with the software and interface to participate in securing the NavCoin network. Since then, the NavCoin blockchain has grown and the onboard memory of the NavPi struggled to keep up with storing all the block headers. Since then, NavCoin Core has been looking for alternative low powered devices to take over the reigns from the NavPi.A couple of months ago work began on creating the NavDroid interface for the Odroid XU4. The beta version of this software is now available to the public for download. The software provides the basic functionality for mining on the XU4 device; Send, Receive, Transaction Lists, Community Fund Voting, Encrypt, Backup and Restore.The software is built with NodeJS and Angular, and fully open source. We encourage any web developers or designers who would like to get involved in working with blockchain to try the software, test it and help to fix bugs or improve the user interface. What we\u2019ve released today is simply a starting point for the community to run with.Until the software has been fully peer reviewed and any bugs fixed, we recommend using the NavDroid with caution and not using it as your primary mining device.You can install the repositories on an existing Odroid by cloning the software from GitHub and installing with NPM, or if you want to download the image join the community on discord to get the download link.There are two main code repositories;NavCoin Express is the NodeJS back end server that interacts with the daemon and provides the API to the front end.https://github.com/Encrypt-S/navcoin-expressNavCoin Angular is the Angular front end web server that provides the web interface for controlling your NavCoin wallet.https://github.com/Encrypt-S/navcoin-angularIf you find any bugs or want to make any improvements, please create an issue or a pull request on the appropriate repository and join the community on discord to discuss.Community Driven Knowledge BaseThe NavCoin Knowledge Base has been relaunched as a Hugo static site served from GitHub. Moving away from Wordpress means that the knowledge base can be more easily contributed to by everyone in the community rather than only a select few moderators of the site. Contributing to the site does require some knowledge of markdown and GitHub, but it\u2019s not necessary to be a developer to add an article.Matt has written a guide explaining how to contribute to the site:https://info.navcoin.org/general-support/contribute-to-the-knowledge-baseWe\u2019ve only had the time to seed the knowledge base with a few of the most important articles so far and would appreciate any help the community can offer in turning the knowledge base into a thriving resource for NavCoin. If you browse the knowledge base and notice something missing, consider writing it up as a guide and submitting a pull request on GitHub.The design of the site is also pretty basic so far. If you have HTML and CSS skills, and are interested in helping to improve the design or user experience of the site, please get in touch with us on discord and we can set you up as a collaborator on GitHub.New Exchange\u00a0ListingsThe community has been doing a great job lately in helping NAV get listed on more cryptocurrency exchanges. This week NavCoin has been added to the following platforms;VertBase: https://www.vertbase.comAltilly: https://www.altilly.com/asset/NAVCoinZark: https://www.coinzark.comCoinmerce: https://coinmerce.io/uk/buy/navCoinXTR: https://www.coinxtr.comWith these additions you can buy or sell NAV on 24 platforms worldwide so far. More exchange listings for NAV means more exposure for the project, more regional fiat on and off ramps and of course additional redundancy when it comes to buying or selling NavCoin. We encourage the community to review these exchanges and support diversity by trading on them if they pass your due diligence.One of the most important exchange listings NAV achieved recently was the reactivation of the NAV market on Bisq. Bisq is an open source, decentralised exchange that offers a high level of security for trading. When trading on decentralised exchanges, the coins you are trading never leave your computer until the trade is completed, drastically reducing the risk of exit scams or exchange hacks as have been experienced by even some of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the industry. Like the saying goes \u201cNot your keys, not your coins\u201d and Bisq keeps you in control of your private keys the whole time.As a project which is highly focused on decentralisation, making Bisq a primary market for NavCoin would help to further this mission. If you\u2019re currently looking to buy or sell NAV, consider using Bisq and placing your orders there.https://bisq.network/CryptoLark InterviewLast week NavCoin Co-Founder Craig MacGregor flew down to Wellington to talk with The Crypto Lark, one of New Zealand\u2019s top blockchain and cryptocurrency youtubers.

Is there a story behind it?Of course, there is a story, an interesting one. The name Beam was actually invented by Guy Corem, at the beginning of 2018, long before we even starting working on the project. I think most of you know that Guy is not only the originator but also the soul behind the project initially the name Beam came from a kind of wordplay on Grin. Because Grin is a kind of smile and Beam is this wider, happier smile.So this was the original idea. But very quickly it got a lot of additional connotations, most of them as you would imagine, relating to light. So for example, our implementation of the lightning network we call the Laser Beam. And it also influenced our logo. Most people see the logo and think of it as some kind of a prism, where the white light goes in and breaks out into different colors.I actually see it exactly the opposite way, all these different beams going in and coming out as one single white beam, a little bit similar to the transactions in Mimblewimble, which are merged inside the blocks and they become inseparable. And of course for those of us who are a little bit older, it reminds us of the great album by Pink Floyd, called \u2018The Dark Side of the Moon\u2019, and due to the dark side, so it is more private, so a privacy angle as well.Q/Is there any plan for rebranding Beam, to a different name, in the future?Not at the moment. I really like this name, and I would like it to remain the same. Even though sometimes it causes a little bit of confusion. For example, when we launched our Android wallet a couple of days ago, there was another wallet also called Beam in the Google Play store. So sometimes it\u2019s confusing, but I really like this name. I think it does it so far.I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world.Q/Beam has some great tech and more on the way. But the days are pass\u00e9 in crypto when you could take an \u2018If you build it they will come\u2019 approach. Does Beam have interested partners and businesses that are actively looking at integrating the tech? If so, what can you tell us about them? If not, what\u2019s the plan there?Absolutely. First of all, you really have to build it. This is the basis for everything and if you look at our roadmap for 2019, you can clearly see that our intention is to make Beam the best cryptocurrency out there. We think that the features that we are adding, such as atomic swap, one-sided payments, and all the usability features, including different wallets. This is the basis for the whole thing. If we manage to Beam as usable and as practical as we really want it to be, I think it will be a great start.Of course, it doesn\u2019t stop there, so we are constantly talking to different payment service providers, and maybe some of you saw in the community in Telegram recently the photos of the ATM machines that are integrating Beam right now.We are definitely not stopping at building the tech, we are also working very hard at making it practical in the real world. There is a lot of work in that case in many different directions. In the following questions, I will elaborate on the long term plans that we have for beam and the additional features we want to build on top of Beam. We are definitely putting a lot of effort into attracting partners and making Beam usable in the real world.Q/ Can you please describe the process an international company would go through to use Beam as a means of transferring money internationally. How simple and seamless will this process be (ie. would they have to purchase/sell Beam on an exchange on each end)? What security measures will be in place from a user perspective (2FA, multi-signature)? From a process perspective, how will financial regulations and audit requirements be met? While some of these points are touched on in the roadmap, the purpose of this question is have a concise description that could be presented to a company to try to get them interested in learning more about Beam and how it could improve their processes (cost of transfers, amount of time for transfers, security of transfers).It\u2019s a little bit early to discuss specific ways of using Beam features for enterprise companies because we are during the process of developing, but I would like to address a few issues from this question on a more broad basis. One of them has to do with compliance. Compliance is basically one of the more complex and interesting concepts that we are attaching to Beam. I would like to talk a little bit about what this means and how it can be used, and I think it\u2019s very important for companies to understand where we\u2019re going with this.If you\u2019re a business that wants to receive Beam as a way of payment, just like with any other currency you have to do certain things, for example, be able to attach documentation such as receipts or contracts with the transaction. You should be able to show your income and expenses to the authorities, to pay your taxes, and be audited, and all the regular things that businesses do all the time. This is actually the easy part. We call this vertical compliance. It\u2019s basically the ability to be accountable for the things you are actually doing and how exactly you\u2019re conducting your business, and we are working on that.However, there is another axis here which we call horizontal compliance, and it\u2019s a little bit more interesting. I will give an example of how this works today in Bitcoin. Since all the transactions and amounts are visible and the addresses are traceable, it\u2019s actually worth using companies like Chainalysis which do network analyses on the transaction graph. They can tell whether a specific transaction has touched or come through a wallet that is suspected of illegal activities, and they can attach a risk score to this transaction so each organization can decide if it wants to receive or accept these Bitcoins depending on this.So banks and exchanges may reject Bitcoin on this basis. The fact that they are actually able to trace a transaction to its source, when this specific coin was born, and to see how it got to where it is now is the basis of this horizontal compliance. In confidential cryptocurrencies this is of course not possible because the blockchain is not transparent, you cannot see anything there.However, this idea of being able to trace is the standard for compliance in the world of cryptocurrencies. What we have to do is supply the solution that will not affect the confidentiality of the network in general, because one thing that compliance is not, it does not mean that anyone can see your personal data, your transactions, and it does not in any way affect the confidentiality of the network.But you still should be able to show the source of funds, how you got this money and how it passed through the system because this is how it works in the old school world of banks, and how the banks are being regulated. There are many ways of doing that, and the challenge here for us is to understand exactly how to implement it from finality so businesses can conduct legal activities regulated by the local authorities in a way that is compliant to the local regulations, using Beam. This is exactly the challenge we are facing right now, and working on.Q/Do you have a strategy regarding countries with regulations that oppose privacy coins?Yes, we are staying on top of all the current trends in the regulations, and it\u2019s completely changing, there are very few countries today that have closed and decided regulations for cryptocurrencies in general, and for confidential cryptocurrencies in particular. But we are doing a lot of research and consulting a lot, and trying to understand all the requirements of what it means to be a regulated cryptocurrency. So it\u2019s definitely a part of our big effort to figure out how this should really work, to find this way of combining the confidentiality which is in our opinion is an essential property of a cryptocurrency with the ability to regulate it.Q/What is the reasoning for adding the Genesis Mining CEO as an advisor, and what other advisors does Beam have so far?I won\u2019t answer about Marco Streng specifically, but I would like to talk about our advisors in general and how we operate. As you can imagine, we have always needed a lot of advice and help from people who are really experienced in the industry and who can really help us with different aspects. It\u2019s a varied world of cryptocurrencies, starting from mining, and integration, and trading, and exchanges, and all the other aspects.So what we have done, is trying to attract the best people we think can help us navigate this complex landscape of the industry. So each and every one of our advisors is a very knowledgeable, and experienced person in their field. Each and everyone helped us to get where we are today, and learn about the business, and make the right decisions at the right point of time. This is why they have been chosen, and they helped us a lot, and we are very thankful for them and appreciate what they have done for us.Q/One of the competitive advantages of Beam is the Dev team who assures speedy developments of different functionalities on beam Wallet. I\u2019d like to know more about your team. Were there any significant challenges that your team encountered in the past?Our team is really amazing, and I\u2019m saying that because I really enjoy working with them, and the interesting fact here is not even one of the current team (I\u2019m talking not just R&D but the entire company, were hired from outside through a recruiter.Everybody is a friend and was brought onto the team by a friend, many of these people I have known for years, some are close personal friends of mine, I\u2019ve worked together with many of them on previous projects. It\u2019s a very friendly group of people who have known each other for a long time, and this helps a lot. As you can imagine, day to day we have a lot of challenges and a lot of difficult problems to solve.Outside of the great technical challenge, and the ability the team brings, I think the human factors here were one of the most important factors in our ability to produce and deliver Beam in such a short period of time. It was about nine (months), from March 2018 to our launch on January the third, 2019.The only way this could have worked is by great cooperation, and we actually feel it every day, this friendship, and ability to communicate in a very constructive and productive manner. I think it was amazing so far. I\u2019m very proud off the team. They are a group of very diverse people from many different countries. It\u2019s a very international company, so it\u2019s really been an amazing experience working with these people.Regarding the challenges, we have had quite a few. One of the biggest challenges was working as an open source project because none off the team had experience with open source projects before. I think it shows, anyone that knows about this sees that we are a little bit struggling with this whole open source idea, because it\u2019s not just going to GitHub and make this repository public, it\u2019s much more than that. Being able to communicate, and to document properly and attract developers, we did a lot of work on that and we still have room to improve.Also, the team was very new to the world of blockchain development and we had to learn everything and pick up things as we go. This was yet another challenge. Of course, it\u2019s not exactly a challenge, but something special that almost everyone in the R&D team experienced, is that it was the first time that we have delivered a project that was actually used by people and attracts a community and gets all the attention and all this crazy interest all of a sudden, and we launch and\u00a0. suddenly there are a lot of miners and traders and exchanges list us, and pools.The action and attention that this project got, caught everyone by surprise, and I think people are still amazed by how it went. That was an interesting experience as well.MiningQ/Beam will be conducting two hard forks this year to stay ASIC resistant. However, after the final hard fork, it is probable that ASIC manufacturer will roll out their models in the market. Does the development team have any plans of imposing protocol upgrades to protect GPU miners from ASIC miners?From the very beginning, we always said that Beam as a company does not have a strict anti-ASIC policy, but we did want to give GPUs a head-start, which is why we have announced two planned forks. One is coming up in June, and the other is probably in December, in order to stay ASIC resistant for about a year and a half, if we are counting from the launch of the project in January.But after that, I don\u2019t think we will have any problem with ASICs, of course, it will depend on the profitability of this operation, and other factors, but in general we do not have long term anti ASIC policy, at the moment.Q/When will ASIC miners be launched to mine Beam?Once again, if we are successful, and if it is actually commercially viable to produce ASICs for Beam, I believe it will happen. Probably some time towards the end of next year, if this happens at all. Our algorithm, Equihash, is relatively difficult to efficiently implement in ASICs today, but the technology will move forward, and I believe if Beam is successful enough there will be ASICs.Q/To secure the network, I know that Beam uses a modified version of Equihash (150,5) PoW mining algorithm. Could you explain what exactly is the difference between the modified and original version? How would this modification benefit Beam miners?The most popular Equihash implementation until we launched, was that of Zcash, and it has 144 by 5 parameters. We wanted to make sure there would be no ready ASICs at the moment we launched. So this is why we have modified the parameters to 150 by 5, and what it practically means is the requirement of the amount of memory you to need to be able to mine Beam, which is why it makes it much more suitable for GPUs.At the moment I think the best GPU is actually mid-range AMD cards and some mid-range Nvidia cards, so you don\u2019t even need a high-end card to effectively mine Beam. So this is the situation and this is why we chose these parameters. I think it was a very good choice. We are happy with the results. We have quite a steady amount of miners today, and it\u2019s been great.ComplianceQ/Will companies/customers using Beam compliance be disclosed?Once again, the word compliance can mean several different things. The most difficult part of compliance is actually the currency part. If you just want to attach documentation to transactions, this is, of course, a very simple operation. You can just add for example a hash of the document to the transaction kernel, and you can always prove that both sides saw this document and agreed on the terms before they conducted the transaction.This is by the way where the communicational nature of the Mimblewimble protocol, the fact that both sides participate in the creation of the transaction helps a lot, because unlike Bitcoin where you send someone a transaction without their consent, here both parties have to agree upon it. This is also a part off the compliance. So I will not conduct a transaction with you if you have not provided the specific documentation that I require or things like that.So, of course, any company or customers that are going to use Beam compliance, they will be conducting their business, it\u2019s not going to be a secret. On the other hand, the transaction that has any additional compliance-related information will still be indistinguishable, so that we do not affect confidentiality.Q/Will Beam compliance be a free or paid \u201cservice\u201d and will the compliance wallets be open sourced?I do not see the compliance as a service, it is more support for a wide set of services. Some of these may be paid, some of them may be free, some of them may be open source, as of course the base code and protocol of Beam will be open source at all times. But you can build a lot of things above it. The compliance right now is more like a layer that supports and allows, enables, many kinds of services, but the services themselves may vary greatly.TechnologyQ/How will Team Beam address ECC post-quantum vulnerability?Ok, so let\u2019s talk a little about quantum computing and what it means for cryptography\u00a0. in general, and Beam specifically, and how we address that. The idea is that today we depend on the fact that ECC is unbreakable in a way using the current computing resources. So it would not be feasible, to crack ECC using the computers that exist today, however, computers have this promise of being big enough one day and powerful enough to be able to crack these cryptographic structures.So as you know, in Beam we are using the so-called Pedersen commitment. The Pedersen commitment is one of the possible implementations of a cryptographic commitment scheme. Let\u2019s say I would like to commit to some message, so what I do, I write this message on a piece of paper and I put it in a small vault, which I lock with a combination lock and I give it to you. So now you are holding this vault. You cannot open it because you do not know the combination, on the other hand, I cannot go back on the message I wrote because you have it and I cannot take this out of the vault.So these are actually the two essential properties of a cryptographic commitment, one is called hiding, which means you cannot see it, and the other one is binding, which means that I cannot go back on my commitment, I cannot really take it back.The Pedersen commitment is a specific commitment scheme that is based on ECC, and it has this property of the hiding being computationally sound. No matter how many resources you have you can never open this box and see what's inside. However, it\u2019s not binding enough. So if you have enough resources, say you have a quantum computer, you can actually change the commitment, so you can change the amount with Beam, and the commitment would still look the same, so it\u2019s not binding enough. What this means is that if someone really has a quantum computer, they can actually break Beam and Mimblewimble in general, and probably many other cryptographic schemes. So what is actually done in order to avoid this, and this is a very interesting trick, there\u2019s a different commitment scheme, it\u2019s called ElGamal commitment.It is actually the opposite Pedersen in the way that it is perfect binding, but it\u2019s not only computationally hiding. What it has done, and it\u2019s already deployed in Beam Mainnet today, when we create the Pedersen commitment, the blinding factor is actually a hash of an ElGamal commitment. This concept is called switch commitments.So tomorrow, if a large enough quantum computer will be ready, what is going to happen is that we will just upgrade our network, and in addition to testing Pedersen commitments, we will also test the built-in ElGamal commitment in addition to that, and since the hash processed in the middle does not give quantum computers any advantage it will be quantum resistant.Now you may ask why we didn\u2019t just do it in the first place, and just use ElGamal commitments, and the reason for that is that it\u2019s computationally more intense, and it will put more strain on the system. So we don\u2019t need it right now, but it\u2019s there and if the moment comes and quantum computers will be available, this is what is going to happen.Q/When will the Atomic Swap be ready? And which coins will be available?We have started working on atomic swaps in October last year, and we had to put it aside for some time before the launch due to an enormous amount of tasks we had to accomplish. We came back to it in February this year, and we are working on it full speed.I believe the first version which will be just CLI wallet and will require full Bitcoin node at first to operate, I believe it will be launched in the next several weeks. Right now the successful swap is working already in Bitcoin and I believe in the next few days I will record a video demo of this process. It\u2019s really exciting, however, it also has a lot of possible error scenarios that you have to handle within the process. I will add a diagram to the text channel.As you can see the process of the Atomic Swap is quite complicated. It requires the creation of several transactions, one that is locking funds on the Bitcoin network and one that is locking funds on the Beam network. Then you have to create two additional transactions, one to redeem the locked UTXO in case of a successful scenario, and one to refund in case the swap didn\u2019t go well and I need to get my money back.As you can see from the diagram, this is a process with many different steps. It involves creating 2 by 2 multi sigs in the middle so that we have shared ownership of the UTXO. What we need to do right now, is make sure all off these error cases are handled, and then we will release the feature.The good news is that out off the box it will support not only Bitcoin but Litecoin and probably many other Bitcoin forks because it works in a very similar way. Sometimes there are differences in the APIs that we need to handle, but the concepts are the same. So yeah, we believe it will work on Bitcoin, Litecoin, and probably some other Bitcoin clones.Q/Ghost Dag is described as one of the new consensus mechanisms that will be researched for adoption in Beams base layer. Can you tell us a little about Ghost Dag, how it differs from the current Nakamoto consensus, and what pros and cons it will potentially present?As you know, one of the issues is always the one with scalability in terms of transaction per second. The problem with any proof of work blockchain, the number of transactions per second in Beam today, is somewhere around 20 transactions per second. Which is nice, but of course it doesn\u2019t really allow massive use for micropayments and things like that.Protocols like GhostDAG and all the Dag based protocols come to resolve this problem. They resolve, using these protocols, faster confirmation, eventually higher transactions per second, and it also brings you better mining decentralisation, because there are much more blocks being created, and even though the blocks being created are smaller, everyone will take a small share because unlike blockchain which is just a sequence of blocks, the DAG (which is an acronym for directed acyclic graph) is actually having a lot of branches living simultaneously and eventually collapsing into some consensus. It allows for faster confirmations this way.I will not go deeply into the details of the implementation of GhostDAG, but this is one of the things we are definitely looking at but in the far future. It will probably not happen any time soon. But this is one of the algorithms we are researching and looking at as a future option going forwards.Q/I have a question I\u2019ve not been able to get to the bottom of re: Mimblewimble Outputs are recorded to the owner on the blockchain. These records are somehow related to the user\u2019s mnemonic phrase used to set up their wallet. But an address isn\u2019t recorded on the blockchain. So, what is the value/function derived from the Mnemonic that is used to record the owner of UTXOs?The way it works is basically like this, you have your seed phrase, which in our case is 12 words. It is used to generate this key that we call the base key. From this base key using a technique called pseudo-random key derivation, we can derive many other different keys. For example, when we create a UTXO it has this value, and the blinding factor, the blinding factor is actually derived from that key.Every time, so that each UTXO has a different blinding factor. However, all the UTXOs are tagged using a concept that we call an owner key, so that you can easily recognize your UTXOs in the blockchain, but nobody else can do it except for you because you are the only one that knows your mnemonic and hence, all the keys that can be derived from it. So this is how it works. It does not need an address to recognize your UTXOs, what you need is just the know your mnemonic, and from that, you can derive all the keys and all the blinding factors that you need to get all your UTXOs from the blockchain at any time.Q/Will Beam be adding a proof-of-existence service, and can this be in-built to the wallet? (What is proof-of-existence?)Yeah. The concept of proof of existence is interesting and goes back, I think, till 2013 In a way, when we talk about adding documents to the transactions, for example, contracts or receipts, in a way it\u2019s a partial implementation of the concept. So at any point in time, you can prove that this specific document was reviewed by one two or several parties, and actually existed at the time of block creation.So it\u2019s kind of partial, specific case, for the proof of existence service in a way. What we are going to do, is use this concept and extend it to different financial applications. So you can say we have something similar to the proof of existence service on top of Beam. Maybe not exactly for the originally intended purpose, but we use the concept for the financial world. At some point, of course, the ability to add documentation to the transaction will be inbuilt to the wallet.Q/In Beam there are no addresses if there are no addresses why there is a blockchain explorer?The blockchain explorer in Beam serves several different explorers. First of all, you can see that the network is alive. You can see the hashrate, and see that the blocks are actually produced, on average every minute, as intended. This is the first purpose, seeing that everything is good with the world.The other purpose is to be able to prove that a specific transaction actually took place. For example if I send you a transaction, and you receive it, but you deny it and say \u201cI did not receive anything\u201d, my way today to prove this transaction happened, is to take the transaction kernel, which is unique, and find it in the explorer, and show the block in which this transaction was included. But this is not enough. Because as we know the transaction is completely opaque. You cannot actually extract information from it.So what we\u2019ve done, we have added another mechanism, which is called payment proof. It\u2019s enabled by default in all the newer versions of the wallet. What it does, is every time the receiver receives a transaction and sends back a message to the sender, as part off this message it has a signature that is signed using the private key of the public SBBS address. It allows the sender to not only prove this transaction took place but that this specific receiver, received and signed it. The signature itself is not enough, but together with the kernel that appears in the blockchain, two of these are sufficient to prove beyond any reasonable doubt to anyone, in any case of dispute, that the transaction was actually received.Q/Mimblewimble was initially Scriptless, but then Scriptless scripts have been implemented. Are there any security side effects of this?Scriptless scripts is actually an interesting term because it is a little misleading in a way, and I\u2019ll explain what I mean. In Bitcoin, each transaction is described in Bitcoin script, and it set out with certain conditions, what it says is \u201cGive this money to the person who knows the private key for this publicly known address\u201d, it\u2019s like an \u2018if\u2019 statement, e.g. If you know this you can have that.This is how the Transaction are represented in Bitcoin. In Ethereum, of course, you have full-blown smart contracts which are written in Solidity, which is much more complicated. In Mimblewimble, the whole genius, and the basis of the idea is that the transaction is actually presented by a series of inputs and outputs, each of which is just a Pedersen Commitment describing it.Then we have the transactional kernel which has additional information and the access of the blinding factors. So there is no script which describes the transaction, however, you can still add some logic to the transaction, but it\u2019s not described in a scripting language, it\u2019s just built into the system as a building block. For example, one of the parameters that we have is maturity, so I can create a transaction which can only be sent to the network starting from a specific block. It will be rejected by the node if it sends before that.This is the maturity parameter. On the other hand, I can create a hash and time lock like the ones we use in Atomic Swaps. So I will give you this transaction, only if you know this secret and only at this specific time. So what Scriptless Scripts basically means is that instead of using a scripting language, we are creating the same types of logic using other types of cryptographic primitives.From one perspective it makes an extension of the protocol a little more difficult because it often requires an upgrade of the node software, but on the other hand, it is handled on the first layer. It\u2019s a first-class citizen of the node, all this logic. once you do have enough building blocks you can build a lot of complicated scenarios such as escrow transactions, and in the future, we intend to use it a lot for confidential assets which I will talk about a little bit later.So this is what Scriptless Scripts actually means, it does not have any security side effects, but the opposite. Since this is something that is essential and an integral part of the first layer protocol it\u2019s actually much harder, better tested, and more robust, than just a concept written on top of something.Q/I understand that Beam is using Confidential Transactions and the Pedersen commitment, but I can not sort out the relationship between the two concepts. Can you explain this for us?The idea of a confidential transaction is that you basically have; who is sending, to whom they are sending and the amount. These are the three parameters that we have. Each and every one of confidential cryptocurrencies has solved the problem of hiding these parameters differently. In Mimblewimble, what has been done is, first of all, we are not recording any addresses in the blockchain, so they are just not there.No matter how many computing resources you have, you cannot know who was the sender and who was the receiver, because this information is just not being recorded in the blockchain at all. As for the value of the transaction, we do encode it, we do encrypt it, as a Pedersen commitment that I mentioned earlier. Hence the confidential transaction is basically built out of a series of PC describing the input and output of a specific transaction. Coming back to the question, the PC is the building block of the confidential transaction in the Mimblewimble protocol.Q/Bringing Ethereum\u2019s assets to Beam as planned for Lumini has an advantage, but you could run complex smart contract applications like MakerDAO on the Mimblewimble chain. Is there any plan to have these types of smart contract applications on Beam?This is a very interesting topic. I will talk about it briefly because it could go on for hours. The Lumini project is an idea of being able to be able to move assets between chains, specifically from the Ethereum chain to Beam, and then trade it confidentially on Beam. So this is the first point, and then at some point, you can move it back to the Ethereum and sell it there. So a two-way bridge between two completely different blockchains.We have discussed several different options of implementing that, and of course, the best, the completely decentralized option would be to just completely link these two networks together, but that would require that every Beam node is aware of all Ethereum contracts. Essentially running Ethereum virtual machine and calculating all the contract by itself in order to be able to validate it, otherwise, it would not be completely decentralized, and you would have to have some kind of trust in the middle.So this concept was rejected at first because I think it would be impractical in the near future to implement something like that. However, we have this kind of compromise that if you do have some centralized contract which you can use to lock your assets on Ethereum and then in exchange create a new type of confidential asset on top of Beam and then trade them and move them back, even though the contract is centralized, it can still work.I can share with you two diagrams, of very high-level ideas about this. I think they are interesting to think about, of how this may work. It is very schematic, but I think it illustrates the concept we are trying to achieve.And Yes. This is one of the things we are researching right now, because of the idea of having Ethereum assets on top of Beam and being able to trade them in a confidential manner, I think it is very interesting. There are a lot of projects today that are doing different types of bridges, and we are in touch with some of them and researching this topic very deeply. I believe this will be one of the things we will focus on in the near future, definitely.Q/I think there are plans to move to Rust, but what is the current status and issues of Rust and what are the criteria for making the decision to shift?As you know Rust is a very interesting and popular programming language today. Grin is implemented in Rust, and it has a lot of interesting properties. It is kind of an evolution of the C++ language, in terms of memory management and error handling, with a lot of improvements. It\u2019s actually very cool. I do not think we will practically rewrite the entire Beam software into Rust in the near future, but we are definitely looking at this programming language for several future developments. It\u2019s cool, and we are thinking about it, but I\u2019m not sure we will do it soon.Q/What is the current process at Beam Hard Fork? How is it different from BTC?The fork upgrade that we are planning is in June, to switch the POW algorithm. We are currently designing the procedure of how it\u2019s going to work. We approach this with a lot of planning and care because it\u2019s a very delicate process. We are just starting to plan this, it will happen in June, so we are still thinking about how to do this right.Q/When will the hardware wallet go on sale? Will it be open source?Right now we are working on implementing for the Trezor T model. It will be open source. We are not going to produce our own hardware wallet or something like that. It will just be another application on top of Trezor. There are some technical challenges we are facing here: the bulletproof implementation, and making it work with small amounts of memory.When you create keys and sign transaction on the computer, you have almost unlimited resources so it works really fast, and when you are creating the transaction on the hardware device, which is smaller, has less capacity, and less processing power, we have to do more optimizations. So that\u2019s why it can take some time. But we are working on that and I believe it will be ready soon. You will be able to use the hardware wallet with Beam.Also, there is a difference because in Mimblewimble the transaction is created interactively both by sender and receiver, so the protocol is also working differently. Once we are done with the first implementation of Trezor T, we will immediately move on to Ledger and other popular hardware wallets.Q/How is the progress on the Beam\u2019s lightning network, and when will it go live?The lightning network, which we call Laser Beam, is actually a two-part question. The first part is to create a point to point transaction. The way lightning works, is you pay the funded with some funds from the blockchain, then two wallets transact directly, and then after some period of time, the last transaction of this exchange is being sent to the chain, and that\u2019s settled this open funded channel.The trick here is not to allow to spend any one of the previous transactions, because if that happens you can basically trick someone into thinking they got some funds that they didn\u2019t. This is the first part we are doing, we\u2019re adding the relative time lock functionality which is required in order to make this mechanism work. It will be added in our fork in June.The other part of the Lightning network is the routing, and it\u2019s more complicated and interesting because you have to have a funded channel two points and two wallets, so you don\u2019t have to create the channel every time between every two wallets.At this point what we\u2019re thinking about is having this work on a shift topology, so that you cannot actually route to any network at any time because this is one of the unsolved problems in the lightning network, that you can not easily calculate the route between the two points. It\u2019s completely changing, and the funding is changing. We are thinking about is to make it work in the hub and spoke architecture, where we have several central hubs, to which many different clients connect.This I believe can work. Right now what we\u2019re doing is we are building a demo, which we hope to show you soon, of this point to point communication. Right after that, we will start working on routing. It\u2019s very difficult to estimate how much time it will take to implement completely, but we are already working on it.Q/Will it be possible to select a certain node, or run a local node on the Beam mobile wallet?This is also a two-part question. Selecting a certain node, yes definitely, the next version there will, of course, be a setting that will allow you to select any node, including your own. Running the local node on the mobile wallet is possible. You can do that. We have done that. However, the exact use case, as you know it requires a lot of traffic, and quite a lot of battery life because the processing is intense.What we have tried to do initially is to do a combination, so you have an ability to restore a wallet on the mobile device which requires a node because you have to download the blockchain and recognize your UTXOs using your owners key. Then delete this information, and connect to a remote node and continue working like that. However, it still requires quite a lot of resources from the mobile device, battery life, and memory you need 700mb free just to download the blockchain, and things like that. So we are still testing whether it will be practical. The answer is yes it\u2019s possible, but we are not sure at this moment how practical it will be, but we are testing that right now.I just want to add to this, that except for the memory requirements, Beam node requires relatively low usage, so in general it should be possible to run it on platforms with little resources.Q/Who\u2019s the better tech Beam or Grin?Well, it\u2019s not about who has the better tech, because there is nothing Beam can do that Grin can\u2019t, and vice versa. The technologies are similar in a way. There are some differences in a way today, for example in Beam you can have identical UTXOs which allow us to create this feature of one side payments.The idea of one side payments is that you can basically pre-create partial UTXOs and create some kind of a coin list, and send it to the other party. Then you can go offline and at any time the sender, just like in Bitcoin can create transactions, and send it to the network.You will receive them eventually when you come online. However, it has some privacy tradeoffs. If anybody knows this UTXO that you published, they can trace that this specific transaction belongs to you. So it has limited use, for example for donations, or any other scenario where privacy is less important but you do want the ability this freedom of now being online at all. This is one of the differences, and there are several more, but I wouldn\u2019t go so far to say that there is a better technology on Beam or Grin, it\u2019s really not about that.Q/Is development currently taking place on Beam confidential assets?Yes, absolutely. We have support for confidential assets on Beam to enable them from day one. However, to use it there are several different scenarios that we are currently thinking about.The idea of confidential assets is that you can create an emission of a different type of asset, so you can trade not just Beam on the Beam network, but different assets that might represent another currency, it may have some other emission, it may have its own rules.The way it works is by adding additional generators to this Pedersen commitment that I just described, so just extend the number of tokens you can trade on Beam. It allows for a lot of very interesting use cases, and we\u2019re currently investigating different possibilities of making this work, from becoming an STO (Security Token Offering) platform that you can actually issue security tokens on, maybe creating a stable coin on top of Beam. So there are a lot of options for how to use that.I think this is one of the more interesting features that have a lot of potential in the near future. We are definitely developing it, and thinking about different use cases, we will announce once we have some interesting implementation details to report.Q/Can you explain how confidential assets are actually created in detail? Is there a way in which one will be able to run a project/develop on top of beam blockchain?Yes. There are several ways in which confidential assets can be done. The one that is currently working on the chain already but is not enabled yet, is the following idea. You have the Pedersen commitment which is just the sum of two factors, the value, and the blinding factor.Each of them is multiplied by a different generator on the curve. So if you add another generator, so you have D multiplied by a generator, and now I add another generator and I have another value, B1. So this means that 1 can actually represent a different asset, so within the same transaction, I can transfer several types of assets. This is one of the possible ways to implement it. The way it works is that I can create an emission as an owner of this new asset, I can create a new asset, I can create an emission of some amount of this asset, and start trading them with people, and also I\u2019m the one who can burn them later. I can receive them back later, and take them out of circulation.I think this is the simplest way to explain it. However, we don\u2019t yet have support for that in the wallet, so we can play with it on and development chains, but it\u2019s not really enabled yet on the mainnet.Speaking about\u00a0CryptoQ/Beam delivers on the properties of sound money but It is still hard to attribute any intrinsic value to Beam and most cryptocurrencies, is there any plan in the future to embark on a project that would add some intrinsic value to Beam?I think we have touched on some of these points before. I think any system that can use Beam in technical scenarios, like confidential assets or payment platform, is adding value to Beam beyond just mining selling and all the things taking place right now. We are definitely, constantly, looking for opportunities to engage in such projects with many different organizations. We are working hard, exactly on that.Q/Alexander Zaidelson mentioned in an interview somewhere that Beam could become a top 5 coin based on market cap, but where do you place it around the end of the year? In terms of adoption, exchanges, functional product?I don\u2019t have all the statistics and calculations in front of me in terms of the exact amount of coins, market cap, and things like that. In terms of adoption, exchanges, and functional product, I can assure you that all these things are moving forward at a great pace.Adoption as one is a function of the things we discussed before, of how useable Beam is and where it can be applied. Exchanges are moving forward as well, slowly but surely. Functionality is something that we are very focused on.Our roadmap shows that we are constantly adding useful functions that we think can be really beneficial to the platform as a whole, starting with Atomic Swaps, and many other additional components.We are on the road to this exact position, this is our goal, to become a top cryptocurrency in full, really reliable, and practical. These are the top values of Beam as a project. Functionality, usability, and confidentiality of course, and stability.Q/Is the reason for Beam not being listed on a major exchange because there is something wrong with Beam?So, there is nothing wrong with Beam. I think eventually we will be listed. We are just three months old. There are a lot of factors at play here. Some of them being the difficulty of integration, and some of them because Mimblewimble is very different and works differently.This is something we are all aware of, and yes the community is very aware of it. I think with some patience, we will get there. There is definitely nothing major standing between us and listing on major exchanges. All these things will be resolved and we will get there.Q/How would do you think Beam and \u201cMimblewimble\u201d technology will affect the rest of the crypto market?I think Mimblewimble brought a great amount of interest and attention to the aspects of confidentiality and privacy on the blockchain. I think in many ways it\u2019s revitalized this entire field because, in my opinion, it\u2019s a very elegant solution.You can basically explain it to anyone in the matter of half an hour. It does not involve super complicated math, it doesn\u2019t involve a lot of different mechanisms combined together, it\u2019s a very coherent and very elegant scheme that gives you both the scalability and the confidentiality without having to compromise on any of those. I think it was a great achievement and move forward for the space of confidentiality.I also think that it has inspired a lot of additional research into both science and technology of confidentiality. I don\u2019t believe Mimblewimble is the end word of this technology, but I think it\u2019s a very important step forward and I\u2019m very glad we have implemented this protocol and made a practical, working, a cryptocurrency based on it.Today, almost everyone is aware of this technology, and of the projects implementing this. It appears in a lot of papers and mentioned everywhere. I think it\u2019s made a huge impact on the industry.Q/What does the team think about the current price of Beam and the network hashrate?Firstly the network hash-rate is obviously related to price as well. As for the price itself, it\u2019s also related to several different factors. The first one being the inflation rate right now, which is high. And as you know, we have the first halving coming up at the end of this year.So some of that will change. We think that it also has to do with the fact of awareness, adoption, exchanges. Everything plays a role in this. At this point I would like to really thank our community for all the work they did so far, promoting Beam, our great ambassador team, and all the people that participate and actually help us with that.I really encourage you to keep doing that, you are doing great so far. I think eventually it will also have an impact on the price, with time.Q/Does Beam have plans to be added to any first-tier exchanges\uff1fOnce again, I cannot comment on any specifics, with some patience it will be fine.Treasury and FoundationQ/What is the treasury fund used for?The idea of the treasury was to be able to raise some money, but in a way that would create a good alignment of incentive for everyone involved in the project, over a long period of time.So just to explain in a few words how the treasury works. In the first 5 years of the project, 20% of each block is allocated to the treasury and from the treasury it is distributed to our investors who invested money in the project in the beginning, core team members, and also a large portion of the treasury is allocated for the foundation which will be started a little bit further on.So this is how the treasury funds are distributed. All the information exactly about this, what percentages, can be found in the FAQ part of the website, so I won\u2019t go into details. But this is how the treasury works, it goes to investors, core team members, and to the foundation that will be started.Q/Can you maybe share progress on the Beam foundation in Switzerland?I don\u2019t think I have any actual updates, and it\u2019s also not my area of expertise. I mostly handle the tech, but we are working currently every day to establish the foundation. It\u2019s a process that is ongoing and moving forward every day. There are a lot of processes involved and it will be done eventually.Q/What if Beam Foundation isn\u2019t as efficient as the current team? What are the guidelines for Beam Foundation?All these things are being determined, and are not finalized yet. The idea of the foundation is to be able to use the funds that are allocated to it, to move forward with the Beam protocol and the Beam blockchain, beyond the lifetime of Beam company.And to have long term impact on the strategy and development of these technologies. So this is the idea, I\u2019m not sure who will lead it at the moment. We are talking to several people we would like to have on the board of directors, but once again there is nothing specific I can discuss right now. The transition to the foundation is a process that we have already started in a way. It will take some time.Our goal is to make it as smooth as possible because it\u2019s a different type of governance, but it\u2019s very important for us to be able to let go and make this transition smooth. Which will allow the foundation to develop the protocol further, for many years to come.Q/How is the development for Mimblewimble on Litecoin coming along?We had several discussions with Charlie Lee of Litecoin some time ago. We offered our help to the Litecoin Foundation in whatever they need to implement Mimblewimble technology via extension blocks on their chain. As far as I know, right now they are currently working internally on the improvement proposal draft, which will describe how exactly they intend to do that. This wasn\u2019t shared with us, so that is where it is at the moment.Q/When moon?As I look around this industry, I think that the moon is going to be crowded very soon. I think we should go to Mars instead. But seriously, as a project and a company, we are doing a lot of things, and we are doing them all at once.If we just list the projects we are working on right now at the same time: node improvement, desktop wallet UI UX, Atomic Swaps, one side payments, mobile wallet for Android and iOS, hardware wallet, lightning network integration and proof of concept, integration with pools, exchanges and third-party payment platforms, community engagement system that we will launch soon that will allow community to propose features and vote for them, we have created this Beam wallet demo machine that allows us to simulate different UI scenarios without actually developing them, and show demos on them which I will use in the video about the atomic swap, not to mention our website, our telegram bot, and other community engagement tools, the blockchain explorer, we are also working on i2p and TOR integration. So this is just a list of things we are doing now, concurrently, at the same time.In addition to this, of course, there are a lot of marketing efforts, conferences, meeting with people, discussing plans, thinking about how to use and implement confidential assets on top of Beam and how to do this, and how the compliance comes into play in different scenarios.Lots of research on topics like Dag protocols, consensus protocols, and many many more like this.

We are very open on all channels, telegram, discord. As you know Gus and Raskul are always there, and Guy Corem is always talking on all channels all the time.

Azbit has reached an important milestone in $5,000,000.Without any doubts, this figure is truly a landmark point for Azbit project, a moment of triumph.Dear partners, we express our sincere gratitude for the support that you provided to the project throughout the entire ICO. Together we have witnessed the most tough times for the crypto market. Capitalization was falling down, the largest cryptocurrencies were rolling down, skeptics did not get tired of repeating that \u201cICO\u2019s have no future\u201d, \u201cICO\u2019s are dead\u201d, \u201ccryptocurrencies have come to an end\u201d.However, Azbit continued to move forward. The work of developers, lawyers, economists, foreign affairs specialists did not stop even for a minute: we were seeking new technical approaches, negotiating with major stock exchanges and investment funds, participating in crypto conferences, developing new strategies to promote the project and AZ token itself, consulting with top experts and advisors.We were confident that cryptocurrencies have a great future, and that diligent work on the project would inevitably bring it closer to success. The support of our community\u200a\u2014\u200aeach of you\u200a\u2014\u200agave us confidence and strength to move on. And 5,000,000 is a confirmation that we\u200a\u2014\u200aboth Azbit project and its partners\u200a\u2014\u200awere right.What\u2019s next? At this point, Azbit began a set of negotiations with major Asian investors, and additionally, started an active marketing campaign in Asia. Our strategic partnership experts predict that a massive\u200a\u2014\u200aand aggressive in a good way\u200a\u2014\u200aaccess to the Asian market will cause a tangible surge of investment in the upcoming weeks. We do not want to jump ahead, but if the circumstances are right, Azbit has every chance of completing the ICO and start trading on exchanges ahead of time.Dear partners, we want to thank you once again for your support and invite you to share this moment of triumph with us._______________________________________________________________Telegram \u2022 Bitcointalk \u2022 YouTube \u2022 Twitter \u2022 Instagram \u2022 Facebook", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Enecuum chains", "author_name": "ENQ Enecuum Blockchain", "link": "https://medium.com/@ENQBlockchain/enecuum-branches-c5fbbcb1dc60?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 10, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "533", "content": "Enecuum chainsENQ Enecuum BlockchainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 10, 2017To ensure speed and security, Enecuum works simultaneously with several chains of the main blockchain network.The following chains exist:Ecological chainEco chain exist for filtering transactions that do not perform useful actions (trash transactions, spam, overloading messages, attempts to Dos attacks on the blockchain system, etc.)Eco chain acts as a filter: it does not remove the block completely, but cleans it from debris, securing normal transactions and making them available for the emission chain. When the solver clogs the block with garbage, the index comes down and it falls under the filters.Service chainThe service chain allows to create various services within the system, such as:1. Voting2. Polls3. Data collection4. Message exchange5. News feedsThus, services that have persistent and repetitive processes can exist in separate block chain.Data chainDate chain can store any files and mark them on the blockchain level with the gematric unique code. This allows to add files to smart contracts in the main unit of the blockchain.Encoding of fragments.A special algorithm splits the file into exclusively context-sensitive fragments, not from the beginning of the file (such as it is in torrents). In this case, a mathematical operator (monoid) is used, which is compatible with decimal gematria of 64 values (binary compatibility).This means that the file can be collected and parsed from fragments, and the hash of these fragments will always be the same.Data chain are ideal for encoding, protecting and selling content and files.For example, it is possible to create a very stable video hosting or file hosting. Plus, this technology allows to create blocks with file content (digital distribution of goods (games, music, movies, etc.), electronic document management, government services and much more).Emission chainThe emission chain records all fees for PoW, PoA, PoS as a share of the total fixed final emission. The chain retains the following information:Link to the solved block and the amount of the reward;Solver\u2019s address;Chain-time of the block\u2019s solution;Token chainsToken chains and token zones are created for the simple interaction of business and customers within its own chain. Functionality, collected in the one convenient place, allows to increase profit of enterprises and to improve the quality of service. While creating an application and using its own token zone, the business gets a lot of opportunities:Tokens zone does not overload the emission chain, existing in parallel with it. In such zones there is an exchange of tokens taking place, and then they are automatically converted into emission units and vice versa. This solves the problem of transaction\u2019s price and speed.Plus, it allows to use the platform in any business, from the sale of gasoline at the gas station to the microtransactions in instant messengers or world transfers of corporations.MarksMarks is an additional tool used to describe the token / token function in situations where it is necessary to identify how exactly a particular currency can be spent on.Marks provide strict fulfilment of the set conditions, certain tasks or functions. They can exist only in conjunction with a payment unit, not as a separate unit. The purpose of the marks is determined before the release and can not be changed.Example: Token + mark for the purchase of building materials. Such a token can be spent only on the purchase of building materials and not on something else, excluding the possibility of \u201ckickbacks\u201d, bribes or misuse of funds.Thus, we get a tool that can be effectively used in such niches as public procurement and state budget distribution, construction, production and others.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Blocks", "author_name": "ENQ Enecuum Blockchain", "link": "https://medium.com/@ENQBlockchain/blocks-46ba701dff7d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 10, 2017", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "481", "content": "BlocksENQ Enecuum BlockchainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 10, 2017The size of the block is not fixed, it allows system to be flexible and easily adapt to the increased load or change of the \u201cgame\u201d rules in the market.The minimum block size is 4 KB, the maximum size is <4 MB.

Bitcoin functions with the help of blockchain technology, which itself bases on the chain of transactions blocks. The information about those transactions updates at all devices in the world simultaneously.The experts predict blockchain big and bright future\u200a\u2014\u200athe technology that ensures that the authenticity of transactions can only be confirmed by the parties involved, without any middlemen or regulating parties, can confirm land and diamonds property rights and organize the communication of \u201csmart\u201d electronic devices.Despite the fact that not long time ago Bitcoin was beating all anti-records and the wide use of it in the worldwide trading is still in the distant future, blockchain is gaining more and more attention from biggest banks, techno-corporations, governments and venture investors. It was in November 2015 that the combined investments in blockchain projects and Bitcoin have passed the 1$ billion mark.Although in its early days blockchain was only attractive as a base for stable functioning of every cryptocurrency, today\u2019s researches and new technologies tell us a completely different story: this database can be used almost everywhere, there are social networks, helpful projects of all sorts and even bank services functioning with help of block data keeping system.It surely isn\u2019t the limit, blockchain\u2019s future looks bright and huge. And that future is something that a lot of people could be afraid of: blockchain can easily replace a lot of bureaucracy system workers, who are only needed to work with databases. At current rate soon comes the day when we won\u2019t even need the people for maintaining the databases and keeping track of statistics\u200a\u2014\u200adistributed database will be capable of maintaining itself.So, now we know a little more about what exactly blockchain is. Now let\u2019s get a little bit more information about Bitcoins.The algorithm\u2019s developer is Satoshi Nakamoto, he has suggested the electronic payment system which bases on mathematical calculations. The point of his idea was to execute the coin exchange without any sort of centralized power, electronically, more or less instantly and with tiniest delays.What is Bitcoin in a couple of phrases? It\u2019s a tough task, but we tried: Bitcoin is a new generation of decentralized digital currency that only works in Internet. Nobody controls it, emission of the currency is executed through the work of millions of computers all around the world, using the program made for calculating of mathematical algorithms. That\u2019s the point of Bitcoin.You can also buy anything you want in Internet using Bitcoins just like you would use dollars or euros, and it trades on the stock market just as any other currency does. But the main important difference is that Bitcoin is decentralized, unlike all the other kinds of money. No organization in the whole world controls Bitcoin. Some are confused by this, because this also means that no bank can control your money.Considering the actuality and popularity Bitcoin and blockchain, a lot of developers are asking how to develop blockchain app. First of all, let\u2019s look at the pros of cryptocurrency wallet apps.Transactions made\u00a0easyYou often should go through hell and back to open a bank account for your company in a bank and facilitate transactions\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes to just get rejected without any reasoning. It isn\u2019t a problem for Bitcoin, you\u2019ll need 5 minutes of your time to make a Bitcoin wallet, set everything up and start using it. No questions, no additional fees.In some countries (for example Japan and a couple of places in Europe) you can already buy something using Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter if it\u2019s a cup of coffee or a house. It\u2019s very comfortable for all parties involved, cause the money are arriving in a matter of seconds with minimal commission charges, and the most important feature is that you don\u2019t need a middleman for your deal: no banks and no brokers are involved, which makes transaction a lot easier.Bitcoin really is an international currency, it\u2019s the same anywhere you go, and it\u2019s undoubtedly a good thing. For example, you can pay for your goods in Europe, USA or wherever else you want using only one account and not thinking about current exchange rate. Sending Bitcoin abroad is as easy, as getting it to your neighbour. No middleman-banks, who could leave you waiting for up to three working days, no excessive commissions for international transactions, no restrictions of transaction amount.Absolutely decentralizedThis currency isn\u2019t printed and supported by the national banks, so therefore it doesn\u2019t play on their rules. Banks can print as much money as they want to cover the holes in state budget, but it would lead to huge inflation. Bitcoin right now is free of that pressure and immense control that make a life of fiduciary money holders harder and harder.The states are looking for further restrictions of cash circulation; meanwhile keeping your money in the bank means excessive \u201ctransparency\u201d of every single one of your transactions to supervisory authorities, high commission charges and in some cases even restrictions of your capability to cash out on your bank deposit. At the same time, Bitcoin maintaining is free and transactions aren\u2019t restricted by any of state and bank presets. All of that makes Bitcoin so decentralized.That said, no control and full anonymity of the transactions make it easy target for terrorists, drug dealers and so on. That\u2019s one of the biggest problems in making Bitcoin a legal currency, and as for now, it isn\u2019t sorted out yet.Unmatched safety\u00a0levelAnother big advantage of Bitcoin is its level of wallets and transactions security that is miles ahead of similar services of other ways to keep and transfer your money. Bitcoin-transactions are secured by the cryptography of the highest level. No one can take the money off you or make transactions from your account. As long as you take all the needed steps to secure your wallet, Bitcoin gives you full control of your money and high level of protection from different ways of scamming.All the new entries in this base are simultaneously synchronized with all of its copies on all of the users computers. The smart algorithms of finding a consensus are working. To steal something, the thief would need to change the data of at least a half of all users, and that\u2019s practically impossible, given how big the network is.If you are too worried about hackers getting your data that\u2019s been stored online, you can use another way called \u201ccold keeping\u201d. Bitcoin-wallets of this type are storing closed keys offline, so it\u2019s impossible to steal them through Internet.It\u2019s probably the best to keep the most part of your Bitcoin budget \u201ccold\u201d and just transfer the needed amount to the separate address, which does have the Internet connection. So, even if you lose your phone or wipe that address off your PC, you only can lose a tiny amount of coins.Full anonymityThe network is decentralized, so everything is absolutely anonymous. You can only track last transactions, but who got the Bitcoins and what did he do for it is impossible to define even for special services. This advantage has one obvious disadvantage: it\u2019s illegal use of Bitcoins.Bitcoin is fully anonymous and at the same time absolutely transparent. You can create endless amount of Bitcoin addresses without opening your name, phone number or any other personal info. But Bitcoin keeps the full history of transactions that took place every now and then, it\u2019s called a chain of sequentially connected blocks, or blockchain that we already discussed. Blockchain knows everything.So, if there\u2019s a publicly used Bitcoin address, everyone can check how many Bitcoins does one have. But if one didn\u2019t tell that this address belongs to him, no one will know his identity. Usually, if someone wants to keep everything as anonymous as possible, one Bitcoin address is used for one transaction only.Good for stock market\u00a0tradingThe rocket rise of the digital currencies couldn\u2019t stay unnoticed by professional traders, who of course decided to try to make profit. The cryptocurrencies stock markets are appearing with immense speed, Bitcoin quotations can be seen on Bloomberg, Yahoo Finances and Thomson Reuters Eikon terminals, the foundations based on digital currencies are being started and supported, Bitcoin index was put into stock market platforms ETF.Cryptocurrencies stock markets are functioning like the standard stock markets. Experienced trader will only need to spend a little time on getting to know the unknown features to start working in the new conditions, and a beginner would risk almost as much as playing lottery. To adapt faster and avoid getting loads of losses and damages, the crypto-trading newbies should learn and understand a couple of simple and not too complicated strategies that work on every stock market that exists.So, how to make a Bitcoin wallet\u00a0app?You\u2019ll need a Bitcoin wallet to have an easy access to your Bitcoins. It can look almost whatever you want it to look like\u200a\u2014\u200asimple sheet of paper, super technological software with loads of security functions on the Flash-medium and so on. The main function of the Bitcoin wallet is to keep secret digital keys that give you access to the Bitcoin address and obviously your money.It\u2019s clear that it\u2019s very important to provide its security and make it as unbeatable as possible. Moreover, the backups are a must in this case. Technically Bitcoins aren\u2019t even kept anywhere, Bitcoin wallets only contain secret digital keys that are needed to access public Bitcoin addresses and give you a possibility to \u201csign\u201d transactions. This is exactly the information that is being kept with the help of Bitcoin wallet.There\u2019s a lot of forms of wallets, but they can all be divided into four categories: for PC, mobile, online and offline Bitcoin wallets. We are obviously more interested in mobile wallets.PC wallets are quite good, but not exactly very comfortable, especially when you are outside and want to pay for something on the shop. In this case the mobile apps with wallets come to the rescue. They work like an app in your smartphone and give you the possibility to pay directly from your phone, it\u2019s made possible by keeping the closed keys to your Bitcoin addresses right in the app. In some cases you can even use the non-contact NFC technology and pay just by touching reader, not giving anyone any of your data.The common feature of all of those mobile wallets is that they aren\u2019t fully functioning Bitcoin clients, so that they don\u2019t need to download the whole blockchain, which continually gets bigger and reaches the size of multiple gigabytes. It would lead to the huge mobile traffic and our mobile operators would happily send us an equally huge receipt for it. Anyway, most mobile phones simply don\u2019t have enough memory on board to keep the whole blockchain.Instead of that, mobile clients are often developed with the help of such system as simplified payment verification (SPV). They download a very little amount of blocks from chain and just relay on other, reliable units of Bitcoin-network to confirm the correctness of existing data.Bitcoin as a payment\u00a0methodWe hope that in the nearest future cryptocurrencies will spread around the world much wider that they are now, and people will stop seeing them as something exotic and unusual. Moreover, today they already are one of the safest (if not the safest) type of digital money.Bitcoin nowadays is a modern digital currency that is already pretty good suited for the transactions in the web. More and more shops are taking Bitcoins as one of the options for the payment. Simplicity and convenience of opening the bank account are attracting more and more attention to this currency. And, what\u2019s notable, it\u2019s people from all around the world. In many Asian and African countries the Bitcoin network replaces the expensive and difficult bank maintenance.In the most forward-minded countries the POS-terminals for Bitcoin-transactios are already getting used in the shops, just as ATMs for cryptocurrencies and hardware-powered Bitcoin wallets are. There\u2019s a true start-up boom going on at the Bitcoin market. It\u2019s turned out that blockchain technology can not only be used for financial calculations, but also for distributed keeping of a data of different actives. There are tens of thousands of other cryptocurrencies already, some of them are based on Bitcoin, some are absolutely independent.The main reason why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rise that fast is the big players joining the market. Investors and their foundations, international corporations, billionaires and even some governments have made it clear that they will support and start using some of those currencies and blockchain technology as a whole\u200a\u2014\u200ait gives investors and cryptocurrency holders a huge confidence boost. The market isn\u2019t taking Bitcoin as a joke, it\u2019s a financial asset that is volatile, maybe hard to understand and even harder to explain, but absolutely real and functioning.And last (but not least), if you want to get expert\u2019s help or consultation about Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, feel absolutely free to contact us, we\u2019ll be more than happy to answer all of your questions regarding cryptocurrencies.

Here, a user (known as a client) can modify data, which is stored on a centralized server. Control of the database remains with a designated authority, which authenticates a client\u2019s credentials before providing access to the database. Since this authority is responsible for administration of the database, if the security of the authority is compromised, the data can be altered, or even deleted.Traditional Databases.Blockchain DatabasesBlockchain databases consist of several decentralized nodes. Each node participates in administration: all nodes verify new additions to the blockchain, and are capable of entering new data into the database. For an addition to be made to the blockchain, the majority of nodes must reach consensus. This consensus mechanism guarantees the security of the network, making it difficult to tamper with.In Bitcoin, consensus is reached by mining (solving complex hashing puzzles), while Ethereum seeks to use proof of stake as its consensus mechanism. To learn more about the difference between these two consensus mechanisms, read my earlier post.Integrity and TransparencyA key property of blockchain technology, which distinguishes it from traditional database technology, is public verifiability, which is enabled by integrity and transparency.Integrity: every user can be sure that the data they are retrieving is uncorrupted and unaltered since the moment it was recordedTransparency: every user can verify how the blockchain has been appended over timeA map of Dashcoin masternodes distributed across the\u00a0world.CRUD vs Read & Write OperationsIn a traditional database, a client can perform four functions on data: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (collectively known as the CRUD commands).The blockchain is designed to be an append only structure. A user can only add more data, in the form of additional blocks. All previous data is permanently stored and cannot be altered. Therefore, the only operations associated with blockchains are:Read Operations: these query and retrieve data from the blockchainWrite Operations: these add more data onto the blockchainValidating and WritingThe blockchain allows for two functions: validation of a transaction, and writing of a new transaction. A transaction is an operation that changes the state of data that lives on the blockchain. While past entries on the blockchain must always remain the same, a new entry can change the state of the data in the past entries. For example, if the blockchain has recorded that my Bitcoin wallet has 1 million BTC, that figure is permanently stored in the blockchain. When I spend 200,000 BTC, that transaction is recorded onto the blockchain, bringing my balance to 800,000 BTC. However, since the blockchain can only be appended, my pre-transaction balance of 1 million BTC also remains on the blockchain permanently, for those who care to look. This is why the blockchain is often referred to as an immutable and distributed ledger.Centralized vs. peer to\u00a0peer.In short, the difference is Decentralized ControlDecentralized control eliminates the risks of centralized control. Anybody with sufficient access to a centralized database can destroy or corrupt the data within it. Users are therefore reliant on the security infrastructure of the database administrator.Blockchain technology uses decentralized data storage to sidestep this issue, thereby building security into its very structure.Though blockchain technology is well-suited to record certain kinds of information, traditional databases are better suited for other kinds of information. It is crucial for every organization to understand what it wants from a database, and gauge this against the strengths and vulnerabilities of each kind of database, before selecting one.", "responses": "10"}, {"title": "Talking Loyalty, Blockchain, and qiibee on the Thriller\u00a0Podcast", "author_name": "Jacqueline B.", "link": "https://blog.qiibee.com/talking-loyalty-blockchain-and-qiibee-on-the-thriller-podcast-84287338c8?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 12, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "8.4K", "content": "Talking Loyalty, Blockchain, and qiibee on the Thriller\u00a0PodcastJacqueline B.BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 12, 2018Listen here!Well, we put on one heck of an airdrop, if we do say so ourselves.But the numbers don\u2019t lie.

Precisely one of the most gratifying results of intellectual evolution is the continuous opening up of new and greater prospects.\u200a\u2014\u200aNikola\u00a0Tesla.Perhaps, there\u2019s no better way to summarize the overall state of development of the fairly nascent technology that is blockchain, than with the words of the oft-overlooked innovator Nikola Tesla. As we discussed last time, Blockchain\u2019s first foray into the mainstream was with the introduction of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin whitepaperand its intended purpose was to enable users to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.The original use of blockchain-based technology to transfer cryptocurrency peer-to-peer already demonstrates its tremendous potential, but as Tesla puts it, \u201cthe more we know, the more ignorant we become in the absolute sense.\u201dBlockchain 2.0: UnchainedThe concept of Blockchain 2.0, or the next step of the distributed-ledger evolution, is best represented by Ethereum\u200a\u2014\u200aa platform which manages to extend the foundation set forth by Bitcoin beyond just cryptocurrency.Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum\u2019s co-founders and a prolific speaker and advocate for crypto, proposed the platform for the developer community to build distributed applications (dApps), referring to this concept of trust beyond currency as \u201csmart contracts.\u201d He also took it a step further, proposing the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).Not long after it was introduced, Ethereum succeeded in gathering a very strong community of developers and further enterprise support through the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem quickly began to operate at full force, still remaining the most widely used public network available. Up until this day, Ethereum remains the network which processes the largest number of daily transactions.The Smart\u00a0ContractIt\u2019s probably one of the most commonly used terms in the blockchain field, and you\u2019ve certainly heard it used here and there. Smart contracts represent a covenant between two parties, written and secured using a programming language, which is automatically executed as soon as the specified triggers are pulled.An easy, real-world example to help explain this is the vending machine. Like a smart contract, it operates based on a fixed, pre-determined set of rules\u200a\u2014\u200ayou put in your money, you make your choice, and you get the product.Important RealizationsWith Ethereum, people came to realize that the blockchain technology first introduced by Bitcoin could be so much more than just a means of transferring money from one party to another without the confirmation of an intermediary.The concept of decentralization started rapidly gaining speed and soon after that, we saw the first use cases in fields as varied as record-keeping, legal, financial, and logistics. All of these cases relied on the new smart contract platform.Another simple example of the need for blockchain technology to improve upon existing situations was VISA\u2019s latest crash. One of the world\u2019s largest financial services companies handling the money of millions of people across the world, VISA\u2019s network crashedon June 2, 2018, leaving countless people without access to their money. This event was caused by a simple \u201csystem failure.\u201dIn a centralized system like VISA and pretty much every other payment platform currently available, this is catastrophic, as we saw. However, happenings of the kind are theoretically impossible or, at the very least, incredibly unlikely to take place in a decentralized, blockchain based ecosystem.Not Without Its\u00a0IssuesDespite representing a step forward in Blockchain\u2019s evolution, Ethereum and other similar networks face their own roadblocks to unlocking the technology\u2019s true potential. One of the most pressing problems is failure to scale.Ethereum\u2019s blockchain can currently carry out only about 20 transactions per second, which is a far cry from VISA\u2019s network which can handle tens of thousands. Because the processing time is so slow, it means that Ethereum is not really usable as a practical everyday payment system. To put it in real terms, if you tried to pay for your morning espresso with Bitcoin or ETH, it would be stone cold by the time the transaction finalized.However, it should be stressed that this is still a young technology which, despite its youth, is already displaying its tremendous potential, as can be seen from projects that are constantly building on it and improving it vastly.The Next GenerationBlockchain 2.0 represented a huge evolution over its first generation. 2.0 truly unlocked and unchained (pun intended) blockchain, and helped the world to see the vast potential of the technology. But there was still work to be done, and it would take yet another generation before we could see that potential turned into practical, everyday solutions to problems, from everyday finances to questions of global development.AERUM is part of this 3rd generation, building a fast, scaleable blockchain infrastructure to empower dApps and P2P transfers.

Despite my long-held reservations, though, for many years of adulthood I thought \u201cfake it till my kids, at least, can make it,\u201d was an okay strategy with respect to Truth and Justice, and maybe even the American Way. A risky strategy, sure, but what isn\u2019t? After all, they now live in an America where anybody who would like to can get married, and today\u2019s young adults are far wiser and better educated and informed, less materialist and more mindful than we were at their age in the 1980s, or so it seems to me. They are making meaningful attempts to create fairer, more egalitarian workplaces and political systems. They have all kinds of wild ideas! Every day I see young people trying so hard to be good to one another. Their high school history textbook was written by Howard Zinn, who at least didn\u2019t think the Pilgrims were having a simply adorable turkey feast with the Red Man, which is what I was taught. These are some miraculous things that happened in my lifetime, and I believe they came about partly as the result in having faith in the possibility of a better future. You need to have that faith to raise children in a troubled world.But then 2016 happened.I\u2019m not the only one to be uncomfortably reminded of Suetonius every time I hear about what\u2019s going on in Washington. Since last November, it\u2019s been plain as day that faith in the invisibly incremental progress promised (specifically, to me, by centrist Democrats) was, to put it kindly, misplaced, and did not prove anywhere near enough to counter the furious and unhinged enemies of that progress on the right. The enlightened atmosphere, so manifestly true and right, of increasing freedom, fairness, and equal rights that allowed my kids and their cohort to grow up in a condition of relative sanity is suddenly in terrible danger. What of their kids?! This is now an all-hands situation. Every social advance is threatened. And bewilderingly, the United States again finds itself in the crusty claws of Republican \u201ctrickle-down economics,\u201d an economic theory unrivaled in its consistency (of abject failure).Consequently, faith in the institutions that were meant to protect us against moments like these has also failed. Faith in the Hope and Change some of us worked so hard for, and which, in the end, delivered so little. Faith in a Senate made up of responsible adults who could be trusted to deliberate fairly and not loot the treasury and rape the Arctic in the dead of night. Faith that the tycoons of Silicon Valley would prove to be decent, no-evil-doing stewards of our information and our privacy. That kind of naivety went up in flames starting in late 2016. Things are not okay.It doesn\u2019t really matter who you blame for the mess we\u2019re in: the drunk maniacs currently at the wheel, or the allegedly sober ones who managed, like idiots, to lose track of the keys. There are excellent arguments condemning everyone in Washington, D.C., and on Wall Street for selling the country out\u200a\u2014\u200apast presidents all the way back to Washington, past candidates, party leadership, lobbyists and congressmen, media, everybody who sat by and let the 1 percent grab everyone by the\u2026well. Now what? None of our old leaders or institutions prevented this mess, and not a one of them is about to see the error of his, or their, ways. The degraded times we live in are such that no one in error will say, \u201cI failed, and I now withdraw and leave better women or men to take my place.\u201d No. They will all cling to the gnawed ends of their power until their flesh falls off their very bones. We need new and better leaders and institutions.Part of the problem is one of accountability. Of simply remembering. Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, a journalist much admired for her cool detachment in dealing with the current president, recently had the face to compare him unfavorably with George W. Bush. Haberman was 30 years old in 2003, when the fraudulent war with Iraq began. There is no excuse whatsoever for this disgrace.Fortunately a thicket of tweets sprang up to remind Haberman of the facts regarding the \u201ctolerance\u201d of George W. Bush.You may be surprised to find that this brings me to my word of the year: blockchain. Blockchain technology\u200a\u2014\u200anot bitcoin, the cryptocurrency it inaugurated in 2009, but the underlying technology\u200a\u2014\u200ais a bulletproof record-keeping system. That\u2019s it, really. Provided it\u2019s running on a robust-enough computer network, blockchains produce incorruptible records. That may not sound like much, but records are remembering. Records are the protection of our memories for the future.Money is the least of it! Anywhere you need records that can\u2019t be altered or deleted, adequately distributed blockchains can (a) produce and (b) safeguard them. Blockchain systems can do a lot more for journalism, and for our future politics, but let\u2019s just start with this. Incorruptible records.Records that can\u2019t be altered. That means no matter what, if you design the system well enough, and if computers and electricity persist. No matter which billionaire doesn\u2019t like you; no matter who is president; no matter if Manhattan turns into a scuba park.That\u2019s why, in the wake of the catastrophe of 2016, I dedicated myself to producing journalism on a blockchain-based publishing platform. I\u2019m totally not trying to sell anything here, so I won\u2019t link. But I\u2019m writing this because I want you in future to think differently about blockchain technology. There are a lot of scams around it, just like there were a lot of internet scams when the internet was born, as there are still. But blockchain itself is not a scam.

I\u2019m neither a crypto expert, nor an expert on investing. I\u2019m simply a crypto enthusiast who works as a full time software engineer at the YC-backed startup Quartzy. I have nothing to gain financially by offering people this information. You can check out my credentials for yourself here. Do your own homework on this subject, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.I\u2019m sure that if you\u2019re reading this article, you\u2019re at least a little intrigued by the idea of cryptoassets and blockchain technology. You may have even read some articles with sensationalist titles extolling the virtues of a certain cryptoasset or Bitcoin, or conversely, why Bitcoin is a bubble. This is neither of those. In writing this, I hope to explain to people why I think that blockchain technology will change the world in a way that any non-techie can understand. It would certainly help to have at least some understanding of this technology, and for that I would point towards someone more qualified than myself. I\u2019ve found the writings of my former instructor, Haseeb Qureshi, to be an invaluable resource, and would recommend this article in particular.When I first began looking at this new technology, it was still very underground. A $1000 investment in Bitcoin in late 2013 would be worth approximately $23,000\u00a0today.I think that the core concepts behind blockchain: peer to peer networks without a central authority (or server), verifiable and unchangeable ledgers keeping track of activity along a chain of events, and the ability to transact between parties without requiring trust between those two parties are all extremely important ideas. These ideas are vastly important to both governments and corporations around the world in ways that most people can\u2019t even begin to fathom.Banking is the most obviously disrupted industry in this space. We\u2019ve seen through Bitcoin how networks can interact and communicate without having to rely on a central authority (the bank\u2019s servers and databases) to determine how much money is in each user\u2019s account (cutting out the middleman). I can think of at least 20 other different use cases for this technology, as can thousands of other Silicon Valley engineers like myself. Many of these technologies are already being worked on. There are many examples of interesting use cases for this technology. Some of my favorites include https://earn.com/ and https://steemit.com/ (these companies are already backed by some of the biggest VCs in the Valley).One of the first cryptoassets that I ever got interested in is Bitcoin (back in late 2012), which it sounds like people are at least slowly becoming familiar with. I still think that Bitcoin has a long term potential as an alternative store of wealth (think internet gold), and as a way for criminals and government officials to launder money across borders. Bitcoin is currently the preferred method of transacting on \u201cdark\u201d web sites to let people buy guns and drugs sent through the mail, but that will change. As an alternative to transacting between parties, Bitcoin has a lot of shortcomings. For technical reasons that I\u2019m not yet qualified to try and explain, Bitcoin can not and will not replace traditional banking, PayPal, or Venmo-style transactions.I have become progressively more interested in Ethereum as a sort of improvement to Bitcoin\u2019s core technology, the blockchain. Coinbase.com makes it easy for people to buy and sell Ethereum for US Dollars, and is one of the most popular exchanges in the world. Ethereum has many of the same properties as Bitcoin, with the key difference being that people can literally write code (called smart contracts) onto what is called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (think a computer that lives entirely on the internet). This concept is so far over people\u2019s heads these days that the only people investing in this space are the open minded people who have enough money to pay experts to advise them (or to just dump money into every new crypto they see), and industry-specific people who can see the potential for themselves.Ethereum Price on Coinbase as of\u00a011/15/17I know that a lot of people who grew up on traditional banking values are seeing many of these cryptoassets as the equivalent of penny stocks. Some of them are. However, unlike bullshit companies that pump and dump their stock, these cryptoassets often represent an idea, and a technology more so than a share of any single company. For example, the same way that Ethereum provides additional functionality that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have, there are cryptoassets being created that are optimized for very specific use cases (look at LiteCoin, Bitcoin Cash, etc. which allow transactions to occur and be verified far more quickly than Bitcoin, or require less computing power to achieve the same functionality). This is much the same way that programming languages work. The popular ones are popular because they work in a specific way that ends up being universally recognized as superior and thus adopted on a large scale.I strongly believe that adoption will also be the key driver in which of these technologies succeed. In a lot of cases, numerous companies will be built around a single cryptoasset, or existing companies will adopt one of these technologies and implement it into their existing technology. Microsoft and IBM are just two that have already started doing this\u200a\u2014\u200abanks will have to follow suit or be decimated.The complexity of some of these cryptoassets immediately turns most people off, but it\u2019s worth investing the time and research to understand how this technology can change the world (and make you rich in the\u00a0process)In many ways, this is like the infancy of other technologies like the computer or the internet. A lot of people also thought that these ideas were mostly smoke and mirrors and didn\u2019t see any reason to learn how to use them. Even today, \u2018digital natives\u2019 are growing up without feeling the need to learn how to use technology in ways other than getting through school or work, surfing the web, and sharing on social media. But there are smart people out there who recognized the potential of these new technologies and built companies around their ideas. These cryptoassets are the new Apples and Googles. Over 10,000 new ones were created this year alone.People with a finance background might therefore look at this as the new dot com bubble, but that\u2019s a poor analogy. There is certainly a lot of hype and misunderstanding in this space, but investors and speculators aren\u2019t necessarily relying on individual companies in order to make returns. They\u2019re relying on the technology being useful and therefore widely adopted. With crypto, you can almost do the equivalent of directly investing in \u201cthe internet\u201d as a concept, and not just as a bunch of companies and stocks. I think that long term, \u201cthe internet\u201d has proven that it\u2019s not just a fad, and I can assure you that blockchain technology won\u2019t be either.The question then becomes how to wade through all the shit out there and figure out which technologies will prove to be useful. I wouldn\u2019t yet consider myself a crypto expert by any means, so my personal plan is to continue learning about and trying to understand the benefits and shortcomings of various cryptoassets. Living in Silicon Valley keeps my ears so deep on the ground that I\u2019m digging worms out of them. Finally, I plan to rely on my own intuition, as I\u2019ve always had a good eye for business opportunities and a proven track record with investment plans.In the past, my biggest shortcoming has always come down to my being too trusting. When Mt Gox was hacked in January 2014, I was robbed of all of my Bitcoin. I now know how to put crypto assets into \u201ccold storage\u201d (not on a 3rd party\u2019s servers) so that it is literally impossible to hack them (part of the beauty of crypto). It\u2019s also important to diversify, and I wouldn\u2019t suggest investing (or maybe speculating is the correct term here) everything in Ethereum alone\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s my biggest bet right now because it currently has some of the strongest adoption and use cases.Governments all over the world are scratching their heads at what to do about this new technology. It\u2019s an uncharted area and has already given rise to one of the greatest criminal tools of all time. An amazing part of this technology though, is that everything is decentralized and happens through the internet, so pretty much all that governments can do is criminalize the exchanging of these cryptoassets. However, any attempts to stop development on these technologies will effectively leave these countries\u2019 governments in the dark ages, while their citizens will still be able to skirt any regulations as long as they have the internet.I think we\u2019re at a pivotal moment where non-tech-oriented people are only now waking up to the idea that Bitcoin isn\u2019t just fake internet gold, and that there are other cryptocurrencies out there that aren\u2019t just a different \u201cbrand\u201d of Bitcoin, and can be evaluated entirely on their merits. It\u2019s only a matter of time before people start seeing the light when this technology begins to disrupt industries all around the world.", "responses": "10"}, {"title": "Data Structures in Distributed Ledgers: Blockchain and Directed Acyclic\u00a0Graph", "author_name": "Vlad Kostanda", "link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/data-structures-in-distributed-ledgers-blockchain-and-directed-acyclic-graph-2adf923e9c6c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 29, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "1.7K", "content": "Data Structures in Distributed Ledgers: Blockchain and Directed Acyclic\u00a0GraphVlad KostandaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 29, 2018All blockchains are distributed ledgers, but not all distributed ledgers are blockchains. While we tend to think of blockchain as the technology for building distributed applications (and we are almost always right), it is not the only one. Moreover, with the deficiencies of blockchain becoming increasingly prominent, other technologies come into focus.By Sean Pollock on\u00a0UnsplashIn 2018, blockchain has become a true buzzword that we seem to hear everywhere. Almost every sector of industry and economy is trying blockchain for size finding benefits that are specific for their applications. We see blockchain-based energy companies, financial platforms, government services, health institutions\u200a\u2014\u200aand new use cases appear with each passing month.However, what they really need is a distributed application that is not necessarily based on blockchain. If we look really deep, we will see that Turtle on which the world of distributed apps rests\u200a\u2014\u200athe distributed ledger. That\u2019s the core technology, and blockchain is just one of its implementations.\u201cDistributed ledger\u201d is the blanket term for the method of storing and processing data in a network consisting of multiple nodes. The main concept of such networks is that, on the one hand, there is no central entity controlling the data processing and, on the other hand, there is trust established in an inherently trustless environment. There are several ways of organizing distributed ledgers, and blockchain is only one of them.The topic of other types of Distributed Ledger Technologies, DLT for short, has been rather hot recently, because the drawbacks of blockchain have begun to outweigh its benefits. The major problems of blockchain are its poor scalability which makes it unable to process large volumes of transactions, and its high transaction fees. Today, both businesses and developers are researching other ways of implementing a distributed ledger that would be more efficient than blockchain.Besides blockchain, a distributed ledger can exist in the form of a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. DAGs have been around for centuries (check, for example, the Graph Theory dating back to 1736), but since recently their properties have become the subject of intense research for the possibility of forming distributed apps for various business purposes. And it seems that there is a huge potential there.Let\u2019s see how blockchain is different from DAG and, particularly, whether DAG is going to become a competitor to blockchain.Blockchain vs. DAG\u200a\u2014\u200athe fundamental differencesThe main difference between blockchain and DAG is in their basic structure and the way new transactions are added and approved.By Austin Chan on\u00a0UnsplashGeneral structureBlockchain is literally a chain of blocks, a linear structure starting with the so-called \u201cgenesis block\u201d and continuing with every new block added to the chain. Only one chain of blocks is formed with any shorter side chains or branches discarded. Each block contains a number of transactions and is referenced to the block before it through the hash. This way, all blocks in the chain can be traced back to the first one, and no modification to the data in the block is possible.At the same time, as we mentioned, blockchain is not the only type of distributed ledger. and since recently we have been witnessing a growing interest to another type\u200a\u2014\u200athe DAG. It is built according to a different principle and seems to solve the blockchain issues.Unlike blockchain, DAG has no linear structure. Instead, it resembles a tree with multiple branches. The data in a DAG is organized according to the two basic rules\u200a\u2014\u200aall transaction flows should be in the same direction, and no element should reference to itself, that is, to be its own parent.Consensus algorithmsOne of the essential properties of a blockchain is the way it reaches consensus. In a decentralized structure, there is no single central entity making decisions about processing transactions. Such decisions are made by the agreement of all nodes in the network for which there are special mechanisms called consensus algorithms. The choice of a particular consensus algorithm has a considerable effect on the network speed, throughput, scalability, and transaction cost.The most popular of the currently existing blockchains\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin and Ethereum\u200a\u2014\u200aadd new blocks with the so-called Proof-of-Work algorithm which is artificially slow, insanely power-consuming and preventing effective scalability of the network. Only one block can be added at a time which slows the network even further. Other algorithms, such as Proof-of-Stake, have manifested higher efficiency, however, certain concerns remain.In their turn, DAGs need no miners or other approving entities that are responsible for adding blocks in blockchains. Instead, any user performing a transaction is also required to become an approver of other transactions. Thus, the network needs no extra costs for transaction processing and is less time-consuming.Moreover, DAG faces less risk of centralization that some blockchain experience. Some consensus algorithms used in blockchain provide the possibility of the consensus power concentration in the hands of a single entity or group. This way, the group takes over the management of the entire network. DAG prevents such scenarios due to its asynchronous transaction validation mechanism where users are required to approve two other transactions before their own transaction is approved.ScalabilitySince DAGs have no \u201cblocks\u201d in the blockchain sense, they are much better scalable. The throughput of a blockchain network can be slowed significantly when a large number of transactions appear at the same time. Each block has a fixed size and is referenced to the one before it. This creates a serious bottleneck allowing to process only a limited number of transactions per unit of time (7 transactions per second in Bitcoin, 20\u200a\u2014\u200ain Ethereum).DAG has no limit on the number of transactions that it can process per second. Since DAG does not group transactions but, rather, arranges them in a linear structure, its throughput can be much higher. The only thing that can slow down the transaction processing is the bandwidth between two peers.Transaction feesTransaction fees are a great pain of the Bitcoin blockchain users. The fees are determined by Bitcoin miners who approve transactions and include them into blocks to be added to the chain. As the number of transaction grows, the transaction fees grow, too, making transactions extremely expensive and nano-transactions\u200a\u2014\u200aplainly unpractical.DAG, in its turn, requires no mining, hence, no rewards for the miners. Each user is also an approver, with their reward being the approval of their own transactions. Besides, with no mining, DAG is not as power-consuming as blockchain. Thus, in DAG there are no transaction fees which makes it suitable for processing transactions of any size, including nano-transactions.So, should blockchain start worrying?It may seem that a perfect replacement for blockchain has been found. Unfortunately, with all its advantages, DAG still cannot be considered a reliable structure for building distributed applications. It has its issues, too\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, its consensus algorithm still leaves much to be desired. Theoretically, with one user approving two other transactions, any entity that eventually generates 1/3 of all transactions in a DAG network can gain control.However, the potential of DAG is being recognized. Vitalik Buterin praised the concept of directed acyclic graphs admitting that they can reduce the network latency: \u201c\u2026they do have some value, particularly in reducing latency, so basically you can design systems where the latency goes down from something like Ethereum\u2019s 14 seconds possibly to 1 second\u2026\u201dIf you are waiting for an answer to the question \u201cwhat is better\u200a\u2014\u200ablockchain or DAG?\u201d, the truth is, as usual, somewhere in-between. We should consider the strong points of both platforms and leverage them to the maximum in building distributed applications.While there are already hundreds of blockchain projects in virtually all industry sectors, DAG is not as popular yet. There are, maybe, a couple of projects using DAG that are widely known, however, their success is a clear indicator that the technology is worth exploring.The best-known project using DAG is IOTA, which includes both a crypto ecosystem and a cryptocurrency. IOTA was designed as a platform for creating IoT infrastructures. DAG structure makes an effective environment for creating networks of multiple connected devices which are a step towards the machine economy.While IOTA cannot be called a purely DAG-based network, as it also uses the Proof-of-Work concept, it is greatly different from the blockchain as we knew it.Another DAG project that is often mentioned is Byteball, a cryptocurrency platform with a native smart contract support. Byteball is fully DAG-based\u200a\u2014\u200ano blocks, no miners, transactions are verified by other users. Byteball does have a transaction fee, though, but it is calculated in proportion to the resources used to verify the transaction.As to the future of distributed applications, we are quite safe to say that both structures will find their share of the market. While DAG is still far from the general adoption but has already manifested its advantages, blockchain is evolving actively with new algorithms and features being tested constantly.If you are interested in blockchain and crypto technology, sign up to my blog where we discuss the hottest topics from the crypto sector and the latest developments in that area.

That is, Bitcoin is managed by its network, and not any one central authority. Decentralization means the network operates on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis.A blockchain, originally block chain, is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.\u00a0\u2026 For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks.Ledgers, the foundation of accounting, are as ancient as writing and money.Their medium has been clay, wooden tally sticks (that were a fire hazard), stone, papyrus and paper. Once computers became normalized in the 1980s and \u201990s, paper records were digitized, often by manual data entry.These early digital ledgers mimicked the cataloguing and accounting of the paper-based world, and it could be said that digitization has been applied more to the logistics of paper documents rather than their creation.Paper-based institutions remain the backbone of our society: money, seals, written signatures, bills, certificates and the use of double-entry bookkeeping.Computing power and breakthroughs in cryptography, along with the discovery and use of some new and interesting algorithms, have allowed the creation of distributed ledgers.In its simplest form, a distributed ledger is a database held and updated independently by each participant (or node) in a large network. The distribution is unique: records are not communicated to various nodes by a central authority, but are instead independently constructed and held by every node. That is, every single node on the network processes every transaction, coming to its own conclusions and then voting on those conclusions to make certain the majority agree with the conclusions.Once there is this consensus, the distributed ledger has been updated, and all nodes maintain their own identical copy of the ledger. This architecture allows for a new dexterity as a system of record that goes beyond being a simple database.Distributed Ledgers are a dynamic form of media and have properties and capabilities that go far beyond static paper-based ledgers.What Can a Blockchain Do?For now, the short version is they enable us to formalize and secure new kinds of relationships in the digital world.The gist of these new kinds of relationships is that the cost of trust (heretofore provided by notaries, lawyers, banks, regulatory compliance officers, governments, etc\u2026) is avoided by the architecture and qualities of distributed ledgers.The invention of distributed ledgers represents a revolution in how information is gathered and communicated. It applies to both static data (a registry), and dynamic data (transactions).

Linear logic is completely predictable, so it can more confidently interact with the blockchain branch.The logical SHARNELL smart contract consists of a form (a description of the values in the formula) and the formula itself (taking into account any given conditions and probabilities, with the possibility of full or partial achievement and operation). Each condition of a logical contract is placed in the form and receives the corresponding symbol that will be used in the formula.

But make no mistake. That\u2019s who he is.His friends and colleagues call him \u201cClip\u201d and for the last 15 years, Dr. John Clippinger has worked at both Harvard Law School and the MIT Media Lab, researching federated identity, the idea that you can be defined by the sum of your data, but that data should not all be stored in the same place. These ideas crystallized sometime in 2008 when the technology known as the blockchain first started to become \u201ca thing\u201d. With David Bollier, Clip edited one of the first books that attempted to explain the potential of the blockchain and self-organizing, distributed systems of governance: \u201cFrom BitCoin to Burning Man\u201d.\u201cOur thesis with the book was that centralized entities were failing on a number of fronts. They took to long to get to consensus. Tended to reject the wisdom of crowds and didn\u2019t properly weigh the evidentiary value of experts when coming to decisions.\u201d And most importantly, Clip and his contributing authors, anticipated that due to the failure of centralized systems, trust in government was eroding. The true potential of the Internet was to replace \u201cBig Brother\u201d or a centralized authority with a decentralized authority, one that could do things in an autonomous manner that had previously been reserved for government.Clip explains. \u201cToday, when you think of the blockchain it is\u200a\u2014\u200aof course\u200a\u2014\u200asynonymous with bitcoin, a form of currency that has taken the world by storm. And you also think of very young entrepreneurs, who invested in bitcoin at $.50 or $1.00 and\u200a\u2014\u200aas a result\u200a\u2014\u200ahave become blockchain millionaires or even billionaires. But what I recognized is that the blockchain was a fundamental technology, one with the potential to change the world in much the same way \u201cthe internet\u201d changed everything. Think about bitcoin as like the first browsers. If you were at Netscape in 1994 it was the right place to be at the right time. At the same time, the true applications that could emerge and run on the blockchain have yet to be invented.\u201dThe blockchain enables distributed applications that do not have a single point of failure, that run in an autonomous manner. Also supported is the notion that a smart contract can be set up between two or more parties that don\u2019t know each other, don\u2019t (necessarily) trust each other, to deliver compensation in exchange for proof that a certain piece of work has been accomplished.John\u2019s fascination with smart contracts, how to define them, how to set them up so they work smoothly and reduce friction with all parties led him to found the Token Commons Foundation, a non-profit based in Zug, Switzerland. The non-profit\u2019s initial focus is on using the blockchain to reduce carbon emissions. This is an (obviously) worthwhile problem. Climate change is an existential threat to our existance as a species.Clip\u2019s commented:\u201cOne important thing we are doing with the Tokens Commons Foundation is establishing a new protocol we intend to open source. The protocol will first be used by Swytch.io, a project of the Foundation, to award tokens upon proof that renewable energy has been generated and that in so doing C02 emissions are reduced.\u201dBut how would a consumer \u201cknow\u201d that the renewable energy they generated\u200a\u2014\u200asay\u200a\u2014\u200aactually offset C02 emissions? That\u2019s where Evident Proof comes in. Prosumers (what folks call people who put solar on their roofs or set up a wind farm) need a way to \u201csee\u201d that they\u2019ve done a certain piece of work. That\u2019s where Evident Proof shines in providing an immutable and legally valid proof of evidence\u200a\u2014\u200aso that it can be integrated into the business and compliance operations of enterprises.According to Clip, what appeals to him about both companies\u200a\u2014\u200aSwytch.io and Evident Proof\u200a\u2014\u200ais that they are elegant solutions to previously intractable problems. For Swytch.io, its about how to get people to come together and work together to solve climate change\u200a\u2014\u200aon a truly global scale. For Evident Proof, it\u2019s how to enable people to prove they\u2019ve done the work and deserve to be rewarded with a certain number of tokens by a smart contract\u00a0.Currently, Clip serves as advisors to Evident Proof, Bancor, and a handful of other companies committed to changing the world.To learn more about Swytch.io\u200a\u2014\u200aplease go to https://swytch.io.

A key challenge was neutrality: how could a decentralized app buy resources like storage and computing, without being tied to a specific blockchain? Across the internet, apps and services face a similar issue of how to directly monetize without relying on a single cryptocurrency, a proprietary network like Visa or PayPal, or a monolithic platform like Apple. Interledger was designed to answer the question:What would a universal network for sending value, independent of any company or currency, look\u00a0like?Interledger is now live and the core protocol was finalized in late 2017. The network\u2019s early use cases include trustlessly exchanging cryptocurrencies and enabling new business models with streaming micropayments. And that\u2019s just the beginning. This post gives an overview of the Interledger network and highlights key features of the protocol that help connect vastly different blockchains and value systems.A Network of Decentralized ExchangesInterledger is made up of a network of connectors, independent operators that act as decentralized exchanges or market makers for cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and other tokenized assets. The protocol allows users to transact natively on the network of their choice, without needing to move assets to a centralized exchange or to a specific blockchain for trading.The Interledger network has no central authority or company and the protocol is not tied to any currency, token or blockchain.Paying from One Currency to\u00a0AnotherWith Interledger, a user can send BTC and the recipient will automatically receive ETH, or whatever their preferred currency happens to be. The assets are exchanged in the flow of the transfer without either party needing to think about how this happens.Behind the scenes, Interledger routes packets of money across value networks like the internet routes packets of data between Internet Service Providers (ISPs). When the user sends BTC, the user\u2019s wallet sends Interledger packets denominated in BTC to a connector. The connector applies their exchange rate and forwards ETH-denominated packets on to the receiver.For more obscure assets, Interledger packets are automatically routed across multiple connectors and each one is incentivized to help find the best paths through the network. Importantly, all of this happens without the sender needing to trust the connectors, as the protocol guarantees that the sender\u2019s money cannot be lost or stolen in transit (see Trustless Sending below).Key Features of the Open\u00a0ProtocolInterledger is a pure protocol and simplicity was one of the primary design principles. The simpler the protocol, the more networks it can connect. In this way, we drew much of our inspiration from the Internet. An open network of networks is more resilient, scalable, and feature-rich than any independent network on its own.The key features of the Interledger Protocol are:Simple Packet FormatTrustless SendingPacketizing ValueSimple Packet\u00a0FormatThe core of the Interledger Protocol (ILP) is the ILP packet, the messaging standard used between senders, connectors, and receivers. The packet is inspired by Internet Protocol (IP) packets and addresses, which are the core of the Internet.ILPv4 has three packet types: Prepare, Fulfill, and Reject; which correspond to request, response, and error messages. Connectors forward Prepare packets from senders to receivers and the connectors relay the Fulfill or Reject packets back from the receivers to the senders.Prepare packets have only five fields: a destination address, amount, end-to-end data, and a \u201ccondition\u201d and expiration that enable the trustless sending. The packet format is network-agnostic and the universal ILP address scheme helps connectors route packets to the correct receiver.Trustless SendingThe second key feature of Interledger is that it enables users to send money through the network of connectors without needing to trust them. ILP guarantees that the sender\u2019s money cannot be lost or stolen in flight, which is critical for creating an open and competitive network.Interledger uses a \u201cforward-and-backward\u201d packet flow, or incentivized two-phase commit, in which the recipient gets paid before the money ever leaves the sender\u2019s account.Prepare packets travel from the sender to the receiver (the \u201cforward\u201d part) and represent a commitment to pay, if and only if the connector presents proof that the receiver was paid.Fulfill packets include proof that the receiver was paid and are relayed by connectors back to the sender (the \u201cbackward\u201d part). Only the receiver could generate the correct proof, which is a simple preimage of a hash. The sender knows with certainty when the money has arrived, no matter what path the packet has taken through the network of connectors. If a packet is misrouted or dropped, the sender will never get the Fulfill and the money will never leave their account.Reject packets are returned by the receiver if they do not want the Prepare packet or the packet does not pass one of the receiver\u2019s checks. Connectors may also return Reject packets if the Prepare expires before the Fulfill is returned. Note that the sender can retry rejected packets, because they haven\u2019t sent the money yet, and higher-level protocols built on top of Interledger handle retries automatically.Packetizing ValueInterledger\u2019s third key feature (and the biggest difference between ILPv1 and ILPv4) is packetizing value, or splitting up larger transfers into many lower-value packets. This is very similar to how big files sent over the internet are sent as many small packets. The benefits are surprisingly analogous to the internet itself, as homogeneous packets increase the network\u2019s efficiency, security, and interoperabilityConnectors process Interledger packets using limited pools of capital or liquidity, and using this efficiently is central to keeping costs low. Each Prepare packet requires connectors to hold the specified amount of money until the transaction is fulfilled or rejected. Smaller packet amounts help connectors avoid reserving large amounts of money for each transaction before knowing if it will be fulfilled. Connectors can operate with smaller pools of liquidity and increase the velocity and utilization of their money.Packetized payments also increase the security and resilience of the network. Connectors can allocate their liquidity like Internet bandwidth (\u201cpayment bandwidth\u201d) to prevent users from interfering with others\u2019 connections. Additionally, smaller packets enable the use of shorter Prepare packet timeouts, which is critical for mitigating the \u201cfree option problem\u201d (locking in an exchange rate that attackers could exploit). At the same time, lower-value packets reduce the risk to a connector posed by failing to deliver the Fulfill packet in time.Finally, packetized payments help Interledger connect more disparate types of ledgers and facilitate a broader array of use cases. Smaller packets can be cleared through ILP without ledger-provided escrow, which was needed for ILPv1. This reduces the requirements for integrating a ledger down to just having the ability to transfer value (though simple payment channels are nice to have to increase speed and lower costs).Connectors can optimize for speed and throughput, because every transaction\u2014 from large purchases to streams of micropayments\u200a\u2014\u200aturns into similarly-sized ILP packets.`The Interledger Network\u00a0TodayThe early Interledger network is optimized for micropayment use cases and trustlessly trading cryptocurrencies natively across blockchains.

There\u2019s no meaningful way to measure the level of engagement with potential customers, other than the rough correlation of impressions to eventual sales.This has given many advertisers the impression that they\u2019re not necessarily getting what they pay for when they advertise online.There\u2019s definitely room for a new and improved way of doing business.What Does Advertising With Blockchain Look\u00a0Like?The first step to efficiency is cutting out the middlemen. Blockchain does this by decentralising the entire process.This creates a direct relationship between creator and user, or between advertiser and consumer.Not only can they be sure that the person using the site or service is a real human customer (thanks to blockchain weeding out bots), but there\u2019s additional value in finding out exactly how the site is being used. That\u2019s something that would usually take additional market research or focus groups.How Does Advertising Become More Efficient?That direct relationship between advertisers and users means instant data, rewards and direct payment, rather than waiting for it to filter through. Without middleman agencies, there\u2019s no percentage taken either.MEDIA Protocol is an example of this new method. Rather than a distinct currency, it\u2019s an embedded and frictionless way to transact between creator and user. Users can be rewarded for their engagement, and use the tokens earned to get access to services, e.g. access paywalled content.This means access to content is predicated on loyalty, not by enduring a certain amount of advertising in order to get access. Essentially, the customer is able to get more of the things they\u2019ve shown an interest in. They\u2019re given more efficient access to the kind of content they\u2019ll engage with.The simplicity of the token system, being built right in, makes it painless for both sides. That in turn increases the efficiency\u200a\u2014\u200amaking the transaction while consuming the content.So How Is This More Efficient?Wave goodbye to throwing money blindly at advertising and hoping for the best. Brands no longer have to shout into the void and pray for a return on their investment. Now they can be sure that every user engaging is a real human, a potential customer. No more bots or inflated click counts.Engagement figures will reflect real impact and give value for that advertising spend.It\u2019s effectively peer-to-peer, which means you get to have a direct effect on your customer\u2019s relationship with you. Once you earn that loyalty, you can build on it in both directions.Target new releases or upgrades straight to the people most likely to appreciate it, and get a real measurement of how they feel about it.Cut out the costly middlemen when reaching out to customers.Get direct access to, and control of, the data your users are generating.Blockchain-based advertising has the potential to replace the existing business model, and not just because it\u2019s efficient.
