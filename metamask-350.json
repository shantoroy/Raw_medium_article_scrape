They\u2019ve done some great work, and we plan to continue working with them, so please don\u2019t poach them too aggressively!This is the same UI you saw previewed at Devcon 3 by the giant dinosaur. That wasn\u2019t Dan Finlay, aka Dino Dan, but was in fact Dan Tsui from Kyokan sharing his team\u2019s work.The new UI isn\u2019t just polish, it also includes several long-overdue features (achem, native token sending). Here\u2019s a basic overview of where things are:I think my personal favorite thing to click here is the \u201cOpen Full Screen Mode\u201d button, which lets you really stretch out and enjoy your account in a new way:You\u2019ll notice Ether on the left tops your new token list, and adding tokens now auto suggests popular tokens, and makes it easy to safely add tokens you know by name, and makes it easy to send them, and review token sending transactions.Don\u2019t get your hopes up, we didn\u2019t have a token sale, that\u2019s just a MetaMark, our April Fool\u2019s joke from last year\u00a0;)Really, the entire interface has been overhauled, and it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer to fully document it all, so let this be a sneak peak at some of the cool stuff we have packed in there.Naturally, all of these changes released at once mean there is a slightly above average chance of hiccups. That\u2019s why we made it easy to opt-in to the new interface, as well as opt back out, in case anything isn\u2019t quite up to your standards yet. If you want to get back to the old interface, you\u2019ll find it on the settings page, under the main menu:We have a lot more cool features planned with this slick new UI, we hope you enjoy it!

Strangely, these systems often get designed with standard web logins (i.e. with a username and password).I always ask myself why I\u2019m designing things this way since, after all, this is an annoying aspect of every web application that Ethereum can solve today.So I\u2019m finally putting my foot down and designing that solution.JSON Web\u00a0TokensOne very popular way to log into a standard web system (and/or use its API) is to submit a password (which is hashed client side) to an authentication endpoint and receive a token in return. This is (usually) called a JSON Web Token and is typically valid for some finite period of time (minutes to days). Here is a nice tutorial on a standard implementation.JSON Web Tokens are nice and dandy, but I got to thinking that it\u2019s very easy to authenticate yourself on the blockchain. In fact, when you use Ethereum, you are constantly doing it.If you think of an Ethereum address (which is just a sha3 hash of your public key) as an account on a website, it is very easy to prove you own that account by signing a piece of data with your private key. This data is arbitrary and can be any random string that the website\u2019s API serves up. Thus, we can use an address as a username and bypass the need for a password. In fact, we don\u2019t even need to use the blockchain to do this.Here\u2019s what it looks like using Express:First we need to do an elliptic curve signature with a private key:var ethUtil = require(\u2018ethereumjs-util\u2019);  // >=5.1.1var data = \u2018i am a string\u2019;// Elliptic curve signature must be done on the Keccak256 Sha3 hash of a piece of data.var message = ethUtil.toBuffer(data);    var msgHash = ethUtil.hashPersonalMessage(message);    var sig = ethUtil.ecsign(msgHash, privateKey);    var serialized = ethUtil.bufferToHex(this.concatSig(sig.v, sig.r, sig.s))    return serializedDon\u2019t worry too much about what these parameters are yet. There is some cryptography going on here and I encourage you to read up on elliptic curve signatures. The Bitcoin wiki is a decent place to start.Anyway, once we have our signature components, we can package them along with the user\u2019s address and send it all to an authentication endpoint.POST /Authenticatevar jwt = require(\u2018jsonwebtoken\u2019);var ethUtil = require('ethereumjs-util');function checkSig(req, res) {  var sig = req.sig;  var owner = req.owner;  // Same data as before  var data = \u2018i am a string\u2019;  var message = ethUtil.toBuffer(data)  var msgHash = ethUtil.hashPersonalMessage(message)  // Get the address of whoever signed this message    var signature = ethUtil.toBuffer(sig)  var sigParams = ethUtil.fromRpcSig(signature)  var publicKey = ethUtil.ecrecover(msgHash, sigParams.v, sigParams.r, sigParams.s)  var sender = ethUtil.publicToAddress(publicKey)  var addr = ethUtil.bufferToHex(sender)   // Determine if it is the same address as 'owner'   var match = false;  if (addr == owner) { match = true; }  if (match) {    // If the signature matches the owner supplied, create a    // JSON web token for the owner that expires in 24 hours.    var token = jwt.sign({user: req.body.addr}, \u2018i am another string\u2019,  { expiresIn: \u201c1d\u201d });    res.send(200, { success: 1, token: token })  } else {    // If the signature doesn\u2019t match, error out    res.send(500, { err: \u2018Signature did not match.\u2019});  }}So basically, given some piece of data, an address, and the components of an EC signature, we can cryptographically prove that the address belongs to the person who signed the data. Pretty cool, huh?Once we are satisfied the signature and address match, we can sign a JSON Web Token for that address server side. In this case, the token is valid for 1 day.Now we just need to put in some middleware to guard any routes that would be serving or modifying protected information.middleware/auth.jsfunction auth(req, res, next) {  jwt.verify(req.body.token, \u2018i am another string\u2019, function(err, decoded) {    if (err) { res.send(500, { error: \u2018Failed to authenticate token.\u2019}); }    else {      req.user = decoded.user;      next();    };  });}app.js// Routesapp.post(\u2018/UpdateData\u2019, auth, Routes.UpdateData);\u2026If the provided token corresponds to the user who sent the request, we continue to requested route. Note that the middleware modifies the request. It is this new `user` parameter that we need to reference because we know it got set in our middleware.POST /UpdateDatafunction UpdateData(req, res) {  // Only use the user that was set in req by auth middleware!  var user = req.user;  updateYourData(user, req.body.data);  ...}And there we have it! Your user has literally signed in, but didn\u2019t need a password.UI stuffBut how does a user actually sign this data in the browser? Metamask to the rescue! Metamask is a neat chrome extension that injects web3 into your browser window.mycomponent.jsxmakeSig(dispatch) {  function toHex(s) {   var hex = \u2018\u2019;   for(var i=0;i<s.length;i++) { hex += \u2018\u2019+s.charCodeAt(i).toString(16); }   return `0x${hex}`; }  var data = toHex(\u2018i am a string\u2019); web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({ id: 1, method: 'personal_sign', params: [web3.eth.accounts[0], data] },   function(err, result) {     let sig = result.result;     dispatch(exchange.authenticate(sig, user))    })  }}render(){  let { dispatch, _main: { sig } } = this.props;  if (Object.keys(sig).length == 0) { this.makeSig(dispatch); }  return (   <p>I am a webpage</p>  );}This will trigger Metamask to pop up a window asking the user to sign the message:Once the callback is invoked, it will call the following action:authenticate(sig, user) {  return (dispatch) => {    fetch(`${this.api}/Authenticate`, {      method: 'POST',      body: JSON.stringify({ owner: user, sig: sig}),      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }    })    .then((res) => { return res.text(); })    .then((body) => {      var token = JSON.parse(body).token;      dispatch({ type: 'SET_AUTH_TOKEN', result: token})    })  }}And once you have the auth token saved in your reducer, you can call your authenticated endpoints. And there we have it!Note that v, r, and s values must be recovered from the signature. Metamask has a signature util module that shows how the signature is constructed. It can be deconstructed like this:var solidity_sha3 = require('solidity-sha3').default;let hash = solidity_sha3(data);let sig = result.result.substr(2, result.result.length);let r = sig.substr(0, 64);let s = sig.substr(64, 64);let v = parseInt(sig.substr(128, 2));where r will be parsed as either 0 or 1. Note also that this uses the solidity-sha3 module to make sure this hashing algorithm is the same one being used as solidity\u2019s native hashing method (we are hashing the hex-string that was signed earlier).Production readyI can\u2019t emphasize enough that every web application using JSON web tokens could easily take advantage of this today. Any user with a Metamask extension could simply bypass the login screen with arguably better security than whatever you\u2019re currently using to manage logins. This means fewer forgotten passwords, less wasted time, and a happier user base.And, you know, if you want your users to pay each other (or you, or users on on any other system that uses this) without an intermediary or if you want to take advantage of Ethereum\u2019s million other features, this sets you up to do that too.Make the switch today.

To get the latest word on that migration process, check out the Truffle 3 migration guide. We will eventually update this tutorial for Truffle 3, but until then, if you just want to get your feet wet, maybe try this tutorial out with Truffle 2.0. npm install -g truffle@2. You might also find Truffle 3 to be easy to start with Webpack using this video tutorial.If you\u2019re interested in building web apps with the Ethereum blockchain, you may have found the Truffle web framework to be a nice fit for your needs.For many types of Dapps (Distributed Apps), Truffle does everything you could want: It compiles your blockchain contracts, injects them into your web app, and can even run a test suite against them!This is all great for you, but what about your users? Truffle has some great defaults for users who are willing to run a local Ethereum JSON RPC server on their computer, but what about your users who just want to sign on and get started?With Metamask, all your users need to do is install our Chrome plugin, and they will have their own secure blockchain accounts right there in the convenience of their browsers.Metamask is just a Developer Preview right now, and has not been released to the general public. We don\u2019t recommend putting serious funds in it, but instead encourage you to use it to help prepare your dapps for Ethereum browsers.It\u2019s possible your Truffle Dapp is already compatible with Metamask, but if you\u2019re like me, you want to go through your project and see what it\u2019s like from your user\u2019s perspective.Just in case you haven\u2019t used Truffle before, I\u2019m going to start by describing how to scaffold a minimal Truffle dapp. If you already have one set up, feel free to jump ahead to Setting up Metamask.Installing Truffle DependenciesYou\u2019re going to need to have installed node.js.From there, you need to install truffle (npm install -g truffle).Also, you\u2019re going to need to run a local blockchain RPC server to test and develop against. I recommend using testrpc, which you install by running npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc.Next let\u2019s make sure we have our testrpc running in the background. Open your terminal and run the command testrpc. That's all! It runs on port 8545by default, just like most Ethereum RPCs, and so does Truffle.Also note that when testrpc first starts, it prints out a list of accounts that will be pre-funded with ether, along with a twelve-word seed phrase for re-generating those accounts. You can use this seed phrase to initialize your MetaMask client with the same accounts, and you\u2019ll have lots of Ether when you start! (Ether is used to pay for network usage, or gas, on the Ethereum network)If you wanted to start up testrpc with the accounts you already have in MetaMask, you can tell testrpc what seed phrase to use with the -m flag. For example:$ testrpc -m \"concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic\"Setting up a simple Truffle\u00a0DappNext, let\u2019s generate a basic Truffle dapp. The default result of truffle initis a simple example currency.To get it up and running, run these commands:mkdir my-money # Create a folder for your new dappcd my-money # Move into that foldertruffle init # Initialize a default truffle project in that foldertruffle migrate # Build, compile, & deploy the dapptruffle serve # Host your web interface on port 8080We just deployed a simple alt-coin called MetaCoin to our local blockchain, and it's available to our browser on http://localhost:8080!If you visit it, you\u2019ll see that by default this new Dapp template signs you in with the first account on your testrpc account list, which happens to be the same account that got pre-populated with 10k shiny new Metacoins! That's because when you ran truffle migrate, Truffle used your first account as the contract publisher, and the contract says to fund the creator's account with 10k coins.You can now send those coins to any account you want, for example, the second account in your testrpc list! If you enter an address and a value, and hit send, you'll see your balance go down!If that seems a little too easy, I\u2019d agree with you! That\u2019s why Metamask gives the user an opportunity to approve every transaction that a Dapp attempts, and that\u2019s more secure!Let\u2019s try connecting to the same account through Metamask, and see how easy it is!Setting up\u00a0MetamaskNow you\u2019ll want to install Metamask from the Chrome store.When you first open Metamask, it will let you either create a new wallet or restore from a seed. Since both Metamask and testrpc use the bip44 standard for wallet generation, you can Restore Existing Vault, and enter the mnemonic that testrpc output when you first started it. It should be 12 words long.You\u2019ll also need to provide a password, which is used to encrypt your wallet.By default you get three accounts, and they\u2019ll be the same as the first three accounts in your testrpc list.To use Metamask with your testrpc accounts, you need to point it at yourtestrpc address as its RPC provider, which by default is localhost:8545. MetaMask provides a menu item for quickly switching to this local port.Open MetamaskClick the current network name in the top right.Select your current testrpc address, which is probbly Localhost 8545.Metamask will close at this point to restart itself.You can now sign into your Dapp with Metamask.Open MetamaskEnter your passwordReload the Dapp page (some dapps will notice when you change accounts, but this basic one doesn\u2019t)You should now see your first account\u2019s MetaCoin balance! If you switch accounts, you should see theirs (none, unless you\u2019ve sent to one!).To send some Metacoin to one of your Metamask accounts, you\u2019re going to need that account\u2019s address.To copy a Metamask account\u2019s address:Open MetamaskClick the details arrow next to the account whose address you want.Click the \u201cCopy Address\u201d button.You now you have a copy of your address to send to!Sending Metacoin from Metamask: So\u00a0Meta!If you connect to your first account, you should see you have some MetaCoin, and if we look in our Metamask plugin, we should have some ether too!It\u2019s important that we have ether, because it\u2019s not only a currency for trade, it\u2019s also the currency for processing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This processing fee is referred to as \u201cgas\u201d.Let\u2019s try sending some Metacoin from one of our Metamask accounts to another.Select the account that has the Metacoin and Ether, so that the Dapp shows a MetaCoin balance.Now we want to copy the address of another account you control to send to. In MetaMask, click the Switch Accounts icon in the top right.If you only have one account, click the + at the bottom of this screen to add a new account.When you see another account in the list, click the Copy Address button on it, and then you can paste that into the Dapp\u2019s To field, along with how much MetaCoin you'd like to send, and hit Send!You should see a notification pop-up, notifying you that you have a transaction to approve.You can now Approve or Reject the transaction, or close the notification, and review the transaction in MetaMask later.This is one way that Metamask is a safer Ethereum browsing experience than running your own RPC. While a pre-authenticated RPC automatically approves all requests sent to it, Metamask gives the user an opportunity to review and approve or reject each transaction that\u2019s requested by the dapp. Long term, making transactions easy to intelligently review is an important priority for MetaMask.Wrapping UpThis has been a simple example, but hopefully shows how Truffle and Metamask work together. They are able to pretty much work out of the box! That\u2019s because Truffle helps you write web3-compliant dapps. Web3 is a Javascript API declared by the core Ethereum team, and Metamask injects it directly into the Dapp\u2019s context!This makes connecting to a Truffle Dapp with Metamask as easy as connecting with your own RPC, but it\u2019s a lot easier for your users.That\u2019s because Metamask is a hyper-light client that doesn\u2019t replicate the entire blockchain locally, but it does let users manage their own accounts, so they can casually benefit from the security of private key management, while placing trust for block validation on Metamask\u2019s configured RPC provider.We hope this has been a useful introduction to developing with Truffle and Metamask!Please, leave a comment or question, start a discussion on github, or Tweet at us on Twitter.

Here is a guide on getting started: https://app.bloom.co/signupBloom requires you interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the Bloom smart contracts to participate in the dApp. The easiest method of doing this is through MetaMask. You should either import the wallet which has your BLT into MetaMask or transfer your BLT to MetaMask.Once MetaMask is set up, you will need at least 0.1 BLT in your MetaMask to continue.Note: Read Part 1 to set up your MetaMask. Read Part 2 to confirm BLT ownership inside MetaMask.Part 1: Setting up\u00a0MetaMaskIf you already have MetaMask set up and your BLT is already in your MetaMask, feel free to skip down to Part 2: Confirming BLT Ownership.Step 1: Click here to get the MetaMask extension for Chrome. Otherwise, check out their site here.Step 2: Add MetaMask to your browser. For example, click \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d to Install MetaMask as an extension.Step 3: Click \u201cAdd Extension\u201d to confirm.Step 4: Read the MetaMask Terms and Conditions which will pop up when you click on your extension in your browser (upper right corner).Step 5: Create a new vault and enter a strong password. On MetaMask, you receive your seed (12 words) which will help to secure your account. Make sure you store your seed in a safe place. Without these 12 words, you cannot restore your wallet.Make sure your MetaMask Extension is unlocked to use the Bloom app. To unlock MetaMask, just hit the MetaMask icon on the top right of your browser and enter your password.Part 2: Confirming BLT OwnershipYou will need to own BLT to use the Bloom dapp. You can also ask for an invite from someone who owns\u00a0BLT.Step 6: Make sure you are on the Main Ethereum Network. If not, click in the upper left corner and change to \u201cMain Ethereum Network\u201d.Upper Left Corner\u200a\u2014\u200aChange to \u201cMain Ethereum\u00a0Network\u201dStep 7: Unlock your vault with your password and fund your account.

It\u2019s what led us to create a secure, decentralized identity in the BloomID. We believe that all users should have a safe and good experience when interacting with products. It\u2019s the context for how we think about our platform\u200a\u2014\u200afrom our smart contracts, to our dApp, to how users interact with our protocol.This also means thinking broadly about the user experience of our community as a whole.MetaMask is an innovative Chrome extension that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, including the Bloom dApp, through your web browser. It manages your wallets and allows you to seamlessly issue transactions and vote in our Bloom platform from the web. We strongly believe that the entire crypto space has greatly benefited from the services that MetaMask provides\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a fantastic tool.Due to the fast moving nature of the space, we also know that security is an ongoing evolution, so we would like to proactively point out a few possible attacks that users should be aware of.Two weeks ago, we wrote a blog post about a theoretical attack vector against MetaMask. Today, Bloom advisor and security researcher Brandon Arvanaghi created a proof-of-concept site EthWalletSecurity, an independent project that interactively demonstrates this attack vector, along with an extended look at MetaMask\u2019s attack surface, for all MetaMask users.We encourage any MetaMask user to explore this site and interact with the attack vectors presented. We care deeply about the Bloom community\u2019s security, which is why we go to great lengths to discover potential attack vectors and educate users on the potential threats they pose.These attacks can happen to both unlocked and locked MetaMask accounts. I will address both in this article. Let\u2019s start by taking a look at unlocked accounts.Part 1: An Unlocked\u00a0MetaMaskYour unlocked MetaMask exposes the currently selected address in MetaMask to every tab you have open. If you ever switch between accounts in MetaMask while it\u2019s unlocked, every tab you have open will also know about that other account.Since the blockchain is public, knowing an account\u2019s address is enough to tell you every incoming and outgoing transaction in its history. If you visit EthWalletSecurity with an unlocked MetaMask, it shows how any site owner can use Etherscan to see your most recent incoming and outgoing transaction.Figure 1: A site owner can use Etherscan to enumerate your most recent transactions when you visit it with an unlocked\u00a0MetaMaskFrom knowing your most recent transactions, an attacker can leverage highly targeted campaigns against your MetaMask wallet.Here\u2019s how it could happen:Approach #1: Your Last Outgoing Transaction FailedThe first example on EthWalletSecurity demonstrates how the site can produce a fake MetaMask notification stating that your most recent outgoing transaction failed. The fake notification would have all the real details about your last outgoing transaction, including its value, the destination address, and the date.Figure 2: A phony notification with real details about your last outgoing transactionUpon hovering over this fake notification, EthWalletSecurity shows how the site can present you a MetaMask transaction for the same amount, but subtly to a different address. Because there is no standard for how Chrome extensions present notifications, a MetaMask user would have no way of knowing that this kind of pop-up, which created a transaction upon hovering over it, is fake.Approach #2: Sign For Your Last Incoming TransactionSimilarly, the site could take your most recent incoming transaction, with the real details about the sender address, ETH amount, and date, and claim that MetaMask requires a signature to accept it. This is not unlike signing for a package arriving at your door.While experienced blockchain users will know that incoming transactions do not require any action on the recipient\u2019s side, it may be easy to overlook this detail when a MetaMask lookalike presents accurate details about your most recent transaction.Figure 3: A fake request to \u201csign for\u201d your most recent incoming transaction, gathered from EtherscanApproach #3: Cloning MetaMask\u2019s CSSA malicious site could take the CSS of the MetaMask pop-out and make an identical, interactive version that shows accurate details about your most recent transactions, like so:Figure 4: A fake pop-out showing how easy it is so spoof the full MetaMask\u00a0behaviorThe phony pop-out would populate itself with your transaction history from Etherscan, with the exception of your most recent transaction, which the pop-out would maliciously claimed failed. The pop-out could then encourage you to re-issue the same transaction, swapping out only the destination address in the new transaction. This is identical to how MetaMask would show a real transaction failing when you click the extension.Part 2: A Locked\u00a0MetaMaskBrowsing the web with a locked MetaMask does not expose any of your MetaMask addresses to any sites. However, it does tell every site you visit that you are a MetaMask user.Approach #4: Coercing the User to Unlock Their Real\u00a0MetaMaskAs mentioned earlier, visiting a site with an unlocked MetaMask means that site (along with every tab you have open) will know your wallet address, its balance, its tokens, and all of your transaction history. For an advertiser, this might be their entire goal. For an attacker, this information makes phishing the user significantly easier.EthWalletSecurity interactively demonstrates how a phony notification for an incoming transaction would likely be enough for a user to unlock their MetaMask, and thus expose their wallet address, balance, and transaction history.Figure 5: A fake notification encouraging a user to unlock their\u00a0MetaMaskApproach #5: Phishing the\u00a0UserThe alternative to having the user open their real MetaMask is to create a fake MetaMask popout for the user to enter their password, seed phrase, or unencrypted private keys. Having a password is valuable, but an attacker would still need access to the user\u2019s encrypted private keys. Having the user\u2019s seed phrase or unencrypted private keys is game over for the user.Approach #6: The Timing\u00a0AttackAs mentioned in this blog post by co-founder John Backus, the malicious site can wait in the background until it detects you have unlocked MetaMask in a different tab. Presumably, you unlocked MetaMask in another tab because you were expecting to make a transaction on that site, whether a dApp or exchange. Since MetaMask does not tell you from which site a transaction originated, the malicious site (no longer the tab you\u2019re currently viewing) can present you a transaction immediately upon detecting you unlocked your MetaMask, tricking you into thinking it came from the site you expected.EthWalletSecurity provides users a chance to experience this timing attack firsthand. You can recreate this attack yourself by visiting the site with a locked MetaMask extension. Once on the site, open a different tab to a different site, and unlock your MetaMask there. Despite being in the background, EthWalletSecurity detects that you have unlocked your MetaMask in a different tab and presents you with a transaction immediately upon your unlocking!Concluding ThoughtsBloom is committed to making interacting with Ethereum dApps more secure, whether from a Chrome extension or from the command-line.We encourage you to explore EthWalletSecurity and learn more about your wallet security. The site is highly interactive. Interacting with EthWalletSecurity from a locked MetaMask shows you different content and attack vectors than when you visit it from an unlocked wallet. We encourage users to learn about both sets of attack vectors, and to stay vigilant when issuing transactions.", "responses": "6"}, {"title": "MetaMask CryptoKitty Performance Update", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "link": "https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-cryptokitty-performance-update-83d851af0147?source=search_post---------8", "post_date": "Dec 5, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "606", "content": "MetaMask CryptoKitty Performance UpdateDan FinlayBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 5, 2017Sorry for any delays in getting back to your pending support tickets, in the last week, since CryptoKitties launched, we\u2019ve gained over 80 thousand new users!Meanwhile, we have a small team, but are growing quickly, so please be patient while we get through all these requests!The number one thing people are asking, is why are my transactions taking a long time, or failing?\u00a0\u00a0When the network is backlogged because of lots of traffic, you might have to pay extra gas to get a transaction through.

Until that bottleneck is expanded, these are the limits we are working with, and the more popular Dapps there are, the more competitive the gas auction will become.Obviously we can\u2019t afford to have all of these problems whenever a great new app hits the decentralized web, and this is why Ethereum scaling strategies are so important.A quick and easy way that CryptoKitties could reduce their load on the network is by allowing people to offer kittie sales without an on-chain transaction. This is already done by exchanges like 0x and EtherDelta, and is summarized in our recent article Scaling Web3 with SignTypedData.Beyond that, we\u2019re probably waiting for other blockchain scaling solutions like Plasma and Sharding to reach production, both of which rely on Proof of Stake, which is one of the reasons that it\u2019s so important for this ecosystem to grow.We hope this overview has been helpful!", "responses": "7"}, {"title": "How to Join AI Crypto Pre-Sales and ICO Using\u00a0MetaMask", "author_name": "AIC_Sharon", "link": "https://medium.com/aicrypto/how-to-join-ai-crypto-pre-sales-and-ico-using-metamask-783e0ce22f51?source=search_post---------9", "post_date": "May 7, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "600", "content": "How to Join AI Crypto Pre-Sales and ICO Using\u00a0MetaMaskAIC_SharonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 7, 2018Hello!

There were lots of fascinating talks about the future of Ethereum and wallet software.One of the most important takeaways for me came from Dan Finlay, one of the creators of MetaMask. I want to make sure dapp developers know one thing:MetaMask plans to phase out the injection of\u00a0Web3.jsToday, the MetaMask Browser Extension automatically inserts a Javascript file into every single web page you visit. This allows dapp developers to talk to Ethereum via the MetaMask wallet quickly and easily.Right click on this page, click Inspect Element, and search for Web3 to find\u00a0it.There are several drawbacks to the current approach. Most of them circle around users\u2019 privacy. As Dan puts it:MetaMask currently shows the selected account to each site that is visited. This is not an acceptable privacy feature, and user adoption has escalated the urgency of addressing this issue.It has also been also criticized that the web3 API is visible at all, even to sites a user did not explicitly show it to, since this also provides some identifying information.We need to shift away from doing this. It will require dapp developers to make changes to their apps. It is best to do this now while the number of daily active dapp users is fewer than a million.John Backus, from Bloom, even worries that advertisers might be targeting people based on their Ethereum holdings:I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some advertisers are already collecting this information. The information is rather easy to collect and has significant use in terms of targeting cryptocurrency holders.Using an In-Browser Ethereum Wallet? Here\u2019s Some Things You Should KnowWhile developing the Bloom dApp, we frequently stumble across noteworthy design considerations of the platforms we are\u2026blog.hellobloom.ioWhat we need is a system where users can opt in to connect their wallet to the web. That is exactly what the team at MetaMask have been working on:https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/714We think this flow is a huge improvement for users and developers. We should not be shy about making breaking changes to dapps now: no one is using them.It will dappen. Give it time.At Balance, our goal is to make it easier for people to make and use dapps. We recently released WalletConnect, our solution for getting dapps and wallets to talk to each other more easily. A large part of that project is WalletConnect.js, a drop-in library for developers to make it easier for them to add support for lots of wallets to their web-based dapps.This is the popup that dapp developers can use from WalletConnect.jsThe flow for people logging in to dapps will then be very simple and safe. You can opt in to a dapp, connect your wallet and interact with a dapp. Here is a mockup of what it would look like if you were using CryptoKitties and the Balance Wallet app.Demonstrating the nitty gritty with the\u00a0kittiesThe plan is to introduce this change in stages. As Dan puts it:I think we also agreed at the WalletConf that it could make sense to ease-in to this breaking change, by allowing end-users (who understand the new expectation of deliberately signing in) to first \u201cenable\u201d full-web3-stealth-mode.Once we have that live, and enable the \u201crequest login\u201d API, hopefully Dapp devs will see the new API as beneficial to migrate to, before we perform a hard break.We will make sure that WalletConnect.js is ready for developers.

Check it out!Your First Smart\u00a0ContractIf you want to get your feet wet with your first smart contracts, a popular language at the moment is Solidity. You can always get the full docs for solidity on The Solidity Docs Site.There are a ton of tutorials on Solidity out there, but a some that we\u2019re fans of are:Learning Solidity series by Karl Floersch.Getting Started as an Ethereum Web Developer by Alex Miller.For messing around & trying out your first Solidity code, you can\u2019t do much better than a zero-install, in-browser IDE like The Remix Solidity Editor.Remix lets you write, deploy, and even interact with your first smart contracts, either on a virtual local virtual machine, or onto a live\u00a0network!If you find your code is in need of automated testing, and a more mature deploy process, there are a variety of Solidity frameworks to choose from:Truffle (Full framework, includes UI building tools)Dappsys (Small, modular systems for deploying Solidity)OpenZeppelin (A suite of common, reusable smart contracts)Embark (Full stack framework, includes UI development)Building an Ethereum User InterfaceThere are a lot of ways that users might interact with a blockchain, and some applications (like Internet of Things) might not have an interface at all, but for a hackathon, there are few kinds of interfaces as easy to get up and running as a web UI with MetaMask.MetaMask takes two of the hardest parts of building an Ethereum interface, and provides you a simple API so you don\u2019t have to think about them:User account management.Communication with a trusted blockchain data source.Both of these things are provided via the web3 API, and when MetaMask is installed on a user\u2019s browser, it can be easily detected in every page load:if (typeof window.web3 !== 'undefined') {  // This user has MetaMask, or another Web3 browser installed!  var ethereumProvider = web3.currentProvider  }The web3 API is primarily exposed as the EthereumProvider object, and usually you\u2019ll initialize your favorite abstraction with it.For example, if you were using the web3.js library, your initialization, and looking up a user\u2019s balance might look like this:var Web3 = require('web3') // The web3.js libraryvar myWeb3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider)myWeb3.getAccounts(function (err, accounts) {  myWeb3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0], function (err, balance) {    console.log('Your balance is ' + Web3.fromWei(balance, 'ether'))     })})Or if you prefer promises, you might use EthJS, where the same lookup might look like this:var Eth = require('ethjs')var eth = new Eth(web3.currentProvider)eth.accounts().then((accounts) => {  const account = accounts[0]return eth.getBalance(account)}).then((balance) => {  console.log('Your balance is ' + Eth.fromWei(balance, 'ether'))})There are a variety of JavaScript libraries for interacting with smart contracts via the web3.currentProvider, so when asking for help, always make sure to specify what libraries you\u2019re using. Maybe ask the library\u2019s own experts!For general MetaMask API best practices, we try to keep this Developer FAQ up to date.Live Web\u00a0ExamplesI\u2019ve started collecting live, editable, in-browser examples using WebpackBin, so you can see how some real apps might be assembled.

Here\u2019s how.Please let us know via email or our support portal if the seed phrase you see is different than the phrase you originally backed up.What We\u00a0SuspectIn the worst case scenario, this could mean that some users were shown an incorrect seed phrase to back up their current accounts, and should re-verify their seed phrases immediately. It could also be user error via a mis-written seed phrase, or some other confusion, but since we cannot verify the cause, we want to be as safe as possible by involving the community in this effort.This does not mean that anyone\u2019s accounts have been compromised by any external malicious individuals. If this is a real bug, it probably either exists in our core MetaMask Controller, or our main Keyring Controller. The bug would need to initially show a user one seed phrase, and after their confirmation, generate a fresh vault, and use it to generate their accounts.Although MetaMask data is stored locally on each device and is encrypted with the user\u2019s password, if your computer has a storage glitch, you will need to restore with your seed phrase, and if you have written the wrong seed phrase, you will lose all of your current accounts. That\u2019s why we are asking all of our users to take precautions and back up their seed phrases again. Even if you backed up your seed phrase originally.BountiesFurthermore, we are issuing a pair of our very first bug bounties for anyone who can identify a related issue in MetaMask on GitCoin and on Bounties.network. We will be occasionally increasing these bounties, and are starting small out of caution for these new platforms.If you are concerned about this issue but are not affected, you can contribute to these public bounties via bounties.network or Gitcoin. To be eligible for the bug bounties, a bounty-hunter must be able to reproduce behavior where a user is shown a different seed phrase than is used to generate their first accounts. This can be done through automated tests of our code or through manual reproduction steps.Finally, we will be hosting an AMA on /r/ethereum on MetaMask\u2019s key storage and account generation code for interested bounty-hunters in two days, on Wednesday, November 15, 2017 starting at 11am PST. The AMA is available here.In ConclusionWe thank the community for their cooperation, understanding, and help.

Overall, this has been a painless experience, but I have found a few gotchas that I want to share. Hopefully this will save some developers time in the future.1. Make sure your Ethereum client is up to\u00a0dateMy first roadblock came from an error that I discovered in the transaction popup window. For some reason, when I hit \u201caccept\u201d to send my transaction, I was greeted by an endlessly spinning orange circle. Upon expanding the popup\u2019s console, I saw:AssertionError: The field v must have byte length of 1 at FakeTransaction.setter [as v]Hmmm\u2026 what does that mean?I pinged Kumavis on slack and he told me it was related to EIP155, which was just recently supported. Any older version of testrpc would lack this support, so I upgraded and things worked fine:npm i -g ethereumjs-testrpc2. Reset your network every time you reboot\u00a0testrpcAnother testrpc problem! Once you open up metamask and type in your password, you are connected to that provider. If you switch providers (e.g. from main net to kovan) and refresh the page, it will reset your connection and you will need to enter your password again.But what happens if you reset testrpc? You should still be listening to localhost:8545, but you\u2019ll find that once you refresh the page, things won\u2019t look right. In fact, things will look very, very wrong.This is because metamask is tracking the block number and when you reboot testrpc that number resets to zero. This is a recipe for disaster. Fortunately, there\u2019s a relatively easy way to avoid this: whenever you reboot testrpc, open up metamask and re-select localhost:8545 as your provider. Now refresh your page, click on metamask, and type your password. Voila! You\u2019re connected to the new testrpc instance.3. Always check for typeof\u00a0web3Your app will probably run into a race condition if you don\u2019t properly check for web3. If you try to render your actual app before web3 is injected, everything will break. So I highly recommend something like the following for your app\u2019s landing component (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re using react):if (typeof web3 == 'undefined') {  return (    <NoMetamask/>  );} else if (web3.version.network == 'loading') {  return (    <WrongNetwork/>  );} else {  return (    <Landing/>  );}Note that checking if (web3\u00a0!== undefined) or if (web3) or anything equivalent will not work. You need to compare the typeof the injected web3 object.4. Pack all your metamask calls into a util\u00a0fileThis is may be more of a developer\u2019s preference than the other ones, but I strongly recommend abstracting all your metamask calls into one file because you will find yourself reusing metamask calls a lot. Rather than collapsing a bunch of copypasta versions of the same function later, why don\u2019t you just start with one metamask file in your util directory? And don\u2019t worry about not having access to web3: it\u2019s just a javascript object that you can pass around like a hot potato\u200a\u2014\u200ait can go anywhere!// metamask.jsexports.doSomething = function(web3, param) {    // I have access to web3, even though I'm not in the DOM!    const user = web3.eth.accounts[0];  // Do stuff}5. Don\u2019t wait to advance the\u00a0UX!I can\u2019t believe I still see this in production. As an ecosystem, we\u2019ve gotten better about this, but I want to extinguish it like smallpox. Please, people. Ethereum has a ~15s block time. That may seem fast in the blockchain world, but it is a lifetime in the world of fast, reactive web applications. And if you\u2019re using testrpc for development, you will probably find yourself forgetting how slow blockchains are. Do not forget how slow blockchains are. Say it out loud every day: \u201cWaiting for Ethereum transactions is a bad user experience.\u201dPlease please please don\u2019t make your users sit around twiddling their thumbs after submitting a transaction. It\u2019s so easy to handle a sendTransaction callback (which is a transaction hash) by dispatching that hash to a queue and periodically checking for a receipt on it. Consider the following:// metamask.jsexports.doSomething = function(web3, param) {  const user = web3.eth.accounts[0];  web3.eth.getTransactionCount(owner, (err, nonce) => {    // Form your tx object...    web3.eth.sendTransaction(obj, (err, res) => {      if (err) { cb(err); }      else { cb(null, res); }    })}// component.jsxcallMetamask() {  metamask.doSomething(web3, 'something', (err, result) => {    if (err) { console.log('Error doing something.') }    else { dispatch({ type: 'QUEUE_TXHASH', result: result }) }  })}With that hash in your queue, you can display it in the toolbar and the user can happily continue with your app while waiting for the transaction to go through.If it really is critical that the transaction is processed before advancing your UI (and you can honestly tell me this is the best UX flow you can think of), please give your users something exciting to look at\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe the Ethereum whitepaper or this cat with a shower cap.6. Yes, it\u2019s really this\u00a0easyThree weeks of heavy metamask development and these are really the only gripes I can come up with. Really, metamask is marvelous and easy to set up. Generally speaking, you should be good to go if you follow the rules/suggestions outlined above and properly reference the web3 API (remember to always use asynchronous calls\u200a\u2014\u200asynchronous ones won\u2019t work in metamask).If you have a question, but it wasn\u2019t answered here, I recommend checking out the Ethereum stack exchange.\u2014If you like my articles, follow me on twitter or check out my company, ConsenSys, because we do awesome stuff.And, as always, there is an open invitation to join the Ethereum communityand help us conquer the world.Hacker Noon is how hackers start their afternoons.

Electron enables easy packaging for all desktop platforms.We need to access some system capabilities (eg Keybase).That was what pointed us to Electron. It would give us the security and user experience control that we aim for.Why MetaMaskIt\u2019s the easiest way to interact with Web3. A lot of people are already used to it in the ecosystem.No gigabyte download is needed to run it. This makes the FTUE (First Time User Experience) really smooth, as seen below.It\u2019s very user friendly. It still needs a lot of work on the UI/UX front, but it will progress.They have plans to become a light client, so AFAIK it won\u2019t need INFURA to work in the future.Our threat\u00a0modelSince we\u2019re paranoid, our threat model is that no matter if the attacker managed to get malicious code inside Aragon, it could not attack the whole operating system or the user\u2019s wallet (MetaMask).By default Electron basically lets its contained application to execute any arbitrary NodeJS code, meaning that a successful attacker could effectively own your operating system.We removed this attack surface by turning nodeIntegration to false, so the dapp is as sandboxed as it would be running in a normal browser.We would run the code that requires operating system calls (eg the Keybase integration) in Electron\u2019s main process and leave the rest running in renderer processes (sandboxed).When disabling NodeJS integration, the standard way to do IPC in Electron is gone. So we had to develop our own safe, secure IPC method, called Intertron.Embedding MetaMaskMetaMask\u2019s build target are browser extensions. So how did we manage to embed a browser extension like MetaMask into our Electron app?We had to:Implement a lot of dummy APIs faking Chrome\u2019s so we didn\u2019t have to distanciate a lot from their codebase.Replace their default communication method between the extension and the webapp (using Ports) with an isolated, inter-origin communication using postMessage.Implement custom protocols so Aragon is served over aragon:// and MetaMask over metamask://. This way, we enforce different origins, thus providing full context isolation (eg there\u2019s no way the Aragon dapp can access MetaMask\u2019s private keys).Show MetaMask when we detect a transaction that needs user input.SummaryThere is a lot of work to be done in the ecosystem to advance how we package dapps from a security and easy of use standpoint.We want to thank the awesome team at MetaMask for their efforts, and look forward to continue working with them.You can check out our MetaMask fork, which I hope it won\u2019t exist for long and will eventually be a part of the upstream repo \ud83d\ude4c", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "How to install MetaMask plugin and get a Ropsten Test\u00a0Ethereum", "author_name": "BANKEX", "link": "https://blog.bankex.org/how-to-buy-ethereum-using-metamask-ccea0703daec?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 27, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "728", "content": "How to install MetaMask plugin and get a Ropsten Test\u00a0EthereumBANKEXBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 27, 2017After reading this article, you should be able to buy Ropsten test Ethereum using MetaMask plugin.

Meanwhile, we\u2019ve been gradually learning to post bounties to Gitcoin on outstanding issues, and have had some pretty great early results with that strategy.It has been important for us to learn that bounties have well defined acceptance criteria.The first type we had great success with was bug bounties. A bug bounty is a classic way of creating a sort of incentivized diligence that can last beyond your immediate attention. Bug bounties are not the easiest to write criteria for, but if you have a suspected bug that you can\u2019t keep looking for, writing those terms is least you can do.The second type is fast bug fixes. When a bug is really bad, and causing people distress, you really can\u2019t fix it fast enough. Also, a bug fix is usually really easy to write acceptance criteria for (which turns out to be a big deal for a bounty), usually something like \u201creproduce the bug with a test, get the test passing\u201d. In these situations a fix bounty can make sense, although it\u2019s important to communicate to these bounty hunters that they\u2019re very much in a race, you\u2019re trying to fix it first, and they will only get paid if they deliver before you.The third type of bounty we\u2019ve begun to use is for small features. Lately, I think our experience with the other types of bounties (and some larger features, which have been a little messier to accept) has helped us develop a sense of what features are more bounty-achievable. We\u2019ve started using Github tags to mark these issues for discussion, and eventually posting bounties.I think our first feature bounty was a very small feature that lets people choose their account icon type in settings. Most people don\u2019t know about that feature yet, and honestly most people don\u2019t care, but some people care a lot about their icon type, so it was a nice gift to that community. A feature like that wasn\u2019t likely to make it high up our priority list, but someone was willing to complete it for a surprisingly small bounty, so it really got us thinking more about what old features might be bounty-able.Our roadmap has had to become a bit dynamic, to deal with the constantly changing ecosystem, but one thing that we\u2019ve always known we needed to do is translate to other languages. We posted the bounty mid-December, and by mid-January Nick Doiron had picked up the issue, and had his PR open a day later. That was it!It\u2019s a little sad, but we were so wrapped up with launching the beta for our new user interface, that we didn\u2019t even get to properly validate his contribution for another month after that, and after a few small tweaks to make sure it was working well, we merged it.Once we had merged in multiple language support from a bounty, it unblocked the path to all other translations, and what better way to get lots of different translations than with bounties from our community? A single tweet of publicity and we had something like 20 language requests, and 10 language pull requests. It\u2019s been total magic. Translating has easily been the easiest, and most community-involving bounty program we\u2019ve run so far, and I think the experience just has us asking more and more: What other issues could be bountied?MetaMask\u2019s translations are undergoing final merges and will appear in the beta UI of our next release. Our first internationalized release will include translations in French, Japanese, Vietnamese, Spanish, Italian, Tagalog, and probably more.

Congratulations to the whole team on reaching 1MM users (!) and their beautiful UI upgrade. Along with their day job of serving as a conduit to the Ethereum blockchain, the ecosystem owes the team a debt of gratitude for protecting us from phishers through their site blacklist.Doing it all open source brings a flutter to our hearts at Gitcoin.However, with so many competing priorities, internationalization of MetaMask kept falling through the cracks.We\u2019ve wanted to make MetaMask available to an international audience for a long time, but the adoption rate in Ethereum got to a point where we were really forced to spend much more of our time doing essential maintenance, like bug fixes, and getting the application working more smoothly. The translation initiative always seemed like something we weren\u2019t going to get around to until the project was either much more mature, or we had a much bigger team.We\u2019ve been trying to hire, as I think everyone in this space has been, and it\u2019s been really challenging to get people with the skill set to fully contribute to our project. Meanwhile, we\u2019d been gradually learning to post bounties to Gitcoin on outstanding issues, and had some pretty great early results with that strategy.\u2014 Dan Finlay, Lead Developer on MetaMaskIt was around that time that Dan reached out to Kevin Owocki at Gitcoin about a bounty specifically for unblocking internationalization.Opened in 2016\u2026 closed last\u00a0week!The Beginning: From \u2018Funded Issue\u2019 To \u2018Started\u00a0Work\u2019Issue funded on Jan 22\u2026 and a wild @mapmeld\u00a0appears!First, on January 22nd, 2018, a bounty of 0.4ETH was posted (then, $393).Nick Doiron (@mapmeld) came across the MetaMask Internationalization Bounty the same day on Gitcoin.Nick: I downloaded and started following MetaMask last year after I read about CryptoKitties and got interested in web3/Ethereum-based web apps. I saw a tweet from Gitcoin/RT from MetaMask that this would be available.Nick: I have some experience with internationalization. In 2015 I wrote a multilingual Chrome app which was a finalist in a contest for USAID/All Children Reading. So I figured I had the unique relevant experience to solve this.Working The Issue Alongside MetaMask / ConsenSysNick went on to complete the largest chunk of the pull request later that day, with intermittent thoughts from the MetaMask team.Nick: [The MetaMask team] gave clear instructions, such as which branch to work from (since MetaMask was in the middle of a UI redesign). I\u2019m also happy they believed I could do it and let me run with it. I came back partway through for some feedback and got thumbs ups, though I didn\u2019t know if it was going alright and how it would get merged.Dan: It\u2019s a little sad, but we were so wrapped up with launching the beta for our new user interface, that we didn\u2019t even get to properly validate his contribution for another month after that, and after a few small tweaks to make sure it was working well, we merged it.Great contribution, Nick Doiron!Nick: There was sort of a long time where no one was working on it and I was starting my new job. Probably a big factor in this was finishing up the new UI. Just recently, people were asking about translations again, and the Consensys guys got this merged in. I was glad my work got into the project!From Bounty to\u00a0EpicSee more\u00a0here!Nick\u2019s contribution to MetaMask opened up the floodgates to translations into a plethora of languages.Dan: Once we had merged in multiple language support from a bounty, it unblocked the path to all other translations, and what better way to get lots of different translations than with bounties from our community? A single tweet of publicity and we had something like 20 language requests, and 10 language pull requests. It\u2019s been total magic.MetaMask\u2019s recently opened epic aims to translate the product into Korean, Hindi, Tamil, Italian, Turkish, Thai, Portuguese, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, Dutch, Arabic, German, and Mandarin.We\u2019re excited that each one of these translations will be incentivized with a Gitcoin bounty of\u00a0.1 ETH ($58 USD).

the Blockchain: Brave with\u00a0MetaMaskBasic Attention TokenBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 26, 2018The decentralized web is there for exploring. Trails are being blazed with decentralized applications built on the Ethereum blockchain, with the MetaMask extension providing a bridge to explore and handle decentralized applications (Dapps) from a web browser.Following the October 2017 ETHWaterloo Hackathon, Brave became the first desktop web browser to suggest MetaMask upon visiting any Web3 site. Brave users see a notification that offers enabling MetaMask to view the content:Brave\u2019s MetaMask integration enables an additional level of awareness for mainstream users, providing notifications as they encounter sites that contain Dapps. Brave users don\u2019t simply browse, they discover and explore the blockchain ecosystem.Brave\u2019s MetaMask extension can also be installed via Settings even if the user does not initially visit a Web3 site. With the flip of a switch, Brave opens up a new world of decentralized applications, and the ability to connect with the Ethereum blockchain:What are\u00a0Dapps?The State of the DApps, a curated list of over 1320 decentralized apps, defines decentralized applications as:\u2026applications which run on a P2P network of computers, instead of one computer. They are considered to be a form of software program designed to function on the internet without being controlled by a single entity. \u00d0Apps can have front-end code and user interfaces written in any language, just like a traditional application, which can make calls to its backend.What is MetaMask?MetaMask is an account manager for Web3 applications, and it allows users to run Ethereum Dapps in their browser without running a full Ethereum node. Instead of trusting websites to manage your accounts, MetaMask allows you use your own Ethereum-based accounts on sites you visit, allowing everything from payments, fundraising, voting, peer to peer trading, and so much more, all without paying fractional transfer fees to middle-men, and with explicit, client-side user consent, so that no site can ever perform an action or transfer without the user\u2019s approval. Users new to Dapps or Ethereum should view this video or peruse an introduction guide to get familiar with MetaMask before initiating their first transaction.How MetaMask Works in\u00a0BraveWith Brave, you can be up-and-running with MetaMask in only a few seconds. Start by navigating to Preferences (CMD+, on macOS, Ctrl+, on Windows) and open the Extensions tab. From there, enable MetaMask and wait for the download and setup process to complete. Once the extension has been loaded, a new tab will open to MetaMask\u2019s How it Works page.Opening MetaMask for the first time (via the newly-placed icon near your address bar) will present you with the option of creating a new wallet or importing the seed terms for a pre-existing account. Once your account has been established, you can proceed to deposit Ether or begin exploring Dapps.As you browse the web, the MetaMask extension will inject a bit of code into every website, exposing the web3 API, and enabling Dapps to communicate with the MetaMask extension itself.Brave will inform you when you\u2019ve navigated to a Dapp if MetaMask isn\u2019t already enabled. If MetaMask is enabled, pages will be able to prompt you to login, initiate transactions, and more!Three Neat Things You Can Do with Brave and\u00a0MetaMaskPost bounties on GitHub issues with GitCoin.Make peer-to-peer trades with Airswap.io.CryptoKitties!Other options include registering names on ENS, which could eventually be used to link to websites, and using Aragon for transparency when managing an organization.More details about leading Dapps can be found here:http://www.stateofthedapps.com/Case Study: Using MetaMask in Brave with AirSwap.io for P2P Token\u00a0TradingIn this case study, we\u2019ll illustrate how a user can access AirSwap.io to purchase a Basic Attention Token (BAT) with Ethereum (ETH) using MetaMask in Brave.The user begins by navigating to https://www.airswap.io/trade.Brave notifies the user that AirSwap contains a Dapp, which can be accessed if MetaMask is enabled.The user clicks to install MetaMask, and checks the box to remember the decision for future use.Once enabled, the MetaMask icon appears next to the Brave shield menu icon.The user clicks on the MetaMask icon, and enters their MetaMask password to access their account.In this case study, the user already has some ETH in their MetaMask account.The user then clicks on the Connect button on the AirSwap page to open the wallet connection options.The user selects MetaMask from the wallet connection options.The user clicks the Sign button to allow the connection between AirSwap and MetaMask from the MetaMask menu.Once the connection has been established, the user selects BAT from the token options, and places a request to sellers to purchase 1 BAT.AirSwap searches for available sellers, and presents an offer to purchase the token.The user agrees to the offer in AirSwap, and then clicks Submit to confirm the offer in MetaMask.AirSwap then completes the purchase, and confirms success.The user can view the successful transaction in MetaMask, and also view the transaction from Etherscan.If the user wishes to view different tokens in MetaMask, they can also add the BAT contract address in the Token menu, and see the BAT they have purchased in MetaMask.FutureWe\u2019ll soon be announcing deeper integration with MetaMask and Ethereum in general with a built-in ETH Wallet, so stay tuned!A special thank you to Dan Finlay, Lead Developer from MetaMask, for his collaboration on this blog.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to buy AppCoin Tokens using\u00a0MetaMask", "author_name": "AppCoins Official", "link": "https://medium.com/@appcoins/how-to-buy-appcoin-tokens-using-metamask-e2024d0011e8?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 17, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "366", "content": "How to buy AppCoin Tokens using\u00a0MetaMaskAppCoins OfficialBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 17, 2017The AppCoins pre-sale is bullish, and there are only 3 days left to enter and get 30% discount on token price, until we hit the deadline on Monday, November 20th, 2017. We\u2019ve compiled a complete guide on how to participate here, but we thought we\u2019d make it easier and faster for you to buy your AppCoin tokens using MetaMask.MetaMask is more than just an Ether wallet, it is rather an Ethereum browser that allows you all the same functions, features and ease of access from regular Ethereum Wallets, and all without the need to download the blockchain or install any software. With MetaMask, you can just install it as a Google Chrome Extension, and you\u2019re good to purchase those tokens you\u2019ve been wanting to buy.Prerequisites:To follow this guide, you will need:A web browser.A certain amount of ether in the account that you control. Please notice, only ETH will be accepted for the AppCoins ICO.Getting StartedIf you don\u2019t have a ERC20-compatible address to send from, or ether (ETH) to contribute, start from Step 1. Otherwise, go to Step 5.Step 1: Creating an\u00a0accountFirst type \u201cmetamask chrome extension\u201d in to Google, and click the link that begins with https://chrome.google.com. You will be taken to the install page, where you can click \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d.Now you will see the Metamask fox in your browser tab.Click it to open your wallet.You will be prompted to create a secure password for your Metamask account. Make sure that the Ethereum Main Net network is selected (on the top left corner).Step 3: Importing an\u00a0AccountIf you have a private key or JSON file for a wallet already, you can import that wallet in to Metamask. Simply click \u201c\u2263\u201d at the top right, choose \u201cImport Account\u201d.You will need to input your raw private key into the \u201cprivate\u201d key field, or the typical JSON keystore file. Otherwise, you can select Create Account to generate a new one.Step 4: Getting\u00a0EtherTo be able to participate in the ICO, you will need to have some ether (ETH) in an account that you control. You can buy ETH from different cryptocurrency exchanges.Important Security RemindersDO NOT send ETH directly from an exchange, otherwise your tokens might never be recovered.There is no need to increase default gas price (or the value you are used to). Unless there is an unusual traffic in the Ethereum network, 30 GWEI should be enough to get the transaction confirmed in a few minutes.Step 5: Buying AppCoin\u00a0TokensThe pre-sale is open until November 20th, or whenever the supply of tokens reaches zero.Please ensure you are on our official and secure website. Our website address is: https://appcoins.io/presale\u00a0.This is the main page of https://appcoins.io. You\u2019ll see the \u201cGet AppCoins Now\u201d button. Click it, and you\u2019ll be taken to our onboarding page.This is the beginning of the pre-sale contribution process. You can find if you\u2019re eligible here. We require all contributors a small KYC composed by name, last name, date of birth, nationality, country of residence and passport/National ID number. Please noticed that this is only for registration purposes. Once you have done so, hit \u201cNext\u201d.This screen presents you with a dropdown list of compatible ERC20 token wallets. Please select the wallet you would like to use from the dropdown\u200a\u2014\u200afor the purposes of this tutorial, we will stick with MetaMask. Click \u201cContinue\u201d when you have selected your compatible wallet.MetaMask has made it easy for all of us, by filling in the information automaically. This means that after you log in on the MetaMask chrome extension, you won\u2019t need to fill in any of the information, as it will be automatically added based on the information you provided on previous steps.To purchase AppCoin tokens, all you will need to do is to send a transaction to the address listed on the page, with the amount of ETH you want to contribute. In order to do so, just open Metamask and click \u201cSend\u201d, and paste in the address copied from our contribution page. Set the value equal to the amount of ETH you want to send.One last step is to add the token to your MetaMask, so you can see your balance. Click \u201cAdd Token\u201d, and paste in the following information:Address: 0x1a7a8bd9106f2b8d977e08582dc7d24c723ab0db\u00a0Decimals: 18Token Symbol: APPCAnd that\u2019s it!When your transaction has been mined and entered into the blockchain, you will be able to see it under \u201cTokens\u201d in your Metamask account.Thank you for participating in the AppCoins ICO.

You can use your Metamask seeds words, or an address private key.Let\u2019s get started using seed words.Install the Nifty Wallet chrome extension from the chrome store here.2. Click the extension in the top right of your browser and accept the T&Cs.3. Choose Import Existing Den and paste your Metamask seeds words into the Nifty Wallet.4. Choose a password, and that\u2019s it! You can now use your same addresses on both networks.Nifty Wallet is a fork of MetaMask that can also use POA\u00a0NetworkImporting a private key from Metamask is even easier.Log into Metamask and from the menu beside your account, choose: Export Private Key.2. Enter your password and click the button to copy your key to the clipboard.3. Open Nifty Wallet, choose Import Account from the user menu (top right).4. You can then paste the key into the wallet and you are all set!Your key imported account will have red\u00a0tag.You are now ready to start also using the POA Network for fast, cheap transactions and of course to play great games like DopeRaider here.To find out more and meet us come to:Website: https://doperaider.com/Discord: https://discord.gg/trEA8AY\u00a0Telegram: https://t.me/DopeRaiderEmail: team@doperaider.comTwitter: https://twitter.com/doperaiderReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/doperaider/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DopeRaider/Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/playdoperaider/?hl=enMedium: https://medium.com/@DopeRaider", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Using Custom DAY Token Tool alpha with\u00a0Metamask", "author_name": "ChronoLogic", "link": "https://blog.chronologic.network/using-chronos-alpha-with-metamask-58eeb94cdfcb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 14, 2017", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "106", "content": "Using Custom DAY Token Tool alpha with\u00a0MetamaskChronoLogicBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 14, 2017Our soon to be released Alpha Version of the Custom DAY Token Tool is already available for public testing. Although it doesn\u2019t deploy into the Ethereum Testnet (Ropsten) yet, you can check out how it is going to work, graphics and also its functionalities.In this blog article we\u2019re going to walk you through on how to use and understand everything that will be possible as soon as this first Alpha version is completely deployed.First of all, since we\u2019re talking about a dApp (Decentralized Application) you\u2019ll need to have MetaMask extension installed on your browser. In order to do that, you might go to MetaMask.io and follow the page instructions on how to do it.Secondly, for now you really don\u2019t need to do anything on the Ethereum Mainnet, which means you also don\u2019t have to spend any amount of Ether with this. So, once your MetaMask is installed properly, click on its Icon, type in your password, and change your connection to \u201cRopsten Test Network\u201d.Once this is done, now it\u2019s time to get some testnet Ether, so you can broadcast transactions properly. To do so, click \u201cBUY\u201d and then select \u201cROPSTEN TEST FAUCET\u201d.This will take you to the Ropsten Test Faucet, a dApp that will send you testnet ETH for free, but only one at a time. For that, click \u201crequest 1 ether from faucet\u201d and then scroll down if you want to check the txHash for this transaction. Once the ETH is already on your MetaMask, we can proceed to exploring the work we\u2019ve already done with the Custom DAY Token Tool.The Chronos\u00a0PlatformOnce your MetaMask has testnet Ether from the faucet and is also unlocked, you can direct yourself to https://alpha.chronologic.network/. Firstly the dApp will notify that you\u2019re connected to Testnet. Don\u2019t worry about it at this point, just click \u201cOK\u201d and keep going forward.Now, click \u201cSTART\u201d and let\u2019s see what the Platform has in store for us. The first customization you may choose is the Token Name and Token Symbol, which can basically be whatever you want. For this tutorial, we\u2019ll fill in the form as if we were making the same version of the day token as the one already deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. Once you have filled these fields properly, click \u201cCONTINUE\u201d.After that we\u2019ll get to a page where you\u2019ll be able to introduce the minting parameters for your customized version of the DAY token.Now, filling the fields, the MINIMUM and MAX MINTING POWER are basically the ChronoPower your customized DAY token version will have. You can create a self-minting token that will be extremely inflationary or not, it\u2019s really up to you. Here you can also customize how long is your HALVING CYCLE, which is dependent of the MINTING PERIOD IN SEC. For example, if you set the minting period in sec for a whole day, then the halving cycle will count each day as a cycle. Same is true if you set it up for an hour or even an year. Once you\u2019ve placed there all your data, click \u201cCONTINUE\u201d.Next step is the \u201cCONTRACT SETUP\u201d. Here you are able to setup vital settings to your own customized DAY token smart contract. Now, let\u2019s breakdown each one of them.MAX ADDRESSES: The number of self-minting addresses your contract will have, for ChronoLogic this number is 3333.STARTING ID FOR TEAM\u2019S MINTING ADDRESS: Here you can setup how far from the top your team will have their Time Mints assigned. For ChronoLogic this value is 3227.TOTAL TEAM\u2019S MINTING ID: The total of self-minting addresses that will be ever assigned as a team minter. In ChronoLogic this value is 18.TEAM LOCK PERIOD IN SECONDS: The main advantage of setting up team minting ids is also being able to lock it up for as long as you see fit. In ChronoLogic the team minting IDs are locked up for 31536000 seconds, which converts to 1 year lock up.POST DEPLOYMENT MAX IDS: Basically, after you deploy your contract, this model allows you to assign more TimeMints, as long as you set things up during this process. For ChronoLogic the number for this is 88.MINIMUM BALANCE TO TRANSFER A MINTER: As the TimeMint has value it self since it can generate new tokens, there\u2019s might also be a restrictive amount to transfer it using the TimeTx process. For ChronoLogic this value is 8888.Once you filled all these fields, click \u201cCONTINUE\u201d.On step #4, \u201cPUBLISH\u201d, you are able to revise all the data you input to the dApp and check if that\u2019s really what you want to deploy. Once the Custom DAY Token Tool is 100% live, after clicking \u201cDEPLOY\u201d you won\u2019t be able to change anything unless you start everything over again, having to pay more DAY tokens for it + ETH for Gas. If you are satisfied with your parameters, click \u201cDEPLOY\u201d.After that you\u2019ll be taken to a page that says \u201cDeploying\u2026\u201d and MetaMask will prompt you to submit a transaction, which will basically create your customized DAY token smart contract, one with all the parameters you just inserted on the dApp.Once you click \u201cSUBMIT\u201d on MetaMask, the dApp will give you a Transaction Hash (txHash), which might take some time to be actually confirmed by the network. Clicking on the link provided you\u2019ll be able to check its progress.As soon as the transaction is mined, the dApp will take you to the \u201cWATCH PAGE\u201d automatically. There you\u2019ll be able to allocate tokens and also Self-minting addresses at will. But first, you need to take ownership of the smart-contract you just created.Once the dApp prompts you for that, simply click \u201cOK\u201d and submit the transaction requested from MetaMask.Now you are able to allocate tokens and TimeMints to whatever ETH address you want. Please note that since we\u2019re talking about the Ethereum Ropsten Testnet Network, whenever you need more ETH to keep this going, just refer to the steps above and get more testnet ETH.Allocating Tokens and TimeMintsOnce you have ownership of your smart-contract, you can now allocate as many tokens you want to whichever ETH address you wish. In order to do that, scroll down a bit and fill the required fields.In a nutshell, these fields mean:RECEIVER\u2019S ADDRESS: ETH address you wish to send the tokens to and also wants to become a self-minting address for your new smart-contract.TIMEMINT TOKENS: Amount of tokens initially sent to such ETH address.ETH VALUE: Accepts only numbers greater than 0 and is designed to keep track if you had ETH in exchange for those tokens/self-minting address.TIMEMINT ID: ID number of the TimeMint you\u2019re assigning. For our ChronoLogic mock contract, this number can be from 1 to 3227.IS THIS A TEAM MEMBER?: If you check this box, it will automatically give out a TimeMint with the lock down period and the specific IDs you\u2019ve reserved for the \u201cTeam TimeMints\u201d while filling up the dApp. For example, if you place \u201c1\u201d on \u201cTIMEMINT ID\u201d and check this box, the real TimeMint ID for this assignment would be TimeMint #3228, which is the first one for the Team, and so on.Once you\u2019ve filled up all fields accordingly, press \u201cALLOCATE\u201d and MetaMask you prompt you with a transaction which will send out the tokens and mark such address as a new TimeMint on your smart-contract.Now, scrolling down you\u2019ll see that the txHash is being accounted for in the dApp, and it will keep logging all assignments you shall make.After you have assigned all TimeMints you want assigned initially and also ALL THE INITIAL TOKENS YOU WILL ASSIGN, now it\u2019s time to release the tokens, which will make them tradeable and also kickstart the minting process.Please note that once you do that, there\u2019s will be no way of creating more tokens for this smart-contract, except for those minted inside self-minting addresses.To do that, scroll back up, and click \u201cRELEASE TOKENS\u201d.Once the tokens are released, you will only be able to assigning \u201cPOST-DEPLOYMENT TIMEMINTS\u201d, which bears no tokens and are available only up to the amount of those you\u2019ve selected before.That\u2019s it for now folks! Once we have more updates we\u2019ll be pleased to announce. For more info on ChronoLogic or the Custom DAY Token Tool, you might want to attend to our coming webinar on Jan 19th.

The 36-hour event, from October 13 to 15, was organized by a volunteer group of enthusiasts of Ethereum, the blockchain-based technology invented by Vitalik Buterin.Our team, comprised of Aubrey Keus, Sergey Zhukovsky, Anthony Tseng, and Kamil Jozwiak, had been selected to participate from a pool of over 1000 developers. This was the largest gathering of developers in the Ethereum community to date, and was meant to encourage the community to learn about and build decentralized applications on Ethereum.Our CTO, Brian Bondy, had also been invited to be one of the judges (full disclosure: he did not judge our team\u2019s submission, as they were evaluated by different judges). Our team was selected as one of the eight final winners by integrating MetaMask into the Brave browser and adding detection for DApps, making the Brave browser a first-class citizen of the blockchain ecosystem.Having MetaMask as an extension in Brave enables users to simplify Ethereum testing and development, and allows the Brave browser to natively handle a wide range of previously deployed \u00d0Apps. To activate MetaMask, the team implemented several missing Google Chrome extension APIs into the Brave browser in C++ and JavaScript. The team also added independent detection for \u00d0Apps when the extension is not installed, and a one-click install prompt display when visiting \u00d0Apps.\u201cWe\u2019re proud of asking the user to install MetaMask when a \u00d0App is detected because it will mean a lot more users of MetaMask,\u201d said Aubrey. \u201cShipping this feature to our user base will open up a wide set of applications previously not available to our users on the Brave browser,\u201d added Serg.Final submissions were evaluated by twenty-two judges, including Vitalik Buterin, Founder of Ethereum, Joey Krug, Founder of Augur, Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, Founder of Gnosis, and Jeff Coleman, Founder of Ledger Labs. Judges evaluated hacks based on creativity, technical difficulty, design, and usefulness.Judges were split into four rooms and each room evaluated over twenty submissions. Judges picked two winning teams from each room. The Brave team was selected by Vitalik\u2019s room and Brian Bondy was judging in a different room.\u201cThere were so many great submissions, it was challenging to pick just two winners. Several of the projects had usefulness in the real world beyond the hackathon itself, which speaks to the reach that Ethereum now has,\u201d said Brian.The team showed a demo of the MetaMask integration to all ETHWaterloo attendees during the closing ceremony. They then added support for the extension in the Brave browser for the desktop (0.19.53), which was shipped to the entire Brave userbase the following day. In the future, the team will work on building mobile \u00d0App support for our Android and iOS browsers.We\u2019re grateful to the organizers of ETHWaterloo for bringing together our global community of Ethereum developers and for this opportunity to develop applications for the blockchain that are immediately applicable to users.

ONLY ETHER WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR THE ICO. Do not send any other cryptocurrency to the addresses mentioned in this article.Getting StartedIf you don\u2019t have a ERC20-compatible address to send from, or ether (ETH) to contribute, start from Step 1. Otherwise, go to Step 5.Step 1: Creating an\u00a0accountFirst type \u201cmetamask chrome extension\u201d in to Google, and click the link that begins with https://chrome.google.com. You will be taken to the install page, where you can click \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d.Now you will see the Metamask fox in your browser tab.Click it to open your wallet.You will be prompted to create a secure password for your Metamask account. Do so. Make sure that the Ethereum Main Net network is selected (on the top left corner).Step 3: Importing an\u00a0AccountIf you have a private key or JSON file for a wallet already, you can import that wallet in to Metamask. Simply click \u201c\u2263\u201d at the top right, choose \u201cImport Account\u201d.You will need to input your raw private key into the \u201cprivate\u201d key field, or the typical JSON keystore file. Otherwise, you can select Create Account to generate a new one.Step 4: Getting\u00a0EtherTo be able to participate in the ICO, you will need to have some ether (ETH) in an account that you control.You can buy ETH from different exchanges using a plethora of currencies. Note: just like purchasing Bitcoins, there are fees associated with every transaction. So sending 1 ether will not exactly give you back the amount of tokens that you expect, it will be slightly less.WARNING: Do not send ether directly from an exchange to our contribution address. It is possible that you will lose those tokens. We suggest buying ether on exchanges, and sending that ether over to your own privately controlled account in MyEtherWallet. Then, you can safely contribute directly to our crowdfunding address from there.Step 5: Buying FUEL\u00a0TokensThe ICO will be active from October 1, 9 AM. PDT, and will close on October 29, 9 AM.

The Bithereum oracle triggers the issuance of BTH from the ETH holder BTH allocation generated from the Bithereum genesis block.Without further ado, here are the steps for redeeming BTH using MetaMask.Step 1: Open\u00a0MetaMaskLog into the MetaMask Chrome Extension and choose the send option.Step 2: Add the hex version of your BTH address to your transactionNote: If you don\u2019t have a hex version of your BTH address or have not created a BTH address, go here before proceeding with this step: https://medium.com/bithereum-network/btc-eth-holder-redemption-guide-for-bth-72d6632b04afPaste the HEX output BTH address you generated earlier into the field under \u201cTransaction Data (Optional)\u201d.Step 3: Provide redemption contract\u00a0addressNext, input the following Bithereum redemption contract address into the \u201cTo Address\u201d field:0x3C2C10e5Ecd073D9ee238493D338Ec6e3d7281C6Enter 0.0 ETH into the \u201camount\u201d field, then click \u201cNext\u201d.Step 4: Generate and send your 0 ETH transactionConfirm that everything was entered in accurately, and proceed with the transaction by clicking \u201cSubmit\u201d.Step 5: Confirm redemptionYou can now verify that your redemption process was successful by looking for your successful transaction directly on the BTH Redemption smart contract using Etherscan.Congratulations, you have successfully redeemed your BTH!

Take Coinmine for example. Coinmine takes an exorbitant amount of fees compared to other at-home mining/staking-as-a-service companies.But these fees are warranted. Coinmine is a gamified product\u200a\u2014\u200athe ultimate work-play station. Users are drawn to a beautiful interface, the experience akin to Robinhood or other applications. Users can make a ROI and bet on cryptocurrencies with no skin-in-the-game besides opportunity cost by choosing what they want to mine.But there\u2019s an opportunity looming in the horizon \u2014Mining & staking services can be bundled with cryptogaming products to create gamified experiences to earn money within games without the need to create a new token. Consumer mining and staking-as-as-service companies have an opportunity to embrace games as a marketing medium for consumers. Future profit earnings for providing work to a network can be hidden as prizes in games for consumers, encouraging them to do more work in the network.For example, if rent-seekers like consumer-mining companies take 10% ETH as a fee for mining ETH, users will be able to \u201cearn\u201d back 5% by completing certain levels within a game. Hardware mining/staking devices will be able to power games and distribute various cryptocurrencies using state channels/LN throughout games and provide an additional incentive to keep mining or staking.With this model, entertainment will slowly blend with work. But are we willing to sacrifice some additional earnings for our own entertainment? Or will we want to maximize on revenues?

Here\u2019s\u00a0HowBigbomBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 11, 2018How to easily use\u00a0MetaMaskMetaMask is a plugin on browsers that facilitate the adoption of Ethereum. For average users, who are using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera or Brave as their browser, MetaMask lets you run dApps without being part of the Ethereum networking as an Ethereum node.With this add-on, your websites can restore user data on the Blockchain, letting them securely manage identities and sign transactions. Basically, MetaMask helps you manage your Ethereum wallet and allows you to send and receive Ethers through a dApp of interest (One of them is Bigbom Marketplace, a transparent economy). Thanks to Metamask, the technology has become more user-friendly as a growing number of people can easily get access to the Ethereum ecosystem through popular Web browsers.So, how can I install and use Metamask?If that question appears in your mind right now, you are in the right place then! In this article, we will go through the step-by-step guidelines on how to master this browser plugin.First thing first, follow this link and install MetaMask as an extension on Google Chrome:Metamask installation for ChromeOnce installed, it will ask you to agree to the terms of use and create your password.Next, you need to save your 12-word mnemonic phrase (seed phrase) carefully. This computer-generated string of words is used to restore your Metamask accounts.Important: The best way to save this crucial phrase is to write it down on paper and keep them somewhere safe.Then you are asked to manually arrange the order of that seed phrase, once for all.Illustration for Meta Mask seed\u00a0phraseAfter that, you\u2019re fully ready to explore all the features MetaMask provides.To practice using Meta Mask, we should have access to the testnet instead of the mainnet to perform our free transactions (test ones).

In the meantime, our current help desk system has been patched and is no longer susceptible to this vulnerabilityIf you think you may have been affected by the breach, you should immediately follow the instructions in the \u201dRecommendations\u201d section belowA note on account access and security:If during the ticket resolution process you shared either your MetaMask 12 word seed phrase or your account\u2019s private key, we strongly urge that you both migrate to a new seed phrase and transfer your assets to a known secure address. We have provided resources below in the \u201cRecommendations\u201d section to assist you through this process. As a reminder: Please do not share your private key or seed words with anyone. The MetaMask team will never ask for or encourage you to share this information.What Happened?On December 8th, 2017, HappyFox notified the MetaMask team that their software had been the subject of a data security incident, where tickets were accessed and viewable by an external party. MetaMask software and infrastructure was in no way compromised. Only MetaMask users who consented to use this third party help desk service when submitting tickets are affected by the breach. The general population of MetaMask users remain unaffected.After discussing the incident with HappyFox as well as conducting an internal security review, we must conclude that the following information from MetaMask user support tickets between the dates of June 27th, 2017 and December 7th, 2017 was leaked to an unknown external third party:Support user contact namesEmail addressesPhone numbers (if voluntarily shared by the end-user)Ticket body contentContact messages/repliesStaff messages/repliesWe never ask for nor encourage users to share sensitive data in any circumstance. As MetaMask stores and encrypts all data associated with accounts locally on the browser, we never ask for users to send their seed phrases or private keys. However, we feel we must alert the community to the potential threat to users\u2019 security and privacy.If during the ticket resolution process you shared either your MetaMask 12 word seed phrase or your account\u2019s private key, we strongly urge that you both migrate to a new seed phrase and transfer your assets to a known secure address. We have provided resources below in the \u201cRecommendations\u201d section to assist you through this process.Who Was Affected?The security incident resulted in 94% of all MetaMask tickets between the dates of June 27th, 2017 and December 7th, 2017 were exposed to an unknown individual through use of HappyFox\u2019s software print ticket function.When Did This Occur?The incident occurred on December 7th, 2017, when at 21:08:34 (UTC) HappyFox, our external help desk solution, began observing an uncommonly large number of requests from a set of IPs on their end. By 21:20:05 (UTC) that same day, HappyFox had identified and applied a patch to mitigate the issue. Shortly thereafter, at 22:08:25 (UTC), the individual exploiting the data leak made contact with HappyFox. MetaMask staff were alerted of the data leak the following day on December 8th, 2017. MetaMask\u2019s account was one of several vendor accounts that were subject to the leak.Where Did This Happen?The data leak occurred on the third party\u2019s ticketing software, a service that they have hosted on Amazon Web Services. HappyFox does not know the legal identity or the geographic location of the individual responsible for the data leak.Why Did This Happen?The reason for the data leak and its subsequent exploitation is unknown at this time. The proof of concept used by the individual responsible for the data leak was used directly on HappyFox\u2019s live environment without their explicit permission or knowledge. Only after conducting and validating the proof of concept on HappyFox\u2019s live environment did the individual make first contact with HappyFox in attempts to secure compensation in the form of a bug bounty. As of December 15th, 2017, the individual had not yet received compensation from HappyFox for identifying and acting on the data leak exploit, and it must also be noted that HappyFox is in the process of establishing their bug bounty program. We are continuing to investigate the extent of the data leak.How Did This Happen?Based on discussions with HappyFox, It seems the individual created a script to loop through URLs and pull data from their software\u2019s print ticket function through the exploitation of broken authentication business logic. The print ticket function has since been disabled and the attack vector is no longer valid. To reiterate, this security incident occurred only on HappyFox\u2019s end. MetaMask\u2019s software and infrastructure remain untouched and intact.RecommendationsWe advise that you use this incident as an opportunity to revisit your security practices by migrating to a new 12 word seed phrase and moving all assets to known secure addresses.

This means that after we release MetaMask version 3.0.0, a small number of users will have seed phrases that now generate different accounts.Fortunately for these users, we\u2019ve gone to some lengths to ensure a smooth transition.You Still Have Your Old Accounts!It took some work, but for a limited time, we are still migrating old vaults into the new format as well as recovering the affected accounts.

With it, you can always re-generate all your accounts on any machine you like, in the same order, every time. This is cool technique called HD Trees, or Hierarchical Derivation Trees, and has some history in Bitcoin.While we were able to recover the old accounts, your seed phrase will no longer recover those accounts, and so if you have accounts like this, you should immediately export them and back them up, or maybe just transfer their balances to accounts that are part of your HD Tree.You can export a MetaMask account using the key button on the main account panel:Sorry if you hit this issue, but rest assured that we made this change so that we would be more compatible with the wider ecosystem, so it should be a good change in the long term.\u00a0\u00a0If you\u2019re curious about what caused this bug, you can read a good write-up about it here.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Tutorial | Setting up your\u00a0MetaMask", "author_name": "Democracy Earth", "link": "https://words.democracy.earth/tutorial-setting-up-your-metamask-186414589d3a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 13, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "36", "content": "Tutorial | Setting up your\u00a0MetaMaskDemocracy EarthBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 13, 2018", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "CoinSwitch Is Integrated Into MetaMask\u00a0Wallet", "author_name": "CoinSwitch", "link": "https://blog.coinswitch.co/coinswitch-is-integrated-into-metamask-wallet-db710001c2b3?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 12", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "62", "content": "CoinSwitch Is Integrated Into MetaMask\u00a0WalletCoinSwitchBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 12We are very excited to announce our integration with MetaMask\u200a\u2014\u200athe most widely used Ethereum wallet.

By the nature of how blockchain transactions work there are many things that can make it difficult to determine whether a transaction was successful:Did I send to the right address?Did I send enough?Was my gas limit high enough?Was my gas rate high enough?Was it confirmed within a reasonable time period?As a merchant, did I get enough crypto at the current exchange rate to cover my costs?All of these questions are things that the end user shouldn\u2019t have to care about. Paying for things and sending crypto from one address to another should JustWork\u2122. End users shouldn\u2019t need to necessarily know about the underlying mechanics of how the protocol works and what could go wrong, just like we don\u2019t all need to know how credit card readers take payments from this plastic disk we hold in our wallets.At best, blockchain UX issues create confusion for the end user. At worst you end up with lost money, transactions that never complete, angry customers, loss of trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and reduced adoption.No bueno.Coming back to our mission at Bidali\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re building tools that power a more open global financial system. So we decided to start to address some of the issues that plague many of the current crypto-payment solutions.Underpaid TransactionsGiven how varied the level of quality of crypto wallets is, it\u2019s really easy to mess up a payment. Even pulling the amount from a QR code is inconsistent across many wallets. At the time of writing the published version of Trust Wallet doesn\u2019t do it. Jaxx is also pretty inconsistent. It\u2019s far too easy to fat finger an amount of 0.00143567 BTC.It\u2019s also a common problem that people send from exchange addresses. Even though it\u2019s not a good idea to use an exchange wallet as your regular wallet, the major issue with regards to payments is that exchanges typically deduct their withdrawal fees from the total withdrawn amount. Unless the customer calculated a new amount to compensate for this it results in an underpayment. Many payment platforms like Coinbase Commerce push an underpayment on to the end user or the merchant to sort out. However, doing that makes accepting crypto more onerous. If we want real adoption it needs to be at least as easy as current payment methods, ideally better.So, we decided to improve that and actually detect when the customer has underpaid or overpaid and we give the merchant and the customer the ability to resolve this easily themselves. Here is an example of underpaying from Bittrex and then topping up the payment to be the correct amount.Overpaid TransactionsOn the merchant side we\u2019re also showing the status of all these different transactions. Whether it was overpaid, underpaid, timed out, or still processing. This makes it easier for the merchant to determine the best course of action\u200a\u2014\u200awhether they should refund the amount or complete the order.Another thing we decided to add was support for Metamask. Now if you have the browser plugin installed and unlocked you can pay directly from Metamask. \ud83d\ude4cMore AwesomeDuring the initial beta test of our gift card site we received some amazing feedback. Thank you! \ud83d\ude4fAs a result we also updated a bunch of other things:Handling underpaid transactions that are never topped up during the time limitSome UI style tweaks and bug fixes to make things more clearSupport for Internet Explorer and other less popular browsersUpdates to the gift card emails so that they display beautifully on all email clientsWhew!

Seed words are also known as a Recovery Phrase. You\u2019ll use this random list of words if you lose your password and need to recover your funds and wallet.It is highly recommended that you write these words down and keep them in a safe place or save the seed words as a file and then password protect it.Many people skip this process and end up losing access to their wallet entirely. PLEASE DO NOT SKIPIt is recommended to keep multiple copies of your seed words in different places. It\u2019s not advisable to take pictures of your seed words or make digital copies of them.You should not store them in your email, cloud storage, or your phone\u2019s photo library as if you are hacked you could lose your wallet and funds. If you must keep them in email or cloud storage make sure they are encrypted with at least an 8 character complex password.5) Add Custom TokenOnce you\u2019ve confirmed your seed words are saved securely your wallet is ready! Please add Jinbi Token to your wallet by selecting add custom token.Below are the details you require.Insert Jinbi Contract Address:0x21d5a14e625d767ce6b7a167491c2d18e0785fdaTicker: JNBDecimals: 18Confirm the above and you have successfully created your ERC 20 compatible JNB account.

Imagine a system where voting on the future state of the world can be done from the comfort of your home. Imagine a place where there are no illusions of what is going on, where the open community comes first.MetaMask is your gateway into this world of decentralized applications\u00a0, or DApps\u00a0, on the Ethereum blockchain!Why use MetaMask?MetaMask is an easily accessible way to access the blockchain network through a user friendly interface. No more setting up your own node on your local machine to interact with the blockchain\u00a0, a Chrome extension is all you need!MetaMask also provides a wallet interface for users to view their LightWallet ether balances, as well as enable sending ether like a normal wallet client.MetaMask is available from the Chrome Web Store. With a couple of clicks, you can get MetaMask up and running on your browser!Getting started using\u00a0MetaMaskMetaMask is a Google Chrome extension that is easily accessible from the Chrome Web Store.Let\u2019s Talk PermissionsBefore we dive in, let\u2019s address a few issues concerning the installation permissions. An extension that can \u201cread and change all your data on the websites you visit\u201d would make most reasonable people nervous! In order for MetaMask to enable DApps to access the blockchain, MetaMask injects a web3 Javascript object into each page. The extension is not changing the website, it is simply giving it access to the network in order to function properly.Getting StartedHere, we\u2019ll walk through a few of MetaMask\u2019s key features, specifically regarding transactions and confirmation of transactions requested by DApps.Setting Up Your\u00a0AccountIf you already have a LightWallet, you can restore your vault with the vault\u2019s seed words. If not, have no fear, you can create a new vault to hold and generate your wallets easily!When you first create a vault, you will be prompted to save a certain number of seed words. These words can be used by MetaMask to regenerate your vault if need be, as well as enabling the creation of new wallets within your vault.Store these seed words somewhere safe! Although MetaMask gives you the option to see your seed words, we recommend storing your seed words physically in the event that the MetaMask software fails. MetaMask is still in its development stage, so we don\u2019t recommend storing large amounts of ETH in your MetamMask wallets just yet.The InterfaceMoving forward, you should be taken to your first wallet, which looks something like this:The arrows corresponds to the following:Pink: This is your editable wallet nickname. Underneath is a portion of the public key, or the hexadecimal address that uniquely identifies your wallet.Teal: These buttons copy your wallet address to the clipboard and allow you to export your private keys.Red: This indicates the current network. Clicking it will open a drop down menu to switch to the Main Ethereum Network, the Morden Test Network, or your own network of choice.Green: This button will take you to a page that will allow you to switch accounts.Below the current wallet information is a list of outgoing transactions from the current wallet with relevant information. Clicking the transaction itself will link you to an etherscan page with more detailed information.Sending ether to another address is simple. MetaMask will help guard you against sending to invalid addresses, as well as initiating transactions that send more ether than the current wallet contains. Before a transaction is actually executed, a notification pops up allowing you to confirm the transaction and examine relevant details.Don\u2019t worry if you close the notification\u00a0, the extension popup will prompt you to approve or reject any pending transactions the next time it\u2019s opened.Here, the accounts page shows an overview of your current wallets, a convenient button to copy wallet addresses, as well as the option to generate more wallets as needed.Final NotesWhile we encourage users to test out and play around with our software, please keep in mind that MetaMask is still in active development. With that in mind, we encourage users to refrain from handling large amounts of ether on the main Ethereum network using MetaMask. We recommend executing all testing or experimentation on the Morden Test Network or a local network of your choosing to mitigate these risks.Similarly, if you do find any bugs, have any feature requests, or would like to leave a comment, please contact us at help@metamask.io or leave an issue in our MetaMask GitHub repository.We wish you the best in exploring the world of Ethereum and DApps using MetaMask. It\u2019s an exciting new frontier out there; we\u2019re happy to be the key that unlocks it for you!Further info:Download here: Chrome Web StoreContact us: help@metamask.io or hello@metamask.ioWebsite: metamask.ioGithub: https://github.com/MetaMask/hello", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "How to see your DAY tokens via\u00a0MetaMask", "author_name": "ChronoLogic", "link": "https://blog.chronologic.network/how-to-see-your-day-tokens-via-metamask-17b3a1b066f3?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 15, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "51", "content": "How to see your DAY tokens via\u00a0MetaMaskChronoLogicBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 15, 2017One of the simplest and safer way of managing an Ethereum wallet is with Chrome\u2019s extension MetaMask. Using cryptography directly from your browser, MetaMask connects you directly to the Ethereum Network, allowing easy access to the Blockchain.However, sometimes there are doubts on how to visualize ERC-20 tokens balance within MetaMask, such as DAY tokens.Now, let\u2019s cover the details about how to visualize your DAY tokens balance via MetaMask and also discuss how you can transfer them whenever you want.Step #1: Open MetaMask extension and unlock your wallet using the password.Step #2: Select the tab \u201cTOKENS\u201d.Step #3: Now, click on \u201cADD TOKEN\u201d.Step #4: At this point we must have the contract\u2019s number that deployed the contract for such token, in this case, ChronoLogic\u2019s contract for DAY tokens. So, paste the address: 0xE814aeE960a85208C3dB542C53E7D4a6C8D5f60F\u00a0; replace the field \u201cToken Symbol\u201d with \u201cDAY\u201d and leave the \u201cDecimals of Precision\u201d in 18. After that, click \u201cADD\u201d.That\u2019s it, now you can visualize your DAY tokens balance safely and easily via MetaMask.Although, if you want to send them, for an exchange or another wallet, you\u2019ll need to use MyEtherWallet(MEW). But don\u2019t worry, for that MetaMask and MEW have a special integration allowing the use of MEW while you enjoy the safety of MetaMask.Whenever you want to move your tokens, DAY or any other ERC-20 tokens, follow these steps:Step #1: Unlock your MetaMask wallet.Step #2: Enter MyEtherWallet\u2019s website and select \u201cSend Ether & Tokens\u201d.Step #3: Mark the option \u201cMetaMask/Mist\u201d and click on \u201cConnect to MetaMask\u201d.Step #4: Scroll down the page and select \u201cAdd Custom Token\u201d.Step #5: Now, repeat \u201cStep #4\u201d from the tutorial above, inserting the address of the contract, token name and define \u201cDecimals\u201d to 18. After that, click \u201cSave\u201d.There you go! Now you can already visualize your available tokens via MyEtherWallet. In order to send them, fill as usual the fields shown below with the receiver address, amount and Gas Limit. The only thing \u201cnew\u201d to do here is select \u201cDAY\u201d or the token you wish where the arrow shows.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "link": "https://medium.com/@danfinlay/hi-there-dan-from-the-metamask-team-here-the-metamask-column-has-a-few-deceptive-marks-a890b7727b08?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 19, 2016", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "2", "content": "Dan FinlayBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 19, 2016Hi there, Dan from the MetaMask team here.The MetaMask column has a few deceptive marks:Multi-Device Pairing (yes, how not?)DAO Withdraw (easily possible with a web dapp, although this feature is now meaningless since that contract is over)Dapp Store (there are actually a couple Dapp stores, but they\u2019re normal websites, not belonging to MetaMask proper).Chain Agnostic (It lets you point at any provider you want, and so is very chain agnostic).Custom Node (Why only a half moon here?

But one piece of software lets you not only store and manage your tokens, but also interact with Ethereum-powered DApps directly in your browser\u200a\u2014\u200athat tool is called MetaMask.A Closer Look at\u00a0MetaMaskMetaMask is a web browser extension that functions as an Ethereum wallet. It is compatible with the Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera browsers. Since it\u2019s an extension, you can install it like a typical Google or Firefox add-on.Aside from using MetaMask as a wallet, users can sign smart contracts and interface with distributed Ethereum-based applications or DApps with it. All of these functions work without users having to run a full Ethereum node. And like other types of Ethereum wallets, MetaMask can store other Ethereum-related data, such as private keys and public addresses. Most importantly, MetaMask enables websites that have Ethereum-based DApps to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.In a way, MetaMask transforms your ordinary browser into an Ethereum browser. The biggest advantage is that it saves time and effort: you do not have to run all your Ethereum software because MetaMask runs all the software on their servers.MetaMask and\u00a0DAppsAs mentioned above, MetaMask interacts with Ethereum-based DApps. And what\u200a\u2014\u200ayou may be asking\u200a\u2014\u200aare DApps? The name refers to \u201cdecentralized applications\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning, they are apps, but there is no central entity that controls them.The term \u201cdecentralized\u201d implies that all the records of the applications\u2019 activities and operation are available to the public. In addition, DApps connect businesses and consumers directly, instead of relying on a middleman. This direct communication makes decision-making easier for both parties, and waiting times shorter.Two of the most popular DApps these days that interact with MetaMask are CryptoKitties and ETHLand.Let us take a look at these DApps and see where MetaMask comes in.CryptoKittiesCryptoKitties is an Ethereum-based game that allows users to buy, raise, breed, and trade their digital cats. Since it is Ethereum-based, all of these transactions happen using Ether instead of fiat money. From time to time, when the market is right, certain unique breeds can command a very high price. The game needs MetaMask to communicate with the blockchain.ETHLendETHLend is a smart-contract based platform on which users can easily borrow or lend Ethereum. Users on the platform place their Ether in a smart contract loan, offering several ERC-20 tokens as collateral. If the borrower successfully repays the loan, the lender earns interest along with the Ether that was lent. However, if the borrower fails to pay, the lender can claim all of the collateral put up for the loan.ETHLend currently works using an online DApp that is only accessible through MetaMask. If you try to open the DApp without MetaMask, you will get an error screen.Installing and Using\u00a0MetaMaskInstalling MetaMask in your browser is pretty easy. First, go to their website to download the tool. Choose the Chrome browser, even if you are using Firefox or Opera. Once you have it, click the \u201cAdd extension\u201d link. A privacy notice \u201cAccept\u201d will pop up followed by the \u201cTerms of Use\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aclick both of them.After you sign up, you will be given 12 seed words that you need to copy and store offline. These are the words you will need to use if you ever have to restore your MetaMask accounts. After doing that, click the \u201cI\u2019ve Copied It Somewhere Safe\u201d button, and you are all set.To find out what your MetaMask public wallet address is, click the MetaMask plugin located at the top right of your browser. A drop-down menu will appear; click the three dots beside your \u201cAccount Name,\u201d then click \u201cCopy Address to Clipboard.\u201dSending and receiving Ether on MetaMask is also fairly easy. To receive Ether, go to your account dashboard and click the three dots on the upper right side corner. Get the QR code and address\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can give this anyone who wants to send you some Ether.Meanwhile, if you want to send Ether, click the \u201cSend\u201d button. Then fill out the fields that ask for the recipient\u2019s public wallet address and the amount you want to send.What About ERC-20\u00a0Tokens?Although MetaMask is compatible with ERC-20 tokens, it does not support them by default. In other words, you have to add the types of ERC-20 tokens manually. Fortunately, this is an easy task.On your MetaMask dashboard, click \u201cAdd Token,\u201d after which you will have to add the token details, such as the token contract address and the token symbol. Then click \u201cSubmit\u201d and \u201cAdd.\u201d You will know if you successfully added the token because your wallet will show your balance for that particular token.ConclusionMetaMask has proven to be a secure and helpful tool for storing your Ethereum and ERC-20 assets. It has a clean record for security: there have been no security breaches that resulted in the loss of assets on the platform. MetaMask uses a type of security system that encrypts all local keys, preventing any exploits or malicious DApps from gaining access to the system. Despite this, you still have to be careful in giving out your private keys because there are a lot of cybercriminals waiting to prey on you.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to: Connect to AMB-NET with\u00a0MetaMask", "author_name": "Vlad Trifa", "link": "https://medium.com/@vladtrifa/how-to-connect-to-amb-net-with-metamask-6964c71e217e?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 10", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "10", "content": "How to: Connect to AMB-NET with\u00a0MetaMaskVlad TrifaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 10After successfully launching the AMB-NET main-net publicly, we would like to provide our community members further details on how to transfer native Amber (AMB) tokens using MetaMask! This overview comes as Atlas Masternodes and Hermes Masternodes are undergoing final testing for public release, alongside a number of Demo Applications!Let\u2019s get started!MetaMask is a web browser extension that has been created as both a bridge and wallet for the Ethereum network, that also allows someone to access Ethereum dApps in their browser. Since Ambrosus is based on Ethereum, it is possible to use MetaMask to send and receive native Amber tokens.Note: while you can use metamask to transfer ERC20 AMBs, this tutorial is really is focused on native AMBs on the actual AMB-NET main-net. To get native AMBs, you\u2019ll need to convert ERC20 tokens to native using the bridge.Step 1: Setup the MetaMask BrowserTo get started, you will need to download the MetaMask Web Browser on either Chrome, Firefox, Opera or Brave. Once this has been completed, then it is a simple step to set up a new Ethereum address, or to import an existing address onto the MetaMask browser extension.Step 2: Connecting to the Ambrosus NetworkTo connect to the Ambrosus Network, you will need to enter the Ambrosus RPC URLs for the different networks that can be accessed:Main-Net: https://network.ambrosus.com (\u2190 the one you\u2019ll likely use)Test-Net: https://network.ambrosus-test.comMore concretely, you do this by selecting the \u2018Networks\u2019 tab in the top right corner and then clicking on \u201cCustom RPC\u201d the last option available.Once you have done this, you simply copy paste the network URL into the area entitled \u201cNew RPC URL\u201d, pick a name, set the token name to AMB, and set the chainID to \u201c0x414e\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athen press save. This connects your MetaMask wallet with the Ambrosus Network.Step 3: Sending and Monitoring TransactionsWhen you would like to send Amber to the Ambrosus Network, you must click the \u2018Send\u2019 Button and then input the relevant information concerning FROM, TO, Gas Fee, Hex Data (optional).Transferring 10 Native AMBs from a wallet to another (yes, it\u2019s\u00a0fast!)Note that because MetaMask is made for Ethereum mainly, even though you\u2019re transferring native AMBs, it may somehow be labelled as ETH. Upon being sent, the Ambrosus Bridge will convert the ERC20 AMB into Native AMB.To monitor any transaction sent to the Ambrosus Network including the relevant addresses and transaction times, you can use Ambrosus\u2019 very own explorer, AmberEx: https://explorer.ambrosus.com/.As Atlas and Hermes Masternodes prepare for imminent launch on the public network in the coming weeks, we hope that this guide helps explain how to begin to interact with AMB-NET main-net to send tokens and much more!In the future, further guides and updates will be released in due course for other wallets as well!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Merunas Grincalaitis", "link": "https://medium.com/@merunasgrincalaitis/yes-other-users-have-to-get-metamask-or-equivalent-to-interact-with-the-dapp-63cb65bb6dfa?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 14, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "Merunas GrincalaitisBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 14, 2018Yes other users have to get metamask or equivalent to interact with the dapp. However if all you need is to get information from the blockchain, you can implement infura which allows you go the data from there without needing an account in the web app.So people could see content from the blockchain without having an account.

When a user loads a webpage, MetaMask automatically injects an Ethereum provider and a Web3 instance for the webpage to use. This allows dapps to access the blockchain, propose transactions, and read their users\u2019 account addresses.But there\u2019s long been a serious privacy issue with the way this exposure works in the current generation of dapp browsers: malicious websites can use these injected objects to view a user\u2019s active Ethereum address, which in turn provides access to their balance, transaction history, and other potentially-sensitive information. Bad-acting sites can also initiate many unwanted Ethereum transactions on a user\u2019s behalf in the hopes that the user will accidentally approve one.To improve privacy across the decentralized web, MetaMask\u200a\u2014\u200aalong with other privacy-conscious dapp browsers like Status, Mist, and imToken\u200a\u2014\u200aplans to adopt a new, safer strategy that will require updates to existing dapps. This article contains everything developers and their end-users need to know about this necessary breaking change, along with code to help future-proof dapps today.Breaking changeIn order to better protect user privacy, MetaMask and other dapp browsers will stop populating the injected Ethereum provider with user accounts by default. Instead, dapps must request access to user accounts, which will in turn ask the user to approve or deny access to the Ethereum blockchain. If the user approves access, the provider will be populated with accounts and the dapp can initiate account-requiring transactions as they normally would.While MetaMask generally avoids breaking APIs to protect the longevity of existing sites, we believe that a privacy flaw that exposes user accounts and allows unrestricted transaction submissions on a user\u2019s behalf to be sufficient justification.In order to provide the smoothest possible rollout, dapps must be allowed adequate time to make the necessary updates. We plan to release this breaking change on November 2nd, 2018, to commemorate the EIP proposing this change, EIP-1102.What this means for\u00a0usersOver the next few months, users may begin to see more \u201cLogin\u201d or \u201cConnect\u201d buttons on dapps. These buttons will prompt a popup from MetaMask (or other dapp browser of choice) asking if the user wants to grant the site access to their public account information. The extension will remember which sites have been approved until the user clears their list.This UX pattern of requiring user approval before exposing user accounts is very similar to requesting access to a user\u2019s camera or microphone. Ethereum users can reject account access on websites they feel are untrustworthy, making it impossible for such sites to identify, track, and target them. By only populating the injected Ethereum provider with accounts after user approval, users have control over their own privacy.Draft UI for MetaMask\u2019s user-approved account access implementationPrivacy modeThe MetaMask settings menu will expose a new \u201cprivacy mode\u201d option that can be used to opt in to and out of this privacy-preserving behavior. If \u201cprivacy mode\u201d is enabled, MetaMask will not automatically expose users\u2019 account addresses to the sites they visit. Instead, sites must specifically request access to see users\u2019 accounts. If \u201cprivacy mode\u201d is disabled, legacy behavior will be maintained and MetaMask will automatically expose users\u2019 account addresses to websites. This means that legacy dapps that are not immediately updated to support this change can still be used by disabling privacy mode.On November 2nd, 2018, MetaMask plans to release these changes with \u201cprivacy mode\u201d disabled by default. This option will eventually be enabled by default in a future release.What this means for developersThe Ethereum provider injected by MetaMask and other dapp browsers will now be available at window.ethereum for convenience. Before reading user accounts or initiating RPC method calls that require user accounts, such as eth_sendTransaction, dapps must now request access to user accounts by calling a new method on the provider: ethereum.enable(). This method returns a Promise that\u2019s either resolved with user accounts after user approval, or rejected with an Error after user rejection.The following code shows a new way to start up a dapp that can be used today in both legacy and modern dapp browsers:Preparing your\u00a0dappAs of MetaMask v4.14.0, the provider is already available at window.ethereum and it exposes the new enable method. Calling this method today won\u2019t trigger an approval popup and accounts will continue to be exposed to dapps until November 2nd; still, dapps can and should be updated as soon as possible to call the new enable method to ensure compatibility with the upcoming change.To fully test a dapp against a version of MetaMask that includes this breaking change:Download a custom build here.Install the build following these instructions.Enable \u201cprivacy mode\u201d in the MetaMask settings menu.Report any issues on Github.ConclusionMaking a breaking change has been a difficult decision for us, but we believe it is better than leaving our users prone to privacy violations. We hope this method of provider requesting will pave the way for a variety of more advanced login strategies, such as requesting a specific network, accounts of particular type, or even user-approved personal information.As dapps switch over to this new pattern, we believe we can begin paving way to a more secure, private, and user-centric web.", "responses": "35"}, {"title": "Ethereum Development Walkthrough (Part 1: Smart contracts)", "author_name": "dev_zl", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-development-walkthrough-part-1-smart-contracts-b3979e6e573e?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 14, 2018", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "2K", "content": "Ethereum Development Walkthrough (Part 1: Smart contracts)dev_zlBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 14, 2018Smart contracts, ICOs, Mist, Metamask, Remix, geth, web3..

And you are there, not knowing what exactly to do and how everything works together.If this is the first article that you read on Ethereum or the blockchain eco-system in general, you are going to love it! Experts calling each others names on twitter, unsafe standards and protocols, untested and buggy development tools. Not everything is figured out yet, everyone is going in different directions, and there still a lot to be done. The future of institutions, banks, and governments is being decided by mad developers! It\u2019s so great.Anyway, don\u2019t worry anymore, I\u2019ll try to connect all the dots for you in this tutorial series, and walk you through the universe of Smart contracts and dapps developement, and show you how everything fits together.While I will not get into every detail, I\u2019ll link some materials that will help you understand some concepts better, and it\u2019s up to you to research them and get into all the little details. The goal of this series is to help you understand better how things work together, in the simplest way possible, like a friend would explain it to you.I don\u2019t even know what Ethereum\u00a0isThe official website of Ethereum tells us this:Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.In other words, it uses the capabilities that gives us the blockchain technology to certify the execution of the code that we run.If you don\u2019t know what the blockchain, Ethereum, Bitcoin, cryptocurrency or any of these words mean, I advise you to listen to this excellent podcast by Tim Ferriss, interviewing Nick Szabo and Naval Ravikant: The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency\u200a\u2014\u200aNick SzaboWhat are Smart Contracts?On Ethereum, Smart Contracts are scripts that can handle money. It\u2019s as simple as that.These contracts are enforced and certified by parties that we call miners. Miners are multiple computers who add a transaction (Execution of a smart contract, payment of a cryptocurrency etc.) to a public ledger that we call a block. Multiple blocks constitute a blockchain.We pay these miners with something called Gas, which is the cost to run a contract. When you publish a smart contract, or execute a function of a smart contract, or transfer money to another account, you pay some ether that gets converted into gas.If it\u2019s still unclear, or you want to know more details, here are some interesting links:A different introduction to Smart Contracts in video.Smart contracts page on Wikipedia.A more detailed explanation of Gas.Before diving into smart contracts developmentIn this tutorial, I\u2019ll assume that you already have some basis in software development, and have a basic knowledge of Javascript and Node.JS. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be quickly lost. Solidity, the programming language that we will use to develop, is close to Javascript\u2019s syntax, and since a lot of development tools around Ethereum are based on Javascript and NodeJS, it will be easier for you to get in if you are already comfortable with both. This is not a tutorial for beginners, and while I\u2019ll link some alternative tutorials for you if you didn\u2019t understand some concepts, it\u2019s up to you to research the rest.Smart contracts developmentNow, finally, we start the interesting part, as I said Solidity is close to Javascript, but they are not alike. On Solidity, and I\u2019m sorry to tell you that, frontend developer, you just can\u2019t slap JQuery on a piece of code and hope that it will work, you can\u2019t overlook security, and you just can\u2019t hack your way through. We will see why when we will discuss security, development patterns, and fail-proofing our code.Now, for our first example, I\u2019m thinking about a script inspired by the movie In Time, where, in a dystopian future, people trade their remaining time to live like money. In the movie, they have a variant of arm wrestling that involves playing with that time, and we will do just that! Wrestling money using a Smart Contract.And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make available for you all the scripts we will see on Github.Also, if it\u2019s the first time you deal with smart contracts, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t understand everything now, it takes practice, reading the docs, and a bit of research to get accustomed to Solidity.The codeNow, onto the coding, first of all, the base of a Solidity script is the following snippet, the pragma directive to tell the compiler which version of Solidity we are using, and the name of our contract, a similar structure to a class in Javascript. Here it\u2019s \u201cWrestling\u201d.We want two wrestlers, so we will add two variables that hold the address of their accounts (Public keys of their wallets).In our little game, in each round, the wrestlers will be able to put in a sum of money, and if one put in double the money of the other(in total), he will win.One important thing about the public/private keywords is, even though, a variable is private, it doesn\u2019t mean that someone couldn\u2019t read its content, it just means that it can be accessed only inside the contract, but in reality, since the whole blockchain is stored on a lot of computers, the information that is stored inside the variable could always be seen by others, and that represents the first security consideration that you should keep in mind.On the other hand, the compiler automatically creates getter functions for public variables. To make it possible for other contracts or users to change the value of the public variable, you need to create a setter function.Now we will add three events, for every step of our game. The beginning, when the wrestlers register, during the game, for each round, and at the end, when a wrestler wins. Events are simply logs, and they can be used to call JavaScript callbacks in the user interface of distributed applications, also known as dapps. Events can even be used for debugging purposes during development since there is no equivalent to the \u201cconsole.log()\u201d function of JavaScript on Solidity.Now we will add the constructor, in Solidity, it has the same name as our contract and it will be called only once, upon the creation of the contract.Here, the first wrestler will be the one who created the contract. \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is the address of the one who invoked the function.Next we let another wrestler register with the following function:The require function is a special error-handling function within Solidity that will revert changes if a condition is not met. In our example, if the variable wrestler2 equals the 0x0 address (the equivalent of 0 for addresses), we can proceed, if the address wrestler2 is different from the 0x0 address, it means that a player has already registered as an opponent, and therefore, we will refuse new registrations.Again, \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is the address of the account that called the function, and we emit an event that signals the start of the wrestling.Now, every wrestler will call a function, \u201cwrestle()\u201d, putting in money. And if both have played, we see if one of them has won (our rule was that one of them have to put in double the cash of the other one). The \u201cpayable\u201d keyword means that the function can receive money, if it isn\u2019t set, the function will not accept ether. The \u201cmsg.value\u201d is the amount of ether that was sent to the contract.We then add the endOfGame(), and endOfRound() functions. The \u201cinternal\u201d keyword is the same as private, the only difference is that internal functions could be inherited by other contracts(since Solidity is similar to other object-oriented languages), while private functions cannot be inherited.Notice that we don\u2019t deliver the money to the winner directly, while in this case it\u2019s not that important, since the winner will take all the money off this contract, in other cases, when multiple users can withdraw ether off a contract, it\u2019s more secure to use a withdraw pattern, to avoid re-entrancy.It simply means, that if for example multiple users can withdraw money off a contract, one can simply call the withdraw function multiple times at once and get payed multiple times. So we need to write our withdraw function in such a manner that it will nullify the amount he should receive before proceeding to pay him.It looks like this:And that\u2019s it.

For Ethereum and the entire blockchain ecosystem to grow, it falls on the community to build the infrastructure components that keep the network running. Across the Ethereum network, there is a need for utilities that lower the barrier of entry and simplify access to Ethereum data. Among the most essential of these are Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) products. Leading the way is Infura, which offers developers a suite of tools to connect their apps to the Ethereum network and other decentralized platforms.Many of the blockchain space\u2019s most remarkable projects\u200a\u2014\u200aMetamask, CryptoKitties, UJO, Radar Relay, Cipher Browser, uPort\u200a\u2014\u200autilize Infura\u2019s APIs to connect their applications to the Ethereum network. In doing so, Infura provides the fundamental infrastructure required to handle both the short-term spikes that can often occur during token launches and essential, longer-term scaling solutions. An average of 6.5 billion JSON-RPC requests per day on the Ethereum network are channeled through Infura infrastructure, making the project an essential pillar of the ecosystem.\u201cOur mission is to facilitate access to Ethereum and the opportunities it provides,\u201d says Infura Lead Systems Engineer Nicola Cocchiaro. \u201cWe\u2019ve always believed that only through widespread adoption can the enormous potential of Ethereum be fully realized. One of the ways that we aim to help achieve that goal is by providing infrastructure as a service. Over the the last two years, this has put us in a privileged position to witness the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem firsthand, and the growth has been explosive both for it and us.\u201dSome numbers on the rise of Infura: \u201cWe now have more than 15,000 registered developers, we\u2019re serving over 6 billion API requests per day and transferring roughly 1.6 petabytes of data per month,\u201d says Cocchiaro. \u201cIn 2017 alone, we relayed transactions that moved more than 7 million ether, with almost 9 million more so far in 2018. And most of this growth happened over the second half of 2017.\u201dA view of transactions served by Infura from June 2017 to April 2018. The spike in December is the CryptoKitties launch.\u201cInfura essentially provides the necessary tools for any application to start developing on Ethereum immediately, without the need to run the complicated infrastructure themselves,\u201d says Mike Godsey, Product Manager. \u201cThis is equally necessary for developers with no traffic testing on networks such as Kovan, Rinkeby, or Ropsten, or ones with tons of traffic running on Mainnet. Infura provides a connection for all developers utilizing the Ethereum blockchain.\u201dThe most well-known portion of the Infura infrastructure is the network of hosted Ethereum clients that spans four Ethereum networks: Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Kovan. \u201cThese are load-balanced groups of nodes, that we can scale to meet demand fairly easily, and that we keep up-to-date and secure,\u201d says Cocchiaro. \u201cWe have TLS-enabled APIs including JSON-RPC, REST and websocket endpoints as ways to access our node network as if it was your local node. Infura also has additional features built on top of these endpoints for reliability and added value, like the feature we call Transaction Assurance.\u201dEthereum nodes are only one part of Infura stack: \u201cWe also host IPFS nodes and a public IPFS gateway. We\u2019re in the process of building additional decentralized storage products based on both IFPS and Swarm, that we will detail in the near future,\u201d says Cocchiaro.One of the central pieces of the Infura architecture is a middleware layer called Ferryman. Cocchiaro explains: \u201cFerryman is Infura\u2019s internal middleware layer that enables smart routing, which allows requests to be sent to different ends of the Infura infrastructure based on the RPC method and other factors. This provides the ability to scale and tune portions of the infrastructure independently depending on traffic needs; in addition to aggressive caching and indexing of blockchain data, smart routing can make it so that incoming requests don\u2019t need to hit a live node at all, and response times are greatly decreased.\u201dInfura\u2019s modular scaling solutions unlock essential network capacity for any project that is or expects to be pushing large amounts of traffic through the Ethereum Network. \u201cWith an ever-growing blockchain, keeping a local node synced and up to date has traditionally presented challenges that typically relate to a combination of storage, bandwidth and memory usage,\u201d says Cocchiaro. \u201cAdditionally, ICOs and other high-traffic dapps have concerns of scaling, sometimes transient, sometimes more permanent, that are not easily solved with local infrastructure.\u201dThe range of projects that utilize Infura\u2019s network is broad. For example, MetaMask uses Infura with a zero-client approach, connecting to Infura\u2019s remote infrastructure in order to serve over one million installed users. Some projects\u200a\u2014\u200alike Mist and Status\u200a\u2014\u200aare working towards utilizing a hybrid approach that relies on Infura\u2019s remote nodes in moments of network stress. In cases where scale is the main concern, like that of CryptoKitties, Infura worked together with developers across the ecosystem to keep the network running smoothly.Looking forward, Infura\u2019s growing platform of utilities will include a developer portal to give insight and monitoring to developers using the Infura network as well as more advanced scaling solutions. \u201cIn order to better serve developers using Infura, we are introducing a new version of our API key that will give apps better visibility into how they are using the network. We are also introducing an \u201cInfura for Business\u201d product that will help prepare developers for production traffic and provide them with the necessary support to keep their applications running smoothly,\u201d explains Mike Godsey.\u201cWe are actively involved in the expanding landscape of Ethereum and plan to incorporate many of the new developments directly into our infrastructure services,\u201d says Godsey. \u201cWe are very excited to see sharding, Plasma, Casper, and advanced state channels start to come online, and will continue to watch those very closely.\u201d", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "React & Ethereum: Getting Started With The Minimum Toolset Required\u200a\u2014\u200aPart 1 of\u00a04", "author_name": "Zubair Ahmed", "link": "https://levelup.gitconnected.com/https-medium-com-zubairnahmed-react-ethereum-getting-started-with-the-minimum-toolset-required-part-1-of-4-9562efa23d18?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 8, 2017", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "1.2K", "content": "React & Ethereum: Getting Started With The Minimum Toolset Required\u200a\u2014\u200aPart 1 of\u00a04Zubair AhmedBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 8, 2017Learn how to create a smart contract and deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain, using the minimum toolset required: Remix, Metamask, and any text editor.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 Part 1 \u2022\u2022\u2022 Part 2 \u2022\u2022\u2022 Part 3 \u2022\u2022\u2022 Part 4 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022Pixabay image, released under Creative Commons\u00a0CC0.Update: This blog series is no longer maintained.IntroductionThe essence of this post is to show how React can talk with the Ethereum blockchain.

We have a path forward with our decentralized global marketplace, which leaves your assets and information in your control, leaving these centralized security issues as a thing of the past.The core interaction on a truly decentralized marketplace is a peer-to-peer trade. The Token Trader is our implementation of that, and delivers the first step on The AirSwap Roadmap.Initially, trading will be 10:00AM to 4:00PM Eastern (ET) on weekdays. As schedules update we\u2019ll be sure to announce on Twitter and Telegram.A view of Token Trader on the Rinkeby test network. As of today we are now on\u00a0mainnet.Connect your\u00a0walletToken Trader supports both the MetaMask browser extension and Ledger hardware wallet devices. This offers true hardware-to-hardware trades, maximizing the control and security you\u2019re able to exercise while trading Ethereum tokens.Both MetaMask and Ledger support multiple accounts, so once you\u2019ve selected your wallet type, you\u2019ll need to confirm the account you\u2019d like to use. To confirm, you\u2019ll be \u201csigning\u201d a piece of data, which is a cryptographic guarantee that you control the account.As you become more involved in this ecosystem, it\u2019s a good idea to consider using a hardware wallet. These keep your private keys protected on-device, which puts it safely out of reach of hackers and other potential bad actors.Enable tradingTo transfer token balances between you and a counterparty, an Ethereum smart contract is required to perform an \u201catomic\u201d swap. By atomic we mean that if one transfer fails, the entire transaction will rollback. This protects both counterparties. Therefore, you must approve the smart contract to perform trades on your behalf to participate in the trading network. Performing these approvals is straightforward as you\u2019ll find them easily in the Token Trader.Wrap some ether\u00a0(WETH)Ether is what fuels the Ethereum network and serves as its native currency. Because the AirSwap network supports tokens that are standards compliant through ERC20, your ether will need to be \u201cwrapped\u201d to make it compatible for trade.Wrapping and unwrapping Ether on the Token Trader is a quick process. You\u2019ll be able to find this feature on the top left of the screen where you can see your balances. When you wrap, you\u2019ll need to set the amount of \u201cgas\u201d you\u2019d like to spend to execute the transaction.Spending more on gas will generally have your transaction executed more quickly, so the balance you strike between gas and time estimate is up to you. You can experiment with different values by sliding the control left or right.You can choose how quickly you\u2019d like a transaction to complete.Make a\u00a0tradeRequesting quotes and orders is a painless process. Once you\u2019ve enabled trading, you can dial in different amounts of AST or WETH you\u2019d like to buy. Upon selecting an amount you like to trade, you can request and inspect an order. When ready to fill the order, you\u2019ll be prompted to set gas for the transaction.With gas set, you\u2019ll be prompted to \u201csign\u201d the transaction on your wallet, either MetaMask or a Ledger device. This is the final step, which submits your transaction to the Ethereum blockchain for settlement. This will take some time, which depends on the amount of gas you\u2019ve set.Once it\u2019s completed, congratulations! You\u2019ve made your first DEX trade.What\u2019s nextWe developed the AirSwap Token Trader to bring market makers and retail traders together around peer-to-peer trades, and to build the best programmatic and user interfaces for this new world of decentralized marketplace.Our next step on the roadmap is to turn Token Trader into a wider trading marketplace, where many traders can meet and trade on a global network powered by the AirSwap Indexer. Stay tuned\u200a\u2014\u200awe have some exciting things in store that we can\u2019t wait to share.Please join us on Twitter and Telegram for conversation about AirSwap, Token Trader, and decentralized global marketplace.", "responses": "9"}, {"title": "Introducing: Privacy\u00a0Mode", "author_name": "Bobby Dresser", "link": "https://medium.com/metamask/introducing-privacy-mode-42549d4870fa?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 5, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "957", "content": "Introducing: Privacy\u00a0ModeMetaMask 5.0 includes an optional setting that requires dapps to ask permission to view your account\u00a0address.Bobby DresserBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 5, 2018If you have MetaMask installed, you know the extension makes it possible to interact with a whole world of websites built on the Ethereum blockchain.On any site you visit, MetaMask automatically adds in a small JavaScript object we call an \u201cEthereum provider.\u201d This allows websites to do things they otherwise couldn\u2019t: propose Ethereum transactions, ask for your signature, query the blockchain, and so on. It\u2019s how dapps get your account balance, or what lets exchanges ask for your tokens.But when it comes to user privacy, this behavior is less than perfect. Dapp browsers like MetaMask show the Ethereum provider object to any site you visit, which means your Ethereum address is indiscriminately exposed. Since the blockchain is public, your account balance and entire transaction history are retrievable by anyone with your address. Malicious sites can use this data to fingerprint, phish, or track unsuspecting users.Putting you in\u00a0controlOver the past couple months, MetaMask has led an effort to improve this privacy flaw across the entire Ethereum ecosystem (documented in EIP 1102). We\u2019re excited to introduce \u201cPrivacy Mode\u201d as the user-facing piece of this new privacy layer.As of version 4.18, MetaMask users will see a new option in their settings.Click the top-right icon, then click \u201cSettings,\u201d and find this option near the\u00a0bottomEnabling Privacy Mode means websites have to ask to see your Ethereum accounts. When a dapp asks for permission to see your accounts, you\u2019ll see a MetaMask popup like this:By default, we\u2019ll remember which sites you\u2019ve allowed to access your addresses. A future version of this feature will let users un-check an option to \u201cKeep me connected to this site,\u201d requiring that site to request access each time you visit.Privacy Mode is simple for users, but it\u2019s a significant paradigm shift for how dapps are built. (If you\u2019re a dapp developer, read this overview for how to stay compatible.)At first, Privacy Mode will be opt-in (and turned \u201coff\u201d by default). Even if you haven\u2019t turned Privacy Mode \u201con\u201d yet, we want to make it clear what\u2019s happening under the hood, so you may start seeing the \u201cConnect to this site\u201d dialog as you use your favorite dapps.If you\u2019ve enabled Privacy Mode and are visiting a dapp that isn\u2019t yet EIP 1102-compliant, the site may not work as expected. In this case, head to your settings, turn Privacy Mode \u201coff,\u201d and try again.The MetaMask team firmly believes EIP 1102 is a crucial step towards a safe, user-friendly decentralized web. Privacy Mode will eventually be the default experience for all MetaMask users.For developers looking for information on how to build applications compatible with EIP 1102, see this post.Thanks to the dozens of developers and community members who have contributed to this standardization effort!", "responses": "5"}, {"title": "\u4e09\u5206\u9418\u958b\u901a\u52a0\u5bc6\u5e63\u9322\u5305\uff0c\u9001\u4f60\u52a0\u5bc6\u5e63", "author_name": "\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa | kin ko", "link": "https://medium.com/cowritingspace/metamask-basics-f26c3a5b2388?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 8, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "459", "content": "\u4e09\u5206\u9418\u958b\u901a\u52a0\u5bc6\u5e63\u9322\u5305\uff0c\u9001\u4f60\u52a0\u5bc6\u5e63\u5927\u5abd\u5927\u53d4\u90fd\u61c2\u7684MetaMask\u9322\u5305\u6559\u5b78\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa | kin koBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 8, 2017\u96d6\u7136\u6211\u662f\u5340\u584a\u93c8\u7684\u5927\u597d\u53cb\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u610f\u5b83\u7684\u4ecb\u9762\u96e2\u7fa4\u773e\u5f88\u9060\uff0c\u5225\u7684\u4e0d\u8aaa\uff0c\u55ae\u662f\u6700\u6700\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u9322\u5305\uff0c\u4e5f\u5f04\u5f97\u597d\u96e3\u61c2\u3002\u4f46\u5f88\u591a\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u80af\u843d\u624b\u8a66\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u958b\u59cb\u6642\u4e00\u982d\u9727\u6c34\uff0c\u6162\u6162\u5c31\u6703\u767c\u89ba\u5176\u5be6\u6c92\u60f3\u50cf\u8907\u96dc\u3002\u82b1\u4e09\u53e5\u9418\u770b\uff0c\u4e0d\u5982\u82b1\u4e09\u5206\u9418\u505a\uff1b\u660e\u767d\u4e86\u624d\u505a\uff0c\u4e0d\u5982\u908a\u505a\u908a\u5f04\u660e\u767d\u3002\u5f04\u9ad2\u96d9\u624b\uff0c\u958b\u901a\u9996\u500b\u865b\u64ec\u5e63\u9322\u5305\u5427\uff0c\u958b\u597d\u4e86\u6211\u9001\u4f60\u9ede\u4ee5\u592a\u5e63\u4f5c\u6e2c\u8a66\u7528\u3002", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Blockchain Designer Profile: Christian Jeria", "author_name": "Sarah Baker Mills", "link": "https://media.consensys.net/blockchain-designer-profile-christian-jeria-ccc299de016a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 21, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "448", "content": "Blockchain Designer Profile: Christian JeriaDesigner at Metamask and\u00a0uPortSarah Baker MillsBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 21, 2017How did you get involved in blockchain?I first learned about Ethereum from Kumavis (creator of MetaMask) when we worked together at Apple. Since then, I have been investing in cryptos and following the development of Ethereum. A couple of years ago, Kumavis asked me to design a logo for MetaMask, thus the fox you see today was born. Earlier this year, Dan Finlay (Lead Developer on MetaMask) approached me for some design work on MetaMask\u200a\u2014\u200aI quickly jumped at the opportunity. Fast forward a few months and I was offered a full-time product design role at ConsenSys.What are you working on\u00a0now?Lately I\u2019ve been hard at work redesigning the MetaMask experience and user interface. Currently, MetaMask is available as a browser extension, but soon we\u2019ll be releasing a shiny new full page web experience with revamped features and capabilities. In addition to being the lead designer on MetaMask, I\u2019ve also been contributing to the uPort identity project. This includes designing for branding and marketing efforts, mobile product design, demo website, and the developer web portal.What is MetaMask?MetaMask is an Ethereum wallet, identity tool (think wallet = identity) and a bridge to easily and quickly access decentralized applications.What is uPort?uPort is a mobile application and platform that empowers people to own their data. uPort\u2019s vision is to build the infrastructure and systems that will enable people to own their identity, collect attestations, and share those attestations with trusted entities in a private and secure way.What do you enjoy about designing in the blockchain space?Blockchain technology fundamentally changes the way we think about the systems around us\u200a\u2014\u200athe way we transfer value, how we interact with applications, the way we manage our privacy online. The systems we currently use are vulnerable, hackable, and suffer from consistent breaches.The opportunity to help design new systems and experiences using blockchain technology excites me about this space. I\u2019ve always been drawn to disruptive ideas that challenge the status quo\u200a\u2014\u200aand blockchain technology precisely does this. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity to tackle big problems and shape the future!What are some of the challenges you face when designing for users of decentralized apps?A challenge we\u2019re currently facing is that we need to design for two distinct users\u200a\u2014\u200aboth technical and non-technical. At this time users of decentralized apps are mainly technical users, though we\u2019re starting to see more and more non-technical users enter the space. Most advanced technical users want a lot of control and functionality that may be intimidating for the average user. Currently, the onramp for users to interact with decentralized apps is steep: they need to know where to buy cryptocurrency, which one to buy, how gas fees work, transferring crypto using public keys, managing their private keys, how to use it to interact with decentralized apps, and much more. This can put a lot of pressure on new users. As a designer, this is something I spend a lot of time thinking about.Another challenge is that this technology is evolving very fast, so conventions are hard to define. However, I am noticing patterns in how developers are using blockchain to leverage new methods for identity management. Data breaches are more and more prevalent these days, how might we use blockchain technology to create a safer internet?As we begin to look at these new experiences, we\u2019re starting to realize that there is so much more we can enable users to do with blockchain than buying and transferring cryptocurrencies online. We have yet to see a blockchain app reach mass adoption; however when we do, I\u2019m confident its success will largely be attributed to its user experience.What advice do you have for a designer new to blockchain?If you\u2019re interested in blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200ado your research! Buy some Ether, get a MetaMask wallet, transfer Ether to your friends, and try to buy something with it.

Back then, it took a lot of our energy just to convince web developers to even try developing for a browser-provided web API, let alone to stop storing user keys in their own site storage.Back then, there were few tutorials, and very little developer expertise about how this platform operated, and so MetaMask did some things to make it easier for developers to make sites that wouldn\u2019t mess up. One of these features has been the way that MetaMask would reload any page that had touched the web3 API whenever the user changed the network.However, times have changed: Web3 apps have matured significantly, and have begun providing increasingly beautiful user experiences. This also caused extra network activity for inactive tabs, and also was incompatible with our eventual plans for allowing different tabs to connect to different networks. You can read more about our reasoning here. Forcing a reload on these carefully crafted websites is an insult to their competence, and so at MetaMask, we\u2019re finally removing those training wheels, and we will no longer be reloading apps when the user changes the current network.What This Means for\u00a0DappsThis means that if your web3-enabled website requires a certain network, you should continuously monitor the user\u2019s network to ensure it\u2019s the network you require, or inform the user to change the network.CryptoKitties does a great job of warning users when they\u2019re on the wrong\u00a0network.To monitor the user\u2019s current selected network, for now you\u2019ll have to poll, the way you do for selected accounts. We absolutely plan to support subscribing to these updates in the near future, please forgive us for the need to poll again. We do cache this value locally, so rest assured this is not making any network round trips:var desiredNetwork = \"1\"setInterval(function () {  web3.version.getNetwork(checkNetwork)}, 1000)function checkNetwork (err, currentNetwork) {  if (err) throw err // Please handle errors responsibly.  if (currentNetwork !== desiredNetwork) {    notifyUserToSwitchNetwork()  } else {    // Go about your business!  }}By including a snippet like this in your project, you\u2019ll be able to curate your user\u2019s experience much more seamlessly within your site.As always, if you have any feedback or questions, you can leave them on this article, open a Github issue, or contact our support team.Happy developing!", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "IPFS Ethereum Hackathon Results", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "link": "https://media.consensys.net/ipfs-ethereum-hackathon-results-d6b90b34286f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 15, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "56", "content": "IPFS Ethereum Hackathon ResultsDan FinlayBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 15, 2017It\u2019s time to announce the results of the IPFS Ethereum Hackathon 2017, as hosted by MetaMask and The Seattle Ethereum Meetup and sponsored by ConsenSys!The week kicked off with an amazing series of talks from some of the biggest thinkers in the decentralized web.

He also taught IPFS how to interpret Ethereum paths, allowing simple resolution of paths like {block_hash}/state/{address}/balance which will allow the writing of a JavaScript web3 provider that is not backed by a traditional RPC but can instead be backed by peer to peer communication, like a true Ethereum light client.The ContestantsAll entries were submitted as Github Issues on the Hackathon\u2019s Github repository.There were three final contestants. They all had good ideas and goals:MusicCoin: A fork of the Ethereum blockchain designed to help musicians earn royalties peer-to-peer.Carbon Harvest: A strategy to solve global warming using IOT and the Ethereum Blockchain (NBD!)Matriarch: A website for deploying and managing customized Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), based on the MiniMe DAO token.The WinnerWhile all of the entries were noble pursuits, one stood out for a few reasons:It had the most working functionality of all the submissions, including both MetaMask and IPFS integrations.It did not try to reinvent the wheel, but rather built on existing aspects of the ecosystem, which the judges felt best represented the virtues of the transparent, decentralized web.This winner was Matriarch, by ChicoBitcoinJoe. You can try a live demo here! It has a few rough edges, but for a hackathon entry, it represents a considerable achievement, and we\u2019re very proud of Joe\u2019s work!You can look forward to Joe being interviewed soon by Arthur Falls!Wrapping UpThis hackathon was great for the participants and hosts, and we made big steps forward for the Ethereum ecosystem by hyper-powering it on the IPFS protocol, and we\u2019re hoping to do it again.

Users should back up their seed phrases immediately, even if they think they already did, by following this guide.In response to user reports, we began internal diligence on the problem, ultimately deciding to issue a public bug bounty with a gradually increasing reward until a possible cause and fix for the issue were found. We were grateful to see extensive community participation in the bounty. In particular, an important observation by Chris Cassano led to a full reproduction example by Mike Seese.Although the unique issue that caused the seed phrase problem appears to be uncommon, we are offering a continuous bounty for similar bugs in the future. We want to always encourage community scrutiny of our code.The BugPrior to the bug fix, MetaMask\u2019s Create Vault function had the ability to create multiple vaults. Under normal processing conditions, creation occurred quickly and the seed phrase displayed was correlated to the most recently created vault. However, when abnormally slow processing power was present, if a user triggered Create Vault multiple times, then viewed the seed phrase, it was possible, though unlikely, that the user was shown a seed phrase from one of their prior Create Vault attempts. This apparently occurred because the old seed phrase was displayed before resolution of the more recent attempts to create a vault were resolved due to the processing power issue.To fix this bug, we\u2019re pushing an update to MetaMask to add a lock to the Create Vault process designed for better processing order even under abnormally low processing power conditions. The fix ensures at multiple layers that only a single seed phrase will be created for a first time user.The AwardSince the bounty was for reproduction steps leading to a fix, the full bounty award will be going to Mike Seese. Congratulations Mike, and thanks for your help!Because Chris Cassano made an important observation, we\u2019re also going to give him a smaller thank-you prize.ConclusionFor our users, if you haven\u2019t yet, please immediately back up your seed phrase again, even if you\u2019ve already done so. We are releasing a fix for this issue today, so new users should not be vulnerable to this particular problem.MetaMask is a free open source software project under the MIT Sharealike License, but we care deeply about our users and our community and are never pleased to see bugs like this arise. We hope that you have found our response to these issues appropriate, but as always, please be cautious with your assets and do not use MetaMask, which remains experimental open source software, to store or transfer more assets than you are willing to lose.We wish you all the best luck in the decentralized web.

In this article, we\u2019ll review why this happened, what we did about it, and what we\u2019ll do differently next time to make this type of thing less likely to occur in the future.TLDR; We had a process oversight, cached less than we could, and had a request timeout set too slow. We recommend Dapp developers register their app\u2019s method names on the on-chain method registry.Context of the\u00a0ChangeAt MetaMask, we\u2019ve long known that one of our most important duties is to make transactions safe and coherent for users to approve, and over our history, we\u2019ve come a long way to making it safer and easier to understand what you\u2019re doing with MetaMask, but we have a long way to go still!An early, non-interactive confirmation alert from June 2016. I don\u2019t have earlier examples on-hand, but they were even more\u00a0sparse.Earlier this year we introduced integration with the Parity on-chain method registry, allowing developers to verify their function names, so we could render them on the confirmation screen.We chose this approach because it relied on the same trust infrastructure the user already has configured (Infura by default, or any other provider they chose), to ask a smart contract registry that could trustlessly verify the method signatures submitted to it on-chain, allowing us to render a method name with a high degree of certainty this was the method name the developer used when writing the contract (hash collisions aside).This approach is far from perfect: It lacks translation, or really any rich interpretation of the transaction at all, but it is a nice and easy thing we knew we could add that gives context to an otherwise hard-to-decipher screen when interacting with contracts you\u2019re not familiar with.Despite publishing that integration, many developers have not registered their method names on that on-chain registry, and our MetaMetrics program further emphasized to us just how important the confirmation screen is to our user experience.This led us to pursue a fallback centralized method registry lookup, leveraging 4byte.directory by the wonderful Piper Merriam. Our confirmation view would check the on-chain registry first, and if it was unavailable, it would try 4byte.The Nature of the\u00a0ProblemDespite this reasonable plan, we had a few issues with the way it was ultimately carried out.First of all, the directory lookups blocked the loading of the confirmation screen, which we already know is slower than ideal to load. This means if those lookups are slow, the confirmation window would also appear slowly.Second, while we had good error handling for this endpoint, the timeout period for the 4byte lookup was not customized, and so it defaulted to one minute, and so if 4byte.directory was very slow to respond or throw errors, users would encounter up to a one minute wait before seeing a generic \u201cContract Interaction\u201d confirmation window.Third, we also added method name rendering to our transaction list, and these lookups were not locally cached, and so every user who loaded their transaction list essentially contributed to a DDoS of 4byte.directory during that time.Fourthly, the change was reviewed and merged without coordinating with 4byte itself, and so 4byte was unprepared for the coming onslaught of user requests.Combine the DDoS of the transaction list with the long timeout of the confirmation\u2019s lookup, and you have some users, who are using unregistered method names getting one-minute confirmation windows.Through this process, some people have asked us about the nature of our QA process, and we have a pretty thorough and documented process for a release, and we also rolled this release out gradually, starting with 3% of Chrome users on Tuesday, and didn\u2019t roll out entirely until Thursday, but because the issue would only really manifest when 4byte went down, the issue didn\u2019t really become visible until we had fully rolled out to production, Friday morning activity began, and the DDoS was in full effect.Many users tweeted at us, and our support team regrets not having noticed the correlation of these reports, but taken individually, the issue was similar to a variety of other issues, like users with slow internet connections, and so they were helped in a more generic way.We also received a number of reports on our GitHub, which allowed users to pile on to common issues, making it much more obvious that the reports were a new and widespread issue, and this ultimately is what got our team\u2019s attention first.Our ResponseOnce we were alerted to the issue, we identified the cause very quickly, and had a revert fix PR ready within an hour, which we then promptly published to the Firefox and Chrome stores.We had team members communicating with users on GitHub and via email and social media about the nature of the issue, and how they could work around it by installing the new fix manually if needed, instead of waiting for the update to auto-install.Unfortunately, the Google Chrome store also automatically flagged this particular release (the fix) for a manual review, which was a new procedure to us. We had no idea how long that process was going to take, and so we began working on alternative workarounds for scenarios where Google might take unacceptably long to accept our change.We were prepared to heavily update the on-chain registry, in turn avoiding our 4byte.directory lookups, around the time that Google accepted our version update and it should since be live for all users.Learnings and Next\u00a0StepsIt has been a while since we had a severe usability issue like this, and so we\u2019re taking the opportunity to learn as much about our process from this event as possible.First of all, we\u2019re enhancing our code review policy to include requirements about pull requests that involve third party APIs, including coordinating with them, appropriately caching those requests, and ensuring timeouts are considered with good user experience in mind.It was suggested that we invite the community to facilitate in our QA process, and so we\u2019re currently considering a community QA program where we would publish \u201cnightly\u201d builds for a period before going to production, with bug bounties on each one.We plan to make our confirmation windows faster to load with several strategies, including allowing non-critical data to load in-line (and not block the rest of the interface from loading). We\u2019re also planning to add much more thorough caching for these method signatures, to reduce the number of outbound requests, and we\u2019re looking at hosting a CDN cache of method signatures as well, so we do not overly strain community infrastructure.Finally, we\u2019re also drafting a crisis response guide that includes a few tricks we came up with during this event to help us more effectively coordinate with the affected users on the many communication channels they reach out to us on.If you\u2019re a dapp developer, you can also improve your user\u2019s experience by registering your function names on the on-chain registry as described in our docs here.ConclusionAt MetaMask it\u2019s our solemn privilege to facilitate you using the decentralized web, and as our user base has grown, so has our responsibility to bring you a solid experience. We\u2019re proud of how long it\u2019s been since we had a usability issue that affected this many people, but we\u2019ve only gotten as stable as we are through rigorous discipline, and commitment to quality at all levels, and so we\u2019re happy to take this opportunity to learn and grow, and we hope by showing you how we\u2019re dealing with the issues we face that we maintain your trust that we\u2019re here, taking your experience and safety seriously.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to Vote on\u00a0ETHFINEX", "author_name": "BANKEX", "link": "https://medium.com/@bankexcom/how-to-vote-on-ethfinex-ff2fe7b3ce1e?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 10, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "351", "content": "How to Vote on\u00a0ETHFINEXHow to transfer tokens from the ETHFINEX exchange to your METAMASK wallet in order to\u00a0vote:BANKEXBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 10, 2018Log into your ETHFINEX account and go to Withdraw:2.

This automatically added a notification to the relevant GitHub Issue, which had been open since July 2016. Maintainer Kumavis quickly made a comment which warned bounty hunters to focus on the newest UI branch.How did I start working on the\u00a0bounty?I found out about the bounty when I saw this Tweet:The first step was to claim this task, so we don\u2019t have multiple people creating duplicate solutions or potentially copying each other\u2019s work. A claim lasts for two weeks.On the GitCoin website, I needed to associate myself with an Ethereum address, which is best accomplished with MetaMask (!!). I used the plugin to create an address and receive a small amount of Ether. Then I was able to sign the contract and pay a fee (typical in Ethereum transactions). According to this transaction record in the blockchain, I spent about 12 cents on the transaction and \u2018gas\u2019 fees.I asked Kumavis for some clarification to make sure that I would be working on the right branch.Is it difficult to add internationalization to a browser extension?I was concerned at first, then I found the guide for Chrome apps, then I discovered that this is now a web standard which works in all the MetaMask browsers.I was pleased to see the views use React / Hyperscript syntax, so all of the view code had a consistent appearance and was all in one ui directory.Unraveling the project, there were four main tasks:make a translation function which calls browser.i18n.getMessage or a fallback functionreplace all UI text, such as <button>Confirm</button>, with the translation function <button>t(\u2018confirm\u2019)</button>enter shortcut codes in the manifest.json file so that the name and description in the App Store can be translatedbuild an organized list of all translations for the default language locale (en for English) which can be copied for other languagesSome internationalization issues were:inconsistent UI text (e.g. buttons on different forms reading \u2018Confirm\u2019 and \u2018CONFIRM\u2019). I decided to replace the latter with \u2018Confirm\u2019 and a text-transform: uppercase;\u200a\u2014\u200athis is also better for accessibility reasons.a shorthand for longer phrases (\u2018Confirm this Transaction\u2019 with \u2018confirmThisTransaction\u2019 or \u2018confirmButton\u2019 or \u2018transactionConfirmButton\u2019?)organizing the English translations (I decided on alphabetical order, so that similar phrases might be bundled together)a few menus looked at the text of your choice and not a unique ID.Building and\u00a0TestingI found it difficult to consistently build the new UI branch on my machine. Maybe I have an old version of gulp? I got a full build working one day, tested it out, and forgot how to do it by the next day.Tests on my machine and CircleCI were partially successful then returned with different errors, which I don\u2019t fully understand. I think it may be related to old UI vs. new UI.I suspect that these problems are common for bounty developers who move from project to project. If I were a full-time \u2018bounty hunter\u2019, I would either create a new development environment for each project, or I would insist on projects facilitating that. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good Dockerfile out there for Chrome and Firefox testing.I wasn\u2019t sure how to write new tests around internationalization. JavaScript tests don\u2019t have a browser.i18n API, so they always run my fallback function. I created a Japanese locale, but to make it appear, it wasn\u2019t enough to add Japanese to my browser preferences\u2026 I needed to change my OS language. This was a little scary (what if I couldn\u2019t figure out how to go back?) and I\u2019m not sure how to implement that in a testing environment.Circling backOnce I had seen the project working on my machine, I posted a Work-In-Progress pull request on the MetaMask repo. I explained some of my design decisions and asked for feedback (particularly on how to name and organize the almost 190 translatable phrases).Five days later, still having no major response, I finished up coding and posted another comment, ending with \u201cWelcoming your feedback on this\u201d.Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t hear any feedback in the past 10 days, and my hold on the project expired. Around the same time I started a new job, where I\u2019m not allowed to do bounty work on the side\u00a0:-PUpdated March 12th,\u00a02018It took a month and a half, but after another user asked about translations, two developers at Consensys started on the final work to merge and approve my code for addition to MetaMask! That means the project was a success!I couldn\u2019t contribute much to this final step, so I asked the bounty-poster and the other contributors about splitting the reward. The other guys said it was their full-time work, so I\u2019ve now claimed and received the full amount (about $280 at today\u2019s prices). Another big plus is that I\u2019ll be seeing translations soon (I know people have already volunteered for Chinese and Russian).ConclusionsI would love to do more bounty work in the future. With cryptocurrency payments, it would be possible for someone to work on this anywhere in the world, without worrying about bank accounts or revealing their identity.Before this type of coding goes mainstream, project builds and tests need to be designed carefully for a coder to drop into a project and help, without first learning the ongoing development branches or personalities on the project.Also, if a bounty is offered by a project user, and the code is not a priority for the maintainers, then how will the bounty be claimed? It\u2019s not unusual for a freelancer to wait a long time to get paid, but having a 3rd party makes it more complex. If I were relying on this bounty for my livelihood, I might check for more buy-in from the maintainers before and after starting work.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Mahesh Murthy", "link": "https://medium.com/@mvmurthy/in-the-ideal-world-yes-the-webapp-would-have-to-be-installed-by-each-client-b1212c1782a0?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 22, 2017", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "3", "content": "Mahesh MurthyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 22, 2017In the ideal world yes the webapp would have to be installed by each client.

My first pass has been to declare a generic Keyring protocol, which is just the code-side of managing a number of key pairs, but haven\u2019t gotten to the UI plugin part yet.Right now we manage those keyrings with a keyring controller, which is a little over-coupled to our code right now, but we are working towards making it a totally independent way of managing multiple signing strategies.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "HOW TO ADD RDC TOKEN TO ETH\u00a0WALLET", "author_name": "Andro_newman", "link": "https://medium.com/@roomdao/how-to-add-rdc-token-to-eth-wallet-41b5af0ccbbd?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 15, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "4", "content": "HOW TO ADD RDC TOKEN TO ETH\u00a0WALLETAndro_newmanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 15, 2018OPEN YOUR METAMASK OR MEWCHOOSE: ADD TOKENUSE SMART CONTRACT ADRESS TO ADD RDC TOKEN AT YOUR WALLET0x840086881Facb1E8C222Fa5DEB2f93F238B0bA95RDC TOKEN WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR WALLETFOR CONTRIBUTE PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINKhttps://roomdao.io/buy.htmlAND WE WILL SEND YOU AN ADRESS FOR CONTRIBUTIONBest regards, ROOMDAO.io", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Braid Contribution Instructions", "author_name": "WeiFund", "link": "https://medium.com/@WeiFund/braid-contribution-instructions-63a7be9ef587?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 9, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "1", "content": "Braid Contribution InstructionsWeiFundBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 9, 2017To participate in the Braid Token Sale, you will need either a MetaMask wallet or a Lightwallet.

Out of curiosity, why didn\u2019t you try Honest Cash?The free market is fundamentally democratic in nature.market = unequal influencedemocracy = equal influenceRight now the Libertarian Party (LP) is using donations to rank potential convention themes. Naturally a wealthy person can potentially exert far more influence on the rankings than a poor person, so I would consider this system to be inherently anti-democratic. In a democratic system every participant would have equal influence on the rankings.Voting and spending are fundamentally different things, so they really can\u2019t be equally effective at prioritizing things. Do you think that democracy would do a better job than the market at ranking the convention themes?From my perspective there\u2019s plenty of concrete evidence that democracy elevates trash rather than treasure.Compare the top-ranked content on Youtube (equal influence) to the top-ranked content on Honest Cash (unequal influence).The highest ranked story on HC is about crypto, the second story is about a guy who donates his programming skills to worthy crypto projects, and the third story is about censorship (the author cites J.S. Mill).What are the top-ranked Youtube videos about? Pewdiepie playing video games? Rap music videos?Technorati, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with it, is one of those services that watches activity on the web, and then puts up metrics and ranks and scores, and tries to distill the flux into something simpler and more comprehensible, which often reduces to telling you how many people are trying to find pictures of a naked Paris Hilton.

It is a corollary of this that if we wish to find a high degree of uniformity and similarity of outlook, we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primitive and \u201ccommon\u201d instincts and tastes prevail. This does not mean that the majority of people have low moral standards; it merely means that the largest group of people whose values are very similar are the people with low standards. It is, as it were, the lowest common denominator which unites the largest number of people. If a numerous group is needed, strong enough to impose their views on the values of life on all the rest, it will never be those with highly differentiated and developed tastes it will be those who form the \u201cmass\u201d in the derogatory sense of the term, the least original and independent, who will be able to put the weight of their numbers behind their particular ideals.\u200a\u2014\u200aFriedrich Hayek, Why the Worst Get on TopMarkets and democracies really aren\u2019t going to elevate the same people and ideas.It\u2019s a self-evident truth, or at least it should be, that democracies elevate the really wrong people/ideas.We need to strike the root\u2026", "responses": ""}, {"title": "We have released MGO official\u00a0GitHub", "author_name": "MobileGO", "link": "https://medium.com/@mobilegoofficial/we-have-released-mgo-official-github-210ae8218874?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 8", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "We have released MGO official\u00a0GitHubMobileGOBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 8Excellent news everyone!

Bitcoin wallet doesn\u2019t support the storage of ETH. Therefore, ETH wallet is recommended if the users want to trade, send, and receive ETH. Here, we use MetaMask, a browser wallet, as an example and introduce how to create a wallet through simple steps.Before creating a wallet, there\u2019re several concepts users need to know\uff1aAddress\uff1aThe wallet address is similar to a bank account. When trading, the wallet address will be used to send or receive the ETH with other traders. Through wallet address, anyone can look up the account information such as trading records or token amount. However, the wallet address doesn\u2019t need to be bind with users\u2019 identity, so there are no concerns for the leakage of personal information.2. Private key\uff1aThe private key is similar to the personal signature but encrypted. The private key is the basis for signing transactions in Ethereum. When trading, it\u2019s the only way to access an Ethereum account and used to confirm the trade is authorized. As the result, anyone knows your private key can access your assets so it needs to be kept carefully.MetaMask creates your wallet on the local terminals and communicates with other blockchain networks, therefore the private key of your wallet is only stored on your local PC. Your wallet is 100% secure and you don\u2019t need to worry about assets loss due to any hacker attack to MetaMask servers. Currently MetaMask is supported on Chrome\u3001Opera, and Firefox.\u3010Install MetaMask\u3011Click HERE to visit the MetaMask download page on Chrome Web Store. Create a new wallet.2.Click on the \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d on the upper right corner and confirm your\u00a0\u00a0installation.3.After installation completes, you will see MetaMask website, and fox head\u00a0\u00a0icon will appear next to your brewer\u2019s URL box, indicating that the\u00a0installation has completed.4.Click on NEXT to create your wallet.\u3010How to use MetaMask\u30111.Click on the MetaMask logo on the upper right corner of your browser.2.Read and Accept the MetaMask terms and Conditions.3.MetaMask requires a group of passwords for your wallet, for which purpose you must confirm your password.4.A 12-word seed phrase will be generated, and you must keep a record of these words. From now on, the seed phrase will be only stored on your PC and is the synonym of your account. Both MetaMask and Star Bit\u00ae exchange will not attempt to access your seed phrase, and you must keep it in good custody. The seed words will be required, if you lost your password or try to log in on a new PC.5.Now your MetaMask wallet is ready!\u203bhttps://www.starbitex.com/", "responses": "5"}, {"title": "New Phishing Strategy Becoming\u00a0Common", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "link": "https://medium.com/metamask/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 13, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "5.1K", "content": "New Phishing Strategy Becoming\u00a0CommonDan FinlayBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 13, 2018Edited June 18, 2018 to reflect our latest understanding of Cloudflare\u2019s security, and mitigation strategies. Apologies if we misrepresented any security issues.MetaMask allows users to interact with Ethereum-compatible sites by putting users in control of their own account secrets, in the form of the 12 secret words the user is shown when first setting up.This is very powerful, but also potentially dangerous, because each user is responsible for the secrecy of their own seed words. If a hacker can trick you into sharing those words, they can steal everything in your accounts.Recently, a number of websites have shown this screen to users out of nowhere. The screen impersonates the MetaMask user interface in the top right of the window, asking the user to enter their wallet seed words.This form then sends the seed words up to a private server, and presumably the funds are drained from all of that user\u2019s accounts.If you have seen this screen, and entered your seed words into it, it may already be too late, your accounts may already be drained. Please contact MetaMask Support immediately.Affected SitesSites we know have been affected so far include:BTC ManagerGames WorkshopTrakt TV (unresolved at the time of this writing)If you\u2019re a user of any of those sites and MetaMask, and have noticed you recently lost some funds, please contact MetaMask Support immediately.The affected sites appear to all use Cloudflare to configure their DNS settings, and this appears to be where the attacker is redirecting the sites to their own imposter sites. Since this has affected multiple sites, if you are using Cloudflare, you should be extra vigilant. Some of the sites had 2FA for all of their users, but the settings were updated by API using their API keys.From what we can tell, Cloudflare has dangerously coarse API access permissions, and at least three common roles have permission to edit DNS settings. These permissions are often shared with plugins you add to your Cloudflare account. That would mean installing a plugin on Cloudflare can be like giving that plugin\u2019s author permission to redirect your site to whatever they\u2019d like.As a security conscious team, this is very concerning, and we would advise any web masters using cloudflare to rotate their API keys regularly, review who has DNS editing permissions (Admin, SuperAdmin, DNS), and minimize those permissions.What We\u2019re\u00a0DoingMetaMask is taking a multi-pronged approach to this attack. The first prong is user education, via this post. MetaMask will never spontaneously ask you for your seed words, and is actually totally incapable of popping up in the top right without the user clicking the fox (as are all WebExtensions)! If you ever see this kind of popup on a site, contact us immediately!MetaMask is currently working with the affected groups to find other common factors, to help us narrow down on the attack vector that is allowing so many sites to become compromised, to help prevent this attack in the future.We are also working on improving our early-detection strategies, to narrow the window during which users can be affected by this attack.Since this attack relies on detecting MetaMask users by the web3 API, we will be making MetaMask users undetectable on unauthorized websites. You can read more on EIP 1102.We also have a couple of other efforts that we will report on if they are effective.If you have ideas for other strategies you\u2019d like to make sure we\u2019re pursuing, please get in touch, we\u2019d be happy to collaborate.

That looks like this:window.addEventListener('load', function() {  // Check if Web3 has been injected by the browser:  if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {    // You have a web3 browser! Continue below!    startApp(web3);  } else {     // Warn the user that they need to get a web3 browser     // Or install MetaMask, maybe with a nice graphic.  }})Copied loosely from the MetaMask Developer Guide.Here\u2019s a nice graphic you can use if they don\u2019t have web3 available.In this example, I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re using a JavaScript bundler like Browserify or Webpack, and know how to install modules off NPM.In your app setup, you\u2019re going to use a few different ethjs modules, and you\u2019ll initialize them with the global web3 object\u2019s currentProvider property, which is how it talks to the blockchain anyway.const Eth = require('ethjs-query')const EthContract = require('ethjs-contract')function startApp(web3) {  const eth = new Eth(web3.currentProvider)  const contract = new EthContract(eth)  initContract(contract)}Once you\u2019ve instantiated a contract instance, you can use it to create references to live contracts on the network. To do this, you need two things:The contract address.The contract ABI.The ABI is the Application Binary Interface, and it tells your JavaScript contract how to talk to the smart contract. It\u2019s just JSON data that describes the contract methods.Usually if you published a contract, you know how to get the ABI, and if you\u2019re connecting to someone else\u2019s contract, they should make the ABI available, although sometimes you can find ABIs matched to contracts on block explorers like Etherscan.Let\u2019s assume you have your ABI and address available, and see how we\u2019ll create a contract object now. In this example I\u2019ll use an ABI that includes only the transfer(to, value) method from the Token standard:const abi = [{    \"constant\": false,    \"inputs\": [      {        \"name\": \"_to\",        \"type\": \"address\"      },      {        \"name\": \"_value\",        \"type\": \"uint256\"      }    ],    \"name\": \"transfer\",    \"outputs\": [      {        \"name\": \"success\",        \"type\": \"bool\"      }    ],    \"payable\": false,    \"type\": \"function\"  }]const address = '0xdeadbeef123456789000000000000'function initContract (contract) {  const MiniToken = contract(abi)  const miniToken = MiniToken.at(address)  listenForClicks(miniToken)}Now we\u2019ve initialized a JavaScript interface for a smart contract, so we just need to create a little HTML<button class=\"transferFunds\">Send Money!</button>And a little JavaScript to respond to the click, and send those funds:function listenForClicks (miniToken) {  var button = document.querySelector('button.transferFunds')  button.addEventListener('click', function() {    miniToken.transfer(toAddress, value, { from: addr })    .then(function (txHash) {      console.log('Transaction sent')      console.dir(txHash)      waitForTxToBeMined(txHash)    })    .catch(console.error)  })}Note if this transaction were to send ether also, you\u2019d add value: '10000' to the options hash that includes the from field. The value is in the unit of wei, which is 1x10^-18 Ether. An easy way to convert is like this:var inWei = web3.toWei('10', 'ether')A strange part of this for a normal web developer is that the transaction response does not mean the transaction is now complete, it just means it\u2019s been transmitted to the network. It still needs to be mined, and in Ethereum, that takes around 14 seconds on average (block time, view stats on EthStats.net).Right now there aren\u2019t great subscription methods for waiting for a transaction to be mined, so you\u2019ll need to poll for it with that txHash you got back. Yes, it\u2019s tedious, so I\u2019ll show you how it can be a little less painful using the new JavaScript async/await pattern:async function waitForTxToBeMined (txHash) {  let txReceipt  while (!txReceipt) {    try {      txReceipt = await eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash)    } catch (err) {      return indicateFailure(err)    }  }  indicateSuccess()}That\u2019s it! (I know, it was a lot) I hope this was enough to show you how to interact with a smart contract over the Ethereum block chain. Once you\u2019re used to it, it\u2019s pretty great, because it\u2019s a sort of global API that has permissions baked in, so while you have to do a couple funny things like wait for transactions to be mined, you don\u2019t have to do obnoxious things like manage user accounts and passwords, or manage a backend server yourself!Please add any questions you have here, we made MetaMask to enable the easy creation of web interfaces for smart contracts, so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re here for.

For information on the latest, greatest, see Scaling Web3 with SignTypedData!Developer note: This article discusses a new method available to websites viewed with MetaMask and Mist browsers, called personal_sign. This is replacing eth_sign, and that old method now has a big red warning for your users because it was deprecated for security reasons. It\u2019s left in place only to keep sites running that rely on it.When people get excited about MetaMask, it\u2019s usually because it allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, which usually involves owning some network fuel called Ether, to run programs on a global shared virtual computer, and we think this is great.However, even without any Ether, MetaMask makes some new things possible for websites, because to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, MetaMask had to add private key management to the browser.When the modern browser was first created, it was seen as a linked document browser, and so identity and payments weren\u2019t baked in. This led to the world of password management that we have today, where each website holds a database that includes your account, and maybe credit card, and when you connect with them, you prove who you are with a password.MetaMask lets us reverse this relationship, and explore a web where the browser can secure your identity for you, in the form of a cryptographic key pair.Called a signature because like a pen signature, it can be used to identify who wrote\u00a0it.One of the basic functions of a cryptographic key pair is signing data. When you sign some data, anyone can see that your signature could only be produced by the person who holds your private key. This is powerful, because it means you can compose a message and prove that you authored it (or at least had it at some point).One example use of this that normal sites could use today, would be for signing a terms of service agreement. The site could submit their terms of service using eth.personal_sign(fromAddress, hexEncodedUtf8Message), and the user will get a MetaMask message like this:MetaMask can now render plain text for signing, so sites can make their signature challenges human readable. We\u2019d like to offer more rich rendering options in the future, and this is discussed in EIP\u00a0185.Once the user signs it, the site could store that signature, and later on they could use it to prove that the user signed the message.This means a user doesn\u2019t need to hold any ether to perform a meaningful act with their MetaMask accounts. In the past, when a website would check the current accounts via web3.eth.accounts, the site only really knew that the user intended to appear as that account, but with a simple signature challenge, you can prove they really do control that account. From there, you could give them a browser cookie to stay logged in. That\u2019s account management without any external, third-party services like Facebook Connect or Google tracking your every move.We\u2019re excited to see what\u2019s possible in a web with accounts baked into the browser, and hope that someday account management like this is baked into every operating system, to enable a seamless, personal, distributed web.For DevelopersI\u2019ve created a sample repository for showing how to submit a message & verify it using MetaMask\u2019s injected APIs, mostly using our own utility lib eth-sig-utils. These methods are not yet supported by web3.js (pending this pull request), but that repo has examples for either using the raw provider object directly, or using a new web3 alternative, EthJS.Security NoticeThese methods, personal_sign and its partner, personal_ecRecover have replaced the previous signature methods, eth_sign and eth_recover. That\u2019s because the previous methods signed raw data unmodified, making it vulnerable to chosen ciphertext attacks, as well as potentially signing transactions you didn\u2019t intend to. You can read more about the reasoning behind this change on the go-ethereum repository.Compatibility NoticeWhile go-ethereum was first to implement these methods, Parity has also since released the feature, although it is not presently compatible with the Geth version. Since we had to choose one, we went with the original implementation, so our sign & recovery methods are currently bit-compatible with Geth, but not Parity.We\u2019re as frustrated as you about the lack of unified standards in the application layer of Ethereum, which is why we\u2019re also working towards building an EIP Standards Signaling DAO.

I found it very useful to use the debugger throughout the whole development of my dApp, but at the start it was 100% necessary to help me write code that would actually compile.You should use remix until you get your dApp to compile with no bugs.There are three options with remix for injecting a blockchain instance into the browser, you can use the Javascript Virtual Machine (JVM), an injected web3 instance (like the chrome extension Metamask), or connecting to a web3 provider (like Infura). The JVM is the way to go when you are a beginner. It is much more forgiving, it ignores gas limits, it gives you an unlimited amount of ether to play with between 5 accounts, and it is much faster to debug with.Make sure the environment is JavaScript VM when starting with your first\u00a0dApp.Start using Event Logs as much as possible to debug your code. They are the closest thing to console.log() from Javascript, as they can notify you of any changes to the state variables of your contract. In Remix they automatically show up in the user interface on the right side. When you want to see them from the front end of your dApp you will have to watch for the event with web3.js (explained later on in this post).Events are shown in the right side user interface of\u00a0remix.Note that Remix is glitchy sometimes. If it isn\u2019t doing what you think it should be doing, open and close a new chrome window and it often helps. This is new software that is in active development, so bugs are expected.Note that sometimes the numbers in local or state storage while debugging will be extremely large. This might be due to accidental overflow for an integer calculation. However I have noticed that there is a bug in Remix\u00a0. Sometimes while debugging it will show overflow, but in reality the contract still works and you get the correct results when executing functions in your dApp. So really pay attention when debugging to local and state storage, and if it is showing overflow and your contract still works perfectly, you are probably okay.Using the Solidity Locals and Solidity State variable viewer in the debugger of remix is extremely helpful to see if your functions are working properly.Keep in mind the first dApp you build will be slow when you are calling functions because you have to wait for blocks to be mined to get a response. This won\u2019t rear its ugly head while using the JVM, as everything happens instantaneously. As you move away from the JVM it will be more frustrating to debug, so do as much debugging as you can here.Moving onto a Better Development Environment with Truffle and\u00a0testRPCIt is tempting to keep using Remix, but you should move on once you get to a point where your dApp compiles properly. Next you should use tools such as Truffle and testRPC that help simulate a real blockchain, so you can test your dApp in a more realistic situation.Truffle is a framework for developing and deploying Ethereum dApps. It is the best framework out there right now, and they are constantly upgrading and improving their product.testRPC is a simulated Ethereum blockchain you can run on your local machine that has been tweaked specifically for fast testing. You don\u2019t have to wait anytime between blocks to see how your dApp is responding, which is super helpful for testing and debugging. However it still gives you a real blockchain environment for testing that will fail for things like an out of gas limitation.Truffle lets you write tests for your dApp with Javascript (based on mocha\u2019s framework) and Solidity. Overall I have found that Javascript is better for integration tests, while Solidity is better for unit testing. However, I was unable to find good examples of Solidity testing online, and the documentation on it is not very in depth. Because of this I ended up doing the majority of my testing with Javascript because there is excellent documentation for mocha.It is sometimes tricky to test smart contracts, because there are situations where you want your contract to fail, like if only the owner is supposed to call a function, and if someone else tries to it should fail. The basic framework of truffle isn\u2019t fully adapted to easily test for this at the moment, but there is a good blog post on a workaround that helps with testing for failures.Sometimes testRPC can act weird in the terminal. If you don\u2019t end testRPC properly and you close your terminal window, it could still be running. Then the next time you try to run testRPC it won\u2019t allow you to start a new instance. This happened most frequently to me when I used MetaMask. For some reason you can\u2019t crtl+C out of testRPC when it is connect to MetaMask, so I started doing crtl+Z, and then I ran into these problems. I found resetting my computer cleans this up, and any other issues I came across with testRPC.Turning it into a Real Front End dApp with Truffle\u00a0BoxesTruffle Boxes is a combination of the Truffle Framework and the React Framework. In order to use truffle boxes, you\u2019ll need a basic understanding of react to go forward.Build out the most basic version of your front end dApp to interact with your contract. It will end up being almost exactly like a normal React app, but you use web3 js (which comes included in Truffle) to interact with the blockchain. You will then have to inject a blockchain instance into your chrome browser so that you can interact with your testRPC on the testnet.MetaMask is the easiest way to interact with a blockchain in the browser. It is a chrome extension that allows you to inject the mainnet, the testnet, or a local instance (like testRPC) of a blockchain. It also allows you to use multiple accounts and send ether or testnet ether between them. Then the web3 code in your front end will interact with the blockchain injected from MetaMask, and you have connected your dApp to a real blockchain!Metamask Chrome Extension interface\u200a\u2014\u200aunfortunately that is testnet ether, which is worthless\u00a0:(.Note that in a developement environemnt with metamask, you should never store real ether alongside your testnet ether, just in case you make a mistake, and send real ether while testing.You can get test net ether for the rinkeby test net here: https://faucet.rinkeby.io/.Always send transactions with a high gas cost in GWEI on the testnet. You might be inclined to keep it low because you are used to doing so for mainnet transactions. I\u2019ve have long waiting times and bugs that have cost me an hour or two of time because I simply set way too small of a gas price on a large contract deployment, and then it failed on the test net, but MetaMask thought it succeeded. Then I couldn\u2019t do anything because MetaMasks nonce count was incorrect. Testnet ether is worthless so you might as well send a lot to beat everyone else in the line!Use the mnemonic flag in testRPC to repeatedly get the same accounts generated whenever you start a new testRPC instance. I use the following command in my terminal:The mnemonic flag generates ethereum accounts based on a string you pass it upon starting testRPC. If I always provide \u201chello\u201d, I will always get the same accounts. This makes it easier to hardcode in accounts while running tests. The accounts flag is used to generate 50 addresses, also good for\u00a0testing.Accounts[0] (from truffle and web3) will be the account that MetaMask had opened up when the dApp is loaded in the browser. Sometimes MetaMask is finicky, and if you switch back and forth between accounts the dApp\u2019s web3 and Metamasks accounts won\u2019t be talking to each other correctly. Just refresh the page.MetaMask will sometimes let you know a call from your front end dApp to the blockchain is going to fail by maxing out the gas you are sending with the transaction, and sending 0 ether instead of the amount the dApp is asking for. It doesn\u2019t explicitly say why it will fail, but it will, and it will use up all the testnet gas. This happens most often when an account tries to call a function that it does not have access to, and it will just revert and burn the gas.Deployment with\u00a0HerokuHeroku is perfect for deploying your dApp because it is super easy to do, and your dApp doesn\u2019t have a backend which makes Heroku\u2019s simple setup very attractive. This article will help with deploying a dApp on Heroku (you will have to let chrome translate the page to English) https://medium.com/taipei-ethereum-meetup/ethereum-dapp-tutorial-push-button-cae3810086a4.My first version of my first dApp deployed to Heroku was very basic, but it doesn\u2019t have to be pretty as long as the smart contract does what it is supposed to do! You can see it here: https://heroku-patreon.herokuapp.com/ (code is located here).The first version of the first dApp I deployed with\u00a0heroku.When you deploy the front end to Heroku, you will have to deploy your contract to the testnet as well. Deploy the contract first, then once it is deployed you can get the address of the contract from etherscan, and hardcode it into your front end so that your dApp is interacting with the correct contract on the testnet. There are a few ways to deploy a contract to the testnet:You can deploy the contract using remix by injecting a web3 instance with MetaMask (make sure you change the environment from JavaScript VM to web3 instance, and that you pick the correct testnet to deploy to).You can deploy with myetherwallet here: https://www.myetherwallet.com/#contractsYou can deploy with truffle as well, and there are good instructions to do so in their documentation.I found using remix to be the easiest way to deploy a simple dApp.General TipsKeep your first few contracts simple.Always update your dev tools (Truffle, testRPC, MetaMask) as much as possible. This is a new field and new versions of the software come out weekly.Be weary of looking at old Solidity code and copying it directly into yours. Solidity is updated often and some of their functions have been deprecated.Read the Solidity documentation.Learn to deal with ether in wei from the beginning, because all numbers should be passed around in wei on the EVM and the front end. Otherwise you will have to retroactively go back and fix your code, which is frustrating.The first time you come across a Big Number while coding go read the documentation here. It will help immensely when you start passing numbers between your front end and the blockchain.Consistenly check back with the web3 documentation and the truffle documenation. They both have a lot of helpful functions that make building dApps easier. There were multiple times when I tried to do something on my own, only to realize that truffle or web3 already has a function that does what I needed.Things to look into for your second\u00a0dAppOnce you get the hang of actually creating a dApp that works, start to look more into the security of writing good smart contract code. Learn about common pitfalls and bugs and how to prevent them. A great place to start is ConSensys\u2019s smart contract best practices.You can watch for Event Logs from the blockchain with the front end by using using web3 (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#contract-events). Watching for Event Logs from the front end allows you to automatically update the front end when something is changed on the blockchain.Once you get the hang of smart contracts you can start to look at ways to reduce the gas cost of the deployment of your contract, and lowering gas cost for storage of state variables. When you are working on your first dApp there is no need to worry about this as it will just confuse you more.ConclusionGood luck deploying your first dApp!

Do not use this method for production applications that you\u2019re not able to update should the API change in the future!There are a wide array of ways that Ethereum plans to scale, and it\u2019s a favorite topic of blockchain fans, because the scalability of the blockchain is a hard technical limit on how useful it can become.One of the easiest ways you can start scaling your application on Ethereum today, without waiting for any other technology to be available, is to construct mechanisms that allow users to sign state changes that aren\u2019t always submitted to the blockchain, but can be if needed, like a state channel. To make a working state channel today, there\u2019s no easier option than to take advantage of MetaMask\u2019s new signTypedData method.Originally proposed in EIP 712 by Leonid Logvinov of 0x, and then implemented for MetaMask by Sergey Ukustov of Machimony. This new method makes it easier than ever to create applications involving user signatures that:Represent structured data.Are human readable.Cannot impersonate Ethereum transactions.Are cheap to compute on-chain.In this article, you\u2019ll learn to show the MetaMask user something like this:Structured data user prompts that are cheap to compute on-chain? No\u00a0way!The API is simple, and will be even simpler once it has been deployed in new versions of EthJS and Web3.js. In the meanwhile, using it exposes you to the lowest-level API that MetaMask gives you: The Ethereum Provider.You can find this code live online on github here.// A JS library for recovering signatures:const sigUtil = require('eth-sig-util')const msgParams = [  {    type: 'string',      // Any valid solidity type    name: 'Message',     // Any string label you want    value: 'Hi, Alice!'  // The value to sign }, {      type: 'uint32',      name: 'A number',      value: '1337'  }]   // Get the current account:web3.eth.getAccounts(function (err, accounts) {  if (!accounts) return  signMsg(msgParams, accounts[0])})function signMsg(msgParams, from) {  web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({    method: 'eth_signTypedData',    params: [msgParams, from],    from: from,  }, function (err, result) {    if (err) return console.error(err)    if (result.error) {      return console.error(result.error.message)    }    const recovered = sigUtil.recoverTypedSignature({      data: msgParams,      sig: result.result     })    if (recovered === from ) {      alert('Recovered signer: ' + from)    } else {      alert('Failed to verify signer, got: ' + result)    }  })}As you can see, in this we:Imported the signature recovery library eth-sig-util.Assembled parameters for the method.Retrieved the current user\u2019s address from the web3 API.Asked the user to sign those parameters.Using the parameters and the signature, we were able to verify this signature came from their address (and only their address!).Not only can you verify this data with JavaScript, you can also verify it in Solidity. Here is an example of verifying one of these signatures in Solidity. This can be useful for writing code for closing a state channel.I hope this has been useful to you, let us know if you have any questions, and if you create any sample examples you\u2019d like to share!", "responses": "7"}, {"title": "Using an In-Browser Ethereum Wallet?

Here\u2019s Some Things You Should\u00a0KnowJohn BackusBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 22, 2018Correction: Brave does not suffer from the issues mentioned in this postWhile developing the Bloom dApp, we frequently stumble across noteworthy design considerations of the platforms we are building on. Recently, we noticed several privacy and security issues for in-browser wallets which can expose personal information and trick users into sending false transactions.This weekend, I posted a tweet about this which gained some momentum on Twitter and Reddit. Dan Finlay, a Metamask core developer, agreed with my analysis and security precautions.Bloom is committed to working alongside the various open-source projects we build upon, and boosting the overall knowledge and security of the Ethereum ecosystem is good for everyone. I\u2019ve converted my thoughts around this topic into the post below.In-browser Ethereum Wallets Reveal More Than You May\u00a0ThinkIf you are using an in-browser Ethereum wallet (Metamask or Parity) then any website can detect if you are an Ethereum user.I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some advertisers are already collecting this information. The information is rather easy to collect and has significant use in terms of targeting cryptocurrency holders.How does this happen? Metamask and Parity inject a global web3 object into the page. For example, the screenshots below show Metamask and Parity both injecting web3 into Twitter:Parity even exposes the current account address by\u00a0defaultPractically Speaking, What is the\u00a0Risk?Don\u2019t worry, these websites can\u2019t send transactions on your behalf of course (not without popping up a confirmation window) but do you really want any website owner or advertiser to know that you hold crypto?Do you want them to know how much ETH you own?This fact, in the wrong hands, could be a risk. It could increase the volume of ads you see or make your device a target to malicious actors.Does MetaMask Expose your\u00a0Wallet?Even though Metamask is locked by default (meaning public addresses aren\u2019t exposed) it is trivial to listen for a wallet unlock.When you unlock your Metamask wallet, it unlocks it across all tabs. The gif below is an example app that alerts when it detects a wallet unlock.Detecting an unlock from an unfocused tab is especially sketchy in my opinion. This means any app can detect when you are in the middle of using your Ethereum wallet.If the user just unlocked their wallet for another tab then they are probably about to send a transaction. The attacker can detect the unlock, wait 30 seconds, then pop up their own transaction.The gif below is an example attack where the user is in the middle of using an exchange:In my opinion, a lot of other small attack opportunities exist as long as web3 is injected into every page. You can tell if someone is specifically a Metamask user by checking web3.currentProvider.isMetamask.Why not pop up your own Metamask lookalike in the top right?Regardless of whether the wallet is currently locked, you can use the current network id on web3 to see if the user was last using the testnet or mainnet. If they\u2019re on anything besides mainnet, they are probably a developer and likely have higher than average crypto holdings.To give Metamask credit: They do have several issues on Github open discussing issues around globally available web3 instance:Security audit and team discussion (issue #799)Configuration should be per-domain (issue #12)Inject Metamask on a per-page basis (issue #537)Be signed out per domain until signing in (issue #714)So What is The Solution?In my opinion, the best immediate stopgap these extensions should add is something similar to other browser permissions like how we grant access to location information.I think the Metamask team is looking into doing this long term: https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/813\u00a0\u2026Potential short term solution:Hardcode that only http://metamask.io/whitelist can call invoke some whitelist functionality in the Metamask extensiondApps should open a popup to http://metamask.io/whitelist?url=example.com. This would be similar to some oAuth user flows.Extension asks if you want to give http://example.com access to your wallet.From then on, web3 is injected automatically on that domainRestricting this functionality to their domain means that nothing has to be injected into every page. The popup means any page can really easily initiate the whitelist process without having to write browser vendor specific extension interactions.Short term solution would then be to add whitelisting as an opt-in feature (so you don\u2019t break existing integrations and make people regret writing their app to depend on Metamask).Security conscious users can opt-in right away and app developers can plan for deprecation.Can you protect yourself?In the meantime, I\u2019d recommend users disable Metamask by default in their browser and then enable it when they want to use it.Unlike unlocking a wallet, I wasn\u2019t able to detect (from an already open and unfocused tab) when a disabled extension was enabled.Some UI improvements would also help the transaction spoofing example I gave. The browser should switch to the tab that created the transaction. The confirmation window should probably have a brightly colored banner that says \u201chttp://example.com created this transaction.\u201dMetamask and other browser wallets are in a tough position though with these transaction popups. If a legitimate dApp could put a custom message in the confirmation window then an attacker could mimic it.Some Final Thoughts:I also want to clarify that I\u2019m not saying that people should never use these in-browser wallets. Security is especially tough and nuanced when you are a platform for handling money and user identity. Even harder when you are on the development side of early adoption.In addition, I\u2019d love to see is the ability to use an ENS address as the recipient field in a transaction. For @BloomToken, users are currently interacting with one of two contracts. If our end users saw our ENS address for every transaction then they\u2019d be less likely to fall for a spoof.In-browser wallets should be unlocked per domain. An advertiser shouldn\u2019t be able to log my ETH address in an unfocused tab just because I want to check on my crypto kitties.I\u2019d also love to see at least an opt-in setting that locks my wallet again after sending a transaction. If a dApp wants to send multiple transactions without unlocking between each, they can use `web3.createBatch`. Metamask handles this well already.An attack that sent ERC20 tokens would be effective. Unlike moving ETH (where Metamask would say how much ETH you are sending), a token transaction would just display the gas price. This might be more likely to trick people if they can\u2019t tell what is being sent.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "What to Expect When Participating in a Token\u00a0Launch", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "link": "https://media.consensys.net/what-to-expect-when-participating-in-a-token-launch-649e35343e85?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 10, 2017", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "453", "content": "What to Expect When Participating in a Token\u00a0LaunchDan FinlayBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 10, 2017The Metamask team\u2019s official guide to best practices when contributing\u200a\u2014\u200afor experts and novices\u00a0alike!If you\u2019re participating in a token launch for the first time, or even if you\u2019ve done it all before, the process of safely and securely taking part in such an event requires research, preparation, and vigilance.Token sales have proven to be a powerful new way of raising funds, but the current infrastructure and climate surrounding the phenomenon presents many risks. As a contributor, you want to purchase tokens for a project you believe in, but you also want to make sure you don\u2019t get phished, scammed, send your currency into the abyss, or any of the unfortunate situations that people sometimes face in the process of contributing to token sales.At MetaMask, we work with users every day who are struggling when trying to participate in token launches. Token sale contributors should always approach their engagement with caution. We\u2019ve created this guide to participating in token launches to empower our community with best practices, and answer some of the most common questions that come up in the token launch process.First Things First: Inform\u00a0YourselfWhen you initially learn about a token launch you\u2019d like to participate in, gather all the information you can. Not every token launch is structured in the same way. Some are not available in all countries. Some require registration beforehand. And some spread their token sales over several days, or even weeks.Make sure you do a few things before the token launch begins:Research, research, researchEvery single person who engages with the decentralized web should consider themselves responsible for educating themselves on the technology and doing due diligence research on any project before considering contributing. Read the whitepaper, the source code, check out the track record of the team, and understand what your contribution entitles you to. There are a lot of dubious projects in the Ethersphere, and security and safety should remain at the forefront of every participant\u2019s mind.Understand the value proposition of the\u00a0projectAvoiding getting phished or hacked is one thing; but you also need to make sure you don\u2019t willingly put money into a project that is not built on solid business or tech fundamentals. Beyond total dud or scam projects, you want to make sure you aren\u2019t just buying tokens for the sake of buying tokens; is this a project that you believe has a real future? Do you have a reason to purchase these tokens? Will you participate in this ecosystem? Will they be valuable to you? The answer to all of these should be a resounding \u201cYes.\u201dKnow the prerequisites you need in order to be a valid\u00a0investorMake sure you can actually participate in this token launch. Do you need to live in a certain country? Register ahead of time? Many token launches will restrict U.S. buyers from participating, and now the Chinese government has banned token launches entirely. It\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re operating within the law and within the rules of the token sale.Find out how you will pay for the token, and how tokens will be distributedWhat is the mechanism of the token launch? Some are straight sales, some are more exotic, like reverse dutch auctions, and some take other forms. On the day of the sale, what needs to happen for the token to change hands?Watch out for Red\u00a0FlagsThe Ethereum space is exciting and full of opportunities, but there are scammers and phishers of all sorts looking to take advantage of people\u2019s trust. It\u2019s essential that you protect yourself while participating in token launches.When trying to give your money to someone, make sure it\u2019s who you intend.A few best practices to staying safe:Never share your private\u00a0keyNever paste your private key anywhere beyond your primary wallet application like Metamask or MyEtherWallet. If you\u2019re using a web-based wallet, keep it bookmarked, and only ever manage it through your bookmark. Phishers can look just like legitimate support staff, but commonly direct people to fake sites to steal their secrets.Treat your private key like your confidential identity information (like your SSN). It gives total control over your account and its funds\u200a\u2014\u200aif someone is asking for it, there is likely something phishy happening. If someone claims they will give you benefits in exchange for your private key\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a scam! Keep an extra eye out for websites that have similar URLs to your trusted platforms, but have a minor difference that may lead you to a scam site built to imitate the site you\u2019re expecting.Always do a deep read of the whitepaper, check out the source\u00a0codeA legitimate Ethereum project will have a complete, detailed white paper explaining the value proposition of the project and the utility of their token in its ecosystem. You should read this when you\u2019re doing your due diligence. If there isn\u2019t a white paper, it\u2019s likely that the token is a scam. Even if there is a white paper, it doesn\u2019t mean the project is legitimate; make sure you read the white paper and evaluate if it provides details that back up the claims in the website and marketing. Keep an eye out for the project\u2019s tech development on Github, to make sure it\u2019s more than just a catchy name and a shiny website. Even if you can\u2019t read code, a healthy developer presence on Github and elsewhere is a sign of a more legitimate project.Listen to the communityThe Ethereum community usually forms a solid opinion of a token launch before it happens. Check on r/ethereum, r/ethtrader, r/cryptocurrency, and the Ethereum Gitter Channel to see what people are saying about the launch. Find some informed voices from the community whose integrity and knowledge you trust, and follow them on social media.Before the Launch: Be\u00a0PreparedParticipating in a popular token launch is sort of like buying concert tickets that you think might sell out fast: you don\u2019t want to forget your Ticketmaster login or have to update your credit card info at the last second. But with token launches, there is the added threat of phishing, so it\u2019s even more important to make sure you know the details ahead of time.Before the launch:Set up your accounts ahead of\u00a0time.Find out what you need to use to interact with the token sale, whether it\u2019s MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, or another kind of wallet or browser. Set up your account before the token sale so that you\u2019re ready to go.Back up your\u00a0accountMake sure you back up your seed phrase for MetaMask or any other account backups for other types of wallets. Double check that it\u2019s going to the right address for your account. Write it down; your hard drive could always crash. You can\u2019t be too safe when you\u2019re backing up your account!Get the\u00a0addressProjects will usually release the address of the token sale ahead of time; make sure you get it beforehand from a reliable source, and compare that to the address on the day of the sale. Sometimes, phishers will give you the wrong address, so read and re-read it! In one case phishers were even able to gain control of a project\u2019s website and post the wrong address there. Another way to check that the address is correct is to use a block explorer like EtherScan to review the contract\u2019s source code and make sure it does what you expect.What to Expect on Launch\u00a0DayThere are some precautions you should take to stay safe and increase your chances of obtaining your tokens when the launch commences and you begin your participation.When submitting your transaction:Triple-check the\u00a0addressIt\u2019s easy to input the wrong address when you\u2019re sending your ETH; and as we\u2019ve mentioned, there are phishers out there who will try to bamboozle you with the wrong address. Check the address you\u2019ve input against the address you got from the project before the token launch, and again against their website. Make sure you\u2019re on the correct, legitimate site when you do so. Be careful with projects that only release the address when the sale opens, because you have no way to verify that it is correct.Up the gas price by a few\u00a0GWeiWhen you\u2019re submitting a transaction on Ethereum, the suggested gas price is usually sufficient; but during a high-traffic period during which there is a backlog of transactions, you can skip to the front of the line if you offer a higher gas price. This may increase your chances of processing a time-sensitive transaction. You can see if the blockchain has a backlog on the Etherscan pending transaction page, and you can see a lot of stats about current gas prices on EthGasStation. You can read more about gas and how it works in this article.Be patientYour transactions could take a few seconds to a few hours, and in some cases even a few days to process. This just depends on the current transaction backlog. A big token launch with a limited time opportunity can create a huge backlog, that has sometimes lasted days. You can always check on EtherScan to see how your transaction is doing. If it\u2019s been more than 24 hours, it\u2019s likely the transaction has failed, but you should definitely check to see.Know that you may not get any\u00a0tokensWhen you\u2019re participating in a token sale, especially a popular one, you aren\u2019t guaranteed to get a token. Even if you\u2019re one of the first people to submit, and you\u2019ve done everything right, sometimes the transactions are simply processed in an order unfavorable to you. This isn\u2019t something that MetaMask or any other wallet provider can control. Only miners have control over the order that transactions are processed. Don\u2019t worry, if that is the case, your ETH will be returned to your wallet, minus the transaction fee (presuming the sale itself was secure and valid).After the\u00a0SaleYou now have some tokens, whatever that means!Congratulations, you\u2019ve purchased some tokens! After the sale takes place, and assuming you\u2019ve successfully purchased a token in a legitimate sale:You can view your token balances in MetaMask in the Token tab (see this guide for details).You can send tokens from your MetaMask accounts using the token send page from MyEtherWallet.com following this guide.How We Can\u00a0HelpAt MetaMask, we do everything we can to ensure our users safety and security Unfortunately, if your Ether is depleted from your wallet, we can\u2019t reverse those transactions.However, there are many things we can help you with. If you have any problems using MetaMask or getting set up, check out our Support Page, and if you can\u2019t find an answer there, open a ticket with us.The Ethereum token ecosystem is a strange and exciting place; now that you are equipped with a few best practices to protect yourself, hopefully you can get involved more safely, and stay better informed!Like this piece?

Once you\u2019ve participated in a token sale, you will get tokens (allocate tokens) to your ethereum wallet with which you participate. Here in this article, I will explain with 0xProject token as an example. This can be any other ICO as far as the tokens issued are ERC20 standard like ZRX or KickICO or any other token.So if you have participated in token sale of 0xproject, you would have got your ZRX tokens to Metamask, which can also be checked on MyEtherWallet aka MEW. So the question could also be \u201chow to transfer these ERC20 tokens from MEW to Poloniex\u201d (Taking Poloniex as example as it\u2019s one of prominent exchanges listing ZRX at the time of writing).Step by Step guideLogin to PoloniexGo to Balances -> Deposits & WithdrawalsInterestingly, finding ZRX is easy here too when you sort it by name as it starts with 0. Once you see ZRX as shown below, you need to get the Deposit Address.Click on Deposit button in the last column of table against ZRX token (row). You should be able to see an Ethereum like address, which you need to copy to clipboard (Ctrl+C or Command+C).Now go to https://www.myetherwallet.com and unlock your account using private key stored. This opens up the wallet through which you\u2019ve purchased ZRX tokens. Once it is unlocked, go to the bottom right corner of the screen, where you will see buttons \u201cLoad Token Balances\u201d, \u201cShow Tokens\u201d.Click on Load Token Balancesand once it is done, click on Show Tokens which will list all possible ERC20 tokens compatible with MyEtherWallet. Fortunately, ZRX starts with Z and will be easily available at the end when you scroll all the way down.You can now see the Balance of your ZRX here.Once you have your address, come back to MEW(MyEtherWallet). Since you have got the Token Balances, now you will have a dropdown beside Amount to Send which shows all possible Tokens you have balance for. Eg: ETH and ZRX as shown below. Select ZRX and continue to next stepYou can either enter the amount of ZRX tokens to be sent to exchange or use Send Entire Balance quick link to populate with your ZRX balance.Then, paste(Ctrl+V or Command+V) the deposit address which you\u2019ve copied from Poloniex. Be very careful and double, triple check the address matches with your poloniex address\u200a\u2014\u200aIf you copy a wrong one or miss something, your tokens will be lost forever.Once address is pasted, amount to send is populated and ZRX is selected from dropdown. Gas value will automatically change to around 52000 and then click on Generate Transaction and then click on Send Transaction and that\u2019s it\u200a\u2014\u200ait gives you \u201cVerify Transaction\u201d button at the bottom or you can search etherscan.io using your poloniex address.PANIC MOMENTAt least for me, being the very first time of transferring ERC tokens from MEW to Poloniex/Exchange, it was a panic moment to see them being shifted across multiple addressesMy tokens were transferred from my MEW address to Address shown on PoloniexThen after 6 minutes, they were transferred from there to some other address (possibly poloniex\u2019s pool) Check this link https://etherscan.io/token/ZRX?a=0xead6be34ce315940264519f250d8160f369fa5cdFrom there, they were transferred to another address in another few minutes, which is when you will see a pending transaction on Poloniex in Mainmenu->Balances->HistoryFortunately, folks at 0xproject slack were helpful and Amir Bandeali suggested that above address could be of Poloniex pool and it turned out to be that, which helped me keep my calm as I wait to see it pending on Poloniex.This 15 minute process of panic made me write this article to help others.", "responses": "6"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "", "link": "https://medium.com/likecoin/likecoin-reg-tutorial-def058a004bd?source=search_post", "post_date": "", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to receive your AirDrop & Bounty\u00a0tokens", "author_name": "CryptoCrystal", "link": "https://medium.com/@cryptocrystal/how-to-receive-your-airdrop-bounty-tokens-5eb9ac6989ef?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 14, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "326", "content": "How to receive your AirDrop & Bounty\u00a0tokensTo receive tokens seems to be difficult.CryptoCrystalBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 14, 2018So I let you know how to receive the airdrop which has been pre-registered and referral bounty.1\u00a0.

We have released a Demo-version of our product, the Proof-of-Asset Protocol, which provides new sources of capital for real assets on a crypto-centric FinTech platform. We have created a demo-version, and it signifies a solution for business.Here is an explanatory video:The best example is a simple example. So imagine that you own two cars. Your biggest wish today is to earn an income off them, but just the thought of all procedures associated with it sends shivers down your spine. So our Proof-of-Asset protocol allows you to tokenize your two cars this evening, and by tomorrow morning you\u2019ll have your money. You protect your token investments with secured assets.Imagine the limitless possibilities that the Proof-of-Asset Protocol can open for your business: access to capital made faster and easier. Take a look at instructions for our app.It is an important step as we managed to implement all the steps of our Proof-of-asset protocol there. This BANKEX demo allows you to create a smart asset using Ropsten test blockchain.In order to use the demo you will have to install the MetaMask plugin first.You can use this guide for it: https://blog.bankex.org/how-to-buy-ethereum-using-metamask-ccea0703daecAfter you log in using MetaMask, you can choose the type of smart asset that you would like to create. Currently there are 3 types available: car token, real estate token and Apple device token.A detailed instruction on how to create a smart asset can be found here: https://blog.bankex.org/creating-a-smart-asset-using-metamask-plugin-30a06bc75ea2After you choose a smart asset type, you are redirected to the form where you will need to include the initial info. Say you selected car token, and are taken to the form as the first step of asset creation. Here you will need to include all information on the car you intend to tokenize, as well as your contact information. For the purpose of this demo, you don\u2019t have to input actual authentic data. The smart asset can be created even leaving the form blank. In which case you will have created a smart asset with blank data. This demo\u2019s primary value is to serve as a demonstration of the asset creation scenario, so we included no strict restrictions for data input. The form includes the option of including a KYC-provider, followed by information on the car (color, mileage, release year, VIN number).After you fill in all the information, it is recorded in blockchain. At this stage you will need MetaMask to pay for the transaction. Ropsten Ether can be obtained if you have a GitHub account. As this is a challenging limitations to some, we have an alternative solution. Users will be able to receive small amounts of Ropsten test Ether from us (the transaction requires a fairly small amount).Having created a smart asset of a certain type, you will then move on to a page with its detailed description. You will see several QR-codes here, containing the smart contract address, the address of the asset itself and the address of the transaction. The QR-code of the asset will be required if you would like to attach additional data to the asset using our mobile app. In this version, the mobile app imitates Internet of Things sensors.The mobile app is completely optional\u200a\u2014\u200athe smart asset is created regardless of whether or not IoT data is included. However, IoT data is used to obtain more accurate information on the asset and, as a result, to increase the accuracy of the asset\u2019s evaluation. Scanning the QR-code of the asset using the mobile app, you give it the asset number\u200a\u2014\u200athis allows the app to identify the asset that it needs to attach the IoT data to.Imagine you sent in data via the app. Returning to the smart asset page, you will be able to press the button reading \u201cCollect Sensor Data\u201d.This will allow you to pull the data sent by the app from the server into your asset. All IoT data is recorded on the blockchain.The value of the asset increases together with its validation. IoT helps us prove the authenticity of the information provided. The data from IoT includes geolocation data, photos and other sensor data. The next step would be the evaluation of the asset, and release of the corresponding token to the market. Also included is the option to share your smart asset via social media.NB!

We\u2019re a chrome extension crypto wallet and account manager with about a million active installs.I\u2019m writing to raise a concern with Chromium Issue 896897, Implement Manifest v3 for Chromium extensions. I commented there, but I am re-publishing here for the sake of more easily linking to our specific concerns (especially since there are so many concerns being expressed regarding those changes).We would like the v3 manifest format to not be pushed to production in its current form until support for the FrozenRealms specification has been included, or at least iFrame API support is kept in the background script context, allowing extensions to run foreign scripts in an isolated environment.Most of the WebExtensions representing this perspective are plugin systems like GreaseMonkey, which increase security by limiting its extensions\u2019 access to the DOM. In addition to plugin systems, I\u2019d like to share another security concern related to these changes.We have been working on using Agoric\u2019s SES (Secure EcmaScript) to better isolate our dependencies, to reduce the risk of dependency-based thefts like the CoPay Dash event-stream hack, as suggested by Zooko Wilcox. SES was derived from Google\u2019s own Caja project.Currently Agoric\u2019s SES relies on a polyfill of the Realms API that relies on the iFrame API, which is not available in ServiceWorkers at this time, which the proposed manifest v3 currently requires all background scripts to be.All we really need is the FrozenRealms API, since it\u2019s the simplest way to truly isolate foreign code in a secure way, but keeping iFrame support would at least let us continue using the SES Realms polyfill.Our background script must handle user keys which manage cryptocurrency accounts, often the most security sensitive bits of data on the user\u2019s entire computer, so it should be understandable that we care very much about the security available to the background script in particular.Thanks for your time,\u2014Dan Finlay and Aaron Davis,MetaMask", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Aavesome", "link": "https://medium.com/aave/breaking-news-over-300-eth-borrowed-on-ethlend-decentralized-lending-application-under-two-weeks-a13de3db1c67?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 28, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "99", "content": "AavesomeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 28, 2017BREAKING NEWS: Over 300 ETH Borrowed on ETHLend Decentralized Lending Application under two Weeks!Since the Alpha 0.2 release on 15 December 2017, ETHLend is proud and humble to announce that over 300 worth of Ethereum has been borrowed through our decentralized application!Borrowers have used variety of different collaterals ranging from the pre-defined list the DAPP provides. There have been currently over 120 loans and the most popular collateral is ETHLend\u2019s native LEND token.The USD-pegged Ethereum loans consists of around 12% of the total loan book, and rest of the loans being pure Ethereum. Most loans are up to 30 days and fewer loans are above 30 days. The biggest loan is around 20 000 USD worth of Ethereum and other bigger loans have varied from 10\u201317 ETH. Due to gas costs on Ethereum, under 0.5 ETH loans are less efficient and we consider loans below 0.5 ETH more or less as testing purposes.Lending volume provides cash flow. Upon each loan request, ETHLend collects 0.01 ETH fee from the borrower and 0.01 ETH fee from the lender when funding a loan. Therefore, even such early stage as Alpha, ETHLend is creating turnover for the project. Despite the fact that the volumes are recently accumulated and the fee structure will be change to more efficient by lowering the threshold for borrowing and making more return on bigger loans, such fee collecting is a proof-of-concept that ETHLend could grow into a fully established FinTech house soon.The unexpected success is a great milestone not solely for ETHLend team, moreover for the whole community of decentralized applications. Developing decentralized applications is surely not the easiest path, however in the long run provides a market that is determined by the lenders and borrowers instead of banks and financial institutions.Do you have a token portfolio and need to unlock some of that liquidity you have lying around in your tokens?Place a loan request by installing metamask (from https://metamask.io) and browsing to the decentralized application at https://app.ethlend.io.

Smart Contracts, Inc.BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 5, 2017By: Jonathan BrownPreviously I had written about how to sign in to a ExpressJS app using Ethereum and JWT.As a follow up, I am introducing web3-auth, an NPM to sign in to the backend with Ethereum accounts.How does it work:The Web3 environment (MetaMask / Mist) is requested to sign a message using the account\u2019s private key.The account address and the signed message are POSTed to the backend.The backend verifies that the signature is correct and generates a signed Json Web Token (JWT) proving that the holder is in control of the address.The JWT is sent back to the web browser as a HttpOnly (not accessible from frontend JS) session cookie.Now I have created a drop-in NPM with this functionality.https://github.com/vanbexlabs/web3-authIt\u2019s very easy to use:npm install web3-auth\u200a\u2014\u200asaveOn the backendvar web3Auth = require(\u2018web3-auth\u2019);web3Auth.attach(app, \u201cThis is my secret.\u201d);The ethereum address of the authentcated user making the request is in `req.user.loggedInAs`.On the frontendvar web3AuthFrontEnd = require(\u2018web3-auth/frontend.js\u2019)web3AuthFrontEnd.signIn(); // Call this when a sign-in button is pressed.I also updated the demo app to use the NPM:

IdenticonsProtecting against the new threat of clipboard hijackingTeam NimiqBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 13On the 8th of February 2019, Lukas Stefanko announced that WeLiveSecurity.com had identified the first case of clipper malware on the Google Play store. It is no surprise that this newly discovered malware was designed to steal cryptocurrency. Nimiq is protected from clipboard hijacking by design, thanks to the Nimiq Identicons.Metamask Clone Exploits Copy &\u00a0PasteThe malware was found impersonating Metamask on the Google Store and was built to steal a users crypto in two ways:To get the users private keys and gain control of the victim\u2019s wallet.By replacing a BTC or ETH wallet address copied to a clipboard with one being controlled by the hacker.Metamask browser extension, used by more than 1.3 million\u00a0usersThe scary thing about stealing crypto through clipboard hijacking is that it exploits user behavior. With any cryptocurrency, receiver wallet addresses are a very long and difficult to memorize string of numbers and letters. To keep things straight forward, most crypto users are copy and pasting the receiver address when processing transactions.Clipboard Hijacking: How Does It\u00a0Work?Clipboard hijacking malware works by monitoring the clipboards of infected computers for cryptocurrency addresses. Essentially, if the malware detects a cryptocurrency address on the user\u2019s clipboard, it will swap it out for an address owned by the thieves.In most cases, crypto clipboard hijackers are limited to a few hundred thousand addresses. However, in mid-2018 BleepingComputer discovered malware monitoring 2.3 million crypto wallet addresses.The truth is that most users do not know that they have been infected with clipboard hijacking malware until it\u2019s too late. The malware simply runs in the background and there is no indication that it\u2019s even there.How can Nimiq Identicons Combat Clipboard HijackingFor those that don\u2019t know, an identicon is \u201ca visual representation of a hash value\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. that serves to identify a user of a computer system as a form of avatar while protecting the users\u2019 privacy\u201d. With Nimiq, virtually-unique identicons are assigned to every account address (Nimiqs terminology in place of \u201cwallet address\u201d) and aim to make each address identifiable at just a glance. Based on Robohash, the challenge Nimiq had to overcome when developing its identicons, was to ensure they are exceptionally recognizable whilst also offering a high level of variability to enable the generation of a different identicon for each Nimiq account address.Indeed, identicons are used to help visualize Ethereum addresses in popular wallets like MyEtherWallet. However, these types of identicons are more geared to tech-savvy audiences and typical internet users often don\u2019t find them recognizable, distinguishable or memorable.Identicons of Ethereum addressesNow, that\u2019s a big problem when you consider the intended function of identicons, as the creator of the concept put it:\u201cIMHO, too much of the web what we read are textual or numeric information which are not easy to distinguish at a glance when they are jumbled up together. So I think adding visual identifiers will make the user experience much more enjoyable.\u201d- Don Park, creator of the identicon conceptIdenticons of Nimiq addressesThe key success factor here is that Nimiq Identicons are highly distinguishable and memorable so that users can identify different account addresses easily. So, when you are trying to confirm to your friends that they are indeed sending to the intended account address:Instead of repeating your Nimiq account address NQ57 KNAL 9PG2 ATVG EBDD 6SMG HUHD M959 SG1B you can say\u2026It\u2019s the orange unicorn with green eyes and antennas.This makes checking account addresses significantly easier, humans are simply better at describing visualizations, rather than a long string of letters and numbers. We also think this way of verifying account addresses is more fun too.If a Nimiq user is subject to a clipboard hijacking attack and the malware replaces the Nimiq address on the clipboard with an account address controlled by the attacker, then the user will paste this fraudulent address into the send field and the receiving addresses identicon will be shown instantly. If you are sending NIM to a friend and you see an identicon different from their usual one, then you instantly know that someone has launched a clipboard hijacking attack against you (or you made a typo or copy-paste error yourself). If you are sending to someone you don\u2019t know, you can just ask them like \u201care you the orange guy, with the soccer ball, blue lobster claws, and the blue background?\u201d.Want to check out some of Nimiq\u2019s Identicons for yourself? Take a look\u00a0here.There is also an ongoing effort to improve the usability in the check-at-a-glance user interaction, by adding a suggested name to each identicon. Many thanks and credit to community developer Terorie for contributing the naming scheme.Yes, it\u2019s true that clipboard hijacking attacks can be protected against by double or triple checking recipient account addresses before sending. However, that does make things more complicated and time-consuming, also most people trust that their computer will paste what they copied. That\u2019s why the instant recognizability and huge variation of Nimiq Identicons can help protect NIM users and foil clipboard hijacking attempts in both a simple and straight forward way.The Huge Variety Of Nimiq IdenticonsEach Nimiq Identicon has five different elements, bottoms, faces, sides, tops body, and background color. Each element has a distinctive color. In total, identicons are made up of a combination of:21 bottoms21 faces21 sides21 tops8 colors for parts9 body colors10 background colorsThat means there are 10 * 9 * 8 * 21\u2074 = 140,026,320 different identicons that can be generated. This means that Nimiq is capable of generating more than 100 million highly differentiated and instantly recognizable identicons.Final WordThe fake MetaMask app in the Google Play store just goes to show how bad actors are evolving and changing their methods to steal crypto by trying to exploit common user behavior. We hope this example helps you to better understand the value of Nimiq Identicons and why it\u2019s useful to have a method for users to easily recognize addresses. In extension of the ease-of-use of the Nimiq Identicons, we look forward to soon rolling out the new Nimiq Identicon naming scheme and sharing it with the community. If you don\u2019t have a Nimiq Identicon yet and want to choose your own right now, you can do so in 30 seconds by creating a Nimiq account here.Pura VidaTeam Nimiq", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "What are\u00a0Tokens?", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "link": "https://medium.com/@danfinlay/what-are-tokens-ef34ba745ee4?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 21, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "73", "content": "What are\u00a0Tokens?Dan FinlayBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 21, 2017These days, when someone says \u201cToken\u201d in a blockchain/Ethereum context, they are usually referring to any Ethereum smart contract that follows the ERC-20 protocol.The ERC-20 protocol is fairly simple. It\u2019s just a set of methods that describe what a basic currency does. Here is a header file for the interface, which is so concise, I believe many non-programmers should be able to make sense of it:contract ERC20 {     function totalSupply() constant returns (uint totalSupply);     function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance);     function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);     function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);     function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool success);     function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint remaining);     event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);     event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value);}The nice thing about having a common protocol is that different wallets know how to talk to those smart contracts very reliably. By having a consistent interface, tokens become easy to represent in a variety of contexts.That said, there is nothing about this particular token standard that is special or absolute. It\u2019s just a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. What a token actually does can be a very open ended thing! While you might expect that sending a token deducts from yourself and adds to someone else, a token like BeerCoin might behave differently!Even \u201cthe standard\u201d itself might change over time, and so wallets all have to do what they can to keep up. Right now ERC-223 is a draft for one token alternative, for example.Does my Wallet Support This\u00a0Token?In Ethereum, the wallet does not actually hold your tokens. Your wallet holds your keys, which is used to send transactions from your account. Transactions can include sending Ether, publishing, or interacting with smart contracts. This includes tokens.When a wallet \u201cSupports tokens\u201d, it just means it has an easy way of *showing* those tokens. Some wallets only allow showing a certain list of tokens. Other wallets let you add custom tokens. Some wallets let you add any contract at all, token or not!For this reason, any wallet that allows \u201cviewing any ERC-20 token\u201d will be able to view any contract that exposes the ERC-20 token methods listed above, so you don\u2019t need to worry whether your token will work with MetaMask, or MEW, or Parity, or Mist.ConclusionIssuing a token just means writing a smart contract that includes some certain functions. Anyone who can write a smart contract and publish it to the blockchain can publish a token that is usable with any normal Ethereum wallet.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Ethereum Development Guide\u200a\u2014\u200aPart\u00a03", "author_name": "Stefan Beyer", "link": "https://medium.com/cryptronics/ethereum-development-guide-part-3-c5a402bf8815?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 5, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "18", "content": "Ethereum Development Guide\u200a\u2014\u200aPart\u00a03Stefan BeyerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 5, 2018Developing web interfaces for smart contractsIntroductionIn part 1 and part 2 of this tutorial series we have developed an Ethereum smart contract for document certification and a command-line tool to make use of the service. In this third part of the guide, we will look at how we can make this service publicly available through a web application.Prerequisites and learning\u00a0outcomesIn order to follow this tutorial, you should have also followed part 1 and part 2, or at least have the source code from these tutorials and understand it:stbeyer/docCertTutorialdocCertTutorial\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain based document certification tutorialgithub.comAs in the previous tutorial, we will use Javascript and Node.js, so some working knowledge of this is required.After completing this tutorial you will know how to:Use the web3.js library in a web environment to connect to an Ethereum smart contractHow to use MetaMask to allow users to sign for transactions with their own keysBuild a web application that connects to a smart contract, executing transactions and callsDesigning the web interfaceFirst, let us define a web interface which will eventually connect to our contract. As this is not a web design tutorial, we will use some very basic html, although I use the bootstrap framework to make the front-end look acceptable.The following is what we want the application to look like:Let\u2019s create a directory webapp and create a file index.html inside the directory with the following content:As you can see we are importing some bootstrap related stylesheet and javascript files from content delivery networks. This also includes the JQuery library which is used by bootstrap and we will also use to simplify our own Javascript.The other two libraries we need are web3 and jsSHA, which we already know from part 2 of this guide. For jsSHA we just copy the sha256.js file into our webapp directory. You can copy this file from the npm imported modules we used in part 2 or from the libraries git repository.In the case of web3, getting the correct file is slightly more complicated. The required file for the browser version of this library should be in the dist folder of the git repository or npm module. However, at the time of writing, even the 1.0 branch of the web3 git repository does not include the correct 1.0 version of the library in the dist folder. I use version 1.0 in this tutorial, as it makes more sense to learn the updated interface of this new version. The required file can be build from source, but as this may fail because of missing dependencies on some installations, it may be easiest to copy it from my repository.The other two Javascript files are the ones in which we will develop our application code. We will get to these soon, but first of all, make sure you have a local web server installed, to serve our web application (web3 does not work correctly, if served from the file system). If you do not have a local web server application you may use http-server. This can be installed globally with:npm install http-server -gNow we can serve our web application on http://localhost:8080 by executing the following command in our webapp directory:http-server .We can now navigate to the page.Designing the contract connectionIf we connect to our contract through our Ethereum node, as in part 2 of this guide, we hit two problems:The node does not run on the end-users computer, so we would have to make it publicly accessible, which is a security risk.Each time a user uploads a document hash, a transaction fee occurs, which is charged to our account. In order to offer our document certification service publicly, we thus cover the bill for our end-users.We could of course ask our users to run their own Ethereum nodes, but then we would provide a service that is difficult to use. A better solution would be to ask users to pay a fee for submitting a file hash to cover our cost, and hide our node behind a REST API (i.e. requests to the contract are sent form the front-end to our back-end server and passed to the Ethereum node there).There is however a third solution, which is the one we will explore here: We can ask our user to sign transactions with their own keys, without running a full node, and by using a user-friendly light wallet.To this end, we will use the MetaMask browser plugin, which is available for Chrome and Firefox. MetaMask is an Ethereum wallet for the browser. The extension actually injects a web3 provider into the browser, which allows us to connect to the blockchain via a MetaMask provided node. We can use web3 as usual and MetaMask will automatically pop up and ask users to confirm transactions and, importantly, spend their own Ether. In our web application we can tell users to install MetaMask, for example by linking the following image to the MetaMask website:Go ahead and install MetaMask in your browser and create an account. MetaMask will appear in your toolbar displaying an image of a fox. In this tutorial we will use our contract deployed on the Rinkeby test network in part 2 of this guide, so make sure you select Rinkeby as the network to connect to in your MetaMask installation. The network can be selected in a drop down menu at the top of the MetaMask extension\u2019s user interface.As in part 2, we require some Rinkeby test Ether in our account. You can transfer some test Ether you may still have from the previous tutorial to your MetaMask account, or use the Rinkeby Ether faucet again to request additional Ether.Connecting to our\u00a0contractOnce we have MetaMask set up to the Rinkeby network, with some test Ether in our account, we can write the missing Javascript code to connect our web interface. Fist of all, let\u2019s define a contract wrapper module again, this time in a file called notaryWebApp.js with the following content:As your can see the code is similar to the contract wrapper module we defined for our command line tool in part 2 of this guide. The functions to send a hash value to the contract and to verify a hash value are unchanged, so we will not discuss them again.What has changed however is the initialisation code that created the link to our web3 provider:if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {    window.web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);} else {    alert(\"No Ethereum interface injected into browser. Read-only access\");}MetaMask injects a web3 object, which used to be a full version of the library. However, in order to deal with different library versions, only a small subset to get the provider is guaranteed to be supported in the foreseeable future, which is why we have included our own copy of the web3 code in our Javascript imports in the html code. The above code checks if we have an injected web3 objects, i.e. it checks wether MetaMask or a compatible extension is installed (the official Ethereum Mist browser also injects web3). If this is found to be the case, we create a new web3 object with our library pointing to the existing existing provider. If no web3 object is found, we display an alert.The contract address and ABI declarations and the contract object definition are unchanged (Remember to replace the contract address, if you want to use your own instance).We can now create our application code in an app.js file in the webapp directory:We call the contracts wrapper init() function when the document is fully loaded. The two functions send() and find() are executed when the buttons in our html are clicked. As you can see, the hash values are calculated as previously, and we make sure that all HEX strings start with a leading \u201c0x\u201d, so that the contract bindings will translate to the Solidity byte32 data type correctly. We use JQuery to inject html into the web page to show the blockchain response.If we use the upload dialogue and click on the \u201cFingerprint to Blockchain\u201d button, MetaMask we pop up and request transaction confirmation:MetaMask confirmation dialogIf we confirm the transaction, MetaMask sends it via its Ethereum node, signed with the end-users key. We are presented with a result similar to this:We now have to wait for a short time for the transaction to be mined (you can confirm this by searching for the transaction ID on https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/.Once the transaction is mined verifying the file by clicking \u201cFind on Blockchain\u201d returns output similar to the following:ConclusionIn this three part guide we have shown the process of developing an Ethereum smart contract based application, using document certification as a simple but useful example. We have developed and tested the contract locally, before deploying it to a real Ethereum blockchain. We have connected to the contract through our own Ethereum node and through MetaMask. Furthermore, we have used the web3 library to create a command-line interface and a web application.The source code for this tutorial can be found on GitHub:stbeyer/docCertTutorialdocCertTutorial\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain based document certification tutorialgithub.com", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to Transfer Tokens from Gnosis LightWallet to Another\u00a0Wallet", "author_name": "Gnosis", "link": "https://blog.gnosis.pm/how-to-transfer-tokens-from-gnosis-lightwallet-to-metamask-57c3dcf2d049?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 3", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "52", "content": "How to Transfer Tokens from Gnosis LightWallet to Another\u00a0WalletGnosisBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 3Disclaimer: The blog post is for informational purposes only.

This was revolutionary at the time. Today this is standard practice and a powerful means of communication of ideas and information. Their dynasty provides us with a modern day example of how innovation provides a future outlook that all organizations can follow to generate success.The reason our project exists is due to the combination of leveraging the power of new blockchain technology, with existing financial problems in developing countries. This industry is fairly new and there are still varied opinions regarding the future of blockchain, and what can be achieved by integrating this technology into different sectors. 30 years ago, noone correctly anticipated the degree of integration of the internet and how it would occur into everyday life, creating widespread benefits to every sector of society. With this in mind, looking forward, we believe the same is possible regarding blockchain technology. Analysis of the world\u2019s population shows that 40% are still unbanked, this amounts to approximately 2 billion people. The interesting statistic here is that this same demographic uses social media extensively such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. We aim to release our platform in the Philippines as it is a prime example of a country whose population has more Facebook users than they have bank account holders. Providing credit to regions such as this, creates opportunities and builds a strong solid future for generations that will, in turn, receive an education, start a business and have access to better healthcare. Economic improvements in regions such as South East Asia would be made possible by the platform we are building. For us as a team, success in our project is measured by the millions of people whose lives we will be able to change.In our office in Barcelona, we have built a solid, collaborative technology team who are passionate about delivering a powerful blockchain-based platform that will successfully enable our vision from our whitepaper to come to life. If you were to visit our office and watch our weekly sprints, you would see that the team really cares about what they are doing and they are passionate about delivering the highest quality solution. As HeroToken holders, every single team member is invested into the future success of the project.After the wonderful response we gained from releasing the first set of screenshots of the new platform last month, we are very happy to be able to show you the next set of interfaces completed in the platform. This time we share some screenshots of our Metamask integration to our Ethereum smart contracts.MetaMask has been integrated into our platform and is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the smart contract without users needing to create new accounts into our system. Users will therefore be able to use their own accounts and balances with the highest level of security. Data security is a top priority for HeroToken and implementing MetaMask is a tried and tested way to ensure that their management of private keys and contracts safe.We have built our Loan Token smart contracts on Ethereum and MetaMask allows the user a seamless and user-friendly process of accessing our loan tokens and processing payments on the Ethereum network. As you can see from our first screenshot, the embedded MetaMask extension is ready to be used on our test platform. Our MetaMask implementation will guide our users through a simple process of logging in securely to their wallet, connecting to our smart contract, then processing the payment of the exact required amount in order to take possession of their loan tokens. This step-by-step process can be seen in the screenshots provided.Our smart contract will use the extension to link up with your existing MetaMask account and integrate completely in the background without you needing to do anything further.This particular process illustrated here is of the lending process of our platform, where the lenders are guided through this process of paying the originators and hence taking possession of their Loan Token to represent the loan.We have integrated using Rinkeby Test Network. This allows us to use a set of \u2018test\u2019 Ethers so that we can fully comprehend all the different aspects of how they will be implemented within our platform when it is live. This level of testing at this stage is imperative to our future success and ensures that we know all contingencies for when our system is live on the Ethereum main network.We hope that by sharing these screenshots, you have a clearer idea of what our technology team are undertaking and the solution that is taking shape. We are excited with this progress and we look forward to sharing more with you in the very near future.Away from technology, our team has also been immersing themselves into the events that Barcelona has to offer. Our business executive team have spent the latter part of the week attending an EU \u2018startup\u2019 event that allows them to learn, network and perspective about the strides that we are making.There is a lot of excitement about our project currently and we appreciate all the positive support and feedback shared by our community.We want to offer you exceptional, consistent service and therefore we encourage you to contact us with any questions you may have about this update (including the technical information) or anything else that we are doing.

Please consult our Twitter and future Medium posts for any new major incidents.tl;dr\u00a0: yesterday MetaMask was taken off of the Chrome Web Store for about 6 hours. It ended up being a removal in error on Chrome\u2019s side. Below: our thought processes and lessons learned. Plus: kudos to our supporters.Sometime during the morning of July 25th, 2018, one of our team members noticed that MetaMask was missing from the Chrome Web Store.This proved to be an interesting wake-up call for a majority of our team.What was left when one searched the term \u2018MetaMask\u2019 on the store was a few re-branded MetaMask forks and one ambiguously branded lookalike. No email from Google at the time alerted us as to why it was taken down (though later, we were notified that the email supposedly bounced, something we plan to investigate and fix tomorrow). All of our other versions\u200a\u2014\u200aon Firefox, Opera, and Brave\u200a\u2014\u200awere working normally.This presented the product with a few immediate concerns:Phishing\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough the majority of new users will visit our landing page first or be directly linked to the extension listing (both of which would eventually lead to a dead link), the existence of lookalikes on the storefront page meant that people searching for the extension could be mislead. Additionally, we were alerted of several other phishing vectors on Telegram and on the Google Play Store that were active at that time.Updates\u200a\u2014\u200athe team was anticipating to deploy a new update\u200a\u2014\u200awith features such as Trezor support and other various Quality of Life improvements\u200a\u2014\u200abut the situation effectively blocked us from deploying an update to over one million installs, which accounts for the majority of our total user count.New installs\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough we had a few knowledge base articles detailing how to install MetaMask from source, this still isn\u2019t an ideal user flow for common users, and explaining to them that they would have to install our extension differently would impact our accessibility.Without an express line of contact to arbitrate the decision nor any knowledge at the time why the removal happened (though rumors did spread quickly), we prepared for the worst possible scenario. Twitter blasts, reaching out to connections, rewriting knowledge base articles, and watching our communications channels took up a large chunk of work from the day.Thankfully, by approximately 12:40 PST the same day, we were back on the store. The reason given: the removal was done in error.The community was 100% behind us the entire time, something we wholeheartedly appreciate. Big shout-outs to Brave & BAT, Augur, MyCrypto, IDEX, and the several other people and organizations who helped propagate the initial announcement and inform our community. You all represent a community worth developing for.So, now that everything is said and done, what does this mean at a basic level?All operations are back to normal within MetaMask. Expect us to push a new update soon in relief.Chrome users should now be able to accept said update, and all links should work fine\u200a\u2014\u200ano listings have changed.The most egregious lookalike on the Chrome Web Store has been removed.The team will have ongoing discussions on future red-alert scenarios and have careful protocols to handle each one. In the most optimistic case, we will share the majority of these red-alert scenarios publicly to increase transparency.As the mango on top, this incident has allowed us to ask meaningful questions about security and continuing to earn trust and acceptance from our community.Given that browser\u2019s app stores have the ability to arbitrarily remove extensions from their listings, how does the product deal with this as an important layer in this ecosystem? What solutions allow us to be resilient to this kind of incident, intentional or not? Although several users used the opportunity to urge their fellow MetaMaskers to jump ship to another browser, this problem persists so long as the browser has the power to curate extensions at-will.How do we continue to combat phishing and in turn, increase confidence that the installed product is the correct one? We recognize that this is an ongoing battle in which phishers will always find ways to circumvent, but given the window of time in which we lacked a formal presence on both Chrome, Telegram, and Android, how do we alert users that these are not legitimate products?For a product that enables decentralized technology, it has centralized points of failure. Our distribution models are some of them, placing our trust in browsers, GitHub, and the people deploying in order to keep the system working. Although we at MetaMask continue to explore solutions to minimize these single points of failure, such as through multi-signature deployment and IPFS, we welcome the community to help us find answers.Again, we thank everyone for your support through this ordeal, though short it was.", "responses": "7"}, {"title": "How to add PMO tokens to your MetaMask\u00a0wallet.", "author_name": "PMOTION", "link": "https://medium.com/pmotion/how-to-add-pmo-tokens-to-your-metamask-wallet-ac612722b117?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 15, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "1.1K", "content": "How to add PMO tokens to your MetaMask\u00a0wallet.PMOTIONBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 15, 2018This is a short guide on how to add it to your PMO tokens to your MetaMask wallet.MetaMask allows you to manage your Ethereum and ERC20 tokens within your browser.You can wait on Metamask to load your PMO tokens or you can add it to MetaMask manually.First you will need to go to the \u201cTokens\u201d tab of MetaMaskMetaMask Tokens Tab2.

We\u2019ve got some big announcements here, and a fresh version of the extension (4.9.0) just hit browsers near you. Read on to learn what your new MetaMask has in store.Trezor supportWe\u2019re happy to announce support for Trezor hardware wallets! If you have a Trezor, you can now connect it to MetaMask and use it to sign transactions across the web. From the top-right menu, click \u201cConnect Hardware Wallet,\u201d follow a couple easy steps, and you\u2019re ready to go.For best results, make sure your Trezor is updated to the latest firmware. And if you don\u2019t have a Trezor, get one! Remember, you shouldn\u2019t be using MetaMask (or your main computer) to store large amounts of Ether. Hardware wallets greatly reduce your risk to hackers. Hat tip to Bruno B. for the solid work (#4625). Read more here.Breaking Change: No longer injecting web3 automaticallyFor anyone who cares about privacy on the web, this is big news. For a long time, MetaMask (and most other dapp browsers) have automatically injected an Ethereum provider and web3 instance into every page you visit. This has made it easy for dapps to get up and running as the ecosystem evolved. On the downside, this is a huge privacy issue: exposing the web3 object and a user\u2019s Ethereum addresses could give malicious sites enough info to fingerprint, track, and phish in a seriously dangerous way.MetaMask (along with Status, Mist, and imToken) plan to stop injecting an Ethereum provider and web3 instance by default. Instead, dapps can use the `postMessage` API to request access from the user. To the user, this will look a bit like a traditional log in flow.Since this change has implications for every dapp out there, we\u2019re taking it slow. We aim to make this change on November 2, and we\u2019ll be releasing example code and UI components along the way to keep things simple for dapp developers.To learn more, check out our blog post or the original EIP 1102. This change also leads neatly into an updated version of the Ethereum provider API, described in EIP 1193.Draft UI for MetaMask\u2019s EIP 1102 implementation (log-in per\u00a0site)ENS is\u00a0hereThis new version of MetaMask adds support for resolving ENS domains! When you type a `.eth` URL in your web browser, MetaMask will resolve the ENS Public Resolver `getContent` hash to the corresponding IPFS hash, and redirect your browser to content served from Infura. [Head to metamask.eth to try it out!] or read this tutorial to posting your own sites on ENS & IPFS! Loading sites over ENS allows sites to be updated by smart contracts instead of the traditional DNS system, potentially reducing the risk of DNS related hacking and phishing that we\u2019ve seen so much of lately. Big shout-out to Phyrex Tsai of portal.network for making this contribution (#4405). Check him out at phyrextsai.eth with MetaMask installed!The ENS/IPFS integration is currently reliant on Infura for its distribution and security, but we\u2019re working towards including more and more of the security client-side over time.The disappearing foxOn Wednesday 7/26, the MetaMask extension was mistakenly removed from the Chrome store for several hours. As most of our users are on Chrome, this caused trouble for our release process and our users\u2019 security. We\u2019re back up and running smoothly, and you can read our informal post-mortem here.MetaMask is\u00a0hiring!Our family is growing.

Most of our UI improvements happen on the Beta UI, and you haven\u2019t switched over yet, you\u2019ll see a screen on startup suggesting you give it a try.The fresh version includes a new Confirmation Screen (below), with a simpler visual hierarchy, displays for contract method names (from the Parity method signature registry) a hex data input, a clearer summary of value for token transfers, and even warnings for nuanced interactions like \u201capprove\u201d token function calls.New confirmation screens with function names and transaction dataMetaMask is lucky to attract a lot of first-time blockchain users. For many, it\u2019s not obvious that token balances are tracked on contracts, unlike the Ether balance intrinsic to an account. Now, known tokens will appear automagically. We\u2019ll scan our list of known popular tokens and check your address against each, hopefully reducing some clicks & headaches. (#4683)For our power users out there, MetaMask can get cluttered with loose accounts. You\u2019re now able to remove loose or imported accounts in the Beta UI from the drop-down menu in the top right. (#2638)You can now remove loose accounts from the top-right menuThe \u201cSend\u201d screen in our Beta UI has a few new tweaks, including an input for optional hex data, more specific error messaging, and a better display of your account address. (#4814, #4694, #4822)The \u201cHome\u201d screen in the Beta UI has a couple upgrades as well: we\u2019re no longer showing rejected transactions on the activity log, and we\u2019ve added small tooltips to make navigation a little smoother. (#4667, #4779)The UI component we use for displaying signature requests now handles newlines and booleans (#4167, #4640). And if you\u2019re a developer out there using `eth_signTypedData`, heads up! The next version of MetaMask will update to the recently-merged EIP 712 spec, and you may need to update your application accordingly.

Any computer connected to the Ethereum network can be referred to as a node. A Full Node is a device that verifies and enforces all of the rules of the blockchain, while a Light Client is referencing a trusted Full Node\u2019s copy of the blockchain. This is important because you can interact on the blockchain without downloading an entire copy of the blockchain.Running a Full Node is\u00a0hardInteracting with the Ethereum blockchain requires access to a node to retrieve the latest data. The blockchain is huge, and running a Full Node is very resource intensive. Already requiring a lot of memory and storage, the blockchain only continues to expand by the minute. An average user does not have the gigabytes of memory and storage space to spare.A Light Client allows for as little verification as possible while remaining secure and fully capable of interacting with DApps and using the Ethereum network. Light clients do not store the entire copy of the blockchain, only specific elements of the blockchain that they need to operate. They store these elements to execute tasks and functions, such as sending and receiving funds. Consequently, they are required to connect to and query Full Nodes.VerificationWhen you sync your full node to the blockchain you are verifying the proof of work consensus. This is the solution to difficult puzzles, one for each block, which get more or less difficult in order to keep the block time consistent. Syncing takes a lot of time because you have to start all the way at the genesis block down to the next, verifying it down the line millions of times. Each subsequent block carries the accumulation of state changes and transitions over time. In our experience, it can take anywhere from a couple hours to a few days to sync a Full Node. It uses a significant amount of IOs and needs a solid state drive at the very least. Even if you are using an implementation that starts from a checkpoint block then it\u2019s still difficult to discover useful p2p nodes you\u2019re able to fetch data from. Syncing state takes a long time due to network issues and having to process every block to reconstruct the state. As a result among other factors, users are forced to rely on centralized infrastructures.Full nodes and Light Clients both sync blocks. However, Full Nodes hold the whole recent state (everyone\u2019s account balance and storage info) whereas Light Clients hold specific portions of the state for those accounts and transactions that they care about. Full nodes validate state transitions by using the state it currently holds and when a new block arrives, new transactions are factored in the block and generates a new state.Simply put, a Full Node makes sure everything matches up and is validated. Conversely, a Light Client is unable to undergo the same validation process as it lacks the recent state. However, assuming it has a reliable source for the latest block header, it can ask for elements of the state\u200a\u2014\u200alike account balance or a smart contract\u200a\u2014\u200afrom Full Nodes.We need options for\u00a0accessMost applications access blockchain data through a small handful of providers, creating silos of information where data is redundant but not highly available. Unchecked, this trend will continue towards centralization. Not only does it require a great deal of trust but it isn\u2019t the peer to peer experience that Ethereum embraces. Not to mention the cost of these providers to maintain this information distribution.Light clients sound great\u200a\u2014\u200awhat\u2019s the\u00a0problem?There are too many Light Clients per Full Nodes. Let\u2019s say there are 10,000 discoverable online/active Full Ethereum Nodes. If we were to turn all Metamask users (About 1.5 million) into Light Clients it would overwhelm them very quickly. The merkle tree that holds all accounts and token balances of Ethereum has over 200 million tree nodes at a given block. Every new block adds thousands of new ones that have to be reconstructed and shared. The volume would be like half time at a world cup concession stand. The Full Nodes being the people serving and the light nodes being the sea of people so eager to request and get what they want. It would be madness and the Full Nodes would not be able to keep up with the demand.Enter Mustekala\u200a\u2014\u200athe Light Client that seeds\u00a0data!As it stands today Light Clients are leechers of data and information. But what if Light Clients could share the data it has also? They don\u2019t have all the data that a Full Nodes has but what if they could share the data that they do have to other Light Clients? This would distribute the load on Full Nodes while also making information readily available to everyone.MetaMask\u2019s solution is to take and share slices of the merkle tree. These are essentially neighborhoods around your account which include other accounts. The same slicing principle applies to smart contract data as well. It\u2019s understandable that token holders will be concerned about their key-value inside the storage data, which could be referenced and hence shared using the same slice taxonomy. This would bring down the amount of tree nodes shared from 200 million to about 65 thousand instead. Each slice is about the size of a picture (128KB) which is manageable to deal with in comparison to the multiple GBs of storage required from the Full Node experience.So now we have the idea that Light Clients are going to be serving information to each other. What does that look like? Each dot represents a computer and the lines represent connections to other computers. Eventually you will have a large well connected graph. In a p2p network a great way of distributing information is gossiping which is taking information that is shared with you and then passing it along to your neighbors. This works especially well when everyone is interested in the data that you are sharing. For instance, there is high demand for information on the latest block.A p2p\u00a0networkSo what would it look like if we are gossiping slices of the blockchain instead? If you are looking up an account or token balance you have to get the slice associated with it. You would have to find others in the network who are looking for that also. You can form p2p neighborhoods, and the latest version of the slice can be passed between that network as well.Gossiping slicesHow do we plan to do\u00a0this?Mustekala offers an alternative approach to a light client solution by using the libp2p network stack. This is the same technology that powers IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to make Ethereum data available as ultra-light elements that can be retrieved based on its content, not its location. This is made possible by a p2p overlay network that we created called \u201cKitsunet\u201d.

This is why the MetaMask team welcomes contributions and input from the broader community.Recently, we have received a number of suggestions from the community regarding support for new blockchains. Currently, MetaMask users are able to access the Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Kovan, and Rinkeby test networks through an easy network drop-down UI. While users are able to connect to other networks by specifying an RPC URL, it does require manual input and doesn\u2019t persist if a user connects to a different custom RPC.Because MetaMask is able to support some custom networks, various teams working on Ethereum RPC compatible chains have requested that MetaMask add menu options to gain easy and automatic access to their own networks in the network selection drop-down. This would be an easy UI implementation, but the politics of maintaining a comprehensive list of blockchains would quickly distract us from iterating on the core product for our users. Rather than maintaining a list of networks, we are more interested in pursuing a generalized solution that allows users to opt into the networks that they prefer, without involving the MetaMask team! Fortunately, the path for this generalized solution is already being paved:In the pursuit of improved privacy and security, the MetaMask team has suggested EIP 1102 as a way to make web3 browser users undetectable while browsing the web, until a user deliberately reveals themselves. This initial sign-in API lays the groundwork for other sign-in options, including different accounts on different sites, and eventually even specific networks per application.Once these features are implemented, MetaMask will be able to work on maintaining simultaneous network connections, a feature that must exist if MetaMask is to enable cross-chain applications. Right now, a site that requests access to one network through MetaMask changes the network for all other sites, but we are already planning to change this behavior. Ideally, MetaMask should allow different sites to connect to their own sets of networks simultaneously.In the meanwhile, any contributor could quickly add support for more networks via our \u201cCustom RPC\u201d option by adding support for EIP 155, as documented in this issue (#1820). This feature should be straightforward to add without adding new providers to our menu, making it a simple and uncontroversial change to make.As we move forward into a multiple-network world, our team will continue iterating on these features. We want to facilitate the growth of the ecosystem, but we want to do it in a general way that keeps MetaMask useful for any user, without having to become arbiters of what networks receive a listing. Because our current vision is reliant on this ongoing series of features, it is difficult to estimate a concrete timeline, but as always, the best way to push the conversation forward is to collaborate with us on our github by commenting and proposing your ideas on the various issues that were linked throughout the article.Thanks to Dan Finlay, Bobby Dresser, and Jenny Pollack.", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "What is MetaMask?

It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum\u00a0node.\u2026 is what they say in their official website https://metamask.io/. However, to understand what this statement really means, you need to first understand what each of these words mean. I mean what is \u201cdistributed web\u201d and what really is \u201cdistributed web of tomorrow\u201d?. What is Ethereum dApp and a Ethereum node? This article will try to briefly demystify each of this word and introduce a tool called MetaMask, which will let you really explore the distributed web of tomorrow.Distributed Web (left) vs Centralized Web\u00a0(right)First of all, lets start with identifying what distributed web is. Most of the things you see on your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox or Opera.), including this article, comes from a computer that sits in a chilled room within a large data center somewhere. Many little computers and phones, which we often call clients, connect to the large central server to download bits of information that they need. This is how the modern web works. We call this the Centralized Web, because, you guessed it, all the data sits somewhere in a central location. However, some groups of people thought that having one large entity that stores, manages and even owns data is not very comfortable and often not safe. Instead, people decided to build a network where everyone can own and share a bit of data with everyone else in the network. So, instead of computers and phones connecting to a single server to download bits of information they need, they connect to many people who own smaller bits of information they need. And once they receive the information, they also begin to share it with others who need the same information. We call this the Distributed Web.Napster: Distributed web built for sharing\u00a0songs.There have been many famous applications of distributed web. The two most well-known examples are Napster and Torrent. Napster is a distributed web specifically built to share songs between its users. It has no central server that stores the songs, and users download and upload songs that they want and that they own. Similarly, Torrent is a distributed web specifically built to share all types of files between its users.Blockchain essentially is a distributed web, similar to Napster or Torrent, built to serve a different purpose. Blockchain is not a coin or some currency. It actually is a distributed web to log, store and share secure, verified and unmodifiable transactions. These transactions can include any type of actions between two entities. For example, in the case of bitcoin, transferring bitcoin between user A and user B can be stored in a blockchain. As you can see blockchain can store and share any type of data that needs security. Bitcoin is basically one application of blockchain technology.Ethereum Project: https://www.ethereum.org/Ethereum is a type of blockchain that is built for applications that need to store data or run programs in the distributed web. It is the \u201cdistributed web of tomorrow\u201d. Unlike bitcoin, Napster or Torrent, it can actually store data in the form of a computer program called smart contract. Computer owners can be part of the Ethereum network, obtain and share the smart contract and receive reward (Ethers) for running the smart contract. Once your computer is part of the Ethereum network, running smart contracts and sharing it with others, it is now a Ethereum Node.Ethereum allows programmers to write apps that can run on many people\u2019s computers. Such type of apps are called dApps, which stands for distributed applications. dApps are being built as we speak and it is slowly gaining more traction. So, we will soon find out what type of applications are a perfect fit as dApps and I will cover more examples of dApps on a separate article.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "HOW TO ADD-ON METAMASK TO MY GOOGLE CHROME AND IMPORT MY MEW ACCOUNT INTO\u00a0METAMASK", "author_name": "Winco", "link": "https://medium.com/@winco/how-to-add-on-metamask-to-my-google-chrome-and-import-my-mew-account-into-metamask-f2ab71ba8332?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 23, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "2.4K", "content": "HOW TO ADD-ON METAMASK TO MY GOOGLE CHROME AND IMPORT MY MEW ACCOUNT INTO\u00a0METAMASKWincoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 23, 2018First, you need to download the METAMASK add-on by going onto their website and following their instructions for \u201cGET CHROME EXTENTION\u201dOnce you click on GET CHROME EXTENTION this is what you should be seeing:(Click on the blue button) + Use it on Google Chrome.Then \u2018Add Extension\u2019 and you should see on the image below.

If you missed the speech in Prague (or if you just want more of Bruno\u2019s memes), here\u2019s a recap of MetaMask\u2019s past, present, and future \u2013 including details on the newly announced MetaMask Mobile!2018 MetaMask by the\u00a0Numbers\ud83e\udd8a 46 extension versions\u00a0released\ud83d\udee0 50k new lines of\u00a0code\u2705 882 pull requests\u00a0merged\ud83d\udca5 1400 issues\u00a0closed\ud83d\udc6f\u200d 100+ community contributors\ud83c\udf77 18 full-time employeesWhat\u2019s New with\u00a0MetaMaskAll those pull requests & releases add up to a lot of tangible changes to MetaMask, so we\u2019ve compiled a list of some updates you may have missed.Hardware wallet integrationsYour accounts are only as safe as your private keys. The safest way to keep your keys is with a hardware wallet, and you can now use MetaMask with both your Trezor and Ledger. And it\u2019s super simple to set up. Here are the instructions for the Trezor & Ledger.Privacy by Default (EIP\u00a01102)Starting on Nov. 2, MetaMask will allow you to turn on \u201cprivacy mode\u201d which will stop your account address from automatically being exposed to websites. You\u2019ll be able to opt-in to this feature starting early next week. If you\u2019re a dapp developer, you should prepare for this breaking change\u200a\u2014\u200ahere\u2019s a quick primer on how to get ready. This is a big step for user privacy on Ethereum and we\u2019re thankful to the community members who\u2019ve provided valuable feedback \u2764Easy token tracking (EIP\u00a0747)Many of our users struggle with manually adding token addresses so that MetaMask can display their token balances. Instead, dapps can now suggest specific tokens directly to MetaMask to track.Simplified data signing (EIP\u00a0712)Before EIP 712, it was often difficult to understand signing prompts and verify you were signing the message you wanted to. Now, dapps have a human-readable signing method that\u2019s also cheap to verify on-chain. If you\u2019re a developer, you should read more about EIP 712 and how use MetaMask\u2019s implementation.\u2026 and more! This is just the tip of the iceberg.

Rather than just another dapp browser, MetaMask Mobile is a bridge to the decentralized web, with a dapp-centric browsing experience, intuitive on-boarding, and features to sync and stay compatible with your desktop MetaMask accounts.Check out the demo below for a sneak peek of MetaMask Mobile\u2019s desktop-to-mobile sync in action.

MetaMask is building support for these contract accounts, allowing users to form a logical on-chain identity.Light Client Development (Mustekala)MetaMask Labs is working on Mustekala, a native browser p2p light client to decrease MetaMask\u2019s reliance on centralized infrastructure. Follow the project as it evolves!Multi-Network SupportMetaMask will soon support any ETH-compatible blockchain, opening MetaMask up to new communities across the world. This is just the start: eventually, we aim to support simultaneous connections to a wide variety of different networks, and even allow sites to suggest networks to their users.MetaMetricsMetaMask\u2019s users span a huge range of technical to non-technical backgrounds, and we aim to make our product work for people across the world. But building for such a broad audience is hard! That\u2019s why we plan to introduce *opt-in* metrics to help understand what our users find challenging and what needs to improve. We\u2019ll NEVER collect addresses, keys, transactions, balances, personal information, or IP addresses, and allowing these metrics to run in your extension will be 100% opt-in.Layer 2 Scaling\u00a0ResearchThere are some exciting projects out there to make the Ethereum blockchain cheaper and faster to use. We\u2019re exploring how to best integrate Layer 2 solutions into MetaMask to encourage this important work across the ecosystem and help get it in the hands of users quickly.Thank You!We couldn\u2019t have done any of this without the incredible support of our community.If you have a couple minutes, we\u2019d love your feedback on MetaMask!

"How to access the Pareto Network with a Metamask (any web3 browser) and PARETO\u00a0license.Eric Lamison-WhiteBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 28, 2018To access the Pareto Network you need three things:An Ethereum WalletPARETO tokens in the Ethereum WalletMetamask or any web3 enabled browser.Fortunately, this can be reduced to two prerequisites as all web3-enabled browsers have Ethereum wallets in them. Wallets contain at least one Ethereum address.PARETO tokens can be purchased and transferred to your Ethereum wallet on any of the following exchanges:KucoinIdexForkDeltaEtherDeltaweb3 in this context refers to a series of protocols that allow access and interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is a shared database and computational resource which lowers the cost of doing business. We do not use or store usernames, passwords, access tokens or any of your cryptoassets.The Pareto Network uses web3 protocols to distinguish users, based on their unique Ethereum address, and it only follows the Ethereum addresses which contain PARETO tokens in them.Therefore, all owners of PARETO are users of the Pareto Network. In that vein, accessing the Pareto Network is more akin to claiming your already existing user account. User accounts are merely Ethereum addresses which at one point held any PARETO tokens, and to access the network a user must prove they own the address by signing it.We use web3-enabled browsers to streamline the signing process with one click. The following web3-enabled browsers are a subset of ones available:DesktopGoogle Chrome with Metamask extensionFirefox with Metamask extensionBrave with Metamask extensionMistMobileiOS\u00a0: TrustAndroid: TrustAlthough this method may seem esoteric, this is the same functionality that idex.market, EtherDelta and other decentralized exchanges use to enable access, as well as games like Cryptokitties.Now that you have a web3-enabled browser, you need your PARETO balance in the wallet. Consider IMPORTING your prior wallet, instead of transferring your tokens. As transferring will have a negative impact on your PARETO Score and ranking.Afterwards, make sure your wallet is unlocked and continue to https://www.pareto.network and click the ACCESS button.This will prompt you to sign a message, and our server will verify the signature.One click signing\u00a0prompt.For users with rigorous cold storage techniques, we will be implementing manual signing in the future. (Cold storage refers to offline, physically difficulty storage of cryptoassets, as an extra layer of security.) Signing addresses does not require an internet connection, but the signed result will need to be transmitted to the Pareto Network server initially.If you would like to authenticate a different address, then click the RESET button on the web page to de-authenticate the current Ethereum address, switch your web3 browser to the desired Ethereum address and the ACCESS button should have re-appeared in the Pareto Network web application.User Interfaces for Pareto access will become simpler and easier to usePareto Network and its partners will be implementing a variety of user friendly improvements to mask more of the Wallet/Address/Token technology and streamline access to the Pareto Network. This will make the platform accessible for an increasingly broader audience.In the mean time, consumers that are willing to dive in to the technology have an advantage.", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "C\u00f3mo instalar Metamask para comprar KOI\u00a0Token", "author_name": "Koitechtudios", "link": "https://medium.com/@koitechstudio/c%C3%B3mo-instalar-metamask-para-comprar-koi-token-5a33843ea134?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 1", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "959", "content": "C\u00f3mo instalar Metamask para comprar KOI\u00a0TokenUna forma f\u00e1cil de interactuar con el token\u00a0ERC20.KoitechtudiosBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 1\u00bfQu\u00e9 es Metamask?Este complemento, en su forma m\u00e1s b\u00e1sica, es un portafolio tradicional donde podemos almacenar nuestros criptoactivos; Podemos enviarlos, recibirlos, entre otros, sin descuidar la seguridad.Metamask se usa principalmente como DApp (Aplicaci\u00f3n Descentralizada) donde, debido a la arquitectura de estas aplicaciones, se trata de cumplir los requisitos para realizar diferentes actividades.

Frontend developers can think of it like a public, distributed database they can access using an API.You can build fully functional frontend web applications with integrated signon, lambda functions, and storage, just by using the Ethereum blockchain as your backend! It\u2019s like a public, distributed version of AWS or Google Cloud. The most popular API for working with Ethereum today is provided by Metamask, a browser extension.At Crowdbotics, we help people build blockchain software, Dapps, and Smart Contracts\u200a\u2014\u200aamong other things\u200a\u2014\u200aand we get to see firsthand all the interesting ways people are applying blockchain technology to real-world problems.Our goal at Crowdbotics is to help all sorts of people build complex software applications better and faster. That\u2019s why we\u2019re providing this complete guide on building Ethereum DApps with MetaMask.We will be covering the following topics:What is MetaMask?How to get MetaMaskFunding MetaMask with EtherWhat is Blockchain?What is the Ethereum blockchain?Decentralized Applications (DApps)Ethereum EcosystemWeb3\u200a\u2014\u200aEthereum Javascript APIDetecting MetaMask and handling possible error statesAvoiding Race Conditions with onLoad()Event listeners vs polling the interfaceWhat is MetaMask?MetaMask is a browser extension that allows web applications to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. For users, it works as an Ethereum wallet, allowing them to store and send any standard Ethereum-compatible tokens (so-called ERC-20 tokens).For developers, it allows you to design and run Ethereum DApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node (which is what developers had to do before Metamask was available). MetaMask talks to the Ethereum blockchain for your web application.Metamask includes a secure sign-on process, providing a user interface to manage your identities on different sites and sign blockchain transactions. It is easy to use on almost every browser.Figure 1. MetaMask on\u00a0Chrome.Getting MetaMaskTo use MetaMask, you will need to install it in your browser. You can choose between Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera or Brave. In our case, we will be using Google Chrome browser. As a first step we need to go to the Chrome extension web store, and download the MetaMask extension. Once you are at the Chrome web store, just click on \u201cAdd to Chrome \u201d to add the MetaMask extension into your browser. Then click on \u201cAdd Extension\u201d and immediately you will see the icon of MetaMask on the right part of the navbar navigation of your Chrome browser.Figure 2. MetaMask is added to\u00a0Chrome.When MetaMask is installed in your browser, you will see an icon at the same level of the address bar on your browser. You should select the icon and proceed with login:Figure 3. MetaMask icon will appear on the right side of the address\u00a0bar.Before Logging in you should accept Terms of use, Privacy notice and Phishing Warning. Scroll inside the panel in order to have the accept button available. When you accept each one, MetaMask login will appear.Figure 4. Accept Terms of use, Privacy notice and Phishing\u00a0Warning.Figure 5. Insert a password and save the 12 words in a safe\u00a0place.Funding MetaMask with\u00a0EtherNow, we will learn how we can get some test Ether for our MetaMask. Real Ether cost money and have to be purchased on a site like Coinbase, but test Ether are available for free. First, you need to log in to your MetaMask account and then you should change your Network by clicking on \u201cMain Network\u201d that is located on the left side of the panel, and finally select \u201cRopsten Test Network\u201d.Figure 6. On the top-left side of panel you will see a dropdown to change\u00a0Network.Be sure to Verify that you are on the correct Network. Next click on the \u201cBUY\u201d button. A panel will appear called \u201cBUY ETH\u201d, finally click on the \u201cRopsten Test Faucet\u201d button.Figure 7. Buying 1ETH. Click on \u201cBuy\u201d button, then you click on \u201cRopsten test Faucet\u201d\u00a0button.When you click on \u201cRopsten Test Faucet\u201d, you will be redirected to https://faucet.metamask.io/. There, you can click on the green button to \u201crequest 1 ether from faucet\u201d, wait for a few seconds and you will receive an address transaction, which is actually a confirmation. Now click on the MetaMask icon and verify your 1ETH for testing purposes.Figure 8. MetaMask Ether Faucet view (https://faucet.metamask.io/).Figure 9. Click on MetaMask icon to see your\u00a0balance.What is Blockchain?There are several definitions regarding \u201cBlockchain\u201d. We\u2019ll share just one:\u201cBlockchain technology\u2019 means distributed ledger technology that uses a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless. The data on the ledger is protected with cryptography, is immutable and auditable and provides an uncensored truth\u201dOn a blockchain, the data is decentralized; it\u2019s distributed across every device connected to the blockchain. It\u2019s a peer for which anyone can set up a node that replicates the necessary data for all nodes to reach an agreement and be compensated by users and app developers. This allows for user data to remain private and apps to be decentralized.Figure 10. Blockchains are implemented on a peer-to-peer network of nodes, from https://www.ethereum.org/What are Decentralized Applications (DApps)?Decentralized applications are similar to conventional web applications, but that run on blockchain. While frontend web applications use APIs to interact with servers and databases, Dapps use Smart Contract interfaces to interact with the blockchain.The code of a Dapp is client-side code (usually Javascript), running in a browser.The backend of a Dapp is one or more Smart Contracts deployed on a blockchain.Typically, to use a Smart Contract\u00a0, you pay with cryptographic tokens like ETH rather than (for example) AWS or Google Cloud Credits.Ethereum EcosystemDecentralized platform that runs smart contracts.Provides developers with a foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language.Works on peer-to-peer network protocols where each blockchain database is maintained and managed by multiple nodes.Web3\u200a\u2014\u200aEthereum Javascript APIA collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node, using a HTTP or IPC connection.Use it to communicate with an Ethereum node or transact with a smart contract deployed on the blockchain from inside a JavaScript or web application.The MetaMask extension exposes the web3 API by an injected web3 object which you can access via JavaScript and does not support most synchronous web3 API methods.MetaMask and error state\u00a0handlingWe will use web3 JS library and conditionals to manage error states. We have four cases:Figure 11. Error state handling\u00a0diagramIf MetaMask is not installedIf MetaMask is installed but it is lockedIf MetaMask is installed and unlocked and it doesn\u2019t have sufficient balance to carry out a transactionIf you have a MetaMask transaction, but reject the transaction.CASE 1: To verify if MetaMask is installed or not.function isInstalled() {   if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined'){      console.log('MetaMask is installed')   }    else{      console.log('MetaMask is not installed')   }}CASE 2: To verify if MetaMask is locked or not.function isLocked() {   web3.eth.getAccounts(function(err, accounts){      if (err != null) {         console.log(err)      }      else if (accounts.length === 0) {         console.log('MetaMask is locked')      }      else {         console.log('MetaMask is unlocked')      }   });}CASE 3: To verify if MetaMask has balance or notfunction checkBalance() {   tokenInst.balanceOf(      web3.eth.accounts[0],       function (error, result) {      if (!error && result) {         var balance = result.c[0];         if (balance < balanceNeeded * (100000000)) {            console.log('MetaMask shows insufficient balance')            return false;         }         console.log('MetaMask shows sufficient balance')         // Include here your transaction function here      }      else {         console.error(error);      }      return false;   });}CASE 4: If you have a MetaMask transaction, but reject the transaction.Figure 12. MetaMask transactiontokenInst.approve(   addrHOLD,    truePlanCost,    gasPrice: web3.toWei('50', 'gwei') },    function (error, result) {   if (!error && result) {      var data;      console.log('approval sent to network');            var url = 'https://etherscan.io/tx/' + result;      var link = '<a href=\\\"\" +                   url +                   \"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">View Transaction</a>';      console.log('Waiting for approval ...');           data = {         txhash: result,         account_type: selectedPlanId,         txtype: 1, // Approval      };      apiService(data, '/transaction/create/', 'POST')      .done(function (response) {         location.href = response.tx_url;      });   }    else {      console.error(error);      console.log('You reject the transaction');   }});All cases together:var transactionApproval = true;function validate() {  if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined'){    console.log('MetaMask is installed')    web3.eth.getAccounts(function(err, accounts){      if (err != null) {        console.log(err)      }      else if (accounts.length === 0) {        console.log('MetaMask is locked')      }      else {        console.log('MetaMask is unlocked')              tokenInst.balanceOf(          web3.eth.accounts[0],           function (error, result) {               if (!error && result) {            var balance = result.c[0];            if (balance < dappCost * (100000000)) {              console.log('MetaMask has insufficient balance')              return false;            }            console.log('MetaMask has balance')            if (transactionApproval == true ){              requestApproval();              transactionApproval = false;            }          }          else {            console.error(error);          }          return false;        });      }    });  }   else{    console.log('MetaMask is not installed')  }}// request approval from MetaMask userfunction requestApproval() {  tokenInst.approve(    addrHOLD,    truePlanCost,    { gasPrice: web3.toWei('50', 'gwei') },    function (error, result) {          if (!error && result) {      var data;      console.log('approval sent to network.');      var url = 'https://etherscan.io/tx/' + result;      var link = '<a href=\\\"\" +                   url +                   \"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">View Transaction</a>';      console.log('waiting for approval ...');      data = {        txhash: result,        account_type: selectedPlanId,        txtype: 1, // Approval      };      apiService(data, '/transaction/create/', 'POST')      .done(function (response) {        location.href = response.tx_url;      });    }    else {      console.error(error);      console.log('You rejected the transaction');    }  });}Avoiding Race Conditions with\u00a0onLoad()Race conditions arise in software when an application depends on the sequence or timing of processes or threads for it to operate properly.Event listeners vs polling the interfaceYou should decide between setting a time that means polling the interface or use event listeners. See an example:Polling the Interface using an interval to check for account changes. This is the way that the Metamask provider recommends for avoiding the refreshing of page to see UI changes. Click here to see more.var account = web3.eth.accounts[0];var accountInterval = setInterval(function() {  if (web3.eth.accounts[0] !== account) {    account = web3.eth.accounts[0];    updateInterface();  }}, 100);Using web3 version 1.0.0, the MetaMask provider exposes an \u201cupdate\u201d event listener.web3.currentProvider.publicConfigStore.on('update', callback);Your callback will be passed an object which contains {selectedAddress, networkVersion}. You can modify the interface according to those attributes change or update.To select event listeners is a better option than polling because you will improve performance, \u201c.on('update')\u201d is triggered without needing to loop.ConclusionAs more people are becoming familiar with the technology, the creative potential for DApps continues to snowball.MetaMask is one tool making development of this technology more accessible, and they are updating with new features all the time.MetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.Among other things, MetaMask is developing new ways to prevent possible attacks.

In this tutorial we will learn how to use Metamask for the purchase of the Token KOI.Metamask is a plugin, this means that it is an extension that we will install in our browser. This plugin works for Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Brave; in the latter comes installed by defaultDownload and Install MetamaskTo begin we must go to https://metamask.io/To download our extension or add-on, just select the corresponding option. For the purposes of this tutorial we will click on Get Firefox ADDOM.This brings us to the Firefox Add-ons. To continue, we just have to select Add to Firefox and wait for the installation to complete.Will appear the window to grant permissions to Metamask, you must add permissions.Once finished, we will find the Metamask icon in the top menu of our Firefox browser.From this icon we will access our Metamask portfolio whenever we want. So, to start, we\u2019re going to click on it..To continue, we select Accept or Continue.In this step we will create a password to access Metamask and that our funds are not compromised by third parties. This password is stored locally, that is; Metamask does not save passwords on its servers.Metamask generated a unique account image.We will find a warning that, once we start, every website we visit may find that we use Metamask. Be careful here: this does not compromise the security of our funds. It only implies that the web is synchronized with your wallet automatically.Save secret Backup Phrase. Here we will place the 12 recovery words as well.Once created, we will see our recovery phrase, this generated phrase is not stored anywhere, so it is our crucial duty to protect it.We have finished creating our portfolio and are ready to receive funds.You can personalize your portfolio by clicking on the account and the word edit.Buying Koi TokenMetamask, as we mentioned at the beginning, is an Ethereum wallet, where we will store either ether or tokens created in the Ethereum network.To begin with, we need to receive funds, so we will need the address of our portfolio. To obtain this address, we will click on the 3 points that are next to the name of our account.Located the Metamask icon to obtain the address of our portfolio, we will click on the name of the account and voila, the address of our portfolio is copied to the clipboard. In this way we can share our address to receive funds.Once copied to your clipboard the address of your Metamask wallet, you can go to your EHT account and recharge it.In case of not having funds in Metamask a message of insufficient funds will appear at the time of purchase.We go to www.koitechstudios.com and place the button \u201cKOI purchase\u201d. The KOI token network will be recognized by the use of Metamask.Having already accepted the conditions, it will automatically open our Metamask portfolio. Here we will be told that we must sign a transaction where our account will be created within the platform. We only need to select Conect to sign our transactionThis section is where the purchase is selected and, obviously, we will need funds in ETH to be able to pay the cost of the KOI currency.Enter the amount of KOI coins we want to buy and press the Contribute button.By selecting, we will automatically open Metamask.In this step you will confirm the purchase of our KOI. As you can see, Metamask works as a bridge between the DApps and our ETH portfolio.In this way we have already used our Metamask portfolio to buy KOI.Finally we just have to Confirm our purchase. The process could take a few secondsIt\u2019s ready\u00a0..!You can check in your ETH portfolio.You have KOI Token in your wallet..!How to see in your walletFirst copy the KOI Token AddressFrom Metamask icon push the menu and select Add TokenPaste the KOI TOKEN AddressSelect Add TokenIt\u2019s ready\u00a0..! you can see your KOI Token in your walletyou can Check in https://etherscan.io", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Bobby Dresser", "link": "https://medium.com/metamask/welcome-to-the-first-ever-metamask-monthly-update-newsletter-a0052b888079?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 29, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "362", "content": "Bobby DresserBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 29, 2018Welcome to the first ever MetaMask Monthly update newsletter!

We hope this will help our community gain better insight into our continual efforts to improve the ecosystem, and maybe even get a better sense of how to participate. Enjoy!General AnnouncementsIn the past couple weeks we\u2019ve received several reports of a common new phishing strategy: compromised sites, most hosted on Cloudflare, are imitating the MetaMask UI to ask for a seed phrase. To help keep our users safe, we\u2019re pushing a one-time notice that describes what to look out for. Remember, MetaMask will never spontaneously ask for your seed phrase. (#4566)We\u2019re preparing to make a breaking change that has implications for all dapp integrations. Right now, when a user switches networks, MetaMask forces a page reload for any app that has interacted with the web3 API. Dapps have come a long way, and this hand-holding is no longer necessary. We\u2019ll soon suggest all dapps poll to monitor their users\u2019 network status and update as they see fit. You can read more about this change here.Development\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat\u2019s\u00a0New?Extension v4.8.0 is out, with some awesome fixes to improve usability and more steady progress towards our new UI.Some users have reported issues with their extension storage, where account nicknames are forgotten or transaction history clears spontaneously. This was traced to an issue in a background persistence process that stopped writing successfully after prolonged use. 4.8.0 contains a patch and we hope to see storage issues decrease significantly. (#4570)To fix an issue where some transactions get stuck in an \u201capproved\u201d state without being submitted to the blockchain, we\u2019ve updated our nonce error handling. (#4557)Our internationalization implementation was incompatible with Brave\u2019s i18n support, throwing errors that could prevent the extension from loading. These errors are now handled more gracefully, so Brave users who were seeing a blank MetaMask should have that fixed soon. (#4524)We\u2019re still hard at work on the Beta UI! To give it a try, click the menu in the top-right and select \u201cTry Beta.\u201dIn the past couple weeks, we\u2019ve shipped several patches that bring it closer to full feature parity with the standard UI in a much smoother interface:Updates to unlock screen, account UI & custom token views (#4190, #4507, #4445, #4591)Cosmetic fixes, including account import, handling extra long token names, updating alert modals. (#4418, #4423, #4428)Other bug fixes include:Fix account reset for custom RPC providers (#4523)Prevent sending to Ganache default accounts on Mainnet (#4288)Prevent memory leak on importing empty private key (#4513)Fix gas adjustment (#4513)Inside the Den\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat\u2019s\u00a0next?GABAWe\u2019ve begun a re-implementation of our controller layer as a standalone package. This modular approach will separate UI development from backend changes and allow each to iterate quickly and independently. The new controller engine, codenamed \u201cGABA\u201d, can also serve as a MetaMask-agnostic resource for developers to compose their own data models & signing interfaces. Read more here. (#4991)Labs / MustekalaMetaMask Labs is hard at work laying the foundation for a browser-based Ethereum light client, which aims to help reduce the ecosystem\u2019s reliance on JSON/RPC and make on-chain data available to a peer network. This month our team is developing a block explorer proof of concept. Try it out by running a simple block explorer in your localhost, connect to kitsunet (the network of the fox), and obtain a synchronized part of the ethereum data from nodes all over the mesh.To learn more about this project take a peek at the architecture description and stay tuned for more updates next month!Meet our new teammates!MetaMask has been experiencing exciting growth this year to date. In the past month we\u2019ve added five new team members who are taking MetaMask to new heights!Paul Bouchon is a self described JavaScript nerd who\u2019s been taking care of the Dojo web framework for the past decade. He loves contributing to open source software, and has already gotten EIP 1102 finalized, and begun converting portions of MetaMask to TypeScript, to add higher guarantees that we don\u2019t break functionality!Jenny Pollack formerly worked on the OAuth2.0 implementation with the Exchange Core Auth team at Microsoft. She\u2019s bringing that experience to MetaMask, combined with a passion for UBI, to help us make the decentralized dream as easy as the old web.William Morriss joins us from Snap, Inc. where he worked on Memories and messaging. He\u2019ll be focusing on mobile development at MetaMask and happens to be a master boardgame player.Bobby Dresser previously helped the uPort team refine their development process, and is now helping MetaMask do the same. With his help, we\u2019ve cut our number of high-priority issues in half, doubling our focus on the things that matter most to our users.Bruno Barbieri first caught our attention by submitting a pull request to MetaMask! The speed he did it with, along with the test-driven development he used, let us know he had some skills. Before his first day on the job, he had a working proof of concept that completely blew us away, and we\u2019ll hopefully share it soon\u2026Dmitry Ryajov has spent the past year and a half working on the IPFS project. He\u2019ll be joining Herman Junge on the MetaMask Labs JavaScript light-client effort, \u201cMustekala\u201d. There are few people on the planet as qualified for that project.We\u2019re not done hiring yet!

Imagine a system where voting on the future state of the world can be done from the comfort of your home. Imagine a place where there are no illusions of what is going on, where the open community comes first.MetaMask is your gateway into this world of decentralized applications\u00a0, or DApps\u00a0, on the Ethereum blockchain!Why use MetaMask? MetaMask is an easily accessible way to access the blockchain network through a user friendly interface. No more setting up your own node on your local machine to interact with the blockchain\u00a0, a Chrome extension is all you need!MetaMask is available from the Chrome Web Store. With a couple of clicks, you can get MetaMask up and running on your browser!Getting started using\u00a0MetaMaskMetaMask is a Google Chrome extension that is easily accessible from the Chrome Web Store.LET\u2019S TALK PERMISSIONSBefore we dive in, let\u2019s address a few issues concerning the installation permissions. An extension that can \u201cread and change all your data on the websites you visit\u201d would make most reasonable people nervous! In order for MetaMask to enable DApps to access the blockchain, MetaMask injects a web3 Javascript object into each page. The extension is not changing the website, it is simply giving it access to the network in order to function properly. Some users have found that making an extra Chrome profile allows them to Sandbox extensions, so if you want maximum security, that\u2019s always an option.Getting StartedHere, we\u2019ll walk through a few of MetaMask\u2019s key features, specifically regarding transactions and confirmation of transactions requested by DApps.SETTING UP YOUR\u00a0ACCOUNTWhen you first create a vault, you will be prompted to save a certain number of seed words. These words can be used by MetaMask to regenerate your vault if need be, as well as enabling the creation of new wallets within your vault.Store these seed words somewhere safe! Although MetaMask gives you the option to see your seed words, we recommend storing your seed words physically in the event that the MetaMask software fails. MetaMask is still in its development stage, so we don\u2019t recommend storing large amounts of ETH in your MetamMask wallets just yet.THE INTERFACEMoving forward, you should be taken to your first wallet, which looks something like this:The arrows corresponds to the following:Pink: This is your editable wallet nickname. Underneath is a portion of the public key, or the hexadecimal address that uniquely identifies your wallet.Teal: These buttons copy your wallet address to the clipboard and allow you to export your private keys.Red: This indicates the current network. Clicking it will open a drop down menu to switch to the Main Ethereum Network, the Morden Test Network, or your own network of choice.Green: This button will take you to a page that will allow you to switch accounts.Below the current wallet information is a list of outgoing transactions from the current wallet with relevant information. Clicking the transaction itself will link you to an etherscan page with more detailed information.Sending ether to another address is simple. MetaMask will help guard you against sending to invalid addresses, as well as initiating transactions that send more ether than the current wallet contains. Before a transaction is actually executed, a notification pops up allowing you to confirm the transaction and examine relevant details.Don\u2019t worry if you close the notification\u00a0, the extension popup will prompt you to approve or reject any pending transactions the next time it\u2019s opened.Here, the accounts page shows an overview of your current wallets, a convenient button to copy wallet addresses, as well as the option to generate more wallets as needed.Final NotesWhile we encourage users to test out and play around with our software, please keep in mind that MetaMask is still in active development. With that in mind, we encourage users to refrain from handling large amounts of ether on the main Ethereum network using MetaMask. We recommend executing all testing or experimentation on the Morden Test Network or a local network of your choosing to mitigate these risks.Similarly, if you do find any bugs, have any feature requests, or would like to leave a comment, please contact us athelp@metamask.io or leave an issue in our MetaMask GitHub repository.We wish you the best in exploring the world of Ethereum and DApps using MetaMask.

Exchanges being hacked are unfortunately something that have been a re-occurrence ever since cryptocurrencies started to become valuable.It is also not uncommon to see wallets being unavailable or down for maintenance on centralized exchanges when the price of certain assets spike, seemingly to retain control of the exchanges liquidity.MetaMask allows users to easily interact with the blockchain and decentralized exchanges such as MetaMorph.pro while staying in full control of their assets. MetaMorph.pro is a decentralized all-in-one platform to trade, exchange and manage cryptocurrencies.Once logged in, the transactions are processed by the platform and shown to the user with then/now price and other details. Using the platform is very easy and trading is done using the 0x protocol which means lower fees and less congestion on the blockchain while offering shared liquidity by using relayers. For every transaction made using MetaMorph.pro, a MetaMask window will simply pop up and ask for permission to execute the transaction on behalf of the user.There are currently NO fees during the beta version of MetaMorph.pro and it is very easy to import a MyEtherWallet with MetaMask and to start trading in moments using the platform with plug-n-play functionality\u200a\u2014\u200ait doesn\u2019t get much easier than that.

Due to the properties of the blockchain representing application state, this results in \u201capplications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference\u201d.Is Ethereum similar to\u00a0Bitcoin?Well. sort of, but not really. The similarity is there in the sense that both use the blockchain, but that\u2019s where it ends. As Ethereum is not just a digital currency But It provides a platform to develop blockchain-based applications which features smart contracts, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and uses its currency called ether for peer-to-peer contracts.What is a smart\u00a0contractA smart contract is a computer code running on top of a blockchain containing a set of rules under which the parties to that smart contract agree to interact with each other. If and when the pre-defined rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced. The platform on which it\u2019s executed gives this piece of code some properties such as immutability, deterministic operation, distributed & verifiable state, etc. The state managed by this code is stored, immutable, on a blockchain and anyone can double check that the current state is correct by replaying all of the transactions from the beginning of the chain.EVM\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Ethereum Virtual\u00a0MachineEVM (or Ethereum virtual machine) is the Ethereum smart contracts byte-code execution environment. Every node in the network runs EVM. All the nodes execute all the transactions that point to smart contracts using EVM, so every node does the same calculations and stores the same values. Moreover, the EVM ensures programs do not have access to each other\u2019s state, ensuring communication can be established without any potential interference.Web3 & Technology StackAs we all know in the early \u201990s the World Wide Web (WWW) revolutionized the information. Since then, the Internet became only more mature & programmable and we saw the rise of the so-called Web2, which brought us social media and e-commerce platforms, revolutionizing social interactions, bringing producers and consumers of information, goods, and services closer together, and allowed us to enjoy P2P interactions on a global scale. But there was always a middleman: a platform acting as a trusted intermediary between A and B who did not know or trust each other. While these platforms have done an amazing job at creating a P2P economy, with an ever more sophisticated content discovery layer, they also dictate all rules of the transactions, and these platforms own all of our data.In this context, Blockchain seems to be a driving force of the next generation Internet, the Decentralized Web, or Web3 and gives rise to Decentralized Web Stack.Similar to building a normal web or mobile applications, creating a dApp (Decentralized Application) commonly requires a few things: computation, file storage, external data, monetization, and payments as depicted below.Web 3.0 Abstracted StackAs we would be progressing towards decentralized systems, this does not mean that we will get rid of centralized systems altogether. It seems to transition from client-server internet to the decentralized web will be gradual rather than radical. As the decentralized web stack is still maturing, the transition seems to be shifting from centralized to partially decentralized to fully decentralized.The shift from Centralized to Fully Decentralized AppsDeveloping a DApp. How to access Ethereum.An attempt to explain Ethereum from a developer\u2019s point of view.Current client-server webapp architecture at a very high\u00a0levelCurrent Client Server Application ArchitectureThe web application is hosted on a hosting provider like AWS, Heroku or any other VPS. The client interacts with this one central application. Clients can be a browser, widget, curl command or other API consuming services. When a client makes a request via a web browser to the server, the server code implemented interacts with the database and/or cache for CRUD operation and serves the client.This is how an Ethereum Dapp looks like at a high\u00a0level:Futuristic Decentralized Application ArchitectureIf one observes every client (browser) communicates with its own instance of the application. There is no central server to which all clients connect to. This means every person who wants to interact with a dapp (Decentralized Application) will need a full copy of the blockchain running on their computer/phone etc. That means, before you can use an application, you have to download the entire blockchain and then start using the application. This might sound ridiculous at first but it has the advantage of not relying on a single central server which might disappear tomorrow.Getting StartedBasic Dapp using Metamask, Truffle &\u00a0GanacheBasic tools we need\u00a0-Node Package Manager (npm)\u200a\u2014\u200aNPM is a package manager for Node.js packages or modules.Ganache\u200a\u2014\u200aGanache (earlier TestRPC) is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development that developers can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests. It runs 100% locally and simulates a full Ethereum client but is much much faster making it ideal for testing and development. It comes in two flavor\u200a\u2014\u200aGanache (GUI) & Ganache-CLI.Truffle\u200a\u2014\u200aTruffle is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Basically, it helps you deploy your contracts to the blockchain, swap old contracts for new ones (called a migration), and hook your front-end up to your deployed contractsMetaMask\u200a\u2014\u200aMetaMask is an Ethereum light client and Chrome extension that lets users interact with the blockchain without downloading the whole blockchain. In other words, it allows you to interact with dApps in an ordinary Chrome browserFirst, we need to install our tools. Lets first install npm if you don\u2019t have one. Here are instructions on how to install it.Once npm is installed, we can use it to install ganache-cli, a Node.js Ethereum client that mimics a real Ethereum node.$ npm install -g ganache-cliNext, we need to install truffle$ npm install -g truffleand the last one, MetaMask Chrome plugin which you can find here.Start Ganache-CLI$ ganache-cliThis will start up the client and generate 10 accounts for you to use, each with 100 ETH.

Open MetaMask and follow the initial setup steps.Once MetaMask is set up, select the network menu in the upper-left. Then select \u201cLocalhost 8545\u201d as your network as shown below.Metamask connected to\u00a0GanacheNext, add a couple of accounts to MetaMask by going to the colored circle at the right top -> Import Account, and then copying in a private key from the list printed out in your terminal when you started Ganache-CLI.

I\u2019m going to call my project ethereumdapp, but you can call yours whatever you\u2019d like.Initialize Truffle$ mkdir ethereumdapp$ cd ethereumdapp$ truffle unbox webpackDeploying Contracts and Running\u00a0dAppTo deploy your contracts to ganache-cli run the following command:$ truffle compile$ truffle migrateOnce the migration is complete we can run our dApp. To run the dApp$ cd app$ npm run devOpen http://localhost:8080/ in the browserWe should see our dApp running and ready to use! If we switch the current MetaMask account to the first account generated by Ganache-CLI and refresh the page we should see balance is 10,000 META. Now we can send META to other accounts using the dApp interface.To check the transactions locally, we may install etherparty explorerInstall etherpartyAs we have already installed node and npm, the only thing to install is git. Here are the steps to install it. Once git is installed, Open a terminal and type the following$ git clone https://github.com/etherparty/explorerThis will clone the etherparty explorer to local directory explorer. Change to this directory$ cd explorernow let's start the explorer$ npm start> EthereumExplorer@0.1.0 start /Users/XXXX/explorer> http-server ./app -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1Starting up http-server, serving ./app on port: 8000Hit CTRL-C to stop the serverNavigate to http://localhost:8000/. You will see something like below.Now let's transfer some Metacoin (10 Metacoin) from ganache-cli account(Account 2) to metamask account(Account 1).Once the transaction is initiated, Metamask will show a notification like belowOn confirming the transaction, We can see Metacoin debited from account 2 and credited to account 1.Account 2Account 1We can validate the transaction in explorer also as shown below.

It is mandatory to register for the whitelist and submit KYC info before you can invest.If this is all new to you, and you don\u2019t know what ETH is, click here to learn more.Once your MetaMask wallet is funded with ETH, investing in the tokenized real estate asset is a very easy process:1. InvestBuy digital shares of the property using ETH from MetaMask.2. Receive PoA-TokensProof-of-Asset (PoA) tokens represent all the economic benefits of ownership. You will receive the tokens after sending ETH from MetaMask. If the property is not completely funded, you will be able to reclaim the ETH you contributed. Read a full breakdown of Brickblock\u2019s token structure here.3. Earn passive\u00a0incomeYour PoA tokens generate passive monthly income from the profits generated by the real estate asset. Your share of the profits will be sent to your Ethereum (MetaMask) address.Before you\u00a0investThere are a few necessary requirements before you can participate in the tokenized real estate sale:First, you need to set up a MetaMask (ERC-20 compatible) wallet. This is where you will invest your ETH from and where you will receive your Proof-of-Asset (PoA) tokens.Important: MetaMask is both an ETH wallet and Ethereum blockchain browser. You must have MetaMask to connect to Brickblock\u2019s smart contract platform. We therefore highly recommend using MetaMask as your ETH wallet.

The contracts provide a better-organized, permanent bookkeeping system, and I hope that the app leads to increased protections for the hundreds of thousands of children in our foster care system.In this article, I review three key tools for developing and testing a smart contract\u200a\u2014\u200aRemix IDE, Ganache, and Metamask. My aim is to teach other developers how to use the three in conjunction, to ensure the effectiveness of their contract prior to integrating into a full stack application.Remix IDE is an open source tool that allows you to compile, test, and debug your smart contract, directly from your browser. In order to effectively test your contract, I recommend connecting Remix to a virtual private Etherium blockchain, such as Ganache.Ganache is available both as a desktop application and as a CLI; I recommend the desktop application, which allows you to clearly visualize the process of deploying transactions. Upon setting up Ganache, you will see the following screen:When running Ganache, you have access to ten Etherium addresses that each are preloaded with 100 test ether, roughly equivalent to $23,254. Ganache immediately confirms when a contract has been deployed or a transaction has been posted to the blockchain, increasing the transaction log and deducting ether upon confirmation of a transaction. In addition, Ganache\u2019s list of transactions will detail transaction types (funds transfer, contract call, contract creation, etc.) along with the transaction hash and the address from which the transaction was sent.Finally, Metamask is a Chrome extension that connects the browser to an Etherium node, allowing you to send and receive ether:Once you download and set up Metamask, connect it to one of your Ganache addresses. In Metamask, the dropdown menu for Networks lists several options; select custom RPC. In the settings menu, for \u2018New RPC URL\u2019, add the RPC server from your Ganache GUI, usually HTTP://127.0.0.1:9545 or HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545.Next, connect to a specific Ganache test wallet in order to load test ether into Metamask. In Metamask, click the colorful avatar on the top right, then click \u2018Import Account\u2019. The select menu will default to \u201cPrivate Key Import\u201d. In Ganache, click on the key icon to the right of the first wallet. Copy and paste the private key into Metamask. Voila! Your account is now loaded with 100 ether.Lastly, connect Remix to Metamask. In the \u201crun\u201d menu, under environments, select \u201cInjected Web3\u201d. Now, when transactions are confirmed in Remix, you will receive a confirmation request from Metamask, ether will be deducted from your Ganache wallet, and the wallet\u2019s transaction count will increment.With this as a starting point, you can now begin writing, compiling, and deploying smart contracts to a private blockchain, using Remix. I hope that this guide was helpful\u200a\u2014\u200aplease let me know your thoughts on this.

Cryptocurrencies are no exception. In fact, it may be truer for crypto than any other asset class. But let\u2019s face it\u200a\u2014\u200athe whole process of crypto diversification is just a pain. Let\u2019s examine all the steps involved:Buy your BTC/ETH from Coinbase/GDAX with fiatSend your BTC/ETH to your MetaMask wallet, since you\u2019re smart and don\u2019t want to keep your hard-earned money on a centralized exchangeDiscover a cool new altcoinResearch which exchanges list that altcoinCreate an account on this new exchange, a process which could take several days to get approved, and may involve sending photos of yourself and your passport to comply with AML/KYC regulationsSend your BTC/ETH to this exchange (paying transaction fees along the way)Sell the BTC/ETH for the altcoin you want (more transaction fees)Withdraw that new altcoin to your MetaMask wallet (even MORE fees!)That\u2019s EIGHT steps just to get the altcoin you wanted. Plus, with centralized exchanges, if you already have some altcoins you want to swap for a different one, you\u2019ll need to exchange them BACK to BTC, ETH or USDT first. (Oh, and we almost forgot\u200a\u2014\u200aeach of those trades is taxable, depending on the country you live in.)Given how tedious and complicated this whole process is, it\u2019s no wonder that so many people just throw their hands up in frustration and decide this crypto stuff isn\u2019t for them.I mean, it\u2019s 2018. Everything else is user-friendly and intuitive, so why, nearly 10 years after the launch of Bitcoin, is dealing with cryptocurrencies still such a ridiculous hassle?We decided that just wasn\u2019t acceptable, and that\u2019s why we developed Faast, the simplest, most effortless way to build a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio.If you have a MetaMask wallet (any other supported wallet), you can simply visit the Faast website, connect your wallet, and begin trading your holdings for the coins you want right away\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding one altcoin for another, without having to exchange it for BTC/ETH/USDT first. No memberships, verifications or any other steps required.Now if you\u2019re thinking \u201cwait a minute, can\u2019t you already do this with ShapeShift?\u201d, the answer is yes, you can. We\u2019re not the first mover in this regard. But MySpace was a first mover too, wasn\u2019t it?While ShapeShift does what it is designed to do, its selection of supported altcoins is limited. With Faast, you can choose from over 130 supported tokens (with many more on the way). You just choose the coins you want, and use the simple click-and-drag interface to diversify your portfolio as you desire.In just a few minutes, you\u2019ll have a well-diversified portfolio without having to sign up for accounts on all those exchanges! Your Faast portfolio piechart updates in real time to provide you with an easy to understand visual representation of your holdings in that wallet.How it\u00a0worksLet\u2019s break down the process you saw in the GIF above step by step. For example, let\u2019s say you want to acquire some PowerLedger (PWR), a renewable energy-focused token which ShapeShift does not support. In the past, if you wanted to grab some PWR tokens without going through the laborious 8-step process described above, you were out of luck\u2026until now.With Faast, things are so much easier. To connect your MetaMask wallet to Faast, just visit faa.st and click the \u201cGet Started\u201d button. You\u2019ll be brought to a page where you can add your wallet. Click the MetaMask image under \u201cSoftware Wallets\u201d. Once your wallet is connected with the Faast website, simply click the \u201cswap\u201d link at the top of the page.On the Swap page, you\u2019ll see the list of assets in your wallet, along with the current price, total value in USD, the percentage (weight) it holds in your portfolio, and the number of units you hold for each coin. To add a new coin, just click \u201cadd asset\u201d in the upper right corner:From there, you\u2019ll see a menu of all the coins supported by Faast. In this example, we\u2019ll select PWR.Now you\u2019re back at the swap screen. Below each coin\u2019s information, you\u2019ll see a bar where you can manually click and drag right or left to the specific quantity you wish to trade.We\u2019re going to free up about $20 USD of ETH so we can swap it for the same amount in PWR. We simply drag the bar for ETH left until we\u2019ve deducted $20, then we scroll down the PWR box, and drag the bar right until we reach +$20 for that asset.Click and drag interface seen above. $20.35 USD worth of PWR has been\u00a0added.Once you\u2019ve adjusted the bars as you wish, just click \u201csave changes\u201d at the top of the screen. You\u2019ll get a confirmation window asking you to confirm once more (MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction as well).And just like that, you now have PWR added to your portfolio! How painless was\u00a0that?We\u2019re so thrilled to be making life easier for crypto investors and traders with Faast, and this is just the beginning. Over the next few months, we\u2019ll be adding many more altcoins to our platform.Come visit us and try it out for yourself, and you\u2019ll quickly understand why Faast is the simplest, easiest way for beginners and advanced users alike to diversify their crypto portfolios.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Bobby Dresser", "link": "https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-monthly-september-a2993bc2fa0f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 28, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "265", "content": "Bobby DresserBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 28, 2018Have you ever wished you could help your users add a token to their wallet? Have you ever been confused or frustrated by Ethereum\u2019s numerous signing methods? Have you ever wished we had a privacy layer that didn\u2019t expose users\u2019 accounts to every site they ever visited?If you answered \u201cyes\u201d to any of the above, this newsletter is for you! Read on to learn about support for the new signTypedData spec, progress on our privacy proposal EIP 1102, a new EIP for adding tokens to users\u2019 wallets, and more new features in the extension.MetaMask v4.12 is rolling out slowly over the next week, so if you don\u2019t see these updates yet, hang tight! And if you\u2019re super keen to upgrade, you can head to our releases page and load the new version manually.Support for the final signTypedData specSigning data is a crucial part of interacting with dapps. By using your private key to sign something, you can prove ownership of your key without revealing it\u200a\u2014\u200aand without sending ETH or paying gas. Ethereum has gone through a range of different signing methods, many with security or usability tradeoffs. With EIP 712 and the finalized signTypedData spec, developers have a method that is simple to implement and efficient to parse and validate on-chain. Rather than asking users to sign illegible hexidecimal or UTF-8 strings, the signTypedData method lets dapps present data in a well-structured, human-readable format.MetaMask 4.12 includes support for this method as specified in EIP 712 under the function name signTypedData_v3. We will continue to support the legacy implementation under signTypedData for the next several months. Users get to know what they\u2019re signing, dapp developers can settle on one implementation, everybody wins. For more detail, read this blog post by ConsenSys\u2019 Koh Wei Jie.Test your dapp with EIP\u00a01102MetaMask has been spearheading an ecosystem-wide effort to improve the privacy layer for dapp browsers & wallets. On November 2, MetaMask will stop exposing users\u2019 accounts by default, and instead require that dapps ask the user\u2019s permission.Since proposing this change, we received some helpful feedback from the community and have incorporated it in the EIP. Rather than removing Ethereum surface area entirely, preventing dapps from even knowing a visitor has a dapp browser installed, the proposal now continues to expose a read-only provider. When a dapp detects the read-only provider, it can request access to the full provider by calling ethereum.enable(). This maintains a narrow fingerprinting surface while still allowing dapps to craft smooth onboarding flows.Mock support for EIP 1102 is now available in 4.12. We encourage dapp developers to test their sites against these changes before they go live! You can reach out to us on Github with any questions.EIP 747: Watch\u00a0AssetMetaMask now supports EIP 747, which defines a way for sites to suggest an asset to their users\u2019 wallet to track. A dapp can simply call wallet_watchAsset() and pass a token\u2019s details\u200a\u2014\u200aif the user\u2019s wallet also supports EIP 747, the wallet will add the token to the user\u2019s list!One API call, and a user gets an easy-to-read confirmation screen. No complicated instructions. No pull requests to centralized repositories.Once your extension has updated to 4.12, you can try the feature using this sample dapp, then check the code to implement for your own token!This is the second step in a larger effort to make token management via MetaMask simpler than ever. Version 4.9 added token auto-detection, which works for tokens tracked in our eth-contract-metadata repo. For other tokens, or for dapp developers who don\u2019t know what wallet their user has, this EIP is great news. We could even use the same pattern in the future to suggest alternate networks to the user, as discussed in this post.Ledger Hardware\u00a0SupportMetaMask 4.12 now supports Ledger hardware wallets! If you have a Ledger, you can now connect it to MetaMask and use it to sign transactions across the web. From the top-right menu, click \u201cConnect Hardware Wallet,\u201d follow a couple easy steps, and you\u2019re ready to go.Once your Ledger is connected, you\u2019ll be able to sign transactions, sign messages, and check your Ledger accounts\u2019 ETH or token balance\u200a\u2014\u200aall without your private keys ever leaving your Ledger.

This means that if the servers are down, e.g. maintenance or a DDoS attack, the users won\u2019t be able to use the application. Other than that, with a desktop version, it\u2019s much easier for the user to verify its integrity against the source code increasing, even more, the trust in the network. At the same time, we realized that the app being available on the web is a very easy way for the users to use it, making it more accessible.So, our idea was to be flexible, making Swapy Exchange available on the web through the cloud but also releasing desktop versions compatible with the most used Operational Systems.With decentralization in mind, we decided to focus on the desktop version first and we released Swapy Exchange Alpha v0.0.1\u200a\u2014\u200aa desktop app built on top of Electron. To make it work we built a wallet manager to create, encrypt and store private keys using Electron Store.The problem began when we tried to deploy this version in the browser. Since we don\u2019t have access to OS capabilities through the browser, we weren\u2019t able to use our previous wallet manager. This means that we\u2019d have to implement 2 different ways to manage wallets: one for the browser and other for the desktop. Not only this could become a mess in our code, but also, it could be very confusing for the users to use the application in one way through the browser and have a totally different experience using the desktop app.So we decided to go to the other way around and release a browser version integrated with MetaMask, which is the most used wallet manager nowadays, because of its easy-to-use approach to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain. Then, again, we bumped in some issues regarding the implementation: it was not possible to easily integrate MetaMask in our desktop app because Electron doesn\u2019t fully support the Chrome Extensions\u2019 API. So we released Swapy Exchange Alpha v0.0.2 only in the browser.At this point we had a big challenge in front of us:1. We didn\u2019t want to have 2 different codebases: one for the web and the other for Electron.2. We needed to provide wallet management for the desktop in the most secure & easy-to-use way, preferably using MetaMask itself within our Electron App.3. Security! We didn\u2019t want anyone to steal user\u2019s private keys or take control of the user\u2019s OS.\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014Aragon\u2019s solutionAragon Desktop integration with\u00a0MetamaskWe then discovered that Aragon\u2019s team was struggling with the same issue to create their desktop version. They wanted to integrate MetaMask into their Electron application and we came across their solution.Basically, they had to implement what was missing in Electron to support extensions + some specific requirements of MetaMask. According to their post, some of the things they had to were:- Implement a lot of dummy APIs faking Chrome\u2019s.- Replace MetaMask\u2019s default communication method between the extension and the webapp (using Ports) with an isolated, inter-origin communication using postMessage.Also, since they removed nodeIntegration from Electron, they had to implement their own way to communicate between the browser renderer and the main app, so they created Intertron.They did a great job on that and in the beginning, we thought in going to the same path, using their open source code as a reference. But we realized that it was not that simple. They were not using the actual codebase of MetaMask, instead, they created their own fork, thus making it too hard to keep MetaMask up-to-date. Also, MetaMask UI is built with React, so as Aragon, but Swapy Exchange uses Angular, nonetheless injecting the UI in our frontend was not so straightforward as for them.Therefore we wanted a way that we could inject MetaMask\u2019s actual code straightforward in our app and don\u2019t worry with integrating any React code and don\u2019t have to worry at all to modify the way MetaMask works thus making a desktop app compatible with MetaMask latest versions of course, without sacrificing any security.Sounds impossible, but we did it!Our solutionSwapy Exchange Desktop (Alpha version) with\u00a0MetamaskThat\u2019s when we bumped into Muon: an Electron fork maintained by Brave. According to Muon\u2019s documentation, some of the goals of the framework are:add support for Chrome extensionsadd security-focused features for the renderer:\u200a\u2014\u200aremove node completely (from the renderer process)\u200a\u2014\u200afull sandboxMuon seemed perfect for us: because not only we would have full support for extensions but also we would have increased security and a framework supported by a great company also in the Ethereum ecosystem.The biggest difference between Electron and Muon is that Muon fully support Chromium\u2019s features and at the same time implements a secure way to do IPC communication, without Node (similar as Aragon\u2019s Intertron, mentioned above). The problem is that it\u2019s still in a very early stage, so they don\u2019t have a good documentation yet, other than the browser-laptop code.But the result couldn\u2019t be better. After we figure out how Muon works and integrates with extensions, we were able to wrap our frontend code within Muon and inject MetaMask with minimum effort, downloading it directly from Chrome Store.How we did\u00a0it1. We created a wrapper for the frontend code where the Muon code resides2. We downloaded MetaMask from the Chrome Store using chrome-ext-downloader3. We injected the extension using [Muon\u2019s extension API]4. We implemented the functions to open and close the MetaMask\u2019s popups5. We created in our frontend the isElectron variable to decide whether to open the extension through Electron/Muon or use MetaMask\u2019s default communication with the browser6. We packed our code with Electron Builder and generated installers for Windows, Mac and Linux.\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014Now, we\u2019re releasing Swapy Exchange Alpha v0.0.3 with both browser and desktop versions using the same codebase integrated with MetaMask in a simple but secure\u00a0way!We want\u00a0more!We think that this solution can be useful for other companies/developers willing to release desktop versions of their dApps, that\u2019s why we created electron-metamask-boilerplate, which can be used to easily wrap a d\u2019App and generate a desktop version using MetaMask, just like we did!Electron + Metamask BoilerplateConclusionIt was a big challenge to come up with this solution, but we learned a lot in the process. We\u2019re willing to keep evolving our code always looking for decentralization, transparency and creating value for our users.It wouldn\u2019t be possible to develop anything without the great open source community around the world, so we\u2019d like to thank all developers behind the software that makes Swapy Network possible.

If you missed the speech in Prague here\u2019s a recap of MetaMask\u2019s past, present, and future.MetaMask team on the Main\u00a0Stage.What did we\u00a0present?All those pull requests & releases throughout the year added up to a lot of tangible changes to MetaMask, so we\u2019ve compiled a list of some updates you may have missed and some categories we have been focusing on throughout this year.Hardware wallet integrationsPrivacy by Default (EIP 1102)Easy token tracking (EIP 747)Simplified data signing (EIP 712)Some of MetaMask\u2019s user-facing improvements we discussed at\u00a0Devcon.From the DevCon stage, we also discussed some of our goals for the year ahead:Contract Account\u00a0SupportGnosis SAFE is an ecosystem of smart contracts that allows for features like social recovery, key allowances, state channels, multi-factor auth, and batch transactions. MetaMask is building support for these contract accounts, allowing users to form a logical on-chain identity.Light Client Development (Mustekala)MetaMask Labs is working on Mustekala, a native browser p2p light client to decrease MetaMask\u2019s reliance on centralized infrastructure. Follow the project as it evolves!Multi-Network SupportMetaMask will soon support any ETH-compatible blockchain, opening MetaMask up to new communities across the world. This is just the start: eventually, we aim to support simultaneous connections to a wide variety of different networks, and even allow sites to suggest networks to their users.MetaMetricsMetaMask\u2019s users span a huge range of technical to non-technical backgrounds, and we aim to make our product work for people across the world. But building for such a broad audience is hard! That\u2019s why we plan to introduce *opt-in* metrics to help understand what our users find challenging and what needs to improve. We\u2019ll NEVER collect addresses, keys, transactions, balances, personal information, or IP addresses, and allowing these metrics to run in your extension will be 100% Voluntary.Layer 2 Scaling\u00a0ResearchThere are some exciting projects out there to make the Ethereum blockchain cheaper and faster to use. We\u2019re exploring how to best integrate Layer 2 solutions into MetaMask to encourage this important work across the ecosystem and help get it in the hands of users quickly.

I recommend using Ganache, which you install by running npm install -g ganache-cli.Next let\u2019s make sure we have our ganache running in the background. Open your terminal and run the command ganache-cli. That's all! It runs on port 8545by default, just like most Ethereum RPCs, and so does Truffle.Also note that when ganachefirst starts, it prints out a list of accounts that will be pre-funded with ether, along with a twelve-word seed phrase for re-generating those accounts. You can use this seed phrase to initialize your MetaMask client with the same accounts, and you\u2019ll have lots of Ether when you start! (Ether is used to pay for network usage, or gas, on the Ethereum network)If you wanted to start up ganachewith the accounts you already have in MetaMask, you can tell ganachewhat seed phrase to use with the -m flag. For example:$ ganache-cli -m \"concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic\"Setting up a simple Truffle\u00a0DappNext, let\u2019s generate a basic Truffle dapp. The default result of truffle initis a simple example currency.To get it up and running, run these commands:mkdir metacoin# Create a folder for your new dappcd metacoin# Move into that foldertruffle init # Initialize a default truffle project in that foldertruffle compilertruffle migrate # Build, compile, & deploy the dapptruffle test test/metacoin.jsSetting up\u00a0MetamaskIf you visit it, you\u2019ll see that by default this new Dapp template signs you in with the first account on your ganache-cli account list, which happens to be the same account that got pre-populated with 10k shiny new Metacoins! That's because when you ran truffle migrate, Truffle used your first account as the contract publisher, and the contract says to fund the creator's account with 10k coins.You can now send those coins to any account you want, for example, the second account in your ganache-cli list! If you enter an address and a value, and hit send, you'll see your balance go down!If that seems a little too easy, I\u2019d agree with you! That\u2019s why Metamask gives the user an opportunity to approve every transaction that a Dapp attempts, and that\u2019s more secure!Let\u2019s try connecting to the same account through Metamask, and see how easy it is!Setting up\u00a0MetamaskNow you\u2019ll want to install Metamask from the Chrome store.Please see how to install MetamaskOpen MetamaskClick the current network name in the top right.Select Custom RPCSet the current RPCLocalhost:8545address.5. fill in the second account (0x035b9094158fc6af051242b6c04444c017b7e17c) and amount of 36. You will see the the result of transaction.This has been a simple example, but hopefully shows how Truffle and Metamask work together. They are able to pretty much work out of the box! That\u2019s because Truffle helps you write web3-compliant dapps.

Making transactions on the Main network may result in lose of ETH!Join us at: SELECT Solidity development channelGoal of the Web ApplicationWe want to enable user to easily interact with our contracts. User has to be able to create pools, send ETH to the pool, transfer reward points, see who\u2019s the Shark and other token holders.We also want to detect account from MetaMask extension and present just user specific data.Blockchain is slow compared to the user interactions and we don\u2019t want user to sit and wait for the confirmations. That means it\u2019s critical to implement transactions queue and enable user to see transaction status within Web Application or using tool like Etherscan.Required toolsThere is quite a lot of technologies we need to make this work:React and Redux\u200a\u2014\u200apopular Javascript libraries to build Web ApplicationsWebpack\u200a\u2014\u200ato take care of modules, dependencies and build processMetaMask\u200a\u2014\u200aweb3 provider and extension for transaction signingShout out to some of the repositories helping me to build this Dapp:React, Redux and Webpack starter repository. Great starting pack, don\u2019t need a lot of changes in the configuration to build upon it.Web3 detection and nice svg images repository. I have put state manipulation into the Redux, but it\u2019s a nice starting point (and I really like the graphics).Web3 LibraryWhat you want to do is rely on the user to provide an external web3 provider. There is no web3 dependency in the package.json. In my case, I force user to install MetaMask, which takes care of web3 injection, signing transactions and connecting to the right node. What I have to do is monitor if it\u2019s connected to the right network and parse users public address for user management.Check web3\u00a0statusWe need web3 status, connected blockchain network and user\u2019s address pretty much everywhere across the application. I have created component which fetches account and network periodically. And Redux makes it easy to map state to the components that needs to check it.const ONE_SECOND = 1000;const ONE_MINUTE = ONE_SECOND * 60;class Web3Provider extends Component {  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this.props.fetchAccounts();    this.props.fetchNetwork();    this.interval = null;    this.networkInterval = null;  }  /**   * Start polling accounts, & network. We poll indefinitely so that we can   * react to the user changing accounts or networks.   */  componentDidMount() {    this.props.fetchAccounts();    this.props.fetchNetwork();    this.initPoll();    this.initNetworkPoll();  }  /**   * Init Web3/account polling, and prevent duplicate interval.   * @return {void}   */  initPoll() {    if (!this.interval) {      this.interval = setInterval(this.props.fetchAccounts, ONE_SECOND);    }  }  /**   * Init network polling, and prevent duplicate intervals.   * @return {void}   */  initNetworkPoll() {    if (!this.networkInterval) {      this.networkInterval = setInterval(this.props.fetchNetwork, ONE_MINUTE);    }  }  render() {    return null;  }}const mapStateToProps = state => {  const { accounts_fetched, account_exists, account_selected, accounts } = state.accounts;  const { network_fetched, network_id } = state.network;  return { accounts_fetched, account_exists, accounts, account_selected, network_fetched, network_id };};const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => (  bindActionCreators({ fetchAccounts, fetchNetwork }, dispatch));const hoc = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Web3Provider);// EXPORT COMPONENTexport { hoc as Web3Provider };We are calling 2 functions, fetchAccounts() and fetchNetwork(). They update global state through Redux, and it\u2019s easy to use it in the components that need address and network informations. All you need is to add state.accounts and state.network in the mapStateToProps() function function in other components.Implementation of the fetchAccounts() and fetchNetwork().import isEmpty from 'lodash/isEmpty';export const fetchNetwork = () => {  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    const { web3 } = window;    web3 && web3.version && web3.version.getNetwork((err, netId) => {      if (err) {        reject(err);      } else {        resolve(netId);      }    });  });};export const fetchAccounts = () => {  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    const { web3 } = window;    const ethAccounts = getAccounts();    if (isEmpty(ethAccounts)) {      web3 && web3.eth && web3.eth.getAccounts((err, accounts) => {        if (err) {          reject(err);        } else {          resolve(accounts);        }      });    } else {      resolve(ethAccounts);    }  });};function getAccounts() {  try {    const { web3 } = window;    // throws if no account selected    return web3.eth.accounts;  } catch (e) {    return [];  }Web3 dependency is injected from MetaMask, and you can access it through window.web3. You can actually check if provider is indeed MetaMask, using web3.currentProvider.isMetaMask. I currently check that when creating transactions. However there are other providers like Parity, and in the future should support them too. Other than that code is pretty straight forward, same as using your own web3 provider.To make it work with Redux you need to create Redux store and reducer, but that is standard for the Redux store manipulation.Checking Web3 state in another component is super easy now.if (isEmpty(this.props.accounts)) {  failed = true;  error = <AccountUnavailable/>;}return (  <div>      {        failed && error      }  </div>)This will render AccountUnavailable component, if there is no accounts mapped to the props of component. I also check if connected network is incorrect, web3 provider is not supported or there is no web3 provider.Public key address\u00a0parsingPublic key from wallet that user is using, is available as the first element in the accounts array in the injected web3, or in the account_selected variable. You can use it thorough the application to identify the user and show him user related content.Public key provided is always in lower case. I feel like this is important to mention, since addresses parsed from events data aren\u2019t, and may be a reason your requests to the backend are failing. I solved this issue by adding Collation index on the columns in the Mongo Db, where needed.When making transactions to the blockchain, addresses aren\u2019t case sensitive. That means you could get away by just storing and matching everything with lower or upper case. But I think it looks better and more professional if displayed addresses on the UI remain unchanged.Sending transaction using\u00a0MetaMaskSending transactions using MetaMask is similar as using your own web3 dependency. Here you can see depositToPool() function implementationexport const depositToPool = (pool, ethAmount) => {  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    const web3 = window.web3;    const poolAddress = pool;    const amountWei = web3.toWei(ethAmount, 'ether');    if (!web3 || !web3.isConnected() || !web3.currentProvider.isMetaMask) {      reject('No web3!');    }    const account = web3.eth.accounts[0];    if (!account) {      reject('No account!');    }    web3.eth.getTransactionCount(account, (error, txCount) => {      if (error) {        reject(error);      }      web3.eth.sendTransaction({        nonce: txCount,        from: account,        to: poolAddress,        value: amountWei      }, (err, transactionId) => {        if (err) {          reject(error);        } else {          axios.post(api_service_url + '/transaction/create', {            address: account,            transaction_id: transactionId,            transaction_type: 'Deposit'          }).then(() => {            resolve(transactionId);          }).catch((err) => {            reject(err);          });        }      });    });  });};I only allow MetaMask provider for now. MetaMask only allows asynchronous calls to the blockchain. What that means is, it won\u2019t work if you don\u2019t provide callback method at the end of the called function. You can\u2019t use\u00a0.then() either, which is a bit weird to me, but I guess that is how they can enforce that. More on the in their developer guide.And a call that creates the poolexport const createPool = (pool) => {  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    const web3 = window.web3;    if(!web3 || !web3.isConnected() || !web3.currentProvider.isMetaMask) {      reject('No web3!');    }    const appContract = web3.eth.contract(appContractAbi).at(app_contract_address);    const account = web3.eth.accounts[0];    if(!account) {      reject('No account!');    }    web3.eth.getTransactionCount(account, (error, txCount) => {      if(error) {        reject(error);      }      appContract.createPool(pool.name, Number(pool.rate), Number(pool.deadline), {        nonce: txCount,        from: account      }, (err, transactionId) => {        if(err) {          reject(error);        } else {          axios.post(api_service_url + '/transaction/create', {            address: account,            transaction_id: transactionId,            transaction_type: 'CreatePool'          }).then(response => {            resolve(transactionId);          }).catch((err) => {            reject(err);          });        }      });    });  });};Transaction queue managementIf you check code carefully, you will notice a little hack. I send transaction data to the backend server, where I store it and wait for the information about it being placed into the block. By doing so I create sort of a queue for blockchain transactions.You could implement the same queue on the frontend, in fact there are already libraries that do that for you. I recommend taking a look at Drizzle. But to use Drizzle you need Web socket, which I think is a pain to set up and maintain on your own. And RPC provider Infura, which I\u2019m using for this Dapp, doesn\u2019t officially support web sockets.There are obvious drawbacks to my solution. If user creates transaction outside of our Web Application, I don\u2019t track it\u2019s status. However I still process Events on the contract, so this is not such a major issue.ConclusionWe created a fully functional Decentralized Web application. Transactions are processed directly on the blockchain, by using MetaMask Web3 provider. To present data we are using custom backend service, which makes UI way more fluid and development a lot easier.It took me quite a while to set up Web Application and provide all the needed API calls on the backend. I deployed it to the AWS instance here, and I encourage you to check it out.

Don\u2019t get me wrong. INFURA is great (although it lacks some features). It\u2019s damn fast, and makes it infinitely easier for web3 beginners. The way it\u2019s set up in Metamask looks kind of like this:const Web3 = require('web3');const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/metamask'));// then try some requestsweb3.eth.getBlockNumber(console.log);You can try the above code yourself in Node.js. It basically tells web3 to use INFURA\u2019s geth node to JSON-RPC on.But now we have a trusted third party problem. Web3 JSON-RPCs INFURA\u2019s nodes, and just trust whatever they reply to us. AFAIK there is no SPV built into web3.js, and the provider is the absolute source of truth.You don\u2019t want that in a decentralized world, do you?Running a light geth\u00a0nodeWe all know that you should run a full node if you want to go full decentralized. But not everyone can run a full node because it takes a really long time to sync, and it requires a lot of disk space.Since geth 1.5.2, you can run geth in light client mode. Instead of reconstructing the entire chain state, light sync mode only gets the block headers. It takes minutes to sync, and only uses a few hundred MBs of disk. When you request information, your light geth node queries its peers.The very important difference between RPC\u2019ing a trusted node and RPC\u2019ing a light node you run is this: even you\u2019re still getting blockchain data from someone else, your light node does not trust the peers and will do all the verifications.To start geth in light sync mode with 2048 MB cache, and with HTTP-RPC enabled on port 8545, simply run this command:geth --syncmode light --cache 2048 --rpc --rpccorsdomain moz-extension://e582a415-cf54-468e-9b4b-f32b576f7bf7,chrome-extension://nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknnThe extension ID above may not be up to date\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can find it by popping out Metamask popup into a tab, or right click View Source and copy the extension ID from address bar.The above command enables CORS for Metamask extension on Firefox and Chrome. If you only need one of them, feel free to remove the other.It may take a few minutes to sync. Meanwhile you can run geth attach to attach to the IPC and check the sync progress.$ geth attach ~/.ethereum/geth.ipcWelcome to the Geth JavaScript console!instance: Geth/v1.7.3-unstable-3ee86a57/linux-amd64/go1.9.2 modules: admin:1.0 debug:1.0 eth:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0 web3:1.0> eth.syncing{  currentBlock: 1026432,  highestBlock: 4537745,  knownStates: 0,  pulledStates: 0,  startingBlock: 966336}> net.peerCount8> eth.blockNumber1032576Verify your HTTP-RPC works in Node.jsconst Web3 = require('web3');const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545'));// then try some requestsweb3.eth.getBlockNumber(console.log);I\u2019ve encountered a weird bug where my Geth node doesn\u2019t open HTTP-RPC when running in light syncmode, even with --rpc flag on. If that happens to you, simply geth attach and type admin.startRPC() in your Geth JavaScript console.Setting up Metamask to use your local\u00a0gethVery conveniently there\u2019s an option to use localhost 8545 in MetamaskSetting Metamask to use local geth node running in light sync\u00a0modeIf HTTP-RPC works in your Node.js environment but not Metamask, then your CORS domain setting is wrong. Restart geth with the correct --rpccorsdomain. See aboveIf HTTP-RPC does not work in Node.js or Metamask, and only IPC-RPC works, then your HTTP-RPC is probably not even turned on.That\u2019s it! Now enjoy the decentralized world where you rely on nobody but yourself.Bonus: filtersWeb3 comes with a very handy feature: filters. You can read the documentation on web3.eth.filter if you care. It basically lets you set up filters and watch for certain events. Very useful if you don\u2019t want to constantly poll the state.Unfortunately, INFURA does not support such call to create and watch filters.Fun side node: Metamask by default constantly calls getBlockNumber on the geth node, INFURA or otherwise, when it could have used a filter to watch the latest block, which is far more performant. The reasoning is that, INFURA does not support filters, and Metamask by default uses INFURA as provider.I\u2019ve had the opportunity to talk to Michael Wuehler about INFURA at one of the meetups. He said filter is one of the most requested features. It\u2019s not currently supported because it does not scale very well (or by his words, it\u2019s linearly scaled).It\u2019s certainly a headache for DApp developers, because your filters won\u2019t work in Firefox/Chrome with default Metamask settings. It works if user is using Metamask with a local geth node though.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "Welcome the Metamask mobile analog: nobody needs to build crypto wallets\u00a0anymore", "author_name": "Diana Furman", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/welcome-the-metamask-mobile-analog-nobody-needs-to-build-crypto-wallets-anymore-e06b733094f7?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 28, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "315", "content": "Welcome the Metamask mobile analog: nobody needs to build crypto wallets\u00a0anymoreDiana FurmanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 28, 2018As an experienced crypto wallet developer, we offer a white label wallet solution for different blockchain projects.

Of course, we could take is as a challenge\u200a\u2014\u200abuild a WL wallet for all needs. But, in fact, we can\u2019t: our precious human resources are naturally limited, and not every company can afford to/put their trust into a \u201cblack box\u201d solution/plead their inability to build a no-risk-of-screwing-up wallet, after all.Regardless of the possible reasons, many crypto companies\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially dapps\u200a\u2014\u200ashun the idea of building their own app just because it would cost them some 1.5 months of development (full ios/android team load)? We do not know of any successful and ambitious crypto startup that has spare developers. Fitting an MVP of a wallet into your company\u2019s roadmap can be.\u00a0.\u00a0. well, if by any chance you work in the industry too, just imagine that and paste the best answer!If you do not, I\u2019ll tell you: impossible unless your survival depends on this (it usually doesn\u2019t).Even the smallest Dapp on Earth can easily go live by implementing Metamask payments, but when it comes to mobile, everything comes to a halt. So what can we do? After sleeping on those facts for several weeks, we came up with an idea.Why not create an ETH wallet SDK for everyone who needs\u00a0it?\u201cHappiness for everyone, free, and no one will go away unsatisfied\u201dWell, that and make the wallet work with Lumi. Do we or do we not have the right to benefit from our own work?Lumi Blockchain WalletAnd that we did. An SDK (software development kit)\u200a\u2014\u200ais literally a toolkit, a bunch of pieces of code, libraries, etc that you can use to create applications with. Implementing the Lumi SDK allows the app to sign Ethereum transactions.So we created the Lumi SDK\u200a\u2014\u200athe only thing left was to find a guinea-pig\u2026 a pioneer, we mean.Some of you have probably heard of 0xUniverse\u200a\u2014\u200aa colorful blockchain strategy game where players explore space, fly spaceships, and colonize planets. Each planet is a unique collectible usually purchased via Metamask (on desktops). The problem occurred when the 0x team decided to expand and develop a mobile version of their creation\u200a\u2014\u200athere was simply no existing solution available for Dapps at that time. So it was the perfect opportunity to give our SDK a try and, as a result, Lumi wallet has been successfully integrated into the 0xUniverse mobile game.What does that mean for the 0x player?1) oh god, there\u2019s finally an 0x app! (so they are going to play the game more often and spend more time in it)2) they decide to purchase a new spaceship, and woo-hoo! They just click the purchase button, are redirected to Lumi Collect, confirm the payment details, and go right back to the app. It\u2019s as simple as it could be. Of course, the easiness of the interaction affects the frequency of the purchases too, if you know what we mean\u00a0:)That\u2019s only one Lumi SDK implementation case: the possibilities for use are endless. Let\u2019s say, you\u2019re running a decentralized auction platform, and your client wants to purchase an item and send it as a gift to a friend. Instead of finding himself in a long process of signing several transactions he can finalize the whole deal in a single click.Do you think it\u2019s time for your Dapp to go mobile?

With this guide you can invest into the ONSTELLAR ICO starting on March 29th. By now you should have already registered for the ICO as explained in this guide. You should also have your investment Ethereum ready in your MyEtherWallet as explained here. And finally you also need the MetaMask browser plugin.This is Tutorial 9 out of 9 for the ONSTELLAR ICO. (overview)Step 1:Go to the ONSTELLAR website and login into your account. You will land on the Dashboard where you should double check your RECEIVING Ethereum wallet address. This is the address where the ONST tokens will be send to.Step 2:Click on Token Sale in the main menu. The token sale address will be made public on March 29th. Don\u2019t use any other address you have gotten from anywhere else or before that day. Copy the address.Step 3:Go to MyEtherWallet.com. Type in the address directly into your browser and don\u2019t click on any links claiming to lead there. Click on Send Ether & Tokens and select the method MetaMask / Mist. Now press the blue button Connect to MetaMask. You must be logged into MetaMask first for this and have selected the account with your funds you want to invest.Step 4:Paste our ICO address that you have copied in Step 2 into the field To Address. Double check if the address is the correct one from our Token Sale page and that you have funds in your wallet. Below in the field Amount to Send fill in the amount of Ethereum you want to invest. You can use the calculator on our token sale page to calculate how much ONST tokens you will receive. After you entered your Ethereum amount click on the button Generate Transaction and then on Send Transaction.In case of a transcation excution error please repeat the process and increase the Gas Limit to 100,000.Step 5:MetaMask will open a window where you have to confirm the transaction. You can adjust the Gas Limit and Gas Price futher up if you want the transaction to be faster. But you can also just leave it on the default value. Double check if all details are correct. If so, click on Submit and your Ethereum will be send to our ICO address.Congratulations!You have successfully participated in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of ONSTELLAR. You will receive your ONST tokens as soon as they are issued.Read the whitepaper at https://onstellar.com/content/onstellar-whitepaper.pdfWebsite | Telegram chat | Twitter | Instagram | Facebook", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Building an ERC721 non-fungible token smart contract and using metamask to interact with it via a web interface.

This equips MetaMask to handle user authentication over usernames and passwords. Additionally, creating a user account with MetaMask requires no personal identifying information. It is the same level of security as your Ethereum wallet\u200a\u2014\u200abecause it is an Ethereum wallet.It works like this. The server generate a challenge message. Your browser requests the challenge message. MetaMask signs the message using your Ethereum private key. The server recreates the Ethereum address from the signed message.This is the same security provided to an Ethereum transaction. Instead of Ethereum transaction data, MetaMask signs text data. The same way your private key signs to spend your coins, it signs the server message it receives. The text could be random, Terms of Service or something else entirely.Using your cryptographic signature, the server is able to verify you are the same, unique, user each time you visit without a username or password.You can find the source code for meta-auth on it\u2019s Github Repo. Or find out more information on npm.Here\u2019s how it works,The Back\u00a0EndFirst, install express and meta-auth$ npm install express meta-authInit both modulesconst express = require('express');const MetaAuth = require('meta-auth');const app = express();const metaAuth = MetaAuth();By default, meta-authwill watch for three route parametersMetaAddress\u200a\u2014\u200aUsed to issue a challenge message for an address.MetaMessage\u200a\u2014\u200aChallenge message returned by the client.MetaSignature\u200a\u2014\u200aSigned Challenge returned with MetaMessage.These parameter names are configurable when initializing meta-authconst metaAuth = require('meta-auth')({  message: 'msg',  signature: 'sig',  address: 'address'});Include the metaAuth middleware. The first function issues a challenge for an Ethereum address. If the\u00a0:MetaAddress route parameter is specified the middleware will create the req.metaAuthobject with a challenge property.The second verifies the message signature and provides req.metaAuth with a recovered property. If the address is recovered the server has cryptographic proof the address belongs to the user. It is safe to log them in.app.get('/auth/:MetaAddress', metaAuth, (req, res) => {  // Request a message from the server  res.send(req.metaAuth.challenge)});app.get('/auth/:MetaMessage/:MetaSignature', metaAuth, (req, res) => {  if (req.metaAuth.recovered) {    // Signature matches the cache address/challenge    // Authentication is valid, assign JWT, etc.    res.send(req.metaAuth.recovered);  } else {    // Sig did not match, invalid authentication    res.status(500).send();  };});Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening under the hoodfunction createChallenge (address) {  const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)    .update(address + uuidv4())    .digest('hex');  cache.set(address, hash);  return hash;}First, The client sends it\u2019s address to the server. It creates a salted hash of the address and uuidv4. It caches the address/challenge pair for lookup later.function checkChallenge(challenge, sig) {  const data = [{    type: 'string',    name: 'challenge',    value: challenge  }]  const recovered = sigUtil.recoverTypedSignature({    data,    sig  });  const storedChallenge = cache.get(recovered);  if (storedChallenge === challenge) {    cache.del(recovered);    return recovered;  }  return false;}The challenge and signature return to the server. It recovers the address from the signature. Then ensures the challenge is for the address. Then removes the data from the cache and returns the recovered address.Returning to the verification express routeapp.get('/auth/:MetaMessage/:MetaSignature', metaAuth, (req, res) => {  if (req.metaAuth.recovered) {    // Signature matches the cache address/challenge    // Authentication is valid, assign JWT, etc.    res.send(req.metaAuth.recovered);  } else {    // Sig did not match, invalid authentication    res.status(400).send();  };});If the recovered property is found meta-auth successfully recovered the address from the message signature.From here, start the user\u2019s session, assign a JWT, give them access to their data, whatever you want to do.The Front\u00a0EndBy now you know the client will make two requests to the serverReceive a challenge based on their Ethereum AddressReturn the challenge with a signature.That\u2019s for the server, but the client will need to make a third call in between to its web3 provider.(code can be found here)$.get('http://localhost:3000/auth/' + web3.eth.accounts[0], (res) =>   {  challenge = [{    type: 'string',    name: 'challenge',    value: res  }];  const from = web3.eth.accounts[0];  const params = [challenge, from];  const method = 'eth_signTypedData';  web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({    method,    params,    from  }, async (err, result) => {    signature = result.result;    if (err) {      return console.error(err);    }  if (result.error) {    return console.error(result.error);  }  $('.signature').text(signature);  });});The challenge is received from the server and MetaMask will handle sendAsync call to sign the provided challenge.$.get('http://localhost:3001/auth/' + challenge[0].value + '/' + signature, (res) => {  if (res === web3.eth.accounts[0]) {    $('.success').show();  } else {    $('.fail').show();   }});For verification the client returns the same challenge with their signature. If the server response matches the user\u2019s Ethereum address authentication was successful.You can find the source code for meta-auth on it\u2019s Github Repo.

Staking is fundamental for a tokenized social network and enables all network participants to have aligned incentives within the ecosystem.Welcome to Web 3.0!How To\u00a0Stake:The first 7 days on the platform allows new users to explore communities and create content without needing to stake SPN. However, after 7 days, users will be required to stake 100 SPN to continue using the platform.The 100 SPN will be locked in a smart contract and progressively unlocked over the course of a year. At the end of the first year, users will be able to withdraw the entire staked amount from the smart contract.Staking implementations are an important part of the SPN token as it constructs our \u201cSomething-At-Stake\u201d design.Staking Implementations position the SPN Utility Token for Proof Of Stake in the near future.See the instructional video below on how to stake SPN:Start Staking Here: beta.sapien.network/stakespnHow To Create An\u00a0Account:To learn how to create an account and operate the platform see the article below:https://blog.sapien.network/creating-your-account-exploring-the-sapien-platform-f51b606fe7c4How To Install and Use Metamask in Under 5\u00a0Minutes:As always, the Sapien team is here to answer any questions or concerns.

This newsletter has some updates on projects past and future, as well as several exciting shoutouts across the MetaMask family!An update on 1102 & Privacy\u00a0ModeLast month we launched a feature called Privacy Mode in MetaMask v5.0.0, which requires that dapps ask users\u2019 permission to view their public Ethereum address. Over the past couple weeks, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of applications across the ecosystem update to support this crucial privacy layer. We\u2019re proud of the ecosystem for stepping up to protect user privacy and excited to keep working to improve the decentralized web.Dependency SecurityLast week a popular Bitcoin wallet was hacked, which has concerning ramifications for all cryptocurrency wallet developers and users. For a full description of the hack, you can read this blog post.Like all software projects, MetaMask has many dependencies in the open source world that help us bring you the ever-evolving experience you\u2019ve grown to expect.In addition to continuing along our roadmap, MetaMask is spending some time improving security around our key management. We\u2019ll first lock down the dependencies related to your keys. We\u2019re also exploring the possibility of sandboxing sensitive portions of code to add the absolute highest certainty that keys are only accessed in the intended ways.Of course, if you\u2019re taking advantage of our Trezor and Ledger hardware wallet support, you\u2019d be immune to this kind of attack, provided you carefully review proposed transactions on the screen of your hardware device.Growing the Design\u00a0TeamMetaMask is stoked to announce our design team has grown by two! We\u2019re welcoming Omna Toshniwal and Juwon Bahn to the team. Omna will focus on UX Research and Juwon joins as our second product designer. Design and usability are core to MetaMask\u2019s mission, and our product serves a variety of audiences, so we\u2019re thrilled to have more talented hands on board.MetaMask is still hiring for a variety of other positions \u2013 check out our open roles and get in touch!\u2019Tis the Season of\u00a0GivingThis holiday season we\u2019re reminding ourselves to give back to those less fortunate.We\u2019re particularly proud of Randy Brito, a member of the MetaMask support team. He and his family fled Venezuela when he was 14, and since then he\u2019s been running an online forum called Bitcoin Venezuela. The forum teaches people how to mine bitcoin, and donations to the organization help fund soup kitchens, schools, farms, and continuous education. They\u2019ve also partnered with GiveCrypto to identify ways crypto can help people in need. Visit Bitcoin Venezuela \u26a1\ufe0f to learn more.He operates this all remotely, part time, in addition to his daily work here at MetaMask. We are very proud to have Randy on our team, and deeply hope Ethereum and other decentralized technology will improve the lives of many in need.You can help\u00a0too!Some of you may remember last year we encouraged donations to Merry Merkle, a collaboration across the blockchain community to raise money for a youth shelter in Toronto.This year, they\u2019re partnering with African Angels, an organization that helps fund primary school education for poor and disadvantaged children in South Africa.You can donate at https://merrymerkle.africa/ or `0xf7050c2908b6c1ccdfb2a44b87853bcc3345e3b3`", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Metamask Update\u200a\u2014\u200aPrivacy\u00a0Mode", "author_name": "Enigmatic", "link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/metamask-update-privacy-mode-5439bb6253bb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 1, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "184", "content": "Metamask Update\u200a\u2014\u200aPrivacy\u00a0ModeEnigmaticBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 1, 2018A couple months back, the awesome team at Metamask put up a blog post (https://medium.com/metamask/https-medium-com-metamask-breaking-change-injecting-web3-7722797916a8) stating that from Nov 2nd onwards, Metamask will be updated to stop having Web3 exposing user accounts by default; Rather, would require the dApp to explicitly request for permission to access Metamask accounts.Presently, \u201cPrivacy Mode\u201d when rolled out, will still be disabled by default; It will, however, be eventually enabled by default on a future release.So let\u2019s have a look to see how this looks like.Cooking up a quick test right here to retrieve Metamask\u2019s first account with my current install of Metamask.Works as\u00a0is.Using a pretty standard provider listener.All fine and dandy.

Though it was fun but challenging ride, the knowledge accumulated was very good. Since developing the reactjs application from scratch and getting it ready for production is something I felt very cumbersome process.We are in the Web 3.0 era, yes everything is getting decentralised, we are going back to basics but with wonderful technology (BLOCKCHAIN) to have immutability, transparency in transactions. Having said that, adopting to DAPPS is not that easy since it requires few plugin\u2019s to enable to perform the transactions. So many DAPPs are out there with an extension(plugin) to enable in order to use it for day to day operations. But why\u00a0?Why end users must worry about those plugin\u2019s?, all they want is to use the services & get / make the payment isn\u2019t it?When we are developing DAPPs, most important thing as a developers to keep in mind is \u201cend user\u201d, at the end of the day without users traction even if you build super great applications it will be just a scrap!In this article, I will explain how to build your DAPPs to use the content provider & sign the transactions under the hood.

On this page, we\u2019ll show you how to get started and trade on The Token Store in four easy steps:Step One: Create or Import an\u00a0AccountSince the Token Store is fully decentralized, we never actually hold any of your funds. However, The Token Store needs to be able to access your ETH and tokens to be able to conduct trades.There\u2019s three ways to do this:Create a new, local account:What this does is generate a new ETH address. The private key to this address is stored in your browser cache and never leaves your browser. To reveal your private key, click the eye toggle on the left. Once the address is generated, you can transfer the ETH or ERC20 tokens you want to transact in to your new ETH address.2. Import account:By entering the private key to your ETH wallet (that looks something like this: 8d408fd8a4c0b2cc01b22637b79261a1752685e08dec2c8d9a46884afdbf039d) The Token Store will import your balances and you\u2019ll be able to trade on The Token Store from your existing ETH address. Your private key is never transmitted to The Token Store!3. Metamask, Brave and other Web3 services:By accessing The Token Store from a web3 service such as Metamask (a Chrome and Firefox plugin) or Brave (a standalone browser), the ETH account you have associated with your Web3 service is automatically attached to The Token Store and all available balances are imported.Note that we strongly recommend using option 3 as it is the most secure way of dealing with your private keys.To choose the option that works best for you, navigate to https://token.store/accountsYou can confirm you have successfully imported your account by noting, at the top right of the screen, the first several letters of your public ETH address in green, along with the wallet\u2019s ETH balance.Here\u2019s how it looks:Step Two: Deposit Funds to The Token Store\u2019s Smart\u00a0ContractOnce your account is attached, you must deposit the funds you wish to trade to The Token Store\u2019s smart contract. To do this, you must have funds in your attached account. (If you chose to create a new account, this means you must transfer tokens from yourself to the new account first.) To deposit funds into The Token Store\u2019s smart contract, use the Deposit widget on the left of the page.Step Three:\u00a0TradeOnce funds are deposited and confirmed (this may take some time), your funds are available for traders. Use the Buy/Sell widget to trade.Step Four:\u00a0WithdrawAfter you\u2019re done trading, you should withdraw the funds currently locked in the smart contract to your ETH address. Use the Withdraw widget on the left to accomplish this. If you have used a new account, make sure that you have noted your private key somewhere safe!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Bobby Dresser", "link": "https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-monthly-january-cd969e6e20f9?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 31", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "94", "content": "Bobby DresserBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 31Documentation, performance improvements, security with SESify and more.Docs for the\u00a0BuidlersWe\u2019re happy to announce the launch of our new developer documentation site.

While we have ambitious long-term plans to decentralize this access layer, Infura makes dapp development simple in the meantime. The data show it: as of July 2018 Infura\u2019s Mainnet endpoint serviced about 100,000 requests per second.A substantial portion of this traffic comes from MetaMask users. In the past couple weeks, we\u2019ve worked to make MetaMask\u2019s requests to Infura more efficient by consolidating requests that fetch token balances (#6049), and by caching known method signatures (#6052). We\u2019ll continue to trim down where possible over the coming weeks. This work will improve the performance of our application and ease our load on Infura\u2019s infrastructure.MetaMask Mobile\u200a\u2014\u200acoming\u00a0soonWe\u2019ve been hard at work building MetaMask for iOS and Android.

We will use the browser plugin MetaMask which is the recommended method connecting to your MyEtherWallet.This is Tutorial 8 out of 9 for the ONSTELLAR ICO. (overview)Step 1: Install\u00a0MetaMaskFirst, you need to install the free MetaMask browser plugin from the MetaMask homepage. There you will find options for Firefox, Chrome and Opera. There you can also download the free Brave browser for even more security which has MetaMask already pre-installed.Step 2: Open\u00a0MetaMaskRestart your browser and click on the fox icon in the top right corner. A pop-up window will appear giving you additional infos about MetaMask. Click the orange Accept button to continue.Step 3: Read and Accept the Terms of\u00a0UseYou will now see the MetaMask Terms of Use. After scrolling through them you can click on the now activated Accept button to continue.Step 4: Create a MetaMask\u00a0AccountYou are now being asked to create a new account. Type in a secure password with at least 8 characters and confirm that password in the field below. After you made sure you have memorized or safed your password click on the Create button.If you have already a MetaMask account from somewhere else you can import it by clicking on Import Existing Den where you then have to enter your secret twelve word phrase and create a new password for it.Step 5: Safe Your 12 Word Backup-PhrasePlease memorize or write down your twelve words phrase and keep them safe. Additionally, you can safe your seed words as a file and keep them on a secure flashdrive that is not connected to the internet. After you are done click on I\u2019ve Copied It Somewhere Safe to continue.These twelve words are your only backup for your MetaMask account and hence the only way to restore it in case of damage or loss of your computer.Step 6: You Are Now Logged\u00a0InYou are now successfully logged into your new MetaMask account and you will see the brand new Ethereum wallet created for you labeled Account 1. If You want to use it to send funds to you can get the full address by clicking on the three dots next to it and select Copy Address To Clipboard.You can also buy Ethereum directly from your Coinbase account or via using Shapeshift from within the MetaMask plugin. However, this tutorial is not talking about that process.Step 7 (Optional): Import Your MyEtherWallet AddressYou probably have already another MyEtherWallet address with Ethereum funds in it as we have guided you in our tutorial How To Transfer Ethereum From Coinbase to MyEtherWallet For The ONSTELLAR ICO. For the ONSTELLAR ICO you can use the MetaMask wallets as they are compatible with ERC20 tokens. However, you can easily import your already existing one into MetaMask to use it from there as well.To do so, click on the user account icon in the top right corner of MetaMask and select Import Account.You can now select the type of the import. Leave the default option at Private Key. Below you have to enter your private key of your MyEtherWallet. Double check if you have the correct key. After that click on the orange Import button.Your imported account is now available in MetaMask. Click again on the user account icon in the top right corner and you will see a second account. Click on it to select it. If that wallet has funds in it you will now see the amount in Meta Mask.FinishedYou have now prepared all neccessary steps to use MetaMask for secure Ethereum transactions via your browser.

Do you want to know why? Because I think we\u2019re about to see a new breed of application. One that is \u201cowned by everyone\u201d, or the entire network of participants, instead of a single entity. I affectionately call them Apps For All, and if we can get them to work they\u2019ll be a major new innovation.But there\u2019s a problem right now. Nobody knows how to design DApps, and nobody knows how to develop user-facing ones. We need to change that now.When I started to write my first DApp, I had no idea how the UI should work. What should the UI flow look like for allowing a user to write something to a blockchain? How do you let a user execute a transaction from the UI? Why is MetaMask necessary for a DApp, how do you integrate it, and at what point does it get displayed to the user?My goal in this article is to demonstrate how I designed and developed a \u201cUI Checkout Flow\u201d for a decentralized application that lets users register a photographic asset on the Ethereum blockchain. Along the way, I hope to explain to new Ethereum developers why MetaMask is a critical component of any user-facing DApp, and at what point in a UX interaction it should get displayed.MetaMaskMetaMask is a wallet and a Chrome extension. As a wallet, it holds Ether and allows you to pay for things on Ethereum. A lot of people use it as a convenient middleman wallet to buy ICO tokens with from a browser.But more importantly, MetaMask allows any regular user from a Web application to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with DApps. This is MetaMask\u2019s true strength. Without the MetaMask Chrome extension installed, users cannot interact with a DApp from a browser. They\u2019d have to set up their own independent Ethereum node.Metamask modal and extensionSetting up an independent Ethereum node is a lot of work. It means a user of your DApp would have to download the entire Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, constant updates from the blockchain would have to be downloaded and synchronized to the user\u2019s computer so that the user could stay current with fresh transactions from the network.Average users won\u2019t do that, so MetaMask is a requirement. If a user doesn\u2019t have MetaMask installed, you need to tell them to install it before they can use your DApp.Following good design principles, you should notify users to install MetaMask at the point in your DApp\u2019s UX interaction where it\u2019s obvious they intend to do something. Don\u2019t notify them when they first arrive at your DApp, that\u2019s bad UX. I\u2019ll show you what I mean in a moment.Notification popup if MetaMask is not installedThe Smart\u00a0ContractI\u2019m going to show you the UI checkout flow for my DApp which is titled Proof Of Ex.Proof Of Ex (short for Proof Of Existence), is just a simple proof of concept at this point. It\u2019s also a good use case for a blockchain. The application lets users register their unique photographic assets to the Ethereum blockchain to prove authorship. Since blockchains are immutable and open for all to see, it\u2019s the perfect record for displaying to the world who created what and when.Proof Of Ex is backed by a very simple Smart Contract that provides functions to check if a photographic asset has already been registered. If it hasn\u2019t, it allows a user to register that asset.

The qualitative feedback we get from these different user groups can vary widely. In pursuit of making more data-driven decisions in our UI, MetaMask will begin rolling out an opt-in metrics system starting next week. If you consent, we\u2019ll record anonymized events to better understand the features users gravitate towards, which features go unused, how funnels leak, and so on.Our metrics collection takes a strong stance on user privacy: it will never collect public addresses, private keys, transaction IDs, or transaction hashes. We\u2019ll also obfuscate the last nine digits of any IP addresses. Users can opt-out of metrics collection at any time. Last, MetaMask will never profit from sharing or selling your data, ever.We\u2019ll use this anonymized data to inform our development and create a better MetaMask for all.

For those who haven\u2019t heard about this feel free to check out the intro to it here. In short, this will play a crucial role in helping improve the usability of the decentralized web.MetaMask respects your privacy and safety above all else so here is just a reminder of the number of steps we are taking:MetaMetrics will be opt-in. After opt-in, you can opt-out anytime.MetaMetrics will not collect sensitive data from users: No seed words, no public addresses, no private keys, and no data outside of the extension (we aren\u2019t reading your tabs).MetaMetrics data will only be used for guiding development through an understanding of how people are using the product. We will not profit off of your data. Ever.Data collected will be anonymous. Individual data points will be deleted in compliance with GDPR regulations.Data will be occasionally aggregated and shared with the community-at-large.Our codebase continues to be open source and open to audits at our GitHub.An important thing to reiterate on is that by opting into MetaMetrics you can help the us learn vital information. Info such as which feature do people use the most? What parts of the application do people run into the most trouble with? Where do people drop off when completing certain actions? All questions which we can find answers from valuable MetaMetrics information. This will lead to a better more intuitive MetaMask. Since launching MetaMetrics at the beginning of March, we have discovered we are averaging around 70,000 weekly active MetaMask users. A number we optimistically see growing and we continue to build out our feature set.Ethereum Object CapabilitiesLast Friday our own Dan Finlay visited the Gitcoin Livestream and talked a bit about how a concept called Object Capabilities could enhance security, composability, and scalability for accounts throughout the ecosystem. You can watch the live stream here or read his write-up here.Privacy Mode By\u00a0DefaultStarting this month we started enabling Privacy mode by default for new account users. In addition we will be pushing an update to change existing users to Privacy mode by default as well. If some of you recall reading something like this before you are not mistaken. We announced this feature a few months ago here. The only difference is that now this privacy feature will be on by default! This essentially means that websites have to ask to see your Ethereum accounts. When a Dapp asks for permission to see your accounts, you\u2019ll see a MetaMask popup like this:It\u2019s important to know that when privacy mode is enabled, MetaMask will not automatically expose user accounts to webpages. If privacy mode is disabled MetaMask will automatically expose user accounts to websites as it did in the past.Why wasn\u2019t Privacy mode on by default from the beginning?This is an ecosystem-wide standard that requires dapps to update how they access user accounts. Since it was announced, we\u2019ve been diligently coordinating with other dapps and dapp browsers.We didn\u2019t want this privacy standard to disrupt users\u2019 workflows, so we provided a lengthy upgrade period that gave developers time to update their applications.After almost five months, we\u2019re happy to see that nearly all top dapps have updated to support the new standard, and we\u2019re ready to make this the default experience for all MetaMask users.Going ForwardIf you\u2019re visiting a Dapp that still isn\u2019t EIP 1102 compliant, the site may not work as expected. In this case you will have to head to your Settings menu, turn Privacy Mode \u201coff,\u201d and try reloading the Dapp again.The MetaMask team has always build its product with security and privacy in mind and we firmly believe EIP 1102 is a crucial step towards a safe, user-friendly decentralized web.Release notesMetaMask v6.3.0 is out and auto-updating in browsers near you. Next time you pop it open, check out some of the improvements listed below. These changes are new as of this month.Added MetaMetrics usage analytics system. Off by default but If you consent, we\u2019ll record anonymized events to better understand the features users gravitate towards, which features go unused, how funnels leak, and so on. (#6171)The gas chart is now hidden on custom networks. This change was made to avoid confusion when not on Ethereum networks. (#6300)We improved the design and the UX of the onboarding flow proving new users a more intuitive experience (#6192)We now cancel transactions and signature requests that populate in Metamask transaction history when you closing of notification window. (#6340)Fixed gas fees in the submitted step of the transaction details activity log Prior to this PR, transactions created outside of metamask could represent the submitted gas fee (incorrectly) as \u20180 wei\u2019 in the activity log. (#6301)Added wyre for fiat to Crypto onboarding. (#6302)Fixed notification popups not showing when screen size was abnormal for better user preference flexibility. (#6312)We added a new experimental API to allow apps to prevent reload when users change the selected network. This was added to help UX for sites that are willing to put in the extra work. Developers can learn to use it here: (#6330)Enable mobile sync for the Beta (#6332)Redesign of the settings screen for overall design improvement (#6333)Disabled the transaction \u201cCancel\u201d button when your balance is insufficient. This will prevent you from sending a Cancel transaction when you don\u2019t have enough gas to do so. #6341)Enable privacy mode by default for first time users.

If you use multiple addresses on your Ledger, you will not see those balances, only the balance of the account you selected during setup.Green: Clicking on this box will copy your Ethereum address to your computers clipboard for pasting later.Orange: Any transactions you send or receive to or from your Ledger via MetaMask will show up here.

Generally, those selling a product wish to reach the broader global market, but are limited to credit card and Paypal payments that require permissioned systems and possibly paid APIs to work with. In addition, there are difficult problems to solve when deciding to handle customer payments, involving verifying who actually made a payment. Here is where MetaMask+EthJS+EthSigUtil come in. This suggested solution includes a 3 step technical workflow, and it is a surprisingly pleasant user experience: 1) register a public address with the site by digitally signing a challenge phrase with personal_sign. Signature of a hashed message is performed off-chain to prevent chosen cipher and replay attacks 2) server side personal_ecRecover is used to verify the digital signature was created by the address 3) allow acceptance of payment by giving the user easy access to seeing tokens and/or ether in a wallet on your site. Even if you do not want to manage customer sessions with this method, it is effective for solving the problem of accepting crypto payments and being able to verify a person that said they paid you, really did. A full demo is included and linked to at the bottom of this document to demonstrate the process. It uses Metamask + EthJS + EthSigUtil + TruffleBoxes + Angular components. At the backbone of all this, we use Elliptic Curve Cryptography.Introduction: You want to accept Ether and ERC20 tokens as payment for your service, but you don\u2019t have a way of performing KYC with a user, since this type of payment was fundamentally designed to be decentralized, which circumvents the entire banking infrastructure. This is by design, and avoids a centralized authority. In addition, you may not have the financial means to establish a business relationship with a bank, nor the legal right to establish API access with a payment processor. This proposes a solution to verifying payments from digital identities using signatures. You can then use this public address to associate payments with a customer on your site.Challenges: Transactions for cryptocurrency and digital \u201cUtility Tokens\u201d are recorded on a global, open blockchain, and you might have people that scan the transactions sent to your smart contract or designated wallet addresses. There are many benefits to a public, open decentralized ledger, but there might also be bad actors on the system that wish to make false claims that it was them that paid you, and not the person that actually paid you. This is a problem on multiple levels. It takes time to fend off false claims by investigating and tracking down the IPs and discovering evidence postmortem in order to determine who the actual sender of cryptocurrency / token payment was. This archeological endeavor is fraught with error, especially if the genuine payer took precautions on his or her end to anonymize his location through a tangled web of VPNs. Even after wasting precious time investigating the situation, you might credit the wrong user with the purchase. This will result in you losing a customer, and possibly end up refunding the wrong individual.Possible Method (Rejected - Traditional / Centralized): When a user establishes an account with your service, you generate a new address for that user to accept tokens to send to at the point of sale. Unfortunately, this means you have to keep track of a new private key, and a mapping of users to account keys. This is both mess, grows geometrically over time for each payment, and is hard to keep track of. Even worse, your centralized server becomes a target of DDoS and security attacks. For these reasons, I reject this approach and suggest a New Paradigm for accepting Payments and dealing with cryptocurrency / ERC20 token payments.Proposed Solution (New Paradigm / Decentralized): Reverse the paradigm for security. Store as little as possible about your customer. Only store their PUBLIC address. How would this work? At the point a user enters their address, issue a strong cryptographic challenge. Send the user a message that is unique and random that must be digitally signed. The message will be clearly visible to the user, which makes the user confident that they are not signing a transaction with devious intent. This message is then sent into a *one-way hash, is digitally signed by the unlocked user\u2019s account with the use of a Nonce and a private key on their own device, and the output is a digital signature that is sent to the server issuing the challenge. The server uses Elliptic Curve cryptography to recover the address used to sign the message, and compares that recovered address with the expected result.What Makes This Possible: We already have all the tools available to make this happen. ECDSA technology has existed since the early 1990s, however, many modern browsers still don\u2019t have identity of payments built in to the platform. A product called MetaMask offers users with an extremely easy way to securely store cryptographic key pairs. With this browser extension available on Chrome, a selected account acts as the \u201cavailable\u201d address that gets injected into a site that is Web3 enabled. These days we refer to Web3 enabled sites as the front-end UI for Dapps, apps that work with a decentralized blockchain like Ethereum. There are also plenty of other open source tools that have come available since the invention of the Bitcoin protocol and open source software through the most popular open source platform called Github. We will rely on several of the frameworks available, especially Web3JS, EthJS, and eth-sig-util. For the purposes of demo, we will use OpenZeppelin, the TruffleFramework, Angular and Node, as well as their dependencies.Why This is So Powerful: With cryptographic key pairs made available to the user in a very user friendly way, it makes cryptocurrency, Token Payments and also DIGITAL SIGNATURES extremely painless to work with. No longer will you have to be a tech guru with a console based application and know-how of a complex set of instructions in order to perform basic security operations that lie at the heart of public/private key cryptography.Digital Signatures provide a way to undeniably verify that only the owner of a private key could have possibly signed a particular message. 1) You can challenge a user to identify themself NOW, or at any point in the future, in real time, at the point of sale. 2) You can store a message signature that was signed by a user and hold 100% undeniable proof that the user authored it or had at one point in time. This is especially useful for assigning record of ownership, or maintaining contract and end user license agreements. 3) Because the message that is signed is first sent into a 1-way cryptographic hash, you can verify that the data was not manipulated in any way. The hash function has the properties of exhibiting the following properties: A) Irreversible; computationally infeasible to determine the message from its digest, B) Collision resistant; impractical to find more than one message that provides a given digest, and C) High avalanche effect; any small change has a significant change in digest.In the proposed solution, No Ether is Required for signing. Signatures can be performed without the use of public blockchain, which means that replay attacks of signed messages are not possible, preventing a user from appearing as a certain user, and you could extend this idea by having the digital signature verification server issue a cookie to the user in order to stay logged in.Concerns: Relying on public-key cryptography means that the user must protect his identity as if it was his money. His private key becomes his identity. If the user loses their private key or is compromised, there is no way to prevent other users from making payments from that address on their behalf. A user would still have to use the traditional methods of interacting with the website to re-establish a new payment address. Since we are dealing with payment methods and not full blown identities and logins in this solution, we do not suffer major consequences like we would if we were dealing with catastrophic loss of identity for a site.This isn\u2019t entirely new; what makes this special? True. We have had this cryptographically provable EC method since 1994, where y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. We have had tools like BitID, relying on public-key cryptography for e-commerce. The DIFFERENCE NOW, is that we finally have the tools to make the end-to end USER EXPERIENCE cleaner, seamless and enjoyable. It must be a user experience that is as painless as possible. That is what will allow us to have more widespread adoption of payments with cryptocurrency and ERC20 tokens. Using QR codes is less than ideal, let alone looking at one for very long. They are ugly and nearly impossible to visually verify accuracy.Simple Prerequisite: Install Metamask.io Chrome Plugin. MetaMask \u201cis a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows access to dApps without running a full node. Users securely manage identity and transactions. Upon installing and starting MetaMask for the first time, the user is given a 12 word seed phrase to restore accounts created within MetaMask. Users can Switch Accounts or Add new accounts as well. Private keys are stored locally and encrypted; they never leave the application, and are never sent to a server. When the user performs an action in the browser that requires a transaction to be signed, it asks Web3 to send a transaction, which prompts MetaMask for confirmation; the user accepts. No synchronization with a ethereum network is required for a user because nodes are maintained by Infura, remotely.Metamask is not a HARD requirement; any Injectable Web3 provider that supports the personal_sign and personal_ecRecover methods, as well as an intuitive UX would do. We use these methods as opposed to the eth_sign and eth_ecRecover to prevent chosen cipher attacks.Workflow: 1) User adds a method of payment for Ether or ERC20 tokens with MetaMask installed and Account selected. 2) Website \u201cchallenges\u201d user with readable text as well as a random message in the visible text. User accepts to proceed signing. 3) Back-end server uses elliptic curve functions to send in the digital signature and recover the public address used by the signer. 4) A match of the recovered signature and the expected signature is all that is needed to verify the user is who they say they are. 5) Optionally store this digital signature as proof of acceptance for a EULA agreement. 6) Allow wallet info to be displayed on the UI of the dApp for sending tokens.Repercussions: Any site that offers eCommerce can offer Ether & ERC20 compliant tokens as a Method of Payment today. This technology will work no matter if you are a large multinational conglomerate, or if you are just a kid sitting at home dreaming up an idea for a decentralized platform to disrupt the online marketplace. This technique has extraordinary implications. You can can easily accept payments from around the world without a service like Paypal. You don\u2019t need a relationship with a bank. You don\u2019t need to store personal information about your customer. This is a new paradigm that flips ecommerce on its head, especially for the purchase of digital assets or IP.Demonstration: Here\u2019s how it looks in practice. The point of the project is to demonstrate how the majority of web applications in existence could start doing this now. The UI has not been styled; there is no point to waste time on that since each app will already have its own styling and branding. Any interaction that requires the user to be prompted to CANCEL or ACCEPT the fully transparent digital signature challenge, will rely on the use of the MetaMask browser extension.Open Source Example: https://github.com/emmonspired/erc20-digital-signature-verifyAuthentication / Verification Example*User Signs a Random Message that is displayed to the user. This message is hashed and then is digitally signed by a Web3 provider, like MetaMask. In the future this could be some other provider that implements personal_sign like a Ledger / Nano, or even signed using a third party site like MyEtherWallet.com*Example Code that takes the Digital Signature and extracts information from it in the Elliptic Curve personal_ecRecover function to undeniably verify a particular address signer.Wallet Injection in the\u00a0BrowserConnect to Web3Display Wallet / Account InformationAbility to Send ERC20 Tokens (Potential for improvement: instead of user specifying how many tokens to send, the application could present the user with an amount that fluctuates with the market value of ETH/USD or ETH/Token, or obviously a pegged price.Not Included: Room for improvement in the Demo Open Source CodeNode/Java backend; we simulate the verification step here with the click of a button, but it gets the overall point across and demonstrates the inputs/outputs required to verify.What to do to process payment on the backend, post blockchain transaction confirmation.Dependencies: Tech stack includes, but is not limited to:Truffle Framework, Truffle Boxes: LimelabsTech/limelabs-angular-boxAngular, SCSS, Typescript, Async/Await, Bootstrap3, AxiosWeb3js, EthJS, EthSigUtilThese dependencies provide a user-driven working example for understanding and developing the base of a Web3 enabled application for working with the truffle framework and Angular. It also provides a basic example for working with ERC20 compliant tokens. Screenshots below.Again, to give credit where it is due, several man-hours of research was poured over to come to this solution and standard for accepting payments while being able to verify them. I did not have to invent any of the following myself: ECDSA, MetaMask, EthJS, EthSigUtil, Angular, OpenZeppelin, and the many other open source projects that were relied upon to get here. I am just putting it all together in a demo in a user-friendly and developer-friendly package in hopes of sparking a decentralized payment fire and getting this in the hands of many developers.Dan Emmons February 7, 2018CBP | @emmonspired | LinkedIn ProfileSpecial thanks to Dan Finlay @danfinlay for all the work he has done sharing his work with the community, especially some of his examples that I incorporated into this Angular based solution.Special thanks to MetaMask @metamask for all the work Infura has done to bring Ethereum blockchain 1 step closer to feeling like Ethereum is a native part of the dApps browser experience for a user.Special thanks to Maxim Integrated for the massive amount of explanation and research provided regarding The Fundamentals of an ECDSA Authentication System.#1 Digital Signature Challenge Step#2 Verify\u00a0Step#3 Verified Signature Allows Tokens to be\u00a0Sent#4 User Accepts & Signs Transaction, Broadcasts to\u00a0Network#5 Etherscan\u00a0:\u00a0: Broadcasted Transaction Pending#6 Etherscan\u00a0:: shows Transaction included in\u00a0Block#7 UI Reports Transaction Successful#8 Metamask Shows Successful Payment#2B Alternate Demo: Digital Signature 1 Character Off Fails Verification#2C Alternate Demo: High Avalanche Effect - Hashed Message 1 Character Off", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to claim free tokens via\u00a0Metamask", "author_name": "Team Escrowblock", "link": "https://medium.com/@escrowblock/how-to-claim-free-tokens-via-metamask-6fcffd77bec8?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 7, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "40", "content": "How to claim free tokens via\u00a0MetamaskTeam EscrowblockBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 7, 2018Go to https://etherui.net/smartcontract/0x0c73260f143f198bd5f34a66487da5eb3bd2bcdcSelect Metamask from the top right corner and unlock this.

MetaMask enabled Ethereum users and developers to easily use ETH and ERC-20 tokens, and use DApps without needing to use command-line tools or run their own node (thanks to Infura).Aion realized this early on, which is why they had BlockX Labs build AIWA, a wallet and DApp interaction tool for Aion, for them. As Project Manager for AIWA, I\u2019d like to go over the process that we undertook when building \u201cMetaMask for Aion\u201d; specifically, both the inspiration as well as the differentiation. I\u2019ve written this for product people and executives so I\u2019ve kept the jargon quite light.Why do you need a\u00a0wallet?Firstly, you need to justify why your blockchain needs its version of MetaMask. As mentioned above, you want developers and users to interact with it. They need to read and write data and possibly send and receive cryptocurrency, If your blockchain is like Ethereum and Aion, you\u2019ve got a distributed app ecosystem that needs to interact with it.Without a wallet, it\u2019s a lot more difficult for both developers and users to use your blockchain, so reduce the friction and provide them with tool(s) to make it easier.What do you love about MetaMask?Since you\u2019ve got a reason to build a MetaMask-like tool, think about what you love about MetaMask and decide whether you want or need those features. At BlockX Labs, we like that MetaMask is honest with how it maps Ethereum\u2019s features to its UI. MetaMask doesn\u2019t hide or abstract away complexity but exposes it to the user. For example, it shows the raw gas price (in GWei) rather than abstracting it away by converting it to USD.It also differentiates between seed-generated and imported wallets, so that the user can know which wallets are recoverable from the seed phrase. We also love that MetaMask doesn\u2019t keep the user inside MetaMask; it provides links to Etherscan for viewing more transaction details and embeds the ability to use Coinbase and ShapeShift for acquiring Ether. It supports third-party services and doesn\u2019t try to hold the user captive by doing everything itself.Forget about MetaMask!Once you\u2019ve found the features that you love about MetaMask, it\u2019s time to forget about it. Here at BlockX Labs, we use Agile with Scrum. I recommend writing user stories to figure out what user and developers will do with your tool and build your UI around that.In our case, some of the basic features like the receive screen and how the DApp popped up ended up working pretty similarly to MetaMask. But by focusing on our user stories and not trying to clone MetaMask, we came up with a unique hierarchical interface that is modeled around the Token < Wallet < Vault metaphor.As a result, we came up with the idea of a Vault to contain both seed-generated wallets and imported wallets in a single exported file. This makes it super easy for users to backup all of their wallets regardless of whether they\u2019re seed-generated or imported from private keys. Of course, we also built the option to export individually using the standard wallet format as well.</end>Although it\u2019s heavily influenced from my experience building AIWA, hopefully this article has given a decent overview of building something like MetaMask for your own blockchain. I didn\u2019t mention some things that aren\u2019t part of the core product but help make it easier to use (like Infura, and NodeSmith in our case). But perhaps a follow-up article could address the ecosystem partners that would be useful.Have any suggestions on building Metamask for your own blockchain? We\u2019d love to hear them!

This means that MetaMask can now support loading ENS website (.eth) that are hosted on IPFS. When visiting decentralized sites, users can simply type in the domain name instead of long bytes of hashes. It is definitely a big step towards a better solution for easier access to the decentralized contents.This has been one of the efforts that Portal Network has been putting for more user adoption in entire blockchain ecosystem.We are glad that our contribution to MetaMask has been accepted for their newest update!How to install MetaMask?Visit MetaMask official website and click \u201cGET CHROME EXTENSION\u201d. It will then guide you to the Chrome Store where you can easily download the MetaMask extension.Introducing ENSENS compatibility is the main feature of this update. This implementation deals with the mapping between ENS and the decentralized resources address in an elegant way. Simply type a \u201c.eth\u201d URL and MetaMask will resolve ENS domains to IPFS hash and redirect the browser to the related content. Hosting sites on ENS and IPFS reduce the risk of hacking and phishing that comes out one after another.Sites on\u00a0IPFSDifferent Sites hosted on\u00a0IPFSWith the newest MetaMask installed, you can now view any IPFS sites listed here:http://portalnetwork.ethhttp://game.portalnetworkweb.ethhttp://phyrextsai.ethhttp://christophershen.ethhttp://dtube.portalnetworkweb.ethhttp://blockwatch.portalnetworkweb.ethThe ambition for ENS is very promising, and will play a fundamental role in shaping the Ethereum development as the platform becomes more mature.

Since rolling out our privacy-first metrics system last month, we\u2019ve learned that token transfers account for 45% of transactions initiated from within the extension (as opposed to those initiated by a dapp). Right now, this requires selecting a token from the left-side hamburger menu, then going through a \u201cSend\u201d flow specific to that asset. \u201cToken\u201d is also one of our most common keywords in support requests.To make this flow smoother and more discoverable, we now allow users to select the asset they\u2019d like to send right from the general-purpose \u201cEdit Transaction\u201d screen (#6445). Next time you want to transfer tokens, you can start just by clicking the \u201cSend\u201d button on the home screen. (And for the eager: support for sending & managing ERC 721 tokens is coming soon!)The new \u201cAsset\u201d field on Send\u00a0screensMetaMask Supports Goerli\u00a0\ud83d\udd78MetaMask now includes a network option for the new (ish) Goerli testnet. Goerli is a proof-of-authority network that aims to be a reliable piece of infrastructure for building and testing dapps on Ethereum (#6459).Incident Report\u00a0\u26a0\ufe0fLast week we began a slow roll-out of v6.4.0, which included many of the features & fixes detailed in the release notes below. In an effort to improve the legibility of our confirmation screens, 6.4.0 introduced a feature that would ping an external API (4byte.directory) to look up human-readable function names using a transaction\u2019s method signature. (We primarily rely on a Parity on-chain method registry, but nearly half of all transactions are contract interactions not found in the Parity registry. To any dapp devs reading: register your app\u2019s function names to help your users!)When we increased our rollout percentage to 100% on Thursday night, we brought down 4byte\u2019s API due to ineffective caching in the extension. Due to an overly long timeout period, this caused many users to encounter a minute-long spinner in place of the transaction confirmation they should have seen.For more detail on the issue, our response, and our learnings, you can read the incident post-mortem here.Foxes in the Community \ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0fMetaMask dev Jenny Pollack spoke about open source development this weekend at Recolor, a conference organized by she256 out of UC Berkeley. Check out this thread for a pull-quote overview of the day\u2019s panels. We are particularly proud of our former intern (and she256 co-founder) Sara Reynolds for her incredible work promoting diversity and representation in the blockchain space!Community manager Jason Lee also went on the record last week to describe some of the key decisions and principles behind MetaMask\u2019s growth over the past three years.

However, it can also replace a Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet address copied to the clipboard with one belonging to the attacker.\u201dMetaMask, which is one of the oldest Ethereum (ETH)-based DApps, has fallen victim to malicious schemes before.In July last year, Google developers pulled the app from Google Play altogether, leaving only fake impersonations. A subsequent report from MetaMask revealed the action had occurred by mistake.In November, MetaMask confirmed its plans to launch a mobile app, which ended up being the target of the latest malware issue.News Source\u00a0: CoinTelegraph", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Loslegen mit Ethereum Teil 2: MetaMask installieren, einrichten und\u00a0benutzen", "author_name": "Judith S.", "link": "https://medium.com/@judithESSS/loslegen-mit-ethereum-teil-2-metamask-installieren-einrichten-und-benutzen-b9a5025072?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 14, 2017", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "75", "content": "Loslegen mit Ethereum Teil 2: MetaMask installieren, einrichten und\u00a0benutzenJudith S.BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 14, 2017Es gibt mittlerweile eine recht umfangreiche Anzahl an Wallets, also digitalen Geldb\u00f6rsen, die man zum Empfangen, Speichern und Versenden von Ethereum auf Rechner und Smartphone nutzen kann. Wenn Du mit Deinem Rechner und einem Webbrowser wie z.B. Google Chrome, Brave oder Firefox im Web surfst, ist die MetaMask-Extension eine gute Variante, um auf speziellen Websites Transaktionen in der Blockchain zu initiieren. In Deinem Fall hei\u00dft das, Du verwendest die digitale W\u00e4hrung Ether, um eth-Subdomains, CryptoPunks, CryptoKitties oder DADA-Art zu nutzen. Auf der Website von MetaMask findest Du Links zu der Google Chrome Extension und auch zum Download des Browsers \u201eBrave\u201c, falls Du den lieber verwenden m\u00f6chtest. In beiden Varianten arbeitet MetaMask identisch.MetaMask WebsiteWie richte ich mir eine Wallet ein, komme an eine Ethereum-Adresse und benutze beides? So startest Du mit MetaMask.Auf der Website von MetaMask kannst Du ein kurzes Info-Video zur Funktionsweise von MetaMask anschauen (meine deutsche \u00dcbersetzung des Videos findest Du hier). F\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger l\u00e4sst es aber noch einige Fragen zur Installation und Benutzung offen. Wie Du MetaMask einrichtest und damit arbeitest, beschreibe ich kurz im Folgenden:Lade MetaMask im Google Chrome Web Store (in Chrome erreichbar unter chrome://apps/) herunter und installiere die Extension. MetaMask wird dann im Browser als kleines Fuchs-Symbol oben rechts neben Deiner Adresszeile angezeigt. Aber Vorsicht bei der Installation: Manchmal gibt es Anbieter, die an Deine ETH m\u00f6chten. Achte bitte darauf, dass Du das MetaMask installierst, das von https://metamask.io angeboten wird; ein Hinweis auf die korrekte Extension ist oft auch die Anzahl der Nutzer und die Anzahl der Bewertungen f\u00fcr das Produkt.Klicke auf das Fuchs-Icon, um mit dem Einrichten zu beginnen.1. Dir wird zun\u00e4chst eine \u201ePRIVACY NOTICE\u201c angezeigt, die Du durch Klicken auf \u201eAccept\u201c annehmen musst.MetaMask Privacy Notice\u00a0annehmen2. Darauf folgen die \u201eTERMS OF USE\u201c. Lies sie durch. Bist du damit einverstanden, scrolle bitte an das Ende und klicke auf \u201eAccept\u201c.MetaMask Terms of Use\u00a0annehmen3. Jetzt wird Dir ein Feld f\u00fcr das Passwort angezeigt. W\u00e4hle ein starkes Passwort aus. Es wird empfohlen, eines zu verwenden, das aus einer willk\u00fcrlichen Kombination aus Zahlen, Buchstaben und Sonderzeichen besteht und m\u00f6glichst lang ist. Schreibe Dir das Passwort auf, kontrolliere es und deponiere es an einem sicheren Ort. Du wirst es in Zukunft brauchen, um Dich in die MetaMask-Extension einzuloggen.MetaMask Passwort\u00a0setzen4. Nach der Passworterstellung kommst Du auf eine Seite, auf der Deine Seed Phrase angezeigt wird. Dieser Satz ist SEHR wichtig! Schreib ihn auf, am besten mehrfach, und deponiere ihn an unterschiedlichen Orten. Du ben\u00f6tigst diese Seed Phrase, um Deinen MetaMask-Account wiederherzustellen, solltest Du einen neuen Browser nutzen oder die Extension nach einer Deinstallation neu installieren wollen. Mit dem Button \u201eSAVE SEED WORDS AS FILE\u201c kannst Du Dir eine digitale Kopie des Satzes anlegen. Hast Du alles sicher gespeichert und deponiert, dr\u00fccke auf \u201eI\u2019VE COPIED IT SOMEWHERE SAFE\u201c.!! Wichtig! MetaMask hat weder Dein Passwort, noch Deine Seed Phrase. Sollte Du eines von beiden verlieren, kannst Du nicht mehr auf Deine Konten zugreifen!MetaMask Seed Phrase\u00a0sichern5. Nun wirst Du direkt in den Account 1, Deine erste MetaMask Ethereum-Adresse, geleitet. Sie findes Du unter dem Accountnamen, den Du \u00fcbrigens beliebig umbenennen kannst. Deine Adresse kannst Du Dir notieren, damit Du einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber Deine Konten beh\u00e4ltst. Wie Du sie einfach kopieren kannst, steht im folgenden Abschnitt (\u201eDetails zum Men\u00fc\u201c). Du solltest es vermeiden, Adressen per Hand abzuschreiben. Es k\u00f6nnen sich leicht Fehler einschleichen, und die notierte Adresse ist unbrauchbar, weil falsch.MetaMask Der erste\u00a0AccountDetails zum\u00a0Men\u00fcDu findest aber neben dem Accountnamen drei Punkte. Dort kannst Du mit einem Klick auf \u201eCopy Address to clipboard\u201c Deine Adresse in die Zwischenablage kopieren. Hast Du einen QR-Code reader, kannst Du Deine Adresse auch so kopieren oder weiter geben (siehe Men\u00fcpunkt \u201eShow QR Code\u201c).MetaMask Men\u00fcWenn Du Deine Kontobewegungen anschauen m\u00f6chtest, dann w\u00e4hle \u201eView account on Etherscan\u201c. Etherscan ist ein Service, der die Blockchain-Aktivit\u00e4ten anzeigt. Hier findest Du nicht nur Infos zu Deinen Transaktionen und Deinem Guthaben, sondern auch alle anderen Ethereum-Adressen, deren Transaktionen und Guthaben und noch einiges mehr. Auf Etherscan kannst Du also auf die Transaktionen beobachten, die Du mit Deinem Konto t\u00e4tigst und nachvollziehen, wann Du mit wem und unter Einsatz welchen ETH-Betrags was mit Deinem Konto gemacht hast.In dem kleinen Men\u00fc findest Du auch noch den Punkt \u201eExport Private Key\u201c. Das ist mit Vorsicht zu genie\u00dfen! Der Private Key wird gerne mit dem Hausschl\u00fcssel verglichen. Man bewahrt ihn sorgf\u00e4ltig und sicher auf und gibt ihn nicht\u200a\u2014\u200aNIEMALS\u200a\u2014\u200aweiter, erst recht nicht an Fremde. Niemand in der Krypto-Welt wird Dich nach Deinem Private Key fragen, au\u00dfer, er oder sie m\u00f6chte an Dein Geld. F\u00fcr Katzen, Punks und DADA-Kunst ben\u00f6tigst Du Deinen MetaMask Private Key nicht. Also greife erst auf ihn zu, wenn Du wei\u00dft, warum und was Du da tust.Die erste Transaktion durchf\u00fchrenHast Du Guthaben auf Deinem Konto, kannst Du Transaktionen durchf\u00fchren. Websites wie CryptoPunks, CryptoKitties und DADA.nyc haben Funktionen eingebaut, die Du nutzen kannst, sobald Du Dich in MetaMask eingeloggt und das richtige Konto ausgew\u00e4hlt hast. Eigentlich erkl\u00e4rt es sich von selbst, was Du wann tun musst. Kaufst Du z.B. einen CryptoPunk, klickst Du auf \u201eBuy\u201c, wartest, bis sich MetaMask \u00f6ffnet, kontrollierst den Kaufbetrag (\u201eAmount\u201c), das \u201eGas Limit\u201c (wird automatisch gesetzt) und den \u201eGas Price\u201c (wird automatisch gesetzt). Die Maximale Transaktionsgeb\u00fchrt (\u201eMax Transaction Fee\u201c) ist das Maximum, das f\u00fcr die Transaktion an Gas ausgegeben werden wird (meistens liegt die Geb\u00fchrt aber darunter). Unter \u201eMax Total\u201c siehst Du die Gesamtkosten Deiner Transaktion, die sich aus den eben aufgelisteten Posten ergibt.MetaMask Transaktion best\u00e4tigenKleine aber wichtige Anmerkung: Gas Limit und Gas Preis kann man manuell \u00e4ndern. Vor einigen Wochen noch konnte man f\u00fcr Transaktionen, die Zeit haben, einen niedrigen Gas-Preis von ca. 1\u20135 Gwei eingeben, f\u00fcr Transaktionen, die schnell best\u00e4tigt werden sollen entsprechend mehr, z.B. 10 bis 30 Gwei; das Gas Limit war mit 21000 gut gesetzt. Weil zurzeit jedoch sehr viele Transaktionen durchgef\u00fchrt werden, kann es sein, dass die Werte standardm\u00e4\u00dfig viel h\u00f6her eingestellt sind. Aktuell (Anfang Dezember) liegt er der Preis bei ca. 50 Gwei, das Limit variiert stark und kann dabei hoch ansteigen. Checke besser den Betrag unter \u201eMax Transaction Fee\u201c und \u201eMax Total\u201c und w\u00e4ge ab, ob Dir die Transaktion das angegebene Geld wert ist. Wird Dir in diesem Fenster eine Warnmeldung angezeigt, dann dr\u00fccke auf \u201eReject\u201c und versuche zu einem sp\u00e4teren Zeitpunkt, die Transaktion zu wiederholen.m M\u00f6chtest Du versuchen, Gas Limit und Gas Price selbst einzugeben, informiere Dich vorab auf z.B. ETH Gas Station nach den aktuellen Gaspreisen. Was genau Gaspreis und Gaslimit sind, kannst Du auf den Hilfeseiten von MyEtherWallet nachlesen.Dr\u00fcckst du nun auf \u201eSUBMIT\u201c, ist die Transaktion initiiert. Doch Vorsicht auch hier: Ist die Transaktion einmal auf den Weg gebracht, gibt es kein Zur\u00fcck (jedenfalls nicht f\u00fcr Einsteiger)! Man kann Transaktionen nicht stornieren oder nachtr\u00e4glich vom Kauf zur\u00fccktreten. Einmal angesto\u00dfen, nimmt die Sache ihren automatisierten Lauf! Wenn Du den Verlauf Deiner Transaktion verfolgen m\u00f6chtest, dr\u00fccke in MetaMask auf die Transaktion. Es \u00f6ffnet sich die entsprechende Seite auf Etherscan. Schau Dir das einmal in Ruhe an und lerne dabei, wie das alles funktioniert. Ist nicht ganz einfach, aber auch nicht wirklich schwer zu verstehen. \u00dcbrigens: Weil jede Blockchain-Transaktion selbst dann eine Geb\u00fchr (\u201eGas\u201c genannt) kostet, wenn man gar kein Geld verschickt oder wenn die Transaktion fehlschl\u00e4gt, ben\u00f6tigst Du f\u00fcr jede Art der Transaktion mit der Blockchain ein paar ETH. ETH hast Du m\u00f6glicherweise auf Deiner Ether Card bekommen.

I am a fan of the new update, especially the jazzed-up UI. It appears the MetaMask team is working hard to deliver a quality product for its users, which has one of the largest user base on the Ethereum network. As of This month (November) MetaMask reached 1.3 million users. That is an impressive feat for any decentralized project in this space.TL;DRWant to cancel an order on the Ethereum blockchainGet an error message that includes \u201cnonce too low\u201dGo to MetaMask desktop clientSwitch from Main Ethereum Network to Ropsten Test NetworkLet page reload, then switch back to Main Ethereum NetworkCancel orderWatch a short video hereWith the new update and the jazzed-up UI, there seems to also be errors that pop up more frequently. This is to be expected with any tech product in its infancy, especially within the ever so young crypto/blockchain space.The error that I got that initially halted my trading was \u201cnonce too low\u201d. There was actually a lot of other programming jargon, but that was the line that translated to me. As anyone in the tech space knows, when you run into an issue, you google it. I found myself on Medium, Stack Exchange and Reddit. To no avail, I could not fix the problem. I was in luck though.I am fortunate enough to work with a very talented team that is actively building on the Ethereum blockchain. I threw up a screenshot of the error message in our company Telegram. One dev, Dan Shapiro, was quick to suggest a solution. Ironically enough, that night I got the same error, successfully implemented the recommended solution, and was back to trading in no time.I think it is important for those of us that are active in the crypto/blockchain community to share solutions to roadblocks that we experience. This will ensure that the community will progress and grow. I hope you found this article helpful. Feel free to hit the claps a few times and subscribe to the Ethex blog.

We\u2019ve compiled a complete guide on how to participate here, but we thought we\u2019d make it easier and faster for you to buy your KCY tokens using MetaMask.MetaMask is more than just an Ether wallet, it is rather an Ethereum browser that allows you all the same functions, features and ease of access from regular Ethereum Wallets, and all without the need to download the blockchain or install any software. With MetaMask, you can just install it as a Google Chrome Extension, and you\u2019re good to purchase those tokens you\u2019ve been wanting to buy.Prerequisites:To follow this guide, you will need:A web browser.A certain amount of ether in the account that you control. Please notice, only ETH will be accepted for the KickCity Tokensale.Getting StartedIf you don\u2019t have a ERC20-compatible address to send from, or ether (ETH) to contribute, start from Step 1. Otherwise, go to Step 5.Step 1: Creating an\u00a0accountFirst type \u201cmetamask chrome extension\u201d in to Google, and click the link that begins with https://chrome.google.com. You will be taken to the install page, where you can click \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d.Now you will see the Metamask fox in your browser tab.Click it to open your wallet.You will be prompted to create a secure password for your Metamask account. Make sure that the Ethereum Main Net network is selected (on the top left corner).Step 3: Importing an\u00a0AccountIf you have a private key or JSON file for a wallet already, you can import that wallet in to Metamask. Simply click \u201c\u2263\u201d at the top right, choose \u201cImport Account\u201d.You will need to input your raw private key into the \u201cprivate\u201d key field, or the typical JSON keystore file. Otherwise, you can select Create Account to generate a new one.Step 4: Getting\u00a0EtherTo be able to participate in the ICO, you will need to have some ether (ETH) in an account that you control. You can buy ETH from different cryptocurrency exchanges or using this Telegram bot.Important Security RemindersDO NOT send ETH directly from an exchange, otherwise your tokens might never be recovered.There is no need to increase default gas price (or the value you are used to). Unless there is an unusual traffic in the Ethereum network, 30 GWEI should be enough to get the transaction confirmed in a few minutes.Step 5: Buying KickCity\u00a0TokensThe Tokensale is open until March 31, or whenever the supply of tokens reaches zero.Please ensure you are on our official and secure website. Our website address is: https://ico.kickcity.io and Tokensale address is https://tokensale.kickcity.io/.This is the main page of https://tokensale.kickcity.io/One last step is to add the token to your MetaMask, so you can see your balance. Click \u201cAdd Token\u201d, and paste in the following information:Address: 0x9d22c3bf2b51213a3572e865ecf78fab0294e75b\u00a0Decimals: 18Token Symbol: KCYAnd that\u2019s it!When your transaction has been mined and entered into the blockchain, you will be able to see it under \u201cTokens\u201d in your Metamask account.Thank you for participating in the KickCity Tokensale.

Many of these sitres are earning by selling the information we entered.Also some of these sites have a auto-subscribe feature so that if we don\u2019t want any notification still get a mail from these sites which is very irritating.The solution to all these problems is not giving them the email address and still being able to login\u00a0.And that is possible only through METAMASKPresent revolutionlogin using Facebook /google/ GitHubWhy is it preferred now a days?No more cumbersome form-filling.No need to remember yet another username/password pair.The whole process takes seconds instead of minutes.Problem With this\u00a0system-Since you are using these centralized sites to login it has all info and access about your activities on this site and is storing and may be abusing your data for wrong deeds\u00a0.Hence major concern of data privacy.Making these MNC\u2019s very-very powerful.Has to take permission from google and all etc hence slower.Mails and Newsletter from the site we logged in using google which creates a problem of spaming our Inbox and irritating sometimes.Solution-Login Using\u00a0MetaMaskWhat the Heck is MetaMask-MetaMask is a browser plugin, available as the MetaMask Chrome extension or Firefox Add-on. At its core, it serves as an Ethereum wallet: By installing it, you will get access to a unique Ethereum public address, with which you can start sending and receiving ether or tokens.But there is more to it\u00a0.It is also used to it\u00a0.It is a web3 injection to our chrome browser.You must be thinking it is something kind of blockchain tool with no utils to general public\u00a0.But the login method i am going to show u can be used for this toll.This will save your privacy and save u from the wanted website mails.Tech side of how it\u00a0works-You give a public address to using MetaMask accountThe back-end generates a random nonceUsing the nonce the the person digitally signed the site to enter (by clicking SIGN IN)Verification of signatureSecurity- prevent the user from logging in again with the same signature (in case it gets compromised), we make sure that the next time the same user wants to log in, she or he needs to sign a new nonce. This is achieved by generating another random nonce for this user and persisting it to the database.Note- all this is done by the general overview and most highly secure method of JWT token.How it\u00a0LooksWhy use MetaMask-Here\u2019s a list of arguments why this login flow is preferable over both email/password and social logins:Problems In The Present\u00a0System-Users need to have MetaMask installed: This login flow obviously doesn\u2019t work without MetaMask or a web3-enabled browser. If your audience is not interested in cryptocurrencies, there\u2019s a small chance they would even consider installing MetaMask. With the recent crypto-boom, let\u2019s hope we\u2019re heading towards a Web 3.0 internet.Some work needs to be done on the back end: As we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s quite straightforward to implement a simple version of this login flow. However, to integrate it into an existing complex system, it requires some changes in all areas that touch authentication: Signup, database, authentication routes, etc. This is especially true because each account will be associated with one or more public addresses.It doesn\u2019t work on mobile: This deserves its own section\u200a\u2014\u200aread on.Solved With Love By\u00a0MetaMaskIncreased security: Proof of ownership by public-key encryption is arguably more secure than proof of ownership by email/password or by a third party\u200a\u2014\u200aall the more so because MetaMask stores credentials locally on your computer, and not on online servers, which makes the attack surface smaller.Simplified UX: This is a one-click (okay, maybe two-click) login flow, done in a handful of seconds, without the need to type or remember any password.Increased privacy: No email needed, and no third party involved.Conclusion-While the blockchain may have its flaws and is still in an infant stage, I can\u2019t emphasize enough how this login flow could be implemented on any existing website today.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to participate in a test TGE XRT using Metamask and Etherscan?", "author_name": "Mariia Vasileva", "link": "https://blog.aira.life/how-to-participate-in-a-test-tge-xrt-using-metamask-and-etherscan-865febe71862?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 19, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "55", "content": "How to participate in a test TGE XRT using Metamask and Etherscan?Mariia VasilevaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 19, 2018Not long ago Sergey Lonshakov announced in Airalab blog the upcoming TGE (Token Generation Event). In my article, I want to share with you one unusual way to conduct Token Sale using Etherscan. Why unusual? Etherscan is one of the default interfaces available for free to communicate with contracts that everyone used to work with through Parity or MyEtherWallet. Recently, Etherscan got two new functions\u200a\u2014\u200areadContract and writeContract. These functions are especially interesting for those projects that do not yet have interfaces and dapp for conducting Token Sale. Usually in such cases Parity is used; Metamask is useless without a dapp, because with its help you can only send transactions. Let\u2019s move on to the guideline itself.The Guideline1. Open an auction contract on the Etherscan website2. Go to the writeContract tab:3. Connect Metamask. To do this, you should first unlock it. Then click \u201cConnect with Metamask\u201d:4. In the bid field indicate the amount in ETH that we want to transfer and the address to which we will receive the tokens. Click Write:5. A Metamask confirmation pop-up window will appear:6. Using \u201cView your transaction\u201d button you can check the status of the transaction:7. On the readContract tab you can see how much we transferred to the auction contract:? The difference in the amount sent and received is 2 times, because 2 transactions were sent from my account.8. To get XRT, after the end of the auction in the tab writeContract in the field claimTokens specify your address.? How to understand that the auction is over? In the contract on the readContract tab there are two properties endTime and finalPrice, now they are both equal to 0. When the TGE ends new values \u200b\u200bappear in them. And the auction itself will end when the planned amount of ETH is collected\u200a\u2014\u200athe ceiling property (in this case 40 ETH), and the totalReceived field shows the amount that has already been collected.Now you know how to use Etherscan for Token Sale\u00a0:)On the 21th of November visit our website robonomics.network, complete the survey and participate in the general public rehearsal of TGE XRT starting November, 28!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0cMetaMask [ 3\u00a0]", "author_name": "iCaptain", "link": "https://medium.com/@iCaptainArk/%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6-metamask-3-b5c8fb9b511a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 1, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "153", "content": "\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0cMetaMask [ 3\u00a0][ \u6559\u5b78 ]\u00a0\u65b0\u589e\u4ee3\u5e63iCaptainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 1, 2018", "responses": ""}, {"title": "A complete guide to using MetaMask (updated\u00a0version)", "author_name": "Publica.com", "link": "https://medium.com/publicaio/a-complete-guide-to-using-metamask-updated-version-cd0d6f8c338f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 22, 2018", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "55", "content": "A complete guide to using MetaMask (updated\u00a0version)Publica.comBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 22, 2018How to create a cryptocurrency wallet with MetaMask?If you are wondering how to create a new cryptocurrency wallet, consider creating one by installing the MetaMask extension.MetaMask is a free and secure browser extension that allows web applications to read and interact with the Ethereum blockchain.Step 1.

Hitting \u201cCREATE\u201d after that. Once you do, MetaMask will give you your Seed words, which will help you recover your address if you ever lose your password, computer or get another problem. Here you have two options, downloading the Seed words as a file or just agreeing you have saved them offline, like writing in a piece of paper that you can keep secure. We really recommend you doing the later since you\u2019ll be less susceptible to hacks.Now your MetaMask is created and you can access your ETH address by clicking on the three points and selecting \u201cCopy Address to clipboard\u201d. And this is a wallet you CAN use to contribute to Vyral.Step #2\u200a\u2014\u200aPurchasing SHARE tokens with MetaMaskPrior to purchasing SHARE tokens, you\u2019ll need to have ETH in your MetaMask\u2019s address. So, make sure you send it before the sale to your MetaMask ETH Address.Once you have ETH on your MetaMask Wallet and the purchase period has started, the first thing to do is go to https://contribute.vyral.network/. Now, unlock your MetaMask Wallet.Once your MetaMask Wallet is unlocked, let\u2019s proceed with the purchase. On Vyral\u2019s contribution page you\u2019ll see 5 boxes that need to be checked in order to continue with the process. Make sure you read and agree with all of them before hitting \u201cCONTINUE\u201d.Next step would be choosing MetaMask as your selected wallet to contribute. So, select MetaMask\u2019s icon and click on \u201cContinue To Contribute\u201d.After that you\u2019ll go to the actual purchase page. There you\u2019ll choose the amount of ETH you want to send. It can be ANY amount higher than 1 ETH, e.g. 1.2 ETH, 1.87 ETH, 10.889554 ETH, and so on. You\u2019ll also note another field, the \u201cReferral Vyral Key\u201d, in there you\u2019ll paste your referrer Vyral Key, which is also his/her ETH address. As you can see this is completely optional and if you do not have a referrer then leave it as it is. Once you\u2019ve set that, click \u201cPurchase\u201d.This will prompt your MetaMask to generate a transaction with the correct specifics. All you have to do now is click \u201cSUBMIT\u201d.After that the DAPP will take a moment while your transaction goes through the Blockchain. Once it does, it\u2019ll show your Vyral Link automatically.Congratulations! You\u2019ve successfully purchased your first amount of SHARE tokens. Now, go ahead and share your Vyral Link throughout your social media accounts and get a percentage of their purchase in tokens.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "A Cryptogamer\u2019s Comprehensive Guide to\u00a0MetaMask", "author_name": "Max Preusse", "link": "https://medium.com/the-notice-board/a-cryptogamers-comprehensive-guide-to-metamask-4d448cb1337c?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 28, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "13", "content": "A Cryptogamer\u2019s Comprehensive Guide to\u00a0MetaMaskWe explain what MetaMask is, and how to get started using it on\u00a0BitGuildMax PreusseBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 28, 2018Today, MetaMask has become a crucial tool in interfacing with any blockchain game, but using it for the first time can be a little daunting. By the end of this guide, you\u2019ll be well-versed in the art of making simple cryptocurrency transactions.What is MetaMask?Simply put, it\u2019s an interface through which you access your cryptocurrency wallet. It holds, sends, and receives \u201ctokens\u201d. Tokens take many forms, and there are a lot of technical details regarding different token types that we won\u2019t go into here. Suffice to know that tokens take the shape of two major things for you on BitGuild: Your currencies, and your items.You\u2019re about to get pretty familiar with this friendly fox\u00a0face.Getting StartedFirst, we\u2019ll tackle how to set up your MetaMask account and browser extension. If you\u2019ve already done this, feel free to skip to the next section.Step 1: Head over to MyEtherWallet.com (a.k.a MEW) to start the process of setting up your wallet. We recommend you read their disclaimer pop-ups carefully, in order to better understand and secure your wallet.Step 2: Select a password for your wallet. This password should be unique and complex, but most importantly: DO NOT LOSE IT. We can\u2019t help you recover your password, wallet, or other personal data, so write it down carefully, and keep it in more than one place. Better safe than sorry!Step 3: Once you\u2019ve selected a password and created your wallet, you will be prompted to save your keystore file. Click on the \u201cDownload Keystore File (UTC / JSON)\u201d button, save it, and then click \u201cI understand. Continue\u201d. This is also very sensitive data, so keep it in a safe place, preferably in more than one secure location (in case your computer crashes!)Step 4: Save your private key. Again, keep this in a safe place, as it can\u2019t be recovered if you lose it. We suggest keeping it in physical format, hidden away with your important documents.Step 5: Before you can use your new ETH wallet, you\u2019ll need to choose a way to access it. The only currently officially supported method to use your cryptocurrencies on BitGuild are via MetaMask.Now that you\u2019re all set up with a wallet ready to go, the first thing you\u2019ll need to do is load it up with some ETH. You can buy ETH from any reputable source of your choosing\u200a\u2014\u200ahere\u2019s a highly detailed guide for this process.The final step is to add an identifier for PLAT to your wallet. PLAT is the official BitGuild currency, and is necessary in order to play games on the BitGuild Portal. To enable MetaMask to identify PLAT in your wallet, follow these steps:1: Access your wallet by clicking on the MetaMask icon in your browser.2: Click on ADD TOKEN under the Tokens tab.3: Enter the following information in the corresponding boxes, then click ADD.Token Contract Address: 0x4118d7f757ad5893b8fa2f95e067994e1f531371Token Symbol: PLATDecimals of Precision: 18That\u2019s it! Your PLAT should now be displaying in your wallet.Once you\u2019ve registered on the BitGuild Portal, MetaMask takes a backseat to the action. Your items will be viewable through the website, and you\u2019re free to browse the portal, chat with users, and play as many games as you please. As soon as you initiate any transaction, be it in-game or by buying PLAT directly from the BitGuild website, you\u2019ll see a Metamask window pop up, prompting you to confirm the transaction.There are a few elements to these transactions, and we\u2019re going to detail them for you here. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not as complex as it looks. Because of the nature of the ethereum blockchain, all transactions require a fee, commonly known as gas, or gwei.The ethereum blockchain is a shared resource, and as such, transaction fees can vary based on network load. These fees are always small, averaging around 0.46 USD at the time of writing. MetaMask will suggest a gas price based on current network success rates. Should your transaction fail, simply raise the gas price slightly and try again, or wait until later when peak load times might have died down. You can learn more about the blockchain in this post.You are now armed with the knowledge and tools to venture forth and start exploring the world of cryptogaming.

Building Atomic Bazaar, we sought a better way to handle rejections. Some research produced a viable but hacky solution: string matching error messages.Later, Dan Finlay endorsed the string matching approach:This snippet works in Chrome:web3.eth.sendTransaction({...}, function(error, result) {  if (error.message.includes(\"User denied transaction signature\")) {    // handle the \"error\" as a rejection  }})But your mobile users won\u2019t get any benefit from that check.

Users can now create a smart contract based Nuo account with Metamask or a Web3 Wallet without the need for a password. Before this upgrade, users could only create an account with password and later connect Metamask or Web3 Wallet. See how it worksNew Signup with\u00a0MetamaskWith this upgrade, we have completely eliminated the need for using a password on the platform and users can use the platform entirely with Metamask or Web3 Wallets (Trust, imToken etc). You can signup, login, transfer funds or create a loan, trade and reserve, all from the comfort of Metamask or your Web3 Wallet.Signup ProcessIf you are a new user comfortable using web3 applications, you can create an account on Nuo by clicking \u2018Signup\u2019 and \u2018Continue with Metamask\u2019.You would be paying gas cost for creating a smart contract based Nuo account and would need to sign a transaction and agree to our \u2018Terms of Service\u2019 and \u2018Privacy Policy\u2019.Once you sign this transaction, you need to create a username on the platform and enter your email address (optional).Your Nuo account creation process will be completed once your signed transaction is confirmed onchain. You can check the status of your Nuo account by clicking \u2018Check Now\u2019If the signed transaction fails, you would see an option to recreate the account by signing another transaction.Password SignupIf you aren\u2019t comfortable using Metamask or a Web3 Wallet, you can still signup on Nuo with password. Your Nuo account will be a smart contract owned by a private key which is encrypted with your hashed password. While signing a transaction, this private key is decrypted on the client side with your password. Please note: losing or forgetting this password can result in permanent loss of funds due to non-custodial nature of the platform.Signup with Metamask vs Signup with\u00a0PasswordSignup with Metamask vs Signup with\u00a0PasswordUsers signing up with Metamask or Web3 Wallet will pay gas cost for Nuo account creation, while account creation using password is completely free.Users signing up with Metamask or Web3 Wallet will have a permanent account on signup completion, while users signing up with password will have a temporary account which will become permanent, once you transfer some funds to this account.Users signing up with Metamask or Web3 Wallet will not be able to add password authentication to their account, while users signing up with password can connect Metamask or Web3 Wallet to their account.Users signing up with Metamask or Web3 Wallet will not be able to use Nuo across devices or platforms and would be restricted by their Web3 Wallet portability, while users signing up with password will be able to access Nuo from any device or platform by using password authentication.Signup with Metamask or Web3 Wallet is an important feature to give users complete control over their funds on the platform without using hashed password and encrypted private keys. Our goal has always been to create an easy to use product for all users without compromising on the ethos of the Ethereum community.We believe this product is now completely aligned with the community ethos and paves a way for onboarding users who are new to Web3. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our community for their feedback on this product feature and constant support throughout our journey. We build and strive hard for you.PS: If you are an early user who has already signed up with password, you can still login with a connected wallet. You can also create a new account with this feature and can access multiple accounts with the same Metamask or Web3 wallet.Multiple users connected to same Metamask\u00a0Wallet", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to create an Ethereum wallet using the Metamask Chrome extension", "author_name": "Kris Bennett", "link": "https://medium.com/@kbennett2000_46495/how-to-create-an-ethereum-wallet-using-the-metamask-chrome-extension-78c210ea735b?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 25, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "72", "content": "How to create an Ethereum wallet using the Metamask Chrome extensionKris BennettBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 25, 2018Creating an wallet for ETH or other ERC20 tokens is easy using the metamask chrome extension.

The tools make big assumptions about your technical knowledge and strange errors abound. What we want to do with this post is go step-by-step for anybody who wants to invest in ZetoChain but doesn\u2019t know how.MetaMaskThe tool we will use is MetaMask. This is a program linked to your browser that offers a clean, basic interface for your Ethereum wallet. You can send Ether and check token balances also. If you\u2019re completely new to Ethereum, this is the best tool to use because it is the simplest.Creating Your\u00a0AccountBefore you can even purchase Ether, you need to create your MetaMask wallet. Install MetaMask using the instructions on their website. Alternatively, install the Chrome or Firefox extension directly (it\u2019s not available for Safari, Internet Explorer or Edge).Once installed, click the MetaMask fox icon to configure it:Enter a strong\u00a0passwordOnce you\u2019ve copied the seed phrase, click \u201cI\u2019ve copied it somewhere safe\u201dThis is the main interfaceYou can copy the wallet address from the\u00a0menuBuying EtherNow, you\u2019ll need some ether. Exchanges are the most common method to get Ether into your wallet: Changelly, Gemini and Kraken are some popular sites. We recommend Coinbase\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s simple and supports buying Ether with either credit/debit cards or SEPA bank transfers. It\u2019s an involved process registering and purchasing Ether with an exchange so take your time. Once you are done, you can transfer the Ether you purchase to the wallet address MetaMask gives you.Important: you must transfer purchased ether to the MetaMask wallet address. We do not support exchange walletsAt this point, you have some Ether waiting to be spent. Now you need to get whitelisted for ZetoTokens.WhitelistingWe use a Know-Your-Customer process to validate everybody purchasing ZetoToken. This is just a formality but it can take up to 24 hours to process. We already have a post explaining how to do this so check it out.Buying ZetoTokensOnce you\u2019re received the whitelist confirmation email, it\u2019s time to get those tokens. You will need the contract address from the ZetoChain website. Open MetaMask and follow these steps:Click the Send\u00a0buttonEnter the contract address from the ZetoChain website, select the total amount of Ether to send and click\u00a0NextEnter a gas limit of 140000 and click\u00a0SubmitTransaction is in progress. Be patient, this can take a\u00a0while.Success! The transaction is complete.You\u2019ve sent your Ether successfully! But where are your tokens? You need to view the balance at the token address of 0xec9eb73cdbe82b5d60144e6034741a167922acea.MetaMask supports this too:Open the Tokens tab and click Add\u00a0TokenEnter the token address (MetaMask autofills the other fields) and click\u00a0AddYou can now see your token\u00a0countThat\u2019s it! A couple of simple recommendations:Always copy and paste addresses, never try to type them by handWrite down the seed phrase MetaMask gives you on a piece of paper and keep it safe. This is the safest option that costs no money. Don\u2019t lose it though!Send a small amount of Ether first to check you\u2019ve done the right thingAll going well, you are now the proud owner of some ZetoTokens. Do you want to buy some more now? \ud83d\ude09Next time round, we\u2019ll explain the purchasing process with MyEtherWallet, another popular tool for the Ethereum network.

Click \u201cAdd\u201d, and you will be able to see your HUM tokens added to your MetaMask Token tab.This is how you send Ethereum to participate in Pre-sale and check your received HUM tokens.If you have any inquiries, reach us at support@humanscape.ioThank you.Get to know us better!Join our official channels below.Telegram(EN)\u00a0: t.me/HumanscapeKakaoTalk(KR)\u00a0: open.kakao.com/o/gqbUQEMWebsite\u00a0: humanscape.ioMedium\u00a0: medium.com/humanscape-icoFacebook\u00a0: www.facebook.com/humanscapeTwitter\u00a0: twitter.com/Humanscape_ICOReddit\u00a0: https://www.reddit.com/r/Humanscape_officialBitcointalk announcement\u00a0: https://bit.ly/2rVsP4TEmail\u00a0: support@humanscape.io", "responses": ""}, {"title": "What You Should Know About MetaMask\u2019s Privacy\u00a0Policy", "author_name": "Crypto Tips", "link": "https://medium.com/@blockchainchick/what-you-should-know-about-metamasks-privacy-policy-d1fb25c67773?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 6, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "48", "content": "What You Should Know About MetaMask\u2019s Privacy\u00a0Policy(And All ETH In-Browser Wallets)Crypto TipsBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 6, 2018I think it\u2019s time for another friendly reminder to be aware of what you\u2019re doing when your dealing with cryptocurrency.Today I\u2019m focusing on Metamask and their privacy policy.I know that I\u2019ve made a few videos that show how to use this wallet and how it can be awfully convenient compared to other wallet options. But as with many other things in life, convenience often brings a sacrifice to security.I know we\u2019ve all had that experience of wanting to use a new software or update our phones and computers and we\u2019re presented a page that represents that company\u2019s terms of service and privacy policy. Of course these papers read like a dry legal document and that\u2019s because they are.If you\u2019ve ever just clicked the \u201cagree\u201d box just to get going with the process without reading it you are certainly not the only one. But don\u2019t you ever wonder what it is exactly that you\u2019re agreeing to?In the case of Metamask their privacy policy is available for anyone to read.It\u2019s actually not that long or difficult to get through and it\u2019s implications can have an impact on your experience using their wallet.Here\u2019s what I\u2019m talking\u00a0about:Their privacy policy is worded in a way that seems to give them some wiggle room. For example, when it states that \u201cThe personal information we collect from you generally may include:\u201d(and it goes on to list:)\u201cNetwork information regarding transactions\u201d\u201cWe become aware of the first public key created by virtue of the system design\u2026\u201d\u201cWe may receive network information from you as a result of your interaction with our Service.\u201d\u201cOur service requires the highest level of browser permissions that could potentially lead to procurement of more personal information\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Any identifying information collected via Google Analytics is controlled by Google.\u201dThe preceding paragraph explains that the initial public key created is made aware to them because that\u2019s how their system is designed and that all public keys thereafter are anonymous.However, not only are they \u201caware\u201d of the initial public key that you produce on their plug in, they also store it.They also explain that your interaction with their service may result in their servers receiving information like your IP addresses and possibly more.Also since this plug in has \u201cfull browser permissions\u201d this may also lead to them receiving personal information about you. They say that these permissions are for \u201cextremely limited technical purposes\u201d yet go on to vaguely explain that they don\u2019t obtain anything beyond what is necessary, without detailing what it is that is necessary.The privacy policy also states that your information will be shared with their affiliates or any third party that is required for the provision of the \u201cService\u201dAlso, as I stated earlier, the policy reiterates that MetaMask uses Google analytics and for that purpose, any identifying information that is collected by Google Analytics is then controlled by Google.The next paragraph explains all of the scenarios where they will disclose your information.When it comes to securing your information that they\u2019ve collected, that section is a bit thin and explains that they store the personal information on limited access or encrypted computer systems.Now if you\u2019re wondering if these security measures are sufficient, there has been instances where some users\u2019 information, for whatever reason has been compromised. They were required to download a new web browser and create a new MetaMask account and transfer their funds into that new account.This all means that they do indeed collect your data, maybe not all of it, but it\u2019s data that could leave you vulnerable or exposed to outside third\u00a0parties.Granted, I can\u2019t tell exactly how many others have had this same experience or how drastic this security breach was for their network, but regardless, it\u2019s something to be aware of when considering if this service is worth it to you.Again, I myself have used Metamask in the past, and this post certainly isn\u2019t meant to be FUD in any\u00a0way.I think it\u2019s important to be educated when making decisions, especially when it involves your crypto investments.While we\u2019re on the subject of using of in-browser wallets, there\u2019s another thing I think we should all be aware of that also involves the sharing of your\u00a0data.Did you know that if you use any type of Ethereum based in-browser web wallet you could be sharing the fact that you use Ethereum with nearly every website that you\u00a0visit?This doesn\u2019t mean they can steal your crypto without you knowing, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d get a confirmation notification at least.But this does mean that you could be put on a hackers radar if they know you\u2019ve got an investment in crypto.To MetaMask\u2019s credit they are making efforts to address these security\u00a0issues.You can check out their GitHub to see their progress.It\u2019s also important to note that this is still very much a new application that is still working out it\u2019s kinks.This is also the case for many crypto wallets, not just those that are based on your web\u00a0browser.You are ultimately assuming the risk when you choose to store your cryptos. It\u2019s very much worth it to take your time and educate yourself on the status of any wallet you want to use and how the team behind it is addressing its issues.Additional Reading/Sources:MetaMask

The\u00a0BasicsClaire RoyleBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 19, 2018So you want to get into crypto. Well first, you\u2019re going to need a cryptocurrency wallet.What is a crypto wallet, you may ask? Well, simply put, it\u2019s an online wallet that securely stores all your crypto. There are also hardware wallets available but this post will be focusing on one of the simpler online wallets\u200a\u2014\u200aMetaMask.Basically, there are two parts to a wallet. The public key, which is how people can send you crypto, and the private key, which is paired to your public key and is how you access your crypto, so be sure to keep this key private to only you! There is no need to write your private key down or ever share it with anybody (unless you are storing your private keys in a safety deposit box).MetaMask is the wallet I use, and let\u2019s be real, i\u2019m not the most computer savvy person out there. Yet somehow even I managed to figure it out, so I\u2019m confident that you will too.Let\u2019s get started!First, MetaMask is a Chrome extension, so you will first need to download the Chrome browser. You can do that here. (There are other extensions such as for Opera Browser but Chrome is the most popular and will be used in this example)After downloading Chrome, you will need to open a new page. Sometimes you will need to restart your computer to complete the download.Next, you will need to add MetaMask to your Chrome bar, which can be done here.Once you are at the Chrome store, in the Chrome browser, click \u201cadd to Chrome\u201d.\u200b\u200bA small window will pop up on your screen. Click \u201cadd extension\u201d.\u200bOnce you\u2019ve completed this step you will be redirected to a MetaMask intro video. After watching the video, click the MetaMask icon in your toolbar (circled in red in the picture below). Read the Privacy Notice and the Terms of Use clicking \u201cAccept\u201d after each.\u200b\u200bNow create your password to encrypt your new DEN. Passwords consisting of letters, numbers, and symbols are most secure.\u200b\u200bThe next screen will show your 12 seed words. With these, you will be able to restore your MetaMask account. Be sure to write these down and keep them somewhere safe.\u200b\u200bOnce you\u2019ve saved your seed words you are all set. Click \u201cI\u2019ve copied it somewhere safe\u201d to see your new wallet. From here you can buy and send tokens as well as add other wallets to your MetaMask account for easy access to all your cryptocurrencies!\u200b*Note, MetaMask is in Beta for an updated platform, so your MetaMask may look slightly different from the pictures above. Don\u2019t worry though, all the actions are still the same!And there you have it. Your new MetaMask account is all set up!But what good is a wallet without crypto to fill it?Sending and Receiving Ether (or any other ERC-20 Token)As you can see from the above picture, I dont have any ETH. This makes me sad, so I\u2019m going to ask a friend to send me some.In order for anyone to send you crypto, they will need youR PUBLIC KEY.To access this, first click the \u2018Details\u2019 button under your account,then highlight and copy your PUBLIC KEY to your clipboard. Sent this PUBLIC KEY to whoever will be sending you crypto:After sharing my public key with a friend, she was able to send me\u00a0.005 ETH.Now I have a balance, I can send ETH to any PUBLIC KEY.To do so, click \u2018Send in the top right corner. You will then be prompted to enter the PUBLIC KEY of where you are sending the crypto:Remember, every transaction on the blockchain requires gas (ETH) so the amount you send will be less than your current balance, even if you opt to send your entire balance. Once you have entered the details, click \u2018Next.\u2019You can check the details on the next screen, the click the blue \u2018Confirm\u2019 button.You will then be taken back to your main page where you will see that the transaction has been submitted. Once the transaction goes through, the page will look like this:Clicking on the transaction will take you to the transaction page on Etherscan.And it\u2019s as simple as that!For the latest updates and more information, follow MetaMask on Twitter.And remember\u2026.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How import a wallet to your MetaMask\u00a0account?", "author_name": "Publica.com", "link": "https://medium.com/publicaio/how-import-a-wallet-to-your-metamask-account-dcaba25e558d?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 31, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "34", "content": "How import a wallet to your MetaMask\u00a0account?Publica.comBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 31, 2018In order to import an existing wallet to a MetaMask account, follow these simple step-by-step instructions.

EtherDelta, ForkDelta and Cryptokittens are all dApps.Traditionally, in order to interact with Ethereum dApps, you would have to set up a full Ethereum node on your PC\u200a\u2014\u200aa daunting task even for technologically savvy users. However, Metamask simplifies this by allowing you to interact with Ethereum dApps directly in your browser, without the need of such a complicated set-up.But there is more to MetaMask in that it also functions as a more secure \u2018hot\u2019 wallet for Ether (for an explanation, see our beginner\u2019s guide to staying safe in the world of crypto). The extra security is down to MetaMask encrypting your private keys with a password of your choice.We always advise using cold storage, but in the case of a decentralised exchange like EtherDelta, MetaMask provides you with an excellent, secure and convenient alternative way to use the exchange. Just make sure that your MetaMask wallet only holds a number of tokens/Ether that you will actively use\u200a\u2014\u200aplus enough for gas, of course.Installing the MetaMask extensionSo now that we now why you should use MetaMask, let\u2019s get around to installing it. MetaMask is a browser extension currently supported on all 3 major browsers (Chrome, FireFox, Opera) and also on a new up-and-coming browser called Brave.The safest way to get the MetaMask extension is by visiting their homepage and following the links provided. The best practice would be to also check the comments and reviews in order to make sure that you are downloading the real app, and not a fake version.Always make sure that you download the real\u00a0appAfter installing MetaMask, you will need to set up a new identity/wallet by clicking on the MetaMask logo (the little orange fox) in your app bar. This will start up MetaMask.After reading through and accepting the terms and conditions, you will be prompted to create a new password to encrypt your account.Be sure to use a strong password.Once completed, you will be given the seed words for your new account. Make sure to write these down in a safe place as it is the only way to restore lost MetaMask accounts.You are now set up to use MetaMask with the ever-growing list of dApps!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "\u5b89\u88ddMetamask\u548c\u5c0e\u5165\u9322\u5305", "author_name": "heidi ho", "link": "https://medium.com/joyso/%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%9Dmetamask%E5%92%8C%E5%B0%8E%E5%85%A5%E9%8C%A2%E5%8C%85-3d411248d11f?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 9, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "16", "content": "\u5b89\u88ddMetamask\u548c\u5c0e\u5165\u9322\u5305heidi hoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 9, 2018\u9032\u5165\u6b64\u7db2\u5740\u5b89\u88dd Metamask \u63d2\u4ef6\u5230Chrome\uff1ahttps://goo.gl/LJxH6z----\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ede\u9078 Create Account \u65b0\u5efa\u4e00\u500b Metamask \u9322\u5305\uff0c\u6216\u662f\u9ede\u9078 Import Account \u5c0e\u5165\u4f60\u672c\u4f86\u7684 ETH \u9322\u5305\uff08\u5982 MyEtherWallet\u3001Imtoken\uff09\u3002-------\u82e5\u4f60\u9078\u64c7 Import \u4f60\u672c\u4f86\u7684 ETH \u9322\u5305\uff0c\u5247\u9700\u8981\u8f38\u5165\u8a72\u9322\u5305\u7684\u79c1\u9470\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e36\u51fa\u9322\u5305\u3002--------Metamask \u57fa\u672c\u529f\u80fd\u4ecb\u7d39\uff1a1\u3001\u66f4\u6539\u9322\u5305\u540d\u7a31\uff1a\u9ede\u9078 Edit \uff0c\u66f4\u6539\u8a72\u9322\u5305\u540d\u7a31\uff0c\u6211\u53d6\u540dH01\u30022\u3001Oxc099D\u2026\u70ba\u4f60\u7684\u9322\u5305\u5730\u57403\u30010.005669 ETH \u70ba\u4f60\u9322\u5305\u4e2d\u7684 ETH \u91d1\u984d\u3002\u4e0b\u65b9\u76844.28 USD\u70ba\u4f60\u7684 ETH \u76ee\u524d\u7b49\u503c\u7684\u7f8e\u91d1\u91d1\u984d\u30024\u3001SENT\uff1a\u6703\u986f\u793a\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528 Metamask \u9322\u5305\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u7d00\u9304\u3002\uff08\u82e5\u4f60\u662f Import \u5176\u4ed6\u9322\u5305\u5247\u4e0d\u6703\u986f\u793a\u7d00\u9304\uff09-TOKENS\uff1a\u6703\u986f\u793a\u4f60\u540d\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u5e63\u540d\u7a31\u53ca\u6578\u91cf\u3002\u4f46\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u9ede\u9078ADD TOKEN \u4f86\u986f\u793a\u4f60\u540d\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u5e63\u3002------\u8cbc\u4e0a\u4ee3\u5e63\u5408\u7d04\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u4e0b\u9762\u7684Token Symbol \uff08\u4ee3\u5e63\u7a2e\u985e\uff09\u548c Decimals of Precision\uff08\u5c0f\u6578\u9ede\u5f8c\u5e7e\u4f4d\uff09\u6703\u81ea\u52d5\u5e36\u51fa\uff0c\u4e4b\u5f8c\u8acb\u9ede\u9078 ADD\u3002JOYSO \u5408\u7d04\u5730\u5740\uff1a0xDDe12a12A6f67156e0DA672be05c374e1B0a3e57-----\u756b\u9762\u6703\u986f\u793a\u4f60\u6240\u6301\u6709\u7684\u8a72\u4ee3\u5e63\u6578\u91cf\u3002--------\u9ede\u9078 [\u2026]---------\u5247\u6703\u8df3\u51fa\u6b64\u9ed1\u8272\u8996\u7a97\uff0c\u900f\u904e Etherscan \u770b\u4f60\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u7d00\u9304\u986f\u793a\u4f60\u9322\u5305\u5730\u5740\u7684 QR Code\u8907\u88fd\u4f60\u7684\u9322\u5305\u5730\u5740\u5c0e\u51fa\u4f60\u8a72\u9322\u5305\u7684\u79c1\u9470---JOYSO\u5b98\u7db2\uff1a https://joyso.io/zh_TW/\u00a0Telegram \uff1a https://t.me/joyso_io_zhFacebook \uff1ahttps://www.facebook.com/Joyso.io", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Matryx Platform: How to install MetaMask + attach to our ETH PrivateChain", "author_name": "Sam Hessenauer", "link": "https://blog.matryx.ai/matryx-platform-how-to-install-metamask-attach-to-our-eth-privatechain-6107ab9b6604?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 6, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "52", "content": "Matryx Platform: How to install MetaMask + attach to our ETH PrivateChainSam HessenauerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 6, 2018MetaMask Fox image from the awesome team at MetaMask.ioTackle Science\u2019s Greatest Challenges with\u00a0VR and Blockchain-based CollaborationAnnouncing the Matryx release for Q1 2018 includes our new WebUI interface which uses MetaMask for private key handling.This will get you up and running with our platform!MetaMaskGo to the MetaMask site and download their Google Chrome ExtensionMetaMaskMetaMask - brings Ethereum to your browser.metamask.ioClick on Add extension when prompted to add MetaMask to Chrome.

Using MetaMask, you can access and interact with Ethereum-based dApps from your browser. For example, you can transfer your cryptocurrencies between an exchange and your wallet on the browser. For now, it is available on Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.A Step-by-Step Guide for the Beginner.1. Install MetaMask ExtensionIn order to use it, you need to search MetaMask extension in the chrome web store and add it to your chrome browser.2. Access MetaMask Extension and Accept the Terms of\u00a0UseClick the MetaMask extension icon upper right on your browser to access it. You will see the privacy notice when you access to MetaMask extension. The important notice that MetaMask mentioned is that you should not stay signed into MetaMask unless you need to use it. Because your MetaMask account will remain active on every website you visited until you sign out. Accept MateMask\u2019s Terms of Use to continue.MetaMask\u2019s Terms of\u00a0Use3. Create\u00a0PasswordCreate a password for your MetaMask account. In order to protect your account carefully, you can make this password different from other passwords you used. Besides, you can make your password in a mix of characters, numbers, and symbols.4. Save the Backup Seed\u00a0PhraseCopy the backup seed phrase for your account. When you restore your MetaMask account, you must have the backup seed phrase to restore it. If you don\u2019t enter the backup seed phrase accurately, you may lose all cryptocurrencies stored on your MetaMask accounts. Besides, you must save your backup seed phrase in a device without internet to prevent it from hacking.User Interface Introduction:Account OverviewThe MetaMask account page displays your account name, buttons to manage your settings/accounts, buttons to buy and send Ethereum, and tabs for outgoing transactions and token balances.Edit Account Name and Create New\u00a0OneYou can have several accounts in the MetaMask. You can have a new one by creating the name of an account. Select edit which is just above the account name.Go to Account\u00a0OptionsThere are 4 primary account options.1. View Account on the Ethersacn: View your account address on Etherscan, which can see your accounts\u2019 history of the transactions.2. Show QR Code: Show the QR code of your account address, which is an easy way to send Ethereum and tokens from mobile wallets.3. Copy Address to Clipboard: Copy your account address to clipboard, which is an easy way to send Ethereum and tokens from cryptocurrency exchanges.4. Export Private Key: You can export your private key.Go to\u00a0SettingThe icon upper right of the account includes 4 primary options. There are settings, log out, info/help and try Beta.Set Account\u00a0DetailsIn the account setting, you can reveal backup seed phrase if you lose previous one.Three Ways to Buy\u00a0Ethereum1. Buy Ethereum with Fiat\u00a0MoneyYou can purchase Ethereum with fiat money and have it deposited to your MetaMask account through a Coinbase account.2. Buy Ethereum with ShapeshiftTo buy with Shapeshift, choose which cryptocurrency you want to Shapeshift to convert into Ethereum and deposit into your MetaMask account. You can choose any cryptocurrency you have. In this case, we choose BTC for this guide.Buy with Shapeshift and\u00a0DepositDeposit your BTC (or any cryptocurrency you chose) to the deposit address provided by MetaMask and Shapeshift. After your deposit is completed, Shapeshift will convert it to Ethereum and deposit that Ethereum to your account.3. Buy Ethereum with\u00a0CoinbaseYou can also buy Ethereum and have it deposited into your MetaMask account with your Coinbase account. Your browser will open a web page with the below widget.(1) Enter your\u00a0emailEnter the amount of Ethereum you want in your account, enter your email, and select continue.(2) Coinbase\u00a0PasswordEnter your Coinbase password to continue.(3) Coinbase VerificationEnter your Coinbase two-factor verification code send to your cell phone to continue.(4) Enter Coinbase\u00a0PaymentEnter the payment method for buying your Ethereum.(5) Coinbase Confirm PurchaseReview the Coinbase transaction to buy Ethereum and deposited it to your account. Enter the green button to complete the transaction.Two Ways to Despoit\u00a0Ethereum1. Despoit Ethereum with\u00a0QRcodeIn addition to buying Ethereum, you can deposit Ethereum you already own into your account. There are two ways to deposit.

In this second part, we explore secure remote access to this Ethereum node via MetaMask.We also cover how to make everything survive crashes and shutdowns.Setting up an SSH\u00a0tunnelSetting up a what? This is the confusing process I mentioned earlier. I won\u2019t go into details here, but in effect, it allows requests made to your local machine to be forwarded automatically to another machine, in this case the VPS running your geth node. It'll become clear why we need this when we set up MetaMask later.Obtaining the IP address of your\u00a0VPSIn order to forward requests to your VPS you\u2019ll need to know its IP address. This is determined by returning to your Linode dashboard and going to the Linodes tab on the left. You should see your node\u2019s IP address on the right, just below the geographic location of your VPS. It looks something like this: 172.16.389.54. Make a note of that IP; we'll be using it shortly.SSH on\u00a0WindowsAs of the April 2018 update, Windows 10 has OpenSSH installed by default. This provides ssh.exe as well as several other SSH utilities. To check the state of SSH on Windows at the time of writing I downloaded the latest Windows 10 ISO and installed it into a virtual machine. OpenSSH was already installed and available from cmd.exe. If you have Windows 10 but OpenSSH is not installed, follow the instructions in this Microsoft article. If you have an older version of Windows there are several utilities available that will provide SSH capabilities.Initiating the\u00a0tunnelWe\u2019re going from here with the assumption that you have command-line access to an ssh client. The following command sets up the SSH tunnel. This command is identical on all three platforms.ssh -N -v user@172.16.389.54 -L 8545:localhost:8545The -N switch tells ssh not to execute a remote command. We want a continuous connection, or tunnel, to our node. There's no command to execute remotely at this point. The -v switch makes ssh output some logging information as it executes. We then supply the username and IP address in order to log into our VPS. The rest sets up the tunnel itself, specifying that anything your local machine receives on port 8545 (the port on which your node is listening for RPC requests) should be forwarded to the same port on your node securely through the tunnel. That's the most important point: nobody else can do this except you. Your node is safe from exploits due to an exposed RPC port.Connecting MetaMask to the SSH\u00a0tunnelThis is the easiest part of the whole tunnel kerfuffle. I\u2019m assuming you left the SSH tunnel running and that you can see its log output. In your browser, activate MetaMask by clicking on the fox head at the top right of your browser window. At the top of the MetaMask window is the currently-chosen Ethereum network. If you\u2019ve been using beta dApps, it\u2019s probably say something like Rinkeby Test Network. Click on that name and you see a dropdown menu. At the top is Main Ethereum Network. That\u2019s our final destination, but we don\u2019t want to use that menu item. If you do, MetaMask connects to an Infura node, defeating the entire purpose of this long journey. Further down the list you see Localhost 8545. Click on that, watching the output of your SSH tunnel. You should see lines appear similar to this:debug1: Connection to port 8545 forwarding to localhost port 8545 requested.debug1: channel 1: new [direct-tcpip]MetaMask should now have Localhost 8545 at the top and you should see Deposit and Send buttons in the middle. If so, you\u2019ve now connected your remote geth node to MetaMask, though MetaMask believes it has connected to your local machine.Making the impermanent permanentYou now have a fully-functioning geth node and are able to connect to it remotely and securely through MetaMask and an SSH tunnel. Congratulations! Of course, computers crash or are shut down deliberately. In order to avoid having to set everything up again on a restart, we need to do two things: one, set up our geth node to start automatically on the VPS and two, somehow do the same for the SSH tunnel on our local machine.Remote permanenceIn relative terms this is the easy part of the permanence process. We only have to deal with one operating system, Linux, and there\u2019s an established way to start tasks automatically: systemd. Linux politics aside, let's get started.systemd handles processes on most Linux systems, Ubuntu being no exception. In order to do so it reads\u00a0.service files. To have our geth node start automatically on boot we need to provide a geth.service file. Go back and launch the console from the Linodes tab. If your geth node is still running you have to shut it down. As before, type the following to reconnect to your geth node:$ tmux attach -t 0Stop your geth node with ctrl-c. Again, wait until you're at a command prompt, then type ctrl-d to exit from tmux. Type the following at the command line, substituting user in User=user for the username you provided previously:$ cat > geth.service <<EOF[Unit]Description=Go Ethereum client[Service]User=userType=simpleRestart=alwaysExecStart=/usr/bin/geth --rpc --rpcaddr localhost --rpcport 8545 [Install]WantedBy=default.targetEOFThis creates a geth.service file in the current directory. You need to do a few things to make it available to systemd:$ sudo mv geth.service /etc/systemd/system/$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload$ sudo systemctl enable geth.service$ sudo systemctl start geth.serviceTo check on the status of the service, use this:$ sudo systemctl status geth.serviceSomewhere near the beginning of the output, you\u2019ll see active (running). If you don't, there will be error messages below. Good luck! To see continuous output from geth, type the following:$ sudo journalctl -f -u geth.serviceIf all is well you\u2019ll see a stream of lines containing Imported new chain segment. Type ctrl-c to stop the output. Don't worry, this doesn't shut down your geth node. It only stops showing the systemd log output.From now on, when your VPS restarts for any reason geth starts up again automatically.Local permanenceYou\u2019ve successfully started an SSH tunnel on your machine, but as soon as you close the terminal or put your laptop to sleep the tunnel disconnects and the connection is broken. This is obviously sub-optimal. Having to start up a terminal session and re-activate the tunnel is a bit of a drag. The problem is, the three major operating systems have three different ways to set up permanent services like our SSH tunnel.SSH key\u00a0pairsIn order for any of the following to work automatically you need to have SSH private and public keys. If you regularly ssh into remote machines without needing to provide a password, you're already set up. Even in that case, you need to send your public key to the remote machine running geth. For instructions on how to do this\u200a\u2014\u200aand how to generate an SSH key pair in the first place if you need to\u200a\u2014\u200athis article from Linode or this one from Atlassian explains things fairly well. These articles are already very long and very technical; mucking about with SSH keys is a well-known process so it's not necessary to repeat those instructions here. If you can type:$ ssh user@172.16.389.54supplying your own username and the IP of your remote geth node, and you are logged in without having to supply a password, you're good to go. If this is not the case, none of the following will work.LinuxThe process of making an SSH tunnel permanent is similar to the way it was done on our VPS. We install a persistent.ssh.tunnel.service file and set things up so that the service starts with the system. The only major difference, aside from the necessarily different ExecStart line, is that we need to precede that line with a line specifying a slight startup delay to make sure the network is ready before the service starts. Remember, of course, to replace user in User=user with your own desktop username and user@172.16.389.54 with your username on the remote system and its IP address.$ cat > persistent.ssh.tunnel.service <<EOF[Unit]Description=Persistent SSH Tunnel[Service]User=userType=simpleRestart=alwaysExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 10ExecStart=/usr/bin/ssh -N -v user@172.16.389.54 -L 8545:localhost:8545[Install]WantedBy=default.targetEOFThis creates a persistent.ssh.tunnel.service file in the current directory. As before, you need to do a few things to make it available to systemd, this time on your local system:$ sudo mv persistent.ssh.tunnel.service /etc/systemd/system/$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload$ sudo systemctl enable persistent.ssh.tunnel.service$ sudo systemctl start persistent.ssh.tunnel.serviceTo check that the service started successfully, type the following:$ sudo systemctl status persistent.ssh.tunnel.servicemacOSApple\u2019s macOS has its own way of setting up persistent services using launchctl. Similar to systemd on Linux, you provide a configuration file\u200a\u2014\u200athis time in the form of an XML document instead of an INI file\u200a\u2014\u200aand then install and activate the service using that XML document. First, we create this file, providing as usual the username and IP address of our VPS for user@172.16.389.54. As well, provide your macOS username under UserName.$ cat > com.persistent.ssh.tunnel.plist <<EOF<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"><plist version=\"1.0\"><dict>  <key>Label</key>  <string>com.persistent.ssh.tunnel</string>  <key>UserName</key>  <string>user</string>  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>  <string>/tmp/persistent.ssh.tunnel.err</string>  <key>ProgramArguments</key>  <array>    <string>/usr/bin/ssh</string>    <string>-N</string>    <string>-v</string>    <string>user@172.16.389.54</string>    <string>-L</string>    <string>8545:localhost:8545</string>  </array>  <key>KeepAlive</key>  <true/></dict></plist>EOFOnce you\u2019ve created the com.persistent.ssh.tunnel.plist file, move it to a location in which launchctl expects these files to reside. Finally, give the command to install it into the system and start the process running in the background.$ sudo mv com.persistent.ssh.tunnel.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/$ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.persistent.ssh.tunnel.plistInstalling the\u00a0.plist file into /Library/LaunchDaemons/ makes it available to any user on the system; it's not dependent on your being logged in for the tunnel to be active.WindowsIn order to set up a persistent service in Windows you need to download a utility that provides this functionality. The one I used is the free, open source, and public domain NSSM so you need to install that before proceeding.The steps below creates the persistent-ssh-tunnel service and sets various parameters so that you can use it to connect MetaMask to your geth node. I've provided the commands as well as the responses from nssm for clarity. To execute these commands you need to start a terminal session as a Windows administrator. You can do this by opening the start menu and typing cmd. This should bring up a Best match menu with Command Prompt highlighted. To the right choose Run as administrator. Click Yes to allow this app to make changes. If all goes well, you see a black terminal window open with the command prompt C:\\Windows\\system32>. Carefully type the commands below, making sure not to type the command prompt! Be sure that each command gets a response similar to the ones provided here. Substitute your Windows username for\u00a0.\\user (keeping the\u00a0.\\) and your Windows login password for password. Also provide your username and the IP address of your remote geth node in user@172.16.389.54.C:\\Windows\\system32>nssm install persistent-ssh-tunnel \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\OpenSSH\\ssh.exe\" \"-N -v user@172.16.389.54 -L 8545:localhost:8545\"Service \"persistent-ssh-tunnel\" installed successfully!

To test it out, open a browser that has MetaMask installed and follow the instructions above under Configuring MetaMask. MetaMask should again connect to Localhost 8545, but this time it\u2019s using the background service which tunnels requests to your geth VPS. You no longer have to think about establishing a connection to your remote Ethereum node.ConclusionFor the sake of expedience I\u2019ve made specific choices in these articles. For instance, I chose to use a VPS, and indeed a particular VPS provider, for our Ethereum node. As explained above, this costs money. dApp developers receiving income from their project should definitely consider this route. On the other hand, someone who is simply curious and would like to follow the steps outlined could set up a VPS, follow the tutorial, and after testing it out and learning all there is to be learned, shut down and delete the VPS. This would end up costing just a few cents: if it took you two hours to complete this tutorial you\u2019d be out 24\u00a2 US, assuming a Linode 16GB VPS. Even factoring in the synchronization time, you\u2019re still only out a couple of USDs.You\u2019re also free to choose a different VPS provider. Digital Ocean\u2019s Droplets are competitively priced. The process here should work equally well on a Droplet. Amazon\u2019s AWS is also a possibility. Using your own hardware would save the monthly cost, but the process gains much more complexity and would have been inappropriate for an article aimed at moderately technical people.Another choice I made was to use the Ubuntu Linux distribution as the operating system for our geth node. Ubuntu is one of the most popular distributions, but there are, shall we say, several other Linux distributions you could choose. If you're more familiar with another distribution, then you should be able to handle the differences between your choice and the Ubuntu-based instructions above.I chose a system service utility for Windows, offering no alternatives, and glossed over the SSH aspects on that OS. Again, these articles would verge on novella length if I were to go into every aspect of all of the software on all of the platforms. I apologize to those who wanted more detail. Please leave a comment if you have questions on these things.This has definitely been a long journey. I know it\u2019s all a bit ambitious, especially for those with a less technical bent. I hope you were able to follow these instructions and end up with your own remote Ethereum node, connecting to it with MetaMask through a secure SSH tunnel. If you have any questions or need any help with the process, please leave a comment here. I\u2019d be happy to help.Originally published at https://kauri.io.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "[\ud734\uba3c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud504] Metamask\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c 3\ucc28 \ud504\ub9ac\uc138\uc77c \ucc38\uc5ec\u00a0\ubc29\ubc95", "author_name": "Humanscape", "link": "https://medium.com/humanscape-ico/%ED%9C%B4%EB%A8%BC%EC%8A%A4%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4%ED%94%84-metamask%EB%A5%BC-%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%9C-3%EC%B0%A8-%ED%94%84%EB%A6%AC%EC%84%B8%EC%9D%BC-%EC%B0%B8%EC%97%AC-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95-8b1abac97292?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 27, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "100", "content": "[\ud734\uba3c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud504] Metamask\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c 3\ucc28 \ud504\ub9ac\uc138\uc77c \ucc38\uc5ec\u00a0\ubc29\ubc95HumanscapeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 27, 2018\uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694. \ud734\uba3c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud504 \ud300\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\ub9ce\uc740 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc758 \uad00\uc2ec\ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc800\ud76c \ud734\uba3c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud504 1\ucc28, 2\ucc28 Presale \ubaa8\ub450 \uc624\ud508 \ub2f9\uc77c \uc644\ud310\uc744 \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc2dc \ud55c \ubc88 \uac10\uc0ac\uc758 \ub9d0\uc500\uc744 \ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4.\uace7 3\ucc28 Presale\uc774 \uc2dc\uc791\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.1\ucc28, 2\ucc28 Presale\uc5d0\uc11c \ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \ub4f1\ub85d \ub418\uc168\ub358 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc808\ucc28 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub610 \uc138\uc77c\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.(\uac1c\uc778 \uc774\ub354\ub9ac\uc6c0 \uc9c0\uac11\uc740 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub4f1\ub85d\uc2dc \uc785\ub825\ud55c \uc8fc\uc18c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.)\ud734\uba3c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud504 3\ucc28 Presale \uc77c\uc815\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.* \uae30\uac04\u00a0: 2018.07.31:13:30 ~ 2018.08.07:13:29* \ud310\ub9e4 \ucc44\ub110\u00a0: \ud734\uba3c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud504 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud648\ud398\uc774\uc9c0, \ud1a0\ud070 \ubc45\ud06c* \ucc38\uc5ec \uac00\ub2a5 \ud654\ud3d0\u00a0: ETH, EOS(\ud1a0\ud070 \ubc45\ud06c)* \ucd5c\uc18c \ucc38\uc5ec \uc218\ub7c9\u00a0: 0.1 ETH* \ucd5c\ub300 \ucc38\uc5ec \uc218\ub7c9\u00a0: 10 ETH* \uad50\ud658 \ube44\uc728\u00a0: 1 ETH = 45,085 HUM / 1 EOS = 797 HUM* \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\u00a0: 5%\uae30\ud0c0 \uc790\uc138\ud55c \uc138\uc77c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc548\ub0b4\u00a0: \u201c\ud074\ub9ad\u201dPresale \ucc38\uc5ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud734\uba3c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud504 KYC \ub4f1\ub85d\u00a0: \u201c\ud074\ub9ad\u201d\uadf8\ub7fc \uc624\ub298\uc740 Chrome \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc778 Metamask\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud734\uba3c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud504 ICO\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc54c\ub824\ub4dc\ub9ac\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Today, Totle is breaking down what this important and exciting update means for you.The updateMetaMask released a \u201cprivacy mode\u201d update that will no longer expose users\u2019 public addresses to websites without their consent. In the past, MetaMask automatically injected an Ethereum provider and Web3 instance, meaning your public address would be shared with the dapp or website you were using.This exposed potentially sensitive information, including your balance and transaction history. This new \u201cprivacy mode\u201d feature is opt-in only, so users will need to enable privacy mode in their settings.From MetaMask: Over the next few months, users may begin to see more \u201cLogin\u201d or \u201cConnect\u201d buttons on dapps. These buttons will prompt a popup from MetaMask (or other dapp browser of choice) asking if the user wants to grant the site access to their public account information. The extension will remember which sites have been approved until the user clears their list.On November 2nd, 2018, MetaMask plans to release these changes with \u201cprivacy mode\u201d disabled by default. This option will eventually be enabled by default in a future release.What this means for\u00a0youIf enabled, this update is reflected in the Totle web app each time you connect your MetaMask wallet. You will see a \u201cConnect Request\u201d pop-up, informing you that our web app will be able to see your public address.Privacy and security are the pillars of Totle\u2019s values; therefore, we recommend all of our users to enable this feature to protect themselves from malicious actors and anyone else looking to get a glimpse of your transactions.For more information about this update, check out MetaMask\u2019s detailed post: https://medium.com/metamask/https-medium-com-metamask-breaking-change-injecting-web3-7722797916a8Note: As of this publication, we haven\u2019t seen updates to the web UI for a privacy mode setting in our MetaMask extensions, but we\u2019re sure the MetaMask team is working diligently to get this out.Have questions?

15There is a brand new speculation market. A completely decentralized tokenized bonding curve curation market has just gone live on mainnet. It is comprised entirely of smart contracts and has an easy to use interface connected via Metamask to interact with the contracts.Tokenized bonding curves and curation markets have been at the front of the innovation discussion in the Ethereum community because of the power they enable the market with.Essentially a bonding curve is a smart contract that can issue tokens via staking value, or \u201cbonding\u201d based on a floating price point where the x axis is how many tokens have been generated and the y axis is how expensive they become. The value bonded stays in the contract ready to be redeemed for the secondary token at the price the graph is currently at. This means an early bonder can profit after others have entered the contract and the price function has moved.The first night the platform went live, the bonding curve for a simple Poloniex api call went over 14x without needing a market or liquidity to have people trade it.The possibilities for a curation market are still just being discovered but some of the most powerful currently being discussed are:Curating Oracles for trusted data feeds;\u00a0The staked value creates an incentive for the provider to remain honest while giving an indicator to the developers as to which feed the community has decided is most valuable. This also allows the provider to have a fluctuating price point and make more money based on a higher demand.Ico launch platform;\u00a0Generating a curve that issues erc20 secondary tokens eliminates the need for liquidity or exchange listings or market makers as participants can enter and exit positions and have an increase or decrease in value by interacting directly with the contracts.Prediction markets;\u00a0In the simplest form 2 bonding curves are created for a long and short on bitcoin and at the end of a pre set period the losing curve pays out the staked value as a dividend to the winning curve. The truly exciting part about this is that the earlier one enters a curve the less expensive the position is, rewarding early prediction.Fundraising or Bounty Development competitions;\u00a0Generate one master curve with a problem to be solved, and individuals stake value to this curve. Participants who want to enter the competition would each have their own curve. The community would then speculate on who they believe to be the winner by staking to one of the competitors curve. If the bounty is satisfied the winner would receive the original master value with the speculators on that winner receiving the value staked by the losing curves.These are just the first possibilities of an entirely new speculative curation market that is running live on Ethereum mainnet at admin.zap.org and you can use Metamask to easily interact with the contracts.Here\u2019s some links for more info on what a tokenized bonding curve curation market is:https://medium.com/@simondlr/tokens-2-0-curved-token-bonding-in-curation-markets-1764a2e0bee5The Emergence of Cryptoeconomic PrimitivesThe building blocks of a token-based societyblog.coinbase.comFull market live on mainnet: admin.zap.org (use Metamask)\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 \u2014Also be sure to join our un-official Zap Community channels at https://discord.gg/QTGsczR and https://twitter.com/ZapUnofficial!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to use MetaMask to transfer ETH to MVL\u00a0Address", "author_name": "Trust-Driven MVL", "link": "https://medium.com/@mvlchain/how-to-use-metamask-to-transfer-eth-to-mvl-wallet-how-to-join-mvl-ico-9768a2f0cddb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 25, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "51", "content": "How to use MetaMask to transfer ETH to MVL\u00a0AddressTrust-Driven MVLBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 25, 2018Hi! MVL Team here.First round of Pre-ICO will start on April 26 at 9 pm UTC+9. In order to participate, you have to send ETH to MVL ICO Contract Address. You can use MetaMask to do so. Once you transfer ETH to MVL ICO Contract Address, you will in return get MVL Tokens.1. Sign up and log in our homepage (https://mvlchain.io). Go to My Page and click ICO(Token Sale) and see MVL ICO Contract Address. This is will appear after April 26 at 9 pm UTC+9. You have to add your ETH wallet first.2. Open Metamask and click \u2018Send.\u2019 See how to install Metamask here.3. In the first field, insert MVL ICO Contract Address and insert the amount of ETH you wish to transfer. Hit Next.4. Please check if the amount of ETH you want to transfer is correct. If you go back and change the ETH amount and come back to this page, the amount may not be changed. So click the arrow in the yellow box so the ETH amount is correct.The transaction fee occurs so you have to set gas price. We recommend Gas limit to 250,000 and gas price to 10~11. Unused as gas will be refunded. We will let you know how to check used gas amount below. The gas will be used from your ETH wallet. So you have to have 0.01 ETH more than the amount you want to transfer to the MVL ICO.5. Next, you will see this page. If you set a transaction fee that is not too low, transfer will occur within one minute. Now click \u201cView account on Etherscan\u201d.6. You will then go to https://etherscan.io/ where you can see your wallet address, MVL ICO Contract Address and used gas amount. Here you will see your transaction.7.
