It\u2019s just numbers in cyberspace, a mirage, insubstantial as a soap bubble. Bitcoin is not backed by anything other than the faith of the fools who buy it and of the greater fools who buy it from these lesser fools. And you know? Fair enough. All this is true.What may be less easy to grasp is that U.S. dollars are likewise an illusion. They too consist mainly of numbers out there in cyberspace. Sometimes they\u2019re stored in paper or coins, but while the paper and coins are material, the dollars they represent are not. U.S. dollars are not backed by anything other than the faith of the fools who accept it as payment and of other fools who agree in turn to accept it as payment from them. The main difference is that, for the moment at least, the illusion, in the case of dollars, is more widely and more fiercely believed.In fact, almost all of our U.S. dollars, about 90 percent, are purely abstract\u200a\u2014\u200athey literally do not exist in any tangible form. James Surowiecki reported in 2012 that \u201conly about 10 percent of the U.S. money supply\u200a\u2014\u200aabout $1 trillion of the roughly $10 trillion total\u200a\u2014\u200aexists in the form of paper cash and coins.\u201d (The number now appears to be about $1.5 trillion out of $13.7 trillion.) There is nothing stopping our banking system from creating more dollars whenever the mood strikes. Of the $13.7 trillion in the M2 money supply as of October 2017, $13.5 trillion was created after 1959\u2014or, to put it another way, M2 has expanded by almost 50 times.The U.S. dollar is what is known as a \u201cfiat\u201d currency. Fiat is Latin for \u201clet there be,\u201d as in fiat lux, let there be light; hence, fiat denarii, let there be lire, bolivars, dollars, and rubles. The temptation for leaders of nation-states to manufacture money has historically been practically irresistible. One evident result of this wantonness is inflation: The purchasing power of $1 in 1959 is now a little under 12 cents.The bitcoin blockchain was created, in part, to address this historical weakness. After the 21 millionth bitcoin is mined, in around 2140, the system will produce no more.Charlatans and thieves will forever try to game the various structures put in place to control and/or account for any monetary system and, indeed, any store of value (see: the crooks of the Panama and Paradise Papers, Bernies Cornfeld and Madoff, the London Whale, LTCM and BCCI, the clever and quiet thieves of treasures from the Gardner Museum in Boston, the 2008 financial crisis and associated bailouts, and the thefts at Mt. Gox, the DAO, and Tether). All stores of value are targets. And using any system of exchange\u200a\u2014\u200athrough fair means or foul\u200a\u2014\u200afortunes can and will be made and lost. And yet, surprising as it may sometimes seem, there are enough people acting in good faith to prevent monetary systems from collapsing entirely.There are a few radical differences between cryptocurrencies and U.S. dollars. For example, the transactions conducted in the bitcoin system are recorded in an unfalsifiable ledger that relies not on the authority of banks or governments, but on the strength of a public computer network that (theoretically, at least) anyone is free to join. Also, again, the supply of bitcoins is ultimately fixed. The anonymity of cryptocurrency is not, perhaps, quite as bulletproof as the anonymity of (unmarked) cash.Money itself is an illusion, a mass hallucination. You\u2019re working hard to make it, grow it, and keep it, but even so, the only real thing about it is its symbolic power. Which is indeed awesome, considered from a certain angle.Our shared understanding of the value of that green-tinted piece of paper, that Krugerrand, ether token, or pound coin, is all that counts. And that shared understanding has no fixed meaning; it\u2019s in eternal flux. The \u201cvalue\u201d of all money, all stores of exchange, is unstable and abstract, even in the face of every attempt to secure it\u200a\u2014\u200asay, with a set rate of exchange against various assets\u200a\u2014\u200aor to regulate its flow by setting interest rates. Money is only a shifting network of agreements made in and on behalf of the hive, and that\u2019s all it has ever been\u2014a fragile thread in a web of human trust.Consider the \u201cflight capital\u201d that refugees are forced to trade at a huge loss in order to cross a hostile border. That is money, but exactly what does it have in common with the invisible money that is your paycheck, a string of numbers colliding in the ether with the string of numbers that is your bank account? Maybe the price of avocados or coffee goes up or down between the time of the electronic collision in your bank and the day you go to the market. There are natural disasters in which people must suddenly become willing to pay vastly inflated sums for a few gallons of clean water. What, then, is \u201cthe value of a dollar\u201d?All the common arguments against cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and the blockchain technology that undergirds them, invariably fail to take this fact\u200a\u2014\u200athe provisional and fragile nature of ordinary money\u200a\u2014\u200ainto account. Cryptocurrencies cannot be understood even a little bit by anyone who thinks money is real, solid, or \u201cbacked by\u201d anything other than human trust in institutions whose stability is always uncertain. A U.S. dollar is \u201cbacked by\u201d \u201cthe full faith and credit of the United States.\u201d But what exactly does this mean?It means that if you take one dollar to the U.S. Treasury and ask them to redeem it, they will: They\u2019ll give you\u2026one dollar. Or four quarters, if you want, probably.The unfortunate fact is that monetary crises in unstable governments like those of Greece, Venezuela, and Spain have already precipitated a number of spikes in the crypto markets. When the Cypriot government sought to resolve the country\u2019s 2013 banking crisis by subjecting its citizens\u2019 bank deposits to a nearly 7 percent haircut, the price of bitcoin shot up, likely because, at that point, many southern European holders of euros with debt-ridden governments surmised that bitcoin might represent a more reliable home for their money than the Cypriot banks could provide. Spanish bank depositors must have wondered: Would their own banks be next?Our existing financial institutions are deeply flawed, in short, and permanently prone to corruption, and this was so long before bitcoin was a gleam in its mysterious inventor\u2019s eye. Satoshi Nakamoto made a point of stating it plain as day in the so-called genesis block that started bitcoin rolling: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d Bitcoin was a politically motivated project from the first, a new system explicitly built to provide a tamperproof digital means of exchange on which a better alternative to our existing banking systems might be based.The theory behind all cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, is that the records produced by a distributed computer network can be made tamperproof, thus theoretically guaranteeing the soundness of a currency better than governments can. And so far, despite some substantial bumps in the road, the blockchain system on which bitcoin is built has at least partially proved this theory. A million or more bitcoins have been stolen since 2009, but the underlying system\u2019s distributed ledger, the accounting system on which bitcoin is based, has so far remained stable and incorruptible.The many thefts and ripoffs that occurred in the early days of bitcoin call to mind the movie The Treasure of Sierra Madre, a fine drama of greed and corruption set during the 1920's. There can be no question that the prospect of instantaneous wealth, almost close enough to touch, can drive people insane. Note, however, that the propensity of greed to produce crime and insanity did not cause the value of gold to evaporate.The real caveat here is that the incorruptibility of the bitcoin ledger survived, not only because of the system\u2019s distribution, not only because of its clever cryptographic safeguards, but because of the good faith and good sense of individual developers who shepherded the project through its wobbly-legged infancy. Without the sangfroid of Gavin Andresen, who was effectively bitcoin\u2019s sole steward during many of its early moments of crisis, the project might easily have died. Even today, the various forks and growing pains still bedeviling the bitcoin system are providing a kind of stress test. At present (this is just my opinion) the relative untrustworthiness of bitcoin\u2019s core devs, who are thought by many to be strategizing for their own benefit, may be inflicting lasting damage not only to the cause of bitcoin, but also to the promise of blockchain technology in general.As a separate issue, cryptocurrency speculators ran the risk of getting fleeced, early on, because of the difficulties in (1) creating safe storage, and (2) developing systems for getting ordinary money in and out of cryptocurrency safely. Because of disasters like the theft of around 800,000 bitcoins from the Mt. Gox exchange, which was discovered in 2014, the whole ecosystem of cryptocurrency got kind of a bad rap. The public impression was that bitcoin itself was somehow hacked, when in fact it was the largest exchange that was hacked. Rather like the central Bank of Bangladesh was deprived of $63 million in its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last year.Saying that \u201cbitcoin is a fraud\u201d because bad actors have ripped people off is exactly like saying \u201cthe financial services industry is a fraud\u201d because Jamie Dimon\u2019s company is crooked. Bitcoin was used on the dark web to buy and sell drugs! Well\u2026most hundred-dollar bills bear traces of cocaine, so if you object to hundred-dollar bills on that account, please, send your surplus my way. Does the fact that it\u2019s used in criminal transactions delegitimize cash? No. The truth is that money is tainted in its very nature.Soon enough, the blockchain system now in use to guarantee bitcoin transactions will morph and meld with other systems, because its value is incalculable. Investors from Wall Street to Sand Hill Road have already invested significant amounts of money, time, and effort in blockchain-based businesses. Everywhere human beings need to know for sure whether or not something really happened, blockchain technology can be programmed to give us incorruptible information about it. Whatever the defects in the system Satoshi Nakamoto launched in 2009\u200a\u2014\u200aand they are still substantial\u200a\u2014\u200ahe proved that there really is a way for people to create foolproof, guaranteed records of human transactions, entirely without reliance on outside authorities such as banks or governments. There\u2019s no going back from that.The fight for stability in any currency is always in the process of being lost, because wherever there is a chance to game or forge a transaction, human nature is such that some will try to cheat. Even the limited and precarious stability we have in developed countries requires vigilance and work on the part of countless principled people, and there\u2019s never certainty. The struggle to preserve the illusion that money is real is never over, and it never can be.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Bitcoin", "author_name": "Nassim Nicholas Taleb", "link": "https://medium.com/opacity/bitcoin-1537e616a074?source=search_post---------1", "post_date": "Jan 22, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "60K", "content": "BitcoinNassim Nicholas TalebBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 22, 2018It may fail but we now know how to do\u00a0itForeword to the book by Saifedean AmmousLet us follow the logic of things from the beginning. Or, rather, from the end: modern times. We are, as I am writing these lines, witnessing a complete riot against some class of experts, in domains that are too difficult for us to understand, such as macroeconomic reality, and in which not only the expert is not an expert, but he doesn\u2019t know it. That previous Federal Reserve bosses, Greenspan and Bernanke, had little grasp of empirical reality is something we only discovered a bit too late: one can macroBS longer than microBS, which is why we need to be careful on who to endow with centralized macro decisions.What makes it worse is that all central banks operated under the same model, making it a perfect monoculture.In the complex domain, expertise doesn\u2019t concentrate: under organic reality, things work in a distributed way, as Hayek has convincingly demonstrated. But Hayek used the notion of distributed knowledge. Well, it looks like we do not even need that thing called knowledge for things to work well. Nor do we need individual rationality. All we need is structure.It doesn\u2019t mean all participants have a democratic sharing of decisions. One motivated participant can disproportionately move the needle (what I have studied as the asymmetry of the minority rule). But every participant has the option to be that player.Somehow, under scale transformation, emerges a miraculous effect: rational markets do not require any individual trader to be rational. In fact they work well under zero-intelligence \u2013a zero intelligence crowd, under the right design, works better than a Soviet-style management composed to maximally intelligent humans.Which is why Bitcoin is an excellent idea. It fulfills the needs of the complex system, not because it is a cryptocurrency, but precisely because it has no owner, no authority that can decide on its fate. It is owned by the crowd, its users. And it has now a track record of several years, enough for it to be an animal in its own right.For other cryptocurrencies to compete, they need to have such a Hayekian property.Bitcoin is a currency without a government. But, one may ask, didn\u2019t we have gold, silver and other metals, another class of currencies without a government? Not quite. When you trade gold, you trade \u201cloco\u201d Hong Kong and end up receiving a claim on a stock there, which you might need to move to New Jersey. Banks control the custodian game and governments control banks (or, rather, bankers and government officials are, to be polite, tight together). So Bitcoin has a huge advantage over gold in transactions: clearance does not require a specific custodian. No government can control what code you have in your head.Finally, Bitcoin will go through hick-ups (hiccups). It may fail; but then it will be easily reinvented as we now know how it works. In its present state, it may not be convenient for transactions, not good enough to buy your decaffeinated expresso macchiato at your local virtue-signaling coffee chain. It may be too volatile to be a currency, for now. But it is the first organic currency.But its mere existence is an insurance policy that will remind governments that the last object establishment could control, namely, the currency, is no longer their monopoly. This gives us, the crowd, an insurance policy against an Orwellian future.", "responses": "228"}, {"title": "Don\u2019t fall for the hype\u200a\u2014\u200aWhy Bitcoin\u2019s $10,000 Price Doesn\u2019t Reflect Its True\u00a0Value", "author_name": "Miguel Cuneta", "link": "https://decentralize.today/dont-fall-for-the-hype-why-bitcoin-s-10-000-price-doesn-t-reflect-its-true-value-6b42a59fce0a?source=search_post---------2", "post_date": "Dec 2, 2017", "readtime": "12 min read", "upvotes": "60K", "content": "Don\u2019t fall for the hype\u200a\u2014\u200aWhy Bitcoin\u2019s $10,000 Price Doesn\u2019t Reflect Its True\u00a0ValueMiguel CunetaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 2, 2017Financial news headlines from the last few days:Bitcoin finally hits $10,000!\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Economist, Nov. 28th, 2017Bitcoin surpasses the $10,000 milestone!\u200a\u2014\u200aCNBC, Nov. 28th, 2017BITCOIN SOARS ABOVE $11,000!\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Guardian, Nov. 29th, 2017Funny thing is, news outlets haven\u2019t had 24 hours to let the \u201c$10,000\u201d news simmer and the price of Bitcoin already rose to $11,500. By the time they published their \u201c$11,000\u201d piece, it already dropped back to $9,000. Then, as soon as they entered the last word on their \u201cBitcoin is crashing!\u201d article, it\u2019s back above $11,000 per Bitcoin.Amazing? Crazy? All of the above? It may seem so, but this is not unprecedented.We\u2019ve seen this before, back in 2013, with a media frenzy when Bitcoin was approaching $1,000 that fueled that year\u2019s \u201cbubble\u201d. In January of that year, one Bitcoin was trading at around $15.00, rocketed to $266 by April, and then crashed back to $50 within days of reaching that peak. Like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, by November it had already reached $1,000, peaking at $1,242 on the largest Bitcoin exchange of that time, the now defunct Mt. Gox. That\u2019s an almost 100X increase in 11 months, an order of magnitude larger than this year\u2019s (2017) 10-fold run up.The funny thing is, the charts then are almost identical to the ones today, and news articles look almost exactly the same. Just add one zero.Image from CNN\u00a0MoneyThe media gobbles this up because people are fascinated by this stuff. Stories of people finding 5000 BTC in an old hard drive that they bought for $25 in 2009, a man throwing away 7500 BTC by accident and scouring a landfill to try and find it, a man buying pizzas for 10,000 BTC\u200a\u2014\u200aIt\u2019s the sizzle to the steak, and it sells.The Other SidePeople love it when markets rise, but what goes up must come down, and Bitcoin is not immune to this. History shows us three major \u201cBitcoin Bubbles\u201d, and a lot of volatility in between. Swings of 20\u201330% in one day are not uncommon in the Bitcoin world, but to most people this can be quite terrifying. For example, Bitcoin broke $11,500 a couple of days ago but then crashed back to $9,600 and lost 20% of its value overnight.These are not isolated cases. In fact, it\u2019s quite common. There\u2019s that time it crashed from $260 to $50. Bitcoin was declared dead.Then there was that time it crashed from $330 to $180. The despair was palpable.Or that time it crashed from $600 to $250. \u201cWill it ever end?\u201d People asked. Even true believers started to doubt. A lot of people gave up and sold out.So Bitcoin doesn\u2019t perpetually go up, what a surprise. If you look at short term linear charts, yes, there are major downswings at any given point in time. It does not always go up for 12 months straight, like this year.Yet if you look at the logarithmic chart below:Log charts are better than linear charts in measuring performance over long periods of time. A jump from $1 to $30 will look tiny compared to a jump from $100 to $200 in a linear chart, even though it is a 3000% increase versus a 100% increase. A log chart fixes this problem.We can see on this all-time price chart that since Bitcoin was invented, it has been on a steady upward climb, with some major swings in between. You\u2019ll notice that in the early days, the swings were actually bigger and more volatile.Three times in the history of Bitcoin, the price went parabolic, meaning it went almost straight upwards on the chart. An almost vertical climb on a log chart is hard to achieve unless the price goes up very very fast. This was the case in 2011 and twice in 2013. In both years, Bitcoin increased by at least 100-fold. As you can see, in this 2017 climb from $1,000 to $11,000, we haven\u2019t formed a parabolic uptrend just yet. It will need to track upward towards $100K per Bitcoin really fast for that to happen. We are not there yet and we have a long way to go.The Bitcoin Hype-CycleThe peculiar thing about Bitcoin\u2019s price is that it goes through cycles. First, a slow and steady accumulation by people who understand the tech and buy it when it is considered worthless. This is usually after a big price \u201ccrash\u201d. It then starts to reach a point where the media picks up its growth again, and then, a parabolic buying frenzy ensues where even your grandma starts buying Bitcoins. Finally, after reaching a dramatic peak, it finally pops and drops, causing panic selling, leaving only those who truly understand the tech holding on to their coins, the \u201cHODLers\u201d. Then its back to square one, with a higher base price and a larger user base. Rinse, repeat.The Obsession with the Price While Overlooking the ValuePrice is not equal to value. The price of water is cheap, but it is pretty valuable. I mean, we\u2019d die in about three days without water. If water suddenly became scarce, its market price would skyrocket. In a zombie apocalypse scenario, gold would be worth a lot less than water, guaranteed. Today, simple bottled water can be more expensive than gasoline per liter, when just two decades ago the idea of buying water at all was considered crazy. The market decides on the price, but the value of something lies outside its price.In the same way, the value of Bitcoin has nothing to do with its exchange rate.When Bitcoin was worth exactly zero dollars, it already essentially solved the previously unsolvable 30-year old computer science problem called the Byzantine General\u2019s problem\u200a\u2014\u200ahow to reach agreement with other agents over an untrusted network of communication, or distributed consensus. That value proposition was there from day zero, even if the price of one Bitcoin was essentially zero.\u201cA lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990s. I hope it\u2019s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we\u2019re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSatoshi Nakamoto, 2009Don\u2019t Trust\u200a\u2014\u200aVerifyBecause of Bitcoin, we don\u2019t need middlemen to transact\u200a\u2014\u200ahell, we eliminated the need for trust. We can transfer value over the internet without asking permission from a gatekeeper. The internet did this for the transfer of information, whereas before, we had to go to the post office to send mail, through a telephone operator to call someone overseas, or a publisher to let the world read about our stories and ideas. Bitcoin is doing this today, letting us store value like never before and transfer value from one owner to another without permission, globally, and instantly.Just like how the value of your paper money is not in the paper itself but in the government or authority that issues this paper, the value of Bitcoin is not in the tokens used to exchange with each other, but in the network that allows this exchange to happen.The price of Bitcoin is the least interesting thing about it. The value of Bitcoin is in its ability to do what it set out to do, and do it best. When you truly understand the technology, you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s true value.The Crypto-Renaissance, A Financial RevolutionOver one-third of a trillion dollars. That\u2019s the total amount of cryptocurrencies in the world. $165 Billion belongs to Bitcoin alone, which just shows how dominant network effects can be. Because of Bitcoin technology, the power to create and exchange money was granted to every person on earth and is no longer the monopoly of kings, institutions, and oligarchs. The printing press did the exact same thing for the power to create and exchange information, which started the renaissance and led to the industrial revolution. It\u2019s a return to the original spirit of why money was invented in the first place.There is immense wealth being created right before our very eyes, but it is happening so fast that most people are ignoring it.Back when I was a young boy, I loved reading the Guinness book of world records, and one of the most fascinating things for me there was the list of richest people in the world. In the late 80s to early 90s, it was consistently the Sultan of Brunei, with his golden throne, 200 Ferraris and a gold plated Rolls Royce that made the top of the list.Suddenly, in the late 90s to early 2000s, it was Bill Gates and a bunch of other geeks that made it to the top of the list. Where the hell did they come from? How can a bunch of geeks writing software, wearing sneakers, and working from their garages become wealthier than a King with solid gold chairs? Why did this happen?It happened simply because the World Wide Web was just much more valuable than gold and oil. There is much more value in a global network allowing people to store, exchange, and transfer information than in yellow shiny rocks and fossil fuels from under the ground.The exact same thing is happening today in the cryptocurrency world. Suddenly, geeks who toiled over establishing the Bitcoin network voluntarily and thanklessly for years are being paid back by the very software they helped build. Traders who believed in projects and invested the small amount of money they had left along with time and effort in building these projects are seeing 1000% up to 30,000% increases in the value of their net worth in cryptocurrencies. Pioneers are paving the way for a new generation of financial applications that will usher billions of new users to the internet economy. There are some among them who are already approaching Billionaire status, and many more will follow.Wealth creation is a good thing, and the concentration of this wealth is not necessarily a bad thing. How the wealth was acquired is what is important\u200a\u2014\u200ahonest wealth. Bitcoin is honest money. No coercion, no unfair advantage, no abuse of power, and no abuse of labor was needed to establish the newfound wealth of the original Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trailblazers. This is why trust fund babies who have been \u201ctrading for decades\u201d shit on Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200athey cant accept the fact that a geek who took an early risk on an unknown technology is now much wealthier than them, in the same way I can imagine a guy sitting on a solid gold throne must have scoffed at the idea of a geek in a garage becoming wealthier than him.Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will make a lot of people financially independent, and that\u2019s a great thing. Millions of people who never had access to capital will be able to pursue their goals and build things that could ultimately help humanity as a whole.The Separation of Cash and StateBitcoin is now the 6th most valuable circulating currency in the whole world, and it did this in about eight years, with roughly only about\u00a00.01% of the world\u2019s population owning or using it.We could be watching one of the biggest financial bubbles in history unfold with this cryptocurrency mania. Yet on the other side of the coin, there is also the non-trivial possibility that we are witnessing something remarkable happening before our very eyes\u200a\u2014\u200athe return of the separation of cash and state.People are hungry to be part of the world of finance. What was once the private playground of the rich and powerful, the middlemen and brokers, institutions and corporations\u200a\u2014\u200athe world of investing and financial exchange\u200a\u2014\u200ahave been eclipsed by thousands of common people empowered by the free and open nature of blockchain-based finance. The people that can\u2019t afford the buy-in to the current system, ones who do not pass the vetting of its gatekeepers and are left with nowhere to go. They see Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a permissionless option to participate in the global financial economy and a way out of their own rat races. They invest hard earned money, a few bucks here and there, hoping to make honest gains on their own, even risking losses, instead of being at the mercy of consumerism and inflation.And it works. Young men and women from all walks of life, from the Philippines to Kazakhstan, are learning about Blockchain technology and Crypto trading, putting in the time and effort, finding jobs in the industry, making money, and then teaching or inspiring others to do so too.Children born from 2009 onwards are going to live in a world where digital cryptocurrencies always existed and are the norm, instead of a fad. They will never understand the need to wait \u201c3 to 5 business days\u201d for money to be transferred, to wait in line at a bank, to pay 10% to send money. It\u2019s easy to think that this is wishful thinking, but remember, lot of people called the internet a fad too. Now we no longer go online, we live online.Technologies of tomorrow like robotics, artificial intelligence, autonomous machines, and the Internet of Things will not use credit cards, a technology never intended for an online network, but will use blockchains and cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin as the global reserve. This is almost a certainty.Will crypto markets crash in between? Most likely. In the same way the dotcom bubble burned over six trillion dollars back in 2000, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets will probably go through the same cycles.Notice I said Markets? Markets crash, technology doesn\u2019t. Technology evolves or becomes obsolete. The risk of Bitcoin going obsolete at this point is close to zero.Market bubbles establish the true players in the market and eliminate all the ones who are there for a quick buck. What\u2019s important is that the technology is real, and it is here to stay.The Future of Money Itself\u200a\u2014\u200aA Very Tall Order\u201cTrue confidence lies not in being sure you are right, but in not being afraid to be wrong.\u201dBitcoin\u2019s upward trend becomes logical once you understand the many layers of the technology behind it. Add to that the thousands and thousands of people who, for their own financial self-interest, will work day and night and fight tooth and nail to keep the fire going, building the network, protecting the network, being the network, and you\u2019ve got an unstoppable force or innovation and value pushing us towards the next evolution of money.So what\u2019s going to happen? No one can predict what is going to happen.These are merely possibilities that I and others have explored, based on the information we have today. To say we know where this growth trend will end up is arrogance. That\u2019s why the work never stops, that\u2019s why we drive the direction instead of letting it drive us. As I write this, the positive feedback loop and self-reinforcing trend that Bitcoin started keeps moving forward and upward, with no equilibrium in sight, and with the end-game being a global paradigm shift in the way we store value and transact with one another.The future of money will lie in the hands of its users, the people, the sovereign individual, and not in the powers that be. Money is, in fact, a form of speech. It is just a message about the transfer of value from one to another. Because of the Bitcoin protocol, we finally figured out how to use our most powerful communication channel, the internet, to exchange value with anyone, anywhere, anytime, without permission or friction, freely.We will live in a future where Bitcoin set money free.Many thanks to @ericzoo for the comments and suggestions, much appreciated.Thoughts and opinions are my own and in no way reflect any affiliations I have with any organization.I do not give investment advice.

Since we\u2019re rapidly approaching the ten year anniversary of Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper publication, I\u2019ll attempt to project out twenty years to see the evolution of Bitcoin, blockchain, alternative cryptocurrencies and decentralization.This is the type of article that will look unbelievably foolish or incredibly brilliant when I\u2019m old and gray.I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going for it anyway.I\u2019m also going to go much, much deeper than \u201cBitcoin will go to zero\u201d or \u201cBitcoin will become the reserve currency and be worth $1,000,000\u201d. That\u2019s not really saying all that much and anyone can do it.Instead we\u2019ll look at how the technology will transform and how society will transform with it.I\u2019ve got a decent track record of successfully predicting future trends and technology but nobody gets it 100% right. Arthur C. Clarke, one of the greatest sci-fi writers of all time, saw the coming of satellites and GPS, as well as the cloud, the Internet and telecommuting but by his own admission he overestimated the importance of rockets and failed to see the importance of a prototype laptop a company gifted to him to write his next novel.Magnum Chaos represented by Lorenzo Lotto, at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in\u00a0Bergamo.Chaos theory tells us it\u2019s impossible to predict the future.But that\u2019s not entirely true.We can never see black swan events or completely unexpected technology (try explaining a computer and the Internet to an 18th century farmer) but we can do a kind of Monte Carlo analysis of tomorrow and see the major pathways spinning out into infinity.Few people can do it well.In fact, most people get the future laughably wrong so before we leap into our predictions, we need to understand why so we can try to avoid the same mistakes.This Internet Thing will Never Work\u00a0OutThe first reason people get the future so wrong is because they dedicate about five minutes to looking at something before they form an opinion on it.That isn\u2019t thinking.Homer\u2019s brain.That\u2019s the primordial lizard brain running a mental heuristic that\u2019s absolutely incapable of understanding anything new and novel. It\u2019s only good at attack, defense, finding food and shelter and avoiding boredom. It\u2019s a survival machine.Unfortunately, many people live almost their entire lives at this level and their opinions are worth zero when it comes to seeing new trends and developments.The second major reason people get the future so wrong is it goes against everything they understand about the world. Think about a company like Kodak who simply refused to see the power of digital film because they\u2019d built up a business over a hundred years on the back of chemical film. They had every advantage and they blew it. They mistook the past for the future and they paid a heavy price by going bankrupt as the market roared past them. To see the future you have to be able to step outside of yourself, forget your past successes and see beyond your current understanding.A third major reason people fail to see the future is because it challenges their position of power. That\u2019s why oligarch banker, Jamie Dimon, and a prince from a country that just allowed women to drive last month, all see Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a \u201cfraud\u201d or a \u201cscam\u201d.They literally can\u2019t see clearly because they\u2019re the main beneficiaries of the current system. They don\u2019t want to see. So they engage in a kind of information warfare, even if it\u2019s unconscious. It\u2019s nothing but a mental defense mechanism. The rise of new ways of running the world means their position is under fire and they\u2019re terrified.Asking these people about Bitcoin is like asking a taxi driver what he thinks about Uber or a horse and buggy manufacturer what he thinks about cars. Their opinions are worth less than nothing.The fourth major reason people screw up predictions is because they mistake their opinion for reality. There\u2019s what you think about the world and there\u2019s actual reality and they\u2019re often not the same thing. One is the map and one is the territory. Don\u2019t mistake the map for the territory.Take this now infamous article by Clifford Stoll from Newsweek in 1995 that declared the Internet a total failure poised for imminent collapse. Stoll writes:\u201cVisionaries see a future of telecommuting workers, interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms. They speak of electronic town meetings and virtual communities. Commerce and business will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems. And the freedom of digital networks will make government more democratic. Baloney.\u201d [Emphasis mine.]Clifford Stoll: I see nothing but the shadow of my opinions in Plato\u2019s\u00a0cave.Reading that quote it\u2019s impossible not to grin ear to ear as feelings of tremendous superiority wash over you. What an idiot! Who didn\u2019t see the Internet coming?Answer: Almost nobody.Hindsight is 20/20.I\u2019m betting almost everyone busting up laughing at the poor guy didn\u2019t see it coming either, if they even knew what the Internet was in the first place. If they did they almost certainly didn\u2019t see a working Wikipedia, the rise of telecommuting and a day when they would buy everything from books to groceries through Amazon.Actually what\u2019s most striking about the above quote is not how inaccurate it is, but how accurate it is on so many levels.That\u2019s right.Read the article and you\u2019ll see tons of his predictions are incredibly spot on!If you go back and strip out all Stoll\u2019s opinions what emerges is an amazingly clear picture of the next two decades of the net. Check it out:\u201cNicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we\u2019ll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet.\u201dI yanked two words: \u201cUh, sure.\u201d His opinion.Stoll saw the future, he just refused to see it. If he managed to get out of his own way and just observe instead of interpreting and filtering what he saw, the article would have gone down in history as one of the most forward thinking and accurate ever written. That brings us to our next reason.The fifth reason people get the future wrong is a complete and total lack of patience.Take the opening line of Stoll\u2019s article:\u201cAfter two decades online, I\u2019m perplexed.\u201dStoll had already lived with the Internet for twenty years but it just wasn\u2019t coming together for him. It\u2019s easy to think it\u2019s never going to happen when that much time goes by.The waiting is the hardest part. It takes patience to let things develop naturally.Patience. Patience. Patience.Creativity requires setbacks and failures and tremendous tenacity. Once you expose your idea to the reality of rust, gravity and friction, things tend to fall apart. No plan survives contact with the enemy. Reality is a whetstone that either shatters you or sharpens your ideas.Things take time.A classic example of the real creative process and how long it takes comes from George de Mestral, the inventor of Velcro.He first came up with the idea in 1941, after taking his dog for a walk in the woods and seeing a bunch of burrs attached to his fur. The concept didn\u2019t fully take root in his mind for another seven years. He started working on recreating the tiny hooks in 1948 and it took him ten years to make it work and mass produce it.After that he opened his company in the late 1950s, he expected immediate high demand.It didn\u2019t happen.It took another five years before the budding space program in the 1960\u2019s saw Velcro as a way to solve the problem of getting astronauts in and out of bulky and unwieldy space suits. The rest of the world only cares about the problems things solve for them not the idea or ideology behind it. Soon after the ski industry noticed it would work on boots.All in all from initial idea to functioning, profitable business?About twenty five years.Lastly, we can take one more lesson from Stoll before I launch into my predictions for crypto.His biggest mistake is the sixth and final reason people are blind to the future. He took current inventions, air lifted them forward and imagined them as the solution to future problems. Wrong!Current inventions solve current problems. Future problems will take brand new solutions.In the article Stoll mentions that CD books would never replace real books. He was right that reading books on CD with a crappy CRT monitor that rips apart your retinas was a miserable experience. But understanding that helps us understand the necessary characteristics of a future solution.It\u2019s nearly impossible to know what form those solutions will take, but we can figure out what traits the solution will have so we can recognize it when it gets here.Let\u2019s see how it works:CDs are clunky. Monitors back then were blurry and hard to read. They hurt the eyes. Computers were huge and not very portable. Even laptops were bricks that burned your legs that nobody would want to read a damn thing on.But he also missed the shortcomings of books.Books are heavy too. They\u2019re made of trees! And they can easily get lost or damaged by the elements. You can only carry so many before you\u2019re carrying a huge weight around.From there we can see that a good solution would be:Super-portable and lightweight.Have a crystal clear display.Hides the data storage completely from the user.As easy to use as a book. Just open and read.Protect the data so if we lose it or damage it, we can recover it without needing to buy it again.Allow you to carry lots of books at once.The Kindle improved reading and now it\u2019s even waterproof which makes it better than traditional books. New solutions must offer the same feature set plus new and improved features to really take\u00a0off.Of course we know the answer now: the Kindle and the iPad.Both have tremendous ease of use, hide the storage media from the user completely, protect the data by backing it up and they\u2019re easy on the eyes.Solutions start by pointing out what\u2019s wrong, asking the right questions about how to fix it and correctly defining what properties we would need to have a better experience.From the above, we have three principles to help us predict the future:Patience.Observe, don\u2019t interpret.Don\u2019t graft today\u2019s solutions onto tomorrow\u2019s problems.All right, let\u2019s break out the crystal ball and peer into the fate of Bitcoin and crypto.Hopefully we\u2019ll have better luck than Stoll and this article won\u2019t get trotted out by tomorrow\u2019s Boing Boing replacement to call me an idiot.The Rise of Bitcoin, Crypto and DecentralizationWe\u2019ll start with a few easy predictions and move on to some more complex and far reaching ones as well as some seriously controversial ones.I\u2019ll also include a confidence meter to let you know how strongly I feel about the scenario playing out.1) The Bubble\u00a0BurstsPeople in and out of crypto see them as bubble that will pop, causing prices to crash badly.They\u2019re right.But so what?That\u2019s not the end of the story. It\u2019s just the beginning.Right now we\u2019re in the grips of tremendous euphoria. There\u2019s so much potential. We can practically taste the decentralized future. It\u2019s just around the corner! Any day now.Of course, that\u2019s almost certainly not how it will work out. The bubble will pop. Vitalik is right. 90% of tokens will fail.But after the pop comes the real working ideas.Eight years into the crypto experiment, everyone is working on the railroad tracks of the future but we don\u2019t have much to show for it other than speculative trading and some smart contracts. The apps are hideous and practically unusable. It\u2019s nerve wracking when you push \u201csend\u201d and blast $5000 across the web to someone. Better hope you copy and pasted that address right so your money doesn\u2019t disappear into the void!When the Internet bubble burst many of today\u2019s marquee companies saw their stocks crash 85%. Yet they survived and the best was yet to come. Amazon and Google went on to dominate the world.The same will happen in crypto.The 10% of projects that make it through the bloodbath will turn into the Amazon, Google and Facebook of tomorrow and likely even the JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs as well, not to mention maybe even the governments of the future, like digital direct democracies or liquid democracies.Innovation is hard work. You\u2019re literally trying to create something that doesn\u2019t exist!There are no guidelines, no working templates, no business models to clone. There\u2019s nothing. You\u2019re on your own! It\u2019s just you and your imagination. With those odds of course 90% of people and companies fail!It doesn\u2019t matter.Crypto, blockchain and triple entry accounting are probably the most important invention of the last 500 years so they\u2019re not going to go gently into that good night.The bubble burst is just the next step. Three years after that the tech will really mature and take off running.2) Government Cryptocurrencies will\u00a0FlourishThe community won\u2019t like this one, but it\u2019s a no brainer.Many governments will not sit by and lose control of the money supply without a vicious fight. Anyone working on a project right now should be anticipating protocol level assaults on decentralized cryptos and designing defenses against them.A distributed, decentralized DDoS stopping grid, like the one from Gladius is a great first step but there is a lot more work to be done. We\u2019ll talk about some additional defenses cryptos needs to survive later when I come to the evolution of protocols.Governments will lose the battle in the long run, probably in thirty to one hundred years (maybe faster depending on how many wars or financial crises strike). That\u2019s provided we survive as a race, don\u2019t nuke ourselves, and push out into space. But in ten or twenty years expect very strong government cryptocurrencies to come to power and dominate the flow of money for many, if not most, people around the world.\u201cBut no one will adopt them!\u201d scream the crypto faithful!Of course, they will.The average person has zero understanding of just about anything that actually matters and they absolutely don\u2019t see a need for privacy and security until it\u2019s physically ripped away from them under extreme circumstances like a war. When soldiers invade your house and take everything you own suddenly the need for privacy becomes very real to people.Remember this interview with Snowden about government surveillance on the John Oliver show?Watch the look on Snowden\u2019s face when he realizes that the average man on the street doesn\u2019t know a damn thing about privacy and doesn\u2019t care about it in the least! The only time they care is when the government has a picture of their dick on file. Seriously.People will adopt government cryptos like good little sheep without a second thought. Even better, they\u2019ll think it\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do and they\u2019ll even be willing to kill for it if told that\u2019s right. Count on it!Of course, in many ways government issued cryptocurrencies are utterly ridiculous, as Naval Ravikant points out in his epic blockchain tweetstorm:They\u2019re nonsense because the very purpose of blockchain is to distribute power across a system. By not allowing a single group to control or change the rules arbitrarily, decentralized cryptos and apps provide a powerful set of checks and balances against harmful actions to the system.When five different banks own a blockchain, that\u2019s not a blockchain, that\u2019s a database. Only when the banks, the regulators, the shareholders and the customers of the bank hold the keys to the blockchain at the same time and can counteract each other\u2019s power is it a true blockchain.The checks and balances on power are exactly the point!Government crypto will represent a total and complete corruption of that idea.But it won\u2019t matter. They\u2019ll do it any way.In fact, instead of distributing power, they\u2019ll look to concentrate even more power, by giving themselves the ability to track every single citizen\u2019s spending with impunity and automatically collect taxes from wages and sales of goods and services. That\u2019s why authoritarian governments are racing to build official state cryptos. They can\u2019t wait to have panopticon money in your pocket as soon as possible.They will absolutely outlaw physical cash and they will do it under the guise of one of three excuses:Stopping money launderingStopping terroristsStopping crimeOf course, knowing that you spend half your paycheck on Amazon, groceries and rent has nothing to do with any of those things but hey, if you trot out any or all of the above reasons you can easily get half the population to do whatever you want and even better they\u2019ll believe it with all their hearts.Remember American psychologist Gustave Gilbert\u2019s talk with Nazi Herman Goring during the Nuremberg trials? Goring told him that most people will go along with whatever their leaders tell them to do without question, whether it\u2019s a democracy or fascist dictatorship.Naively, Gilber replied, \u201cThere is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.\u201dBut Goring only laughed and said, \u201cOh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.\u201dGovernment cryptos will be a very, very bitter pill to swallow for current true believers in the crypto space but they better get used to them.A better bet is to assume there\u2019ll be hybrid systems of decentralized and centralized crypto and to design for it right now to avoid getting swallowed in the tsunami to come. Better to embrace the current system with blockchain and then overwhelm it from within rather than ignore it so that it becomes hostile.3) Decentralized Cryptocurrencies Will Become a Parallel Economic Operating System for the\u00a0PlanetJust because centralized cryptos rise to prominence doesn\u2019t mean the decentralized cryptos will go away. Oh, many governments will try, but in the end they\u2019ll fail to stamp them out. The reasons are simple.The same factors that make it hard to form consensus across a blockchain, make it hard for all the world\u2019s governments to agree on anything. They won\u2019t be able to do it. Some governments will love decentralization and others will hate it.Even as some countries openly rail against them, many others will openly embrace decentralized cryptocurrencies, especially the ones who suffered the worst under the dominance of Europe and the US dollar over the last century.I see the Latin American countries, freewheeling no-holds-barred globalists like Singapore, historical bankers-to-the-world Switzerland and many of the Asian and African countries welcoming decentralized crypto with open arms, if only to stick it to the current empires.If all the countries don\u2019t agree, then decentralized cryptos are never going away, even as centralized cryptos come to power.But to remain relevant, decentralized cryptos need to move fast. They need a killer app. Right now they\u2019re vulnerable to attack. To really take root they need that killer app to spread virally across the globe. It\u2019s got to be something so indispensable that people can\u2019t imagine their lives without it. This will bring existing power players into the system and they will then use that power to defend it against attacks from outside powers.I outlined one of the ways that can happen in my article for gamifying the distribution of money. But that\u2019s just one way it can play out. There are many, many more. If you\u2019re working on a platform now, know that it\u2019s a race against time before central cryptos take root.4) The Killer App for Crypto is NOT a\u00a0BrowserThis is a classic example of grafting old inventions onto a new system. The Brave Browser is awesome and I bet I\u2019ll really love it as it gets paired with BAT and/or a universal payment system that automatically swaps cryptocurrencies without the need for an exchange but I don\u2019t see it as the final interface to the blockchain. I see it as a potential intermediate step.So what does the killer app look like?I don\u2019t know.But I know it is:UbiquitousEasy to useActs as a platform for everything from changing money to getting tickets to protecting privacy and information.Open sourceIt\u2019s also something totally new and original that expands and extends the best characteristics of the blockchain while minimizing its greatest weaknesses.Maybe a decentralized AI assistant or attention filter? The possibilities are endless so get moving!5) Blockchain is Just the Beginning of Decentralized ConsensusBlockchain systems are only the first successful implementation of decentralized consensus mechanisms.People are already inventing new ones like IOTA\u2019s Tangle and the HashGraph.It doesn\u2019t really matter if both of those projects prove failures in the long run because some other project will create another method. This is virtually guaranteed.Over the next twenty years, I predict dozens, if not hundreds of experimental distributed consensus protocols, capable of transaction levels that blow away Visa level processing, augmented by artificial intelligence systems.It\u2019s also strongly possible that none of these systems will be designed by humans.Instead AI\u2019s will rapidly iterate on ideas and come up with systems that no human ever could if they had a hundred years. They\u2019ll draw their inspiration from nature and systems of insects or roots or other biological systems like proteins.One or two of these systems will come to dominate all coins and become the meta-system to rule them all, uniting many different kinds of coins and running the entire system like a massive fractal that enables countless daughter networks to flourish inside of it.6) Crypto Will Get a LOT Easier to\u00a0UseToday\u2019s user experience in crypto is awful.If I mistype something or copy and paste wrong, my money disappears forever. If there\u2019s a software glitch I lose my money forever. If someone hacks my computer or phone my money is gone forever.See a trend there? Make any mistake you\u2019re toast. It\u2019s like driving a motorcycle on the edge of a one inch mountain road with no rail.The core wallets are slow, hard to use and ugly. When I last upgraded Ethereum, it forgot to keep my private keys so I had to go restore them all. Earlier this year I had an old Bitcoin stuck in an ancient version of Multibit from 2013. It took me a week to free it after the software mistakenly thought I had sent a transaction that was never actually broadcast.Imagine these wallets going into cold storage and coming out five years later. Will they even be usable? What happens when quantum computers come out and we need to completely update the basic protocols that underscore the system?The average person will never be able to do these procedures. Zero chance. Two decades in IT taught me that people can and will screw up their machines in ways that are utterly unimaginable to tech people. Murphy\u2019s Law rules.Even worse, there\u2019s no way to reverse any transaction or to secure it against mistakes. I foresee many algorithmic methods to freeze, roll back and protect transactions, as well as ways to self-escrow money and recover stolen money. Think of them as automated versions of calling the bank and declaring a card stolen.If grandma can\u2019t do it, forget it. Everyone is not an IT person who can bang away at the Linux terminal.Only systems that provide all the features of the old system plus brand new features achieve mass adoption.Think about CD-ROM books from the 80\u2019s again. They had a bunch of new features, like charts and color and you could back them up.But it wasn\u2019t good enough because CD\u2019s had fatal flaws. Ray Kurzweil calls this the \u201cfalse pretender\u201d phase of evolutionary development in his book The Singularity is Near. The new tech has some advantages but too many disadvantages to really make it with the wider world and replace the old technology.It wasn\u2019t until Kindles and iPads came along that eReaders had all the old features of reading a book, such as portability and being easy on the eyes, plus new features like the ability to carry a thousand books with you at once, something no dead tree could compete with, that it could really take off.Cryptos must follow a similar path from fatally flawed to bringing untold new powers to people and businesses to acheive world dominance.I also see many of the kinds of systems we really need arising from the desire to pass digital money down to your children. For that we will need ad-hock banks formed with groups of people as needed or algorithmic banks and bullet proof multi-signature wallets with decentralized cloud or foglet services to act as the final arbiter.It won\u2019t be enough to simply shard up your keys and give them to trusted friends or loved ones. That is a first pass solution. Friends stop being friends, people get divorced or die or worse. We need something better and completely automated.Think about how hard it would be to pass your Bitcoin down to your loved ones now. What if you died tomorrow or got hit on the head and forgot your password?Even if you plan for it, it kind of sucks too.You would have to create a will, lock a backup of your private keys and wallet in a safe, give the password to an estate lawyer and hope that he doesn\u2019t make off with it or the USB stick or Trezor/Nano doesn\u2019t die. You could also create a multi-signature wallet with some friends and family members and hope someone doesn\u2019t check a different version into Github with a backdoor or bug and screw it up. All of it is ugly and immature. It\u2019s unacceptable.By the way, if you want to start a crypto business that everyone will need in the future, solve the inheritance problem. Everyone will pay you gladly.I foresee drag and drop smart contracts and AI generated wills with self-escrowing money. In essence, the blockchain itself will be the bank and the customer service department, perhaps using your biometric markers and third party proof-of-staked groups or a decentralized AI that can verify your loved ones, as well as trigger events like your end of days. Automated password and key recovery will be STOP.Whatever it looks like, we\u2019ll need algorithmic approximations of the controls we have now for giving money to people we want and keeping it out of the hands of people who want to rob us. We also need the system to protect us from accidents, death and going nuts.7) The protocols of Coins will Get Abstracted from the Coins ThemselvesRight now all the coins that exist are inextricably bound to their protocols.I expect us to abstract away the protocols for exchanging, sending and receiving as well as securing, defending and storing our coins.This will mirror the evolution of today\u2019s servers from bare metal to virtualization to containers to serverless.To start with, most coins can\u2019t scale. We can\u2019t even come close to hitting Visa level transaction processing on chain, the holy grail of any crypto system and the subject of much in-fighting and controversy. Bitcoin can do 7 transactions per second at its peak.Some people have gone so far as to consider this a virtue of the coin as it encourages people to save and store it rather than send it.That\u2019s just absurd.We should be able to move the coin as fast and as far and as often as we like.Let\u2019s face it, the 1 MB limit is nothing but a hack. Originally Bitcoin had no limit. Then Satoshi snuck it in overnight with no mention of it and no explanation in the source code. It was most likely nothing but a ham-fisted way to prevent DDoS attacks.We can and will come up with better flooding protections.Are you a 1MB adherent? How about SegWit2X\u2019s 2MB? Maybe you go for Bitcoin Cash\u2019s 8MB block?Wrong. All of them wrong and ridiculous.According to the folks at the Lightning Network if we had seven billion people doing a mere two transactions a day it would take:24 GB blocks3.5 TB/day1.27 PB per yearWe need to think differently and evolve beyond petty nonsense to design real solutions. To survive Bitcoin and crypto must change. It\u2019s got to be easy to integrate new defenses, newer cryptographic algorithms when quantum computers come knocking and better speeds and innovations.We can\u2019t just rest on the laurels of the Satoshi vision and assume he thought of everything.He didn\u2019t.And frankly, who gives a fuck what Satoshi thinks? He left the project. If he really wanted to guide it he could have stuck around like Linus did with Linux. But he didn\u2019t. He left it up to the rest of us to figure it all out.So let\u2019s really start to do that because the current system won\u2019t stand or will just become dominated by mega-payment processors just like the system we have right now.One way to do that is to abstract all the protocols and run all the older coins as something equivalent to virtual machines or containers. Then the rules are separate from the coins themselves.That\u2019s just one way, but to really become the promised breakthrough technology, blockchain needs real innovation.Either way, people need to think quick, or we\u2019ll still be debating 1 MB versus 2 MB while the CryptoRuble and CryptoYuan blow past us.We\u2019ll also need this because it will become necessary to defend against hostile actors and APTs (advanced persistent threat) protocol level attacks. Think the Great Firewall of China attacking or blocking transactions by screwing with packets and headers with state level man in the middle attacks. The NEM architecture is a good first step, as it includes firewall like protection for nodes.But it needs to go further to stop even more insidious and devastating assaults and it can\u2019t take fours years and a hard fork to implement the solution.The best solutions will likely be externalized security rule chains downloaded to all nodes in the network that act as intrusion detection, firewalls and protocol inspectors and AI based auto-evolving rulesets and countermeasures.Think Neuromancer\u2019s ICE.8) We will have Four Dominant Meta Coins, Plus Fifty to One Hundred Minor Coins, and Infinite Virtual Variations of These Coins, Plus State\u00a0CoinsRight now we\u2019re making coins for everything.Got an identity platform like Civic? Make a coin.Created decentralized DNS? Make a coin and ICO!Building a scratch-your-ass on the blockchain app? You need a coin my friend!Actually you don\u2019t need a coin.Coins will start to shake out into various meta categories. At this point I can only see four types of coins needed, with a blockchain of blockchains (or post-blockchain tech) seamlessly swapping them as needed to consume services:Deflationary Saver CoinInflationary Spender CoinAction TokenReward TokenDeflationary coins are for hoarding and investing. They will rise over time and benefit savers. Everyone needs this kind of investment and it\u2019s the reason Bitcoin started in the first place.An inflationary coin mirrors the dollar today. Nobody likes spending Bitcoin on a flat screen TV only to realize that they paid $175,000 for it a few years later as the price of Bitcoin rockets up. We need stable, spendable coins. Imagine this as the classic \u201cstore of value\u201d Paul Krugman is always bitching about and know that we actually do need this to buy and sell every day goods.An action token is for actions on the network that should always be free such as voting or sending a text message. These are not microtransactions. Resetting my password on something should not cost the equivalent of two pennies. As the EOS folks say \u201cIf you went to Amazon and it cost three cents to load the page, nobody would load the page.\u201dReward tokens are designed to flow around the system as a digital representation of karma, incentivizing good behavior and punishing bad behavior.You could literally build the ultimate universal system with just these four coins. Every other coin could simply act as a subcomponent of those coins with different metadata.9) We\u2019ll Learn We Didn\u2019t Know Crap About EconomicsAre you a Keynesian planner or an Austrian free market adherent?The answer is who cares?All of our economic theories are based on studies conducting with limited data in the analog age of ink and wood pulp. All current economic theory will prove about as advanced as cave paintings as we experiment with new economic systems over the coming years.That\u2019s what these new coins are: Micro-economic systems at war.It\u2019s Darwinian economics.A few basic laws of economics will hold true but many of them will simply fall by the wayside. That\u2019s because with blockchain dominate systems we\u2019ll have real time economic data on a global scale not just a bunch of guesses done with pencil and paper a hundred years ago.As artificial intelligence tracks statistics in real time around the globe we\u2019ll be able to see the real effects of a steel tariff enacted in one country as prices shoot up for building in another country dependent on that steel. We\u2019ll track global production and manufacturing with unbelievable precision and what we learn will very much surprise us in so many wonderful ways.10) A DAO Will Grow to Fortune 500\u00a0StatusThe most likely DAO to reach this milestone will be a DAO that mirrors an open version of Visa, in that it will likely take cuts from the transactions and miners on the most dominant network and it will help fund the future development and governance of that network.It will not hoard all the money but act as a nexus that flows the money down to other businesses and DAOs via smart contract as well as to state and local governments and other non-governmental entities that benefit the network.To do that though the DAO has to evolve.Right now we think of DAO\u2019s as a smart contract. Not even close.\u201cHow beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, / That has such people in\u00a0\u2018t!\u201dA DAO will require AI to help manage and mitigate its rulesets and it will need to be able to auto-generate templated governance models. Governance is everything in DAOs and there are no good scalable models yet to manage a company the size of a major corporation today as an open source meritocratic workplace. Early DAOs failed because they have what I call the Brave New World problem.Everyone imagines they\u2019re the chief and nobody wants to take out the trash.It\u2019s hard to order paperclips when everyone is a king in a DAO.To function effectively a team needs role players and stars. People also have to understand their role and accept it, even if it will change later as they build merit and experience in the system.Management is hard enough as it is in corporate environments. How do you fire someone for non-performance in a DAO? How do you ensure that the guy in charge of ICO security is actually qualified and not just elected because everyone likes him? You can\u2019t risk someone running off with $45 million in Bitcoin because Bob got elected for his great stories about Burning Man and his painting skills.The automated corporate and non-profit architectures of tomorrow will have to evolve incredible tools for ongoing management and decision making as well as operating agreements that function like code to become a reality.11) The Gig Economy Will Grow Big\u00a0TimePeople from the World War II generation had one or two jobs their whole life.Today we have five or six.Tomorrow\u2019s people will have five or six at the same time.Half of those income streams will be automated and passive, likely some kind of crypto UBI. We will also see the rise of AI job matching services. The machines will know your capabilities and skill sets and match short term gigs to you so you don\u2019t even have to look for a job.Imagine a software project that requires an insane amount of code, something like ten trillion lines. Software projects are only getting more complicated and will continue to grow. AI\u2019s will write and test half of it but people will write the other half. The project would get fed into a distributed, decentralized system that chunks up and parses out the work, acts like a project manager and delivers the work to coders all across the worldwide network based on the reputation and skillset fingerprint.Think of it like an AI Github married to UpWork and the Mechanical Turk system.It could work for manufacturing and all kinds of blue collar work as well, which can make a big dent in the haves and have-nots divide we see today.The Hong Kong subway AI is perhaps the first prototype of this kind of network, even if it\u2019s not a perfect analogy. It predicts what will fail on the subway and sends engineers to get ahead of the failures. That makes the uptime of the world\u2019s busiest subway 99%.Much of this will be governed by Externalized Reputation Banks powered by blockchains that will be the social credit of tomorrow.This will be both good and very, very evil.Black Mirror\u2019s Social\u00a0Credit.On the evil side of the house we have the Chinese Social Credit system that is about as Black Mirror as it gets today. It will get infinitely worse as nation-states use Reputation Banks to cram ideology down people\u2019s throats.But open, publicly managed Rep Banks will help us find relationships and work and figure out who to trust in business and in life.It will be a double edged sword.The main challenge is that very few people can agree on what is good or bad in a system and ideology tends to warp those concepts into unrecognizable messes. It will be incredibly easy to create a ruleset that enslaves us all if we\u2019re not careful.The Controversy KingsI just cranked through some of the easier predictions to make. Now let\u2019s toss out a few that just might spark fierce debates and controversy in the community.12) The Blockchain Will Enable All Kinds of\u00a0EvilCrypto enthusiasts will have to come to terms with the fact that the blockchain can and will enable as much evil as it does good.Nothing is all good or evil. Everything exists on a continuum. You can kill someone with a gun but you can also feed your family by hunting. Water sustains life but it can also drown you or even poison you.If you\u2019re out there designing a system right now with the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d DevOps approach, just know that it\u2019s most likely a disaster for systems that can algorithmically govern many aspects of our lives.Instead, you should adopt a go slow, think about it and don\u2019t break things approach.You should start thinking about all the ways to destroy your system or you won\u2019t be able to defend it. If you aren\u2019t imagining all the ways a hostile group will use the power of blockchain, one that doesn\u2019t share your views on openness and freedom and collaboration, then you\u2019re just naive.I\u2019m half way through an article called \u201cWhat If Hitler Had the Blockchain?\u201d Frankly, I don\u2019t want to publish it because I don\u2019t want to give the bad guys any fresh ideas but rest assured it probably doesn\u2019t matter. Their dark minds are already hard at work imagining how to use blockchain as a system of repression and control.I will be somewhat intentionally vague here, so as not to put all of these ideas out into the collective unconscious but think digital tracking of all aspects of your life from where you go and what you do, to statistical predictions about your behavior, as well as behavioral algorithms designed to incentivize you to conform to an ideology, and lastly think unbreakable digital rights management and outright genocide.Genocide?Yeah.Don\u2019t forget that IBM helped the Nazis manage the holocaust with punch cards for tracking victims.What could they have done with blockchain? Answer: Many more horrible atrocities that we can only begin to imagine now.Maybe you think that an open system will always prevent abuses?Wrong.If the Internet has taught us anything it\u2019s that open systems tend towards centralization and given enough time central powers can and will subvert and corrupt any system to their own ends.If you\u2019re working in crypto and you\u2019re not thinking about all the ways to misuse crypto then it\u2019s very likely that instead of designing a system to save the world you just created a prison for it.13) Bitcoin Has a 50/50 Shot At SurvivingMost true believers will not like this one but honestly, 50/50 might be really, really high here.I know, I know. You\u2019ve heard it all before! The Money Badger can\u2019t be stopped! New ATH!!!! Buy and HODLz forever!Look you stuck with me this long so stick with me a little longer so I can explain.First off, I\u2019m rooting for Bitcoin to live until my dying days but let\u2019s look at this objectively for a few minutes to see why it might go down hard. It\u2019s probably not what you think.Bitcoin has first mover advantage. It\u2019s the absolute first of its kind and still dominates the global market share but it also suffers from a number of major flaws that could kill it.Basically, it\u2019s the Model T of the blockchain revolution.How many Model T\u2019s do you see on the street today?Can you retrofit a Model T to make it burn rubber like a Lamborghini? Can you add sophisticated electronics to make it a self-driving Tesla? Nope.To start with, Bitcoin has no built-in governance. This is a crucial flaw. Only a few ways to change it exist. The first is to submit a proposal where almost everyone agrees and as we have seen with SegWit, that\u2019s incredibly hard. It took four years for the change to get adopted.The second is to start a new project and hard fork it. This might be the only way this actually works in the end. A team might fork it and build in governance, but it\u2019s a long shot.A coin with well designed, widespread, build-in governance will have a massive advantage over Bitcoin and could easily replace it, as it makes upgrades seamless and smooth.Upgrades and responses to attacks by well funded hostile forces will need to move fast and percolate throughout the network in hours or days, not years.What about scaling? We already talked about that problem. Changing the blocksize won\u2019t cut it. It will require something more radical.What if China turns the Great Firewall on it? Would it even be possible to retrofit private relays and other anti-interference code into the system at this late stage?What if governments simply decide that they will spend a billion dollars on a datacenter and secretly designed ASICs to run the system? Could any miners compete?What if hostiles just decided to round up all the core developers? How easy would it be to replace them considering the tremendous shortage of talent in the crypto world now?These are only some of the nearly insurmountable problems of my favorite crypto. I point them out not to kill it but to make people think. If you can really see a problem you can find a way to fix it. But if we\u2019re only going to deal with fake problems like the blocksize limit we will get nowhere.Bitcoin is a beautiful, brilliant idea and it\u2019s already changed the world. It won\u2019t fail because it\u2019s a fraud or a scam, but because of its own hard coded rules, in-fighting and lack of governance.Of course, it doesn\u2019t have to fail. We can start thinking about how to save it right here, right now.As I noted earlier, some kind of virtualization or containerization that allows Bitcoin to adapt and evolve by migrating to an abstracted set of protocols and defenses would help ensure that it not only survives but thrives.I\u2019m rooting for it. I\u2019m betting if you\u2019re reading this, you are too.The best way to make sure it survives is to understand all the real reasons it could fail and start designing real solutions to those problems today, so that when they do arrive, we\u2019re ready.The Final\u00a0FrontierI have a lot more predictions but I\u2019ll save them for my fiction. Maybe I\u2019ll do a followup if this article goes viral.I also left a few evil ideas off the table because I don\u2019t want to see them come to pass. If someone else comes up with them, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it but the worst scenarios in the Monte Carlo pathways of tomorrow will not come from my keyboard.Cryptocurrencies represent a fundamental upgrade to the economic systems of the world. Once they\u2019re fully booted up and integrated into the global and interplanetary networks of the future, the world will look very, very different in ways we can only begin to understand.Hundreds of years from now, today\u2019s economies will look like the feudal economies of the past.Cyrptocurrencies, decentralized apps and DAOs even hold the possibility of bootstrapping us into Star Trek like post-scarcity economies but it will take time.I\u2019m not betting on Singularity level acceleration taking us there tomorrow, even if I sprinkle the Singularity into all my sci-fi work because it\u2019s the stuff of great fiction. But it\u2019s probably not reality.If I\u2019m wrong, then my uploaded and snapshotted virtual mind, running on a global fog of computronium in a Matrioshka brain will just have to deal with it.But I doubt it.So where does that leave us?Crypto will be both good and evil like everything in life.If you\u2019re working on crypto then you\u2019re building the world of tomorrow but don\u2019t expect it to arrive next week.Inertia has a way of slowing down even the fastest rockets.Just enjoy the ride while we boldly go where no one has gone before.############################################Check out the interview I did with the awesome Core Media team on the future of #crypto on SoundCloud:############################################If you love my work please visit my Patreon page because that\u2019s where I share special insights with all my fans.

The software I\u2019ve written has been used by millions of users, hundreds of developers, and the talks I\u2019ve given have led directly to the creation of several startups. I\u2019ve talked about Bitcoin on Sky TV and BBC News. I have been repeatedly cited by the Economist as a Bitcoin expert and prominent developer. I have explained Bitcoin to the SEC, to bankers and to ordinary people I met at cafes.From the start, I\u2019ve always said the same thing: Bitcoin is an experiment and like all experiments, it can fail. So don\u2019t invest what you can\u2019t afford to lose. I\u2019ve said this in interviews, on stage at conferences, and over email. So have other well known developers like Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik.But despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards. I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.Why has Bitcoin failed? It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked \u201csystemically important institutions\u201d and \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people. Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. The mechanisms that should have prevented this outcome have broken down, and as a result there\u2019s no longer much reason to think Bitcoin can actually be better than the existing financial system.Think about it. If you had never heard about Bitcoin before, would you care about a payments network that:Couldn\u2019t move your existing moneyHad wildly unpredictable fees that were high and rising fastAllowed buyers to take back payments they\u2019d made after walking out of shops, by simply pressing a button (if you aren\u2019t aware of this \u201cfeature\u201d that\u2019s because Bitcoin was only just changed to allow it)Is suffering large backlogs and flaky payments\u2026 which is controlled by China\u2026 and in which the companies and people building it were in open civil war?I\u2019m going to hazard a guess that the answer is no.", "responses": "371"}, {"title": "Amazon is the biggest threat to bitcoin right\u00a0now", "author_name": "Coin and Crypto", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/amazon-is-the-biggest-threat-to-bitcoin-right-now-62a56d8435e4?source=search_post---------5", "post_date": "Dec 12, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "23K", "content": "Amazon is the biggest threat to bitcoin right\u00a0nowCoin and CryptoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 12, 2017Over the past year, a growing number of people have leapt to take part in bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise. Teenagers have invested their college funds. Some families have mortgaged their homes and placed everything on the table. Even billionaires have suggested putting 10% of all assets into the digital currency.There is a lot of money in play and people\u2019s livelihoods and savings are on the line.

But could the real threat come from a more material realm?UPDATE: before you continue reading, here\u2019s something you should know. We built a tool to let traders place stoplosses and take profits at the same time. If that\u2019s your thing, check it\u00a0out!\ud83d\udc49 https://signalgroups.comAmazon is the largest online retailer in the\u00a0worldBoasting over 94 billion USD in sales last year, it handles almost half of all American online purchases and has operations across the globe. But despite offering a large variety of payment options, Amazon has yet to allow people to pay with bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.As the leader in online retail, it\u2019s in a prime position to do so. Any cryptocurrency Amazon adopted would surely see a huge surge of support. Given the current popularity of cryptocurrency, what exactly is Amazon waiting for?BarriersOne of the reasons Amazon may be avoiding cryptocurrency is their limited transaction speeds. Take a look at the top two major cryptocurrencies.bitcoin: 7 transactions per secondethereum: 15 transactions per secondAmazon peaked at 600 transactions per second during last year\u2019s Amazon prime sale. If even a fraction of their traffic decided to pay with cryptocurrency, consumers would be stuck waiting hours for transactions to go through. Not a great customer experience.Do slow transaction fees mean Amazon will avoid cryptocurrency? The tech giant is no stranger to innovative scaling solutions. Bitcoin and ethereum are currently too slow to support Amazon\u2019s demands but other cryptocurrencies are not. An alternative cryptocurrency called ripple has tested speeds as high as 1500 transactions per second.Why Amazon Might be Considering CryptocurrenciesAlthough it hasn\u2019t announced an official position on cryptocurrencies, there are several indicators that suggest Amazon is considering this space and not necessarily in a bitcoin friendly way.On October 31st Amazon reportedly bought amazonethereum.com, amazoncryptocurrency.com, and amazoncryptocurrencies.com. This move might be simply covering their bases. Or it might be insight into future endeavours.There are already services that sell amazon gift cards for bitcoin so in some respect Amazon offering bitcoin on their site would simply cut out the middlemanFinally one of Amazon\u2019s core principles is \u2018Customer Obsession\u2019. If customers demand a cryptocurrency payment method Amazon is sure to eventually give them what they want.Given that many of its shoppers buy goods internationally, cryptocurrency could be an excellent way for shoppers to enjoy a standardized currency without worrying about exchange rates.What Could\u00a0HappenThere are a few ways this could play out that could endanger bitcoin\u2019s current reign:1. Amazon could stay out of the cryptocurrency sectorIn order to cross the chasm from investment to currency, bitcoin needs to gain widespread adoption from merchants. It\u2019s unlikely that Amazon will stay out of this sector indefinitely but if it did bitcoin would certainly suffer from being excluded by the world\u2019s largest online retailer. This wouldn\u2019t kill bitcoin, but it would hurt its potential as a currency.2. Amazon could adopt a competitor to bitcoinThis seems likely if bitcoin cannot keep up with Amazon\u2019s required transaction speeds. Ripple is a potential contender with 1000+ TPS. This scenario could definitely endanger bitcoin\u2019s reign as the top cryptocurrency. A fictional deal with Visa raised the value of the Monaco cryptocurrency by almost 700%. Any deal with Amazon will rocket the partner cryptocurrency upwards. If Amazon chooses to go this route it probably wouldn\u2019t kill bitcoin, but whatever coin they went with could knock bitcoin out of its top spot.3. Amazon could create its own cryptocurrencyIf Amazon Prime video is any indication\u200a\u2014\u200aAmazon loves to play in high potential spaces where it can leverage its huge army of developers to make big plays. Its holdings range from cloud storage, to video streaming, to hardware offerings. If it sees potential in the cryptocurrency space it has the technical resources to break into it.It would not be the first time a large established company has launched their own token. In September 2017, the chat giant Kik launched an ICO raising $75 million dollars. Overstock, a publically traded e-commerce company, has seen its stock raise by 30% since announcing it plans to ICO this December.If Amazon created its own cryptocurrency they could spread its use across their many services: from Amazon Prime, to Twitch, to Audible, allowing consumers to easily transfer funds within the Amazon ecosystem. They could outcompete any other cryptocurrency and entice mainstream adoption by offering a 5% or 10% discount on purchases made with AmazonCoin. With tens of thousands of developers and high paying salaries it could find the technical talent to design a coin that outpaces bitcoin when it comes to scaling and privacy concerns.This is the most dangerous scenario for bitcoin but it relies on Amazon taking a major leap into a field it has so far avoided.Keep an eye on Amazon as demand for cryptocurrencies risesFor now Amazon seems to be keeping quiet about its plans in this space. But whatever cryptocurrency Amazon chooses could become a household name overnight.Whether Amazon chooses bitcoin, ethereum, or something else altogether, their choice will have dramatic consequences on the existing cryptocurrency landscape. Cryptocurrency and the technology behind it are here to stay, but bitcoin and its reign as the number one cryptocurrency might not be.Enjoy this article?

Perhaps more importantly, I\u2019ve decided to also share my underlying philosophy. As a reminder, I know nothing. None of this should be construed as investment advice, and you should do your own research before making any investments. I would be financially okay if I lost all of my invested money: you should make sure you could survive a total loss before investing any funds.But enough of that, how should you approach investing in cryptocurrencies? First, I advocate creating your own investment tenets. Tenets are also a crucial aspect of the product management process. I recommend creating tenets before diving into any business, project or problem.Why do we write tenets?Tenets are used to make hard decisionsEach tenet expresses the conflict arising from two (or more) competing philosophiesEach tenet ultimately demonstrates preference for one philosophy over othersMost people have their own philosophies and preferences, but they don\u2019t write them down. Writing them out is crucial because it crystalizes your thinking. Tenets are helpful when times are good and indispensable when things get tough. You should debate your tenets heavily with family, friends, and yourself. Below I share five of my cryptocurrency investment tenets:Jason\u2019s Cryptocurrency Tenets [January 2018]1) I will prioritize platform investments (think Ethereum) over application investments (think Dash). Strong infrastructure scales and changes the world. Successful applications are hard to predict and are not stable over time. Platforms better withstand changing customer needs.2) I will choose cryptocurrencies with user adoption and strong focus on user adoption over cryptocurrencies with the latest tech or prettiest whitepapers.3) I will take the super-long term view. I will prioritize cryptocurrency that have the potential to be trillion dollar businesses and will stay away from currencies with more barriers to widespread adoption. If a cryptocurrency is unlikely to ever be used en masse, I won\u2019t buy it. I investment in fundamentals not merely public opinion.4) I will greatly value signals in the market, especially signals from entities with inside information and large investment positions\u200a\u2014\u200apotentially over even my own analysis.5) I value cryptocurrencies that demonstrate the ability to change direction, pivot quickly and make decisions over cryptocurrencies that emphasize status quo, tradition, and moving wisely but slowly. I recognize this is partly a function of team structure and leadership.After painstakingly working through my tenets, I\u2019ve researched many of the cryptocoins available today. Based on my personal investment philosophy and this research, I\u2019ve made several investments over the last month. Here\u2019s my positions as of January 11th 2018:Jason\u2019s Cryptocurrency Portfolio* as of January 11th 2018:Ethereum: 50%Stellar: 20%Neo: 20%Request Network: 10%*I\u2019ve rounded these numbers to make them prettier.Ethereum: 50%As we wrote in Blockchain Technology: \u201cBlockchain technology creates information networks. The fundamental rule of networks is that when a new person joins any network, the network becomes exponentially more valuable. As a corollary, each time another person joins a widely-used network, it becomes exponentially harder for competing networks to offer similar value to people. You use Facebook because all of your friends are on the platform. You are less likely to use a new social network because few of your friends would be on it. As a result, networks tend to produce winner-takes-all markets. Facebook, WeChat and a few other businesses, for example, dominate the social networking space. We expect a similar winner-take-all outcome for blockchain technology. So far, founders have created many hundreds of digital coins. They will create thousands more over the next few years. We expect a handful of these digital coins to successfully walk out onto the global stage, while the vast majority of these coins will ultimately become valueless.\u201dAmazon is a platform. Facebook is a platform. Platforms dominate the internet. As we\u2019ve seen from Ethereum\u2019s creation of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) platform, platform coins will dominate the blockchain coin as well. We\u2019ll see many cryptocoins repositioning themselves as platform coins, especially starting in the second half of 2018 and into 2019 when many smaller, more niche coins start to flame out. Based on my research, Ethereum is currently best positioned to win the platform war. Pure and simple. I may change my view in the next few months or quarters but for now Ethereum gets the majority of my money.Stellar: 20%Stellar is a platform that wants to make it really easy for companies to ICO (versus using Ethereum). Stellar is ultra-focused on this use case, but that\u2019s okay, because this use case is massive.Again, per Blockchain Technology, \u201c[blockchain] technology can also make physical-world assets more liquid (easier to sell and buy) by making them more reducible. In other words, the blockchain better facilitates ownership of assets across multiple people\u2026 while mega-companies (e.g., Amazon, AirBnB) have successfully built their own digital marketplaces in the past, blockchain provides the available-to-all, trust-building, low-cost financial infrastructure via smart contracts, secure transactions, and an authoritative ledger to [almost anyone]\u2026Unlike crowd-funding sites like Kickstarter, where early backers receive nothing but a product or service, ICOs let entities actually own part of meaningful ideas.\u201dThe tokenization of assets via blockchain is going to change the world. So far, this use case is the only one Ethereum has proved it can solve and I find it possible that Stellar eats some of Ethereum\u2019s pie: I am watching Stellar carefully. Stellar focuses on usability (think: MVP) instead of extensibility (think: useless features). The founder started Mt. GOX and built the initial framework for Ripple. Stellar is backed by Stripe and has support from top advisors in tech.Neo: 20%Over the last decade, China has made it clear that they want to build their own solutions to world problems. I expect this trend to continue into the blockchain world, and expect at least a duopoly platform paradigm (at least one major smart contract platform for the West, and at least one smart contract platform for the East).Request Network: 10%Request Network is a platform specifically focused on the payments space (built on top of Ethereum). While the sized of the tokenization of assets space (e.g. ICO) is almost incalculable, the payments space remains enormous. Request Network is a big team bet. As a product leader, I value team organization a lot. I\u2019ve studied the core developers of many of the top blockchain coins, and find that most projects are being run relatively poorly compared to more traditional software development projects today (partly a function of decentralization of blockchain teams). Many teams don\u2019t have updated visions or project plans and as a result miss deadlines and seem to be prioritizing things no one wants. Request Network strikes me as agile, able to pivot quickly, and ruthlessly focused on user growth and customer experience. (I love the bi-weekly updates.). I also immensely value their time in YCombinator, the top startup incubator in the world.Like the pre-blockchain startup world, real-life customer feedback is everything. I want a team desperate to get their coin to market. From there, they can interact with real customers and then make technical changes that are likely to lead to meaningful improvements for real customers.Mainstream cryptocoins I am NOT invested in:BitcoinIn my opinion, a huge milestone for blockchain technology will be to move away from the Bitcoin Hegemony. Right now, the cryptocurrency market as whole is psychologically entwined with Bitcoin. When Bitcoin plummets, the market plummets, although we\u2019ve seen signs of change in the last few weeks. In 2018, I predict that Ethereum (or another platform) will surpass Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market will finally detangle itself from Bitcoin.I don\u2019t find pro-Bitcoin arguments particularly strong. Initially, Bitcoin initially saw a lot of success helping entities perform discreet transactions (think: Silk Road). Currently, though, Bitcoin isn\u2019t particularly helpful in the payments space (slow, expensive, and unfocused): the digital currency is unlikely to scale to widespread user adoption for payments. Bitcoin also can\u2019t help with ICOs: it is not a platform. Perhaps most concerning, from a development perspective Bitcoin moves slowly, has divided leadership, and doesn\u2019t practice user-driven development (at least compared to other digital coins). Proponents cite these characteristics as advantages and argue that Bitcoin is a store of value.We flesh out the digital coin role as a store of value in Blockchain Technology: \u201cBlockchain technology also has potential to provide a new independent store of value. Today, the classic independent store of value, gold, is partly valuable because humans have decided to value it independently of nation states (e.g., Canada) or nation alliances (e.g., the European Union) unlike other mainstream currencies (e.g., the United States dollar is closely tied to the success of the United States of America). Gold is generally inversely correlated with the US dollar: in other words, gold acts as a hedge against the current global financial system. Because gold is difficult to store\u200a\u2014\u200aheavy, relatively insecure\u200a\u2014\u200adigital blockchain-currencies represent an attractive alternative. If digital currencies become more stable over time (currently, they are extremely volatile), they may one day augment or supplement assets such as gold.\u201dThe problem is that no one uses Bitcoin as a stable store of value today. Additionally, Bitcoin is relatively uncorrelated with the US dollar, so it doesn\u2019t act as a particularly useful hedge. Ultimately, I think digital coins will be strong store of values, but this is far, far down the road. At that point, I find that other cryptocoins are just as likely or more likely to act as global store of values compared to Bitcoin.I further argued that the bigger and more immediate store of value opportunity is \u201chelping entities buy into the global financial system in the first place. In developing countries, for example, many entities are eager to shift local, unstable currencies to stable currencies such as the US dollar to better protect their wealth. Like the US dollar today, the blockchain-backed currencies that facilitate world transactions tomorrow will also naturally act as a store of value. Entities will invest in these currencies as they do the US dollar today. As a result, the same blockchain-based currencies that gain mainstream adoption for payments are also likely to gain mainstream adoption as stores of value.\u201d We will be forever indebted to Bitcoin but 2018 will mark Ethereum passing Bitcoin, the marketing falling, and then ultimately rebounding stronger than before. The age of the Blockchain Platform is beginning.Privacy-centric cryptocoinWhile, private, fully-anonymous transactions are a large blockchain use case, coins emphasizing privacy will struggle to gain mass adoption in the long-term. I expect privacy-centric coins to bear the brunt of initial government scrutiny and regulation. I choose to make my investments on the more public side of the blockchain movement. That said, Monero would be my current pick in the privacy-centric digital coin space.RippleAs we wrote in Blockchain Technology: \u201cin the short-term, partial blockchain solutions [like Ripple] will become common. Already, financial institutions are creating their own private blockchain networks and producing digital coin. Participating institutions act as nodes in the blockchain, and have visibility into all transaction on the shared digital ledger.\u201dI like Ripple, and particularly the focus on getting customers. Like many others, however, I am concerned about the difference between the highly-valuable Ripple Payment Protocol and XRP as an investment vehicle. I also see in-house blockchain development from large institutions as meaningful competition.ThanksHopefully my perspective is helpful. If I helped you crystallize your own thinking, I\u2019d very much appreciate a small donation to my Ethereum wallet.Ethereum wallet: 0x81ff5029a05ce15c3b6d6e27c7d89a7c30ecaf32Or just clap a lot =)To trade, I buy Ethereum in CoinBase and then move these coins into Binance.Coinbase: https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a39ac52c9e83802d5f70a27Binance: https://www.binance.com/?ref=18572991Again, this is not investment advice.

This post was originally written in Feb-2018. I have kept it updated since then. There are two squeals to this story1) Cartel Strike #3: Bitcoin Dump from 10K to 7.5K in May-182) Cartel Strike #4: Bitcoin Dump from 6.5K to 3.5K in Nov-18Please do not reproduce. You ARE WELCOME to post a short summary and link to this post. Please get the permission on my twitter before reproducing in other languages.\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 \u2014Every market has three major dimensions and everyone knows\u00a0that1) Technical Analysis 2) Fundamental Analysis 3) Manipulation.\u2192 The 4th dimension of the\u00a0marketThere is 4th dimension that exists in FEW Markets, Its called \u201cCartel\u201d. Its primary Goal is \u201cPrice-suppression\u201d. Please note\u200a\u2014\u200ait IS NOT \u201cManipulation\u201d.What is the difference between Manipulation and Suppression?Manipulation is ALWAYS for Money.\u00a0Suppression is NEVER for money. Preserving current power control is the goal of suppression!!Is Cartel Active in Crypto\u00a0Space?Absolutely. I am presenting my research so you can validate yourself.I called for Bitcoin correction of 95% before CME opened its doors. Check my Twitter account @Super_Crypto So far 83% of it is already in place. (But don\u2019t expect 95% correction to happen in one shot. We will see Rallies and Dumps in between. Nothing goes in a straight line. 20K is just the first inning. We are in for a long ride of a few years. This is a 9 inning game)Since When Cartel Is\u00a0Active?Cartel entered Crypto space somewhere in Oct-2017. Their presence started showing the HOUR CME-Futures Market Opened it doors for Crypto.Bitcoin DUMP started exactly at the moment CME opened Doors at 5PM on Dec-17\u20132017. See this Daily Bitcoin chart (image last updated Nov-24\u20132018)Don\u2019t believe in\u00a0Cartel?Good luck to you!! Most denied cartel\u2019s presence and have been brutally slaughtered since the DUMP started.(Updated Dec-2018) Finally, After 83% Drop Andreas Antonopoulos talked about\u00a0CartelIt took 12 months and 83% of drop for people to accept the fact about the \u201cGlobal Banking Cartel\u201d. And during this time most missed the biggest opportunity of their life by denying the existence of the Cartel. Anyways, better late than never!Let me disappoint you: There is no\u00a0escape!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgI0liAee4s&feature=youtu.beThis Is How Cartel has Worked Since CME\u00a0openedCheck this chart. Click on the image and read all NEWS as they were \u201cReleased\u201d EXACTLY at the important TA resistances levels.Please note: The items listed under Jan-30 and Mar-07 below are the NEWS ONLY. This is how cartel uses media-propaganda to break the price. Ex: Mt. Gox did NOT sell on Mar-07 but the NEWS of this sell was released on Mar-07. Also, the Tether subpoena was issued in Dec-6 but the NEWS was released with the other critical news releases on Jan-30 with the objective to start the next dump\u2026.Why did they wait 55 days to release the Tether subpoena news and how did it hit with all other Bad news on the same day? Read this\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin subpoena news smells like insider trading Now you know why.Do you know there were 6 days of daily dump after March-07 starting exactly at 11:30 ET?Zerohedge has recorded it here\u200a\u2014\u200aIt\u2019s 1130ET, Do You Know Where Your Crypto Crash Is?A serial DUMP since Mar-24 to Apr-01!!!Below is another interesting pattern-selling observed from Mar-24 to Apr-01, 2018. What do you see here?Anytime price tries to recover Dump appears from nowhereAll these are HIGH Volume DUMPSMOST of the DUMPS start Below the Previous DUMP PriceDoes it look like a seller who wants higher price for their Bitcoin or a lower price? I see they want a lower price. Why? Price Suppression!See what happened Crypto Exchange OKEx on Mar-30\u20132018?This is announcement from OKEx: \u201cDear valued customers, At 5:00\u20136:30 on Mar 30, 2018 (Hong Kong Time), a number of users performed unusual transactions to manipulate the price of BTC quarterly futures contract, making it deviate greatly from the BTC index. Based on our team\u2019s investigation, the user closed a huge amount of positions at market price without considering the cost, causing it to drop to an unusually low level. We will disclose the transactions details in further notice\u201dNote the words\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cwithout considering the cost\u201d? This is a footprint of the Cartel in my view. Will the Manipulation Stop after it has been caught? I doubt.Want to See How the FUD is Manufactured?Do you know on Feb-07 Someone hacked China\u2019s central bank mailbox to email a bogus notice about bitcoin crackdown.Bogus press invitations was distributed to US media organisations claiming that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) are about to jointly introduce new measures to crack down on \u201call aspects and services of bitcoin trading in both mainland China and Hong Kong\u201d.Read the above article and ask a question to yourself\u200a\u2014\u200aWho would do such a thing? Only those who have interest in breaking down the Bitcoin price\u200a\u2014\u200aRight? Would an ordinary IT guy or a hacker do this? NO\u200a\u2014\u200abecause they cannot benefit from doing this FUD. Only influential cartel who can benefit by creating a FUD would do this.Let\u2019s get into the fundamentals of the \u201cCartel\u00a0theory\u201dWhat is\u00a0Cartel?Here is definition of Cartel from InvestopediaIs Cartel active in all\u00a0Markets?Not many. Cartel is active in only few markets. If you look at it, in a way OPEC is also a cartel because they control the supply.Which are those\u00a0markets?It\u2019s Gold, Silver, Oil and Bitcoin. Bitcoin was added to the list two months back\u00a0. (Invisible hand started showing its presence since Dec-2017, even though they entered the market much earlier.) Most people deny Cartel exists, even if they experience the results every day they will continue to deny until 95% REKT. Gold bugs denied it even when Gold and Silver was brought down to earth before their eyes. Gold and Silver was REKT to its production cost ($1200/$14) and many miners went bankrupt. Still there are many Gold bugs that are clueless about Cartel.\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 The\u00a0PROOFBefore you read any further let me provide the proof of price-suppression in Precious metals (Gold, Silver, Uranium and all that)See this 25 years Uranium Chart\u00a0?Uranium rose from $5 to $130 from 1993 to 2007.Futures Market started in May-2007See what happened? DROP in Uranium started exactly from May-2007 and it never recovered since then.Any doubts about what started the precipitous drop in Uranium? Its the Cartel people, and their playground is Futures market.Lets look at Gold 25 years chart. Cartel started ACTIVELY Suppressing Gold price in Futures market since 2011. What do you\u00a0see?(Please note: The Gold futures started much earlier than this\u200a\u2014\u200ain 1974. In fact Gold rose after futures were introduced in 1974. The reason it was not suppressed in 1974 was\u200a\u2014\u200aA) there was no need to since Gold was just decoupled from USD in 1971 B) US did not have Debt of 21 Trillion that time. The need arrived with 2008 financial crisis when Gold rose parabolically in 2011 with DEBT. Since then the price-suppression actively started in Gold and Silver markets.)Lets look at 25 years chart of Silver now. Same as\u00a0GoldLet\u2019s compare these charts with Bitcoin? (Nov-2018)Do you see any Similarities here? What does it tell you? coincidence? Natural-correction? Naaaa. It\u2019s Price-Suppression (not Manipulation).So far Bitcoin has consistently gone down since the day CME futures started on Dec-2017. Will it follow Precious Metals path? I think so.Still have doubts? See this recent news in the Gold \u201cfutures\u201d market:Jan 29, 2018\u200a\u2014\u200aCFTC Files Eight Anti-Spoofing Enforcement Actions against Three Banks (Deutsche Bank, HSBC & UBS) & Six Individuals\u200a\u2014\u200afor spoofing with respect to certain futures products in Gold and other precious metals traded on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX)Again, note the word \u201cFutures\u201d above.Also read \u201c6 Traders Arrested For Manipulating The Gold Market\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aJan-20186 traders that manipulated the Gold/Silver markets were \u201cCurrently or formerly employed by UBS, HSBC and Deutsche Bank\u201dThis is just TIP-of-an-ICEBERG. I hope to write a separate post on PM-suppression-scam later.\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 \u2014Cartel is like an Invisible Hand!! Deal with itWho are these entities?They consist of CERTAIN Traders, Agencies, Big Financial institutions & Media (I can list many more but let\u2019s keep it limited). They all work in a perfect synchronization to pull coordinated attacks to attain the goal of price-suppression. See what happened on Jan-30\u20132018 and Mar-07\u20132018? (many bad news hitting the market within hours of each other as Bitcoin was sitting on a critical support at 10K). Once 10K was broken the Cartel took over and started shoring Bitcoin like HELL. today we almost hit 8K. (and we are again below 8K when this post was updated on Mar-18)Why do they do\u00a0this?It\u2019s all about money control. Financial elite has recognized that Bitcoin and Crypto in general is a threat to their existence. What do powers do when they see anything as a threat or enemy? You got it, they try to destroy the enemy (by all means). Therefore, It is extremely important for the Financial-elite to stop bitcoin\u2019s rise so their show can continue.What do they do to stop the RISE of Bitcoin? They first let it rise to unimaginable height (20K first stop). Then they drop it to unimaginable lows. They will do this many times. They have trillions of dollar to maintain the show going, UNTIL the RETAIL investor gives up in frustration. What you are seeing since Mid-2017 is just the 1st inning of 9 innings Bitcoin game.Bitcoin has been placed into Geopolitical chessboard since Mid-2017. Most of the Bitcoiners have NO IDEA how big this game is. Crypto space is just a pawn on this chessboard and there are elite-fingers moving these pawns (Gold, Silver and now Bitcoin).Why only Gold, Silver & Bitcoin? Why not Stocks, Bonds, ETF, Index funds, Mutual funds\u00a0etc?See this chart. If this does not explain to you why Gold/Silver must be suppressed then nothing willEverything is about money control under unsustainable Debt load.When money flows into Gold, Silver and Bitcoin it shows that powers are bankrupt and their \u201cFiat\u201d money is worthless. If these assets rise, all the money supply will dry up and move into these assets. World will know the King has no cloths.When money stays in Stock and bond markets it supports Fiat Currency trade. Therefore, it is very important that stock and bonds markets remain intact and have been kept elevated artificially.In fact, you know what? There is a counter-party to Cartel in stock market and it is called\u200a\u2014\u200aPlunge Protection Team\u200a\u2014\u200aPPT.Cartel\u2019s job is to keep Gold, Silver and Bitcoin markets suppressed while PPT\u2019s job is to keep the stocks and Bond markets elevated.Here is the definition of PPT from IvenstopediaHere is the job description of the PPT in Stock and bond\u00a0marketsTo keep the Stocks and bond markets artificially elevated using the printed (Helicopter) money so that the dream of fake-prosperity continues for ever as the nations go bankrupt.Why not Simply Ban Bitcoin (& Gold) and get over with\u00a0it?It does not work that way folks. There are severe consequences and repercussions of banning any asset, more so in the world of a social media.Lets look at the history firstMost of the people don\u2019t know uncle Sam had banned and confiscated gold in 1933 using presidential executive order. See this Gold confiscation orderTwo things happen when a particular asset is banned 1) Govts and politicians have to face people\u2019s anger and 2) the banned asset gets people\u2019s sympathy (and people tend to hoard it even more). It did happen to Gold since 1933.There is another option: Price suppressionThis works far better than banning anything. When price suppression happens 1) most of the people reject there is anything wrong or malicious about the price drop (even though the fundamental are strong in favor of the asset). In fact, those point out the suppression are called \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d 2) As price keeps dropping people start despising the asset. See what happened to Gold and Silver since 2011. The more it dropped the more people hated it. Many Gold bugs sold precious metals at the bottom and switched over to Bitcoin and Crypto (when it was at the top.) This exactly what \u201cthey\u201d want the retail investor to do as \u201cthey\u201d collect more of it at the lower prices.Therefore, in the 21st century the easiest option is to manipulate the price of an asset so people themselves want to get rid of it without politicians or govts having to face the consequences of banning an asset. Govts and banks have realized that this works far better than banning anything.Therefore, in my view, bitcoin will not be banned as long as it can be controlled. But its price will continue to drop (with many rallies in between) so the average Joe remains a bag holder in the end, starts despising Bitcoin & sells it at the bottom as Cartel collects more of it at a lower cost average. Bitcoin will be banned (selectively initially) ONLY if the crypto bull rages out of \u201ctheir\u201d control.You have a\u00a0choicea. Recognize the threatb. Keep dry powder ready for possible \u201cunimaginable\u201d lows (for years like gold?)c. Buy Bitcoin DAMN cheap if it hit thered. DO not sell your Core position (I am still hodling 70% of my position because I cannot tell when it will turn)Do anything but please DO NOT sell your Bitcoin to the Cartel. In fact, ADD more as they DUMP it on the\u00a0market.This is a game of \u201cWealth-transfer-from-Plebs-to-Elite\u201d. Here is my pinned tweet written on Dec-02\u20132017 (I warned Well before it started, thank me later)What is the Strategy I am\u00a0using?I understand: Trading is difficult. If you cannot handle anxiety, then just Buy DIPS and HODL.Less of HODL, Less of BTFDSTFR\u200a\u2014\u200aSell the F** RalliesBTFDD\u200a\u2014\u200aBuy the F** \u201cDEEP\u201d Dips.\u201cDEEP\u201d is extremely important word here. The DIP must be so DEEP (or bad) that everyone must have given up by this time. Buy ONLY that time.Please note: Tax filing is very painful when you do too many trades. I myself plan to do more of HODL in 2018 than STFR.I am not claiming I bought/sold at these points. I am just explaining the strategy with this image.Where will the price suppression take\u00a0place?It will be at the Futures Markets and Futures trading at Crypto exchanges.How did they do it so\u00a0far?Cartel heavily bought Bitcoin at the exchanges starting from 2K all the way unto 12K. They let the market fly until 20K. [Updated Jun-2018: This was recently confirmed by a research paper: NY Times June 13, 2018\u200a\u2014\u200aA concentrated campaign of price manipulation may have accounted for at least half of the increase in the price of Bitcoin and other big cryptocurrencies last year]CME opened on 17th December and they started selling on exchanges. (See one month before and after CME). Since then the price has gone down tracing about -70% so far.This is from someone on the Gold/Silver side explaining how Bitcoin is being manipulated down. We can learn it from those who have experienced it first-hand for 8 years\u200a\u2014\u200athis is by TFMetals\u200a\u2014\u200atwitter.com/TFMetals/status/979733775633575937How will they do it in the\u00a0future?Initially Cartel will continue to suppress the Crypto prices at exchanges until futures market volume builds (track futures Volume here). Once enough volume is built at the futures market will take over. They will not need cartel to work at exchanges anymore. At this point, cartel will move to futures market, which is their home ground anyways. In simple terms, Bitcoin will be sold as Soybean when volume like Soybean is built at CME.How long will it continue?Look at the Gold/Silver Markets for the answer. Price-suppression (manipulation) started actively in 2011. Its still going on in 2018He told \u201cWe Will TAME Bitcoin\u201d even before CME\u00a0startedDo you think Leo Melamed made this comment casually? I think he meant it and you can see it every days since Dec-17\u20132017 (CME-future\u2019s market Open)How will this\u00a0end?One day Cartel will lose control of the markets. That day will be EPIC. The prices of Bitcoin (and Gold/Silver) will rise astronomically.My Bitcoin path is 20K to \u201cVERY-LOW-PRICE\u201d to 100KMany people ask me do you think it will go to 1K? Here is what I suggestYou want to OWN lot of Bitcoins when it\u00a0endsHere is my tweet about why.Why I think Cartel will lose the game eventually, you\u00a0ask?See this tweetSo, can the Cartel be defeated?\u201cI don\u2019t think\u00a0so\u201dMost of the Crypto community does not believe Cartel exists or there is any kind of coordinated attack going on at Bitcoin. At the most they think it\u2019s Whale or manipulators. They consider everything as \u201cCoincidence\u201d, and that is because it follows Technical Analysis (TA). Of course it will follow TA. The Cartel is investing trillions of dollars behind such efforts, do you think they don\u2019t have highly paid chartists on their payroll? They pay $700 pa for their chartists. How many Twitter-TA-Experts have that income level?So why did Bitcoin start going down exactly on the evening CME opened? It\u2019s \u201cCoincidence\u201d according to the Bitcoiners. At 20K they were pitching for 100K, but now they say the correction was due anyway and we are seeing that normal 50% dip. This correction will soon be over and we will be going to 20 first and then the moon\u2026so they say.First they said the correction is because BCH was listed at Coinbase, then they said its Tether subpoena, then they said No, No its Mt. Gox selling. Later on Mt.Gox changed his dates of selling. No its because of facebook ban, then Google ban, then Twitter ban. Market is still falling. What is the next excuse, people?Therefore, the crypto community as a whole CANNOT come together against Cartel until it\u2019s too late. What is too late? That is the time when most Crypto owners will start hating Bitcoin (see Gold/silver for reference)Anyways, I wish I am wrong and this does not happen and we will go to 20K and then moon soon.This is one of my tweets on Dec-10\u20132017. It\u2019s so true event\u00a0today.Here is the image of that \u201cCME-is-just-a-coincidence\u201d in terms of Market cap. Please note the Bitcoin started going down exactly from the evening of CME opened on Dec-17\u20132017.So far, 200 Billion Dollars have been wiped out from the Market Cap. ($327B to $130B as on Mar-18\u20132018). Does this look like a Natural-Correction to you?

These 3 alternatives should be on your\u00a0radar.Coin and CryptoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 16, 2018First movers or fast followers\u200a\u2014\u200awhich has the advantage? When bitcoin was first proposed in 2008 it was revolutionary. For the first time people could trust in a currency without a bank or government behind it.Fast forward to 2018 and bitcoin is well above 10,000 USD a coin. Over 87% of people have heard of bitcoin. We\u2019ve crossed the chasm.The first iPhone was released shortly before bitcoin was proposed.But bitcoin is almost a decade old. When bitcoin was conceived the app store was only just getting off the ground and portable DVD players were still used on long car trips. The technology of 2018 is leaps and bounds ahead of where it was a decade ago. Crypto technology is no exception.There are now over 1500 cryptocurrencies newer than bitcoin. These coins are more efficient, faster, and offer features that bitcoin lacks. In the past month bitcoin\u2019s percentage of the market has fallen from 56% to 33%.Chart from https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/ show bitcoin\u2019s decline in dominance over the past\u00a0month.This is not the first time first movers have been threatened by newer technologies. Altavista gave way to google. Myspace fell to Facebook. There is a history of first movers losing to innovative fast followers.Research shows that the first mover in a space is 6 times more likely to fail then the ventures that follow it.Bitcoin has done the difficult work of trail-blazing, and now the floodgates are open for a slew of modern competitors.So if bitcoin is just the start of cryptocurrencies, what comes next? To understand what technologies could surpass bitcoin we need to understand where it is currently falling short.Bitcoin and its blockchain have serious\u00a0flawsTransaction speedThe bitcoin network can only handle 7 transactions a section. That means only 7 people worldwide can buy or sell using bitcoin every second. For comparison visa handles 24,000 transactions a second. Low transaction speed limits bitcoin\u2019s effectiveness as a currency. It also hurts those who see bitcoin as a store of value. Exchanges go down and funds are stuck waiting hours (or even days) when too many people buy or sell bitcoin.Network congestion leads to extraordinarily high fees. Fees at the end of December were $37 a transaction, more than the cost of a wire transfer.2. Lack of privacyAre you comfortable with the whole world knowing the value of your bank account? What about the whole world knowing where you send funds and who you receive them from? Bitcoin wallets are tied to address hashes (random sequences of letters). Once the owner of a wallet is identified all of their previous transactions and all of their future transactions are visible to anyone who downloads bitcoin\u2019s ledger. This history can never be deleted or changed.3. ProgrammabilityBitcoin was designed as a digital currency. The technology allows only basic programming. This prevents bitcoin from being used in more complicated situations like for smart automatically executing contracts. Think of it like a calculator compared to a computer. Programmable blockchains (Ethereum being the most widely known example) have the potential to massively disrupt a wide array of sectors.Newer coins are introducing amazing new technologiesMany of these coins are leaps and bounds ahead of bitcoins current capabilities. The following are some of the most impressive contenders:Stellar Lumens (XLM)Pros: Insanely scalable. Great partnerships. Clear use case.You\u2019ve probably heard about Ripple amazing rally at the beginning of January. Stellar Lumens is the newer, 100% decentralized version of Ripple. Ripple\u2019s CEO founded Stellar Lumens to address the flaws he saw in Ripple. It can handle 1000 transactions per second without breaking a sweat, and transfer millions of dollars for a few pennies. Its investors are none other than Y-Combinator\u2019s CEO Sam Altman, and the CEO of Stripe.RaiBlocks (XRB)Pros: Insanely scalable. Instant transactions. Zero Fees.Raiblocks is an even newer coin\u200a\u2014\u200aemerging only in the last few months. It uses a new form of architecture based on directed acyclic graphs that only a few cryptocurrencies have adopted. This makes it infinitely more scalable than blockchain applications. Their approach to development is to do \u2018one thing well\u2019. In this case they aim to be what bitcoin was meant to be: an instant and zero fee way of sending currency around the globe.EOS\u00a0Pros: Scalable and programable. \u2018The Ethereum Killer\u2019EOS has been jokingly described as \u2018Ethereum on Steroids\u2019. The developers behind EOS claim that the EOS blockchain is fully programmable, will eliminate transaction fees and have the ability to process millions of transactions a second. Their block chain launches in April.Bitcoin will have to drastically speed up development or be overtaken.Bitcoin\u2019s last major update, scheduled in November, was canceled due to lack of community support. The November update was meant to introduce Segwit2x, a means of increasing the number of transactions that could be recorded on each block. Without Segwit2x Bitcoin\u2019s networks have grown increasingly slow.The Lightning Network\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin\u2019s now mythical response to scaling faces many unknowns before it can be implemented. More testing is necessary before it can foreseeably address some of Bitcoin\u2019s shortcomings.In the meantime, up and comers like EOS, XLM, and XRB are ready to outperform Bitcoin with their speed and functionality. We have yet to see if these second-movers will take the market. The only thing we can know for sure is that the entire cryptocurrency space is rapidly iterating. The cryptocurrency that ends up winning may yet to be created.Enjoy this article? We have a Telegram Signal group\u00a0now!We post simple and effective trading signals.

There have been some steep climbs and heart-stopping drops making for a roller coaster of emotion that\u2019s not easily controlled. The price action is both thrilling and at times, painful, so it\u2019s easy to lose sight of what you\u2019re investing in. All the coins seem to be running together, so what\u2019s the difference? How is one coin to be distinguished from another? And more importantly, how is an investor to know what the long term value of a coin will be?In this article, I\u2019m going to make the case for what makes Bitcoin different, how Bitcoin is a system that, despite all the cloning, has yet to be truly replicated.Real InnovationTo really understand the value proposition of Bitcoin, it helps to look at a bit of history. It\u2019s tempting to think that the newest ICO or altcoin is the one that will finally \u201cimprove\u201d Bitcoin and fix all of its problems and that Bitcoin will be relegated to the dustbin of history due to its lack of some \u201cfeature\u201d. Indeed, nearly every altcoin, ICO or hardfork thinks that they\u2019re being innovative in some fundamental way. What\u2019s missed is that the biggest innovation has already happened.Decentralized digital scarcity is the real innovation and Bitcoin was the first, and, as this article will make clear, continues to be the only such coin. All the other so-called innovations such as faster confirmation times, changing to proof-of-whatever, Turing completeness, different signature algorithm, different transaction ordering method and even privacy, are really tiny variations on the giant innovation that is Bitcoin.It\u2019s important to remember here that alternatives to Bitcoin have been proposed since 2011 and none of them have even come close to displacing Bitcoin in terms of price, usage or security. IxCoin was a clone of Bitcoin created in 2011 with larger block rewards and a premine (large number of coins sent to the creator). Tenebrix was an altcoin created in 2011 that tried to add GPU resistance and again had a large premine. Solidcoin was another altcoin created in 2011 with faster block times and again, a premine. About the only ones that survived (and not living out a zombie existence) out of that early altcoin era are Namecoin and Litecoin, which distinguished themselves by NOT having a premine.CoinMarketCap circa May\u00a02013ICOs are also not new. Mastercoin did an ICO in 2013 with, you guessed it, a premine, and raised over 5000 BTC at the time and had to rebrand themselves to Omni because the ecosystem around it was so anemic. Factom did an ICO in 2015 and raised over 2000 BTC and had to raise multiple rounds of additional financing because they ran out of money. In other words, all these \u201cexciting\u201d new tokens have generally done very poorly and didn\u2019t actually provide much utility.Altcoins and ICOs have tried many different \u201cfeatures\u201d and most have not been useful or adopted. So what gives? Why does Bitcoin seem to have a special place in the ecosystem? Why is Bitcoin different? We explore two unique aspects that make Bitcoin different than everything else: the network effect and decentralization.The Network\u00a0EffectBecause Bitcoin has the largest network and gains from the network effect, other coins essentially are playing a giant game of catch-up. Bitcoin is the 7-day week and every other altcoin is a slight variation (Let\u2019s have 4-day weeks! Let\u2019s make the day 18 hours! Let\u2019s rename the days to something different! Let\u2019s vary week lengths according to the whims of a central authority!) Needless to say, these types of \u201cinnovations\u201d are, at best, minor and are generally not adopted. This is because the network effect of Bitcoin grows over time and the people using the network optimize toward the standards of the network, locking more and more people in.As the network grows, what we see is that subtle, unseen benefits accrue to each norm. What may, on the surface seem inefficient actually has second and third order effects that benefit the people conforming to the norm. For example, a car does not fly or go on water because the car has been optimized for use on solid ground. The lack of extra features makes the car more useful since it\u2019s easier to park (smaller size than a theoretical boat/car/plane hybrid), cheaper to maintain and get fuel for, etc.In addition, these norms have withstood the test of time and have proven their resilience in ways that are not obvious. You would not want to be the first person to fly in a car/plane hybrid, for example, because you wouldn\u2019t know how safe such a vehicle is. Something that\u2019s been around has proven its relative security. Bitcoin, in a sense, has the world\u2019s richest bug bounty to reveal any security flaws. As a result, Bitcoin has proven its security with the only thing that can really test it: time. Every other coin is much younger and/or has proven to be less secure.Indeed, the dubious nature of many of these \u201cfeatures\u201d become obvious over time. For example, Ethereum\u2019s Turing-completeness makes the entire platform more vulnerable (see DAO and Parity bugs). In contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s smart contract language, Script, has avoided Turing completeness for that exact reason! The usual response by the coin\u2019s centralized authority is to fix such vulnerabilities with even more authoritarian behavior (bailouts, hard forks, etc). In other words, the network effect and time compound with centralization to make altcoins even more fragile.Bitcoin has the largest network and that means that Bitcoin grows in utility simply from having the most users. It\u2019s a lot easier to get accessories for a popular phone than an unpopular one, for example. The ecosystem around Bitcoin makes getting and keeping Bitcoin much easier than say, your altcoin or ICO of the week.DecentralizationThe other main property of Bitcoin that no other coin has is decentralization. By decentralized, I mean that Bitcoin does not have a single point of failure or choke point. Every other coin has a founder or a company that created their coin and they have the most influence over the coin. A hard fork (a backwards incompatible change) that\u2019s forced on the user, for example, is an indication that the coin is pretty centralized.Centralized coins have the \u201cadvantage\u201d of being able to change things quickly in response to market demand. Centralization is certainly a good thing for businesses as they are often trying to make a profit by providing some good or service to their customers. A centralized business can better respond to market demand and change what they sell for better profits.For money, however, centralization is a bad thing. First, one of the main value propositions for a store of value is in being something that doesn\u2019t change qualitatively (aka immutability). A store of value requires that its qualities stay the same or get better over time. A change that undermines its qualities (e.g. inflation of supply, decreasing of acceptance, change of security) drastically changes the utility of money as a store of value.Second, centralization of currency has a tendency to change the rules, often to catastrophic effect. Indeed, 20th century economics is the story of central banks slowly degrading fiat money\u2019s store of value utility. The average fiat currency has a lifespan of 27 years for this reason, despite the backing of powerful entities like governments and near universal usage within an entire country as a medium of exchange. \u201cFeatures\u201d, ability to react quickly and usage simply do not matter nearly as much to the survival of a currency as scarcity and immutability.Every cryptocurrency and ICO other than Bitcoin is centralized. For an ICO, this is obvious. The entity that issues the ICO and creates the token is the centralized party. They issued the coin and thus can change the token\u2019s usage, alter the coin\u2019s incentives or issue additional tokens. They can also refuse to accept certain tokens for their good or service.Altcoins have the same problem, though not in such an obvious way. Usually the creator is the de facto dictator for the coin and can do the same things that a government can. Taxes (dev tax, storage tax, etc), inflation, picking winners and losers (DAO, proof-of-X change, etc) are often decided by the creators. As a holder of an altcoin, you have to trust not just the current leader, but all future leaders of the coin to not confiscate, tax away or inflate away your coins. In other words, altcoins and ICOs are not qualitatively different than fiat. In altcoin and ICO-land, you are not sovereign over your own coins!This is particularly acute in the biggest \u201ccompetitor\u201d to Bitcoin: Ethereum. By any measure, Ethereum is centrally controlled. Ethereum has had at least 5 hard forks where users were forced to upgrade. They\u2019ve bailed out bad decision making with the DAO. They are now even talking about a new storage tax. The centralized control was shown early in their large premine.Bitcoin is different. One of the greatest things that Satoshi did was disappear. In the early days of Bitcoin, Satoshi controlled a lot of what was developed. By disappearing, we\u2019ve now got a situation where parties that don\u2019t like each other (users of various affiliations) all have some say in how the network is run. Every upgrade is voluntary (i.e. soft forks) and does not force anyone to do anything to keep their Bitcoin. In other words, there\u2019s no single point of failure. Bitcoin has a system where even if a whole group of developers got hit by a bus, there are multiple open source implementations that can continue to offer choices to every user. In Bitcoin, you are sovereign over your own bitcoins.This is a very good thing as there\u2019s no central authority that can diminish the utility of your coins. That means Bitcoin is actually scarce (instead of theoretically or temporarily scarce), won\u2019t change qualitatively without everyone\u2019s consent and is thus a good store of value.ConclusionYou might be wondering at this point: but there are so many altcoins and they\u2019re starting to eat into Bitcoin\u2019s market cap! First, market cap is a heavily manipulated metric. Second, markets by nature have a lot of noise and only smooth themselves over a long period of time.Because of the network effect and decentralization, Bitcoin is different than all the pretenders to the throne. That\u2019s not to say that there can\u2019t possibly be anything to ever displace Bitcoin. Such a statement would be overly broad and optimistic of Bitcoin\u2019s chances.But what is clear from studying the history of the cryptocurrency market is that Bitcoin has a lead that won\u2019t be relinquished very easily. A new \u201cfeature\u201d at the expense of the network effect and decentralization is simply not a very good trade-off.What would it take to displace Bitcoin? Most likely an innovation at least as big as Bitcoin itself or a bug that makes Bitcoin insecure. Tweaking a few variables is not going to be enough for another coin to catch up. Even adding a big feature (e.g. privacy) is likely not enough as the network effect has already created an ecosystem specific to Bitcoin.Decentralization is also not easily achieved, and altcoins have not figured out how to guide their coin in that direction. Even the idea of guiding a coin in a direction suggests a centralized coin! It\u2019s hard to imagine creators of valuable coins wanting to decentralize since they are incentivized emotionally, economically as well as socially to keep power over their creations.Bitcoin is different because unlike altcoins, Bitcoin created a new category and has the network effect as a result. Bitcoin will continue to be different because unlike centralized coins, it\u2019s market driven, immutable and unseizable. These happen to be the properties of a great store of value and this gives Bitcoin a utility that no other token has.As hopeful investors, it\u2019s tempting to believe that we\u2019ve found an altcoin or ICO that will improve on Bitcoin and thus make us early adopters in the revolution. Unfortunately, wishful thinking won\u2019t change the properties as fundamental as the network effect or decentralization. Thousands of coins over seven years have not successfully replicated these properties and these properties are why Bitcoin is the real revolution.", "responses": "98"}, {"title": "Buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on\u00a0Coinbase", "author_name": "Coinbase", "link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/buy-sell-send-and-receive-bitcoin-cash-on-coinbase-65f1b2c7214b?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 19, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "20K", "content": "Buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on\u00a0CoinbaseCoinbaseBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 19, 2017We\u2019re excited to announce that customers will be able to buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase.

I have been a customer of yours for over 20 years. You were there with a loan for me when I bought my first car; you helped arrange the mortgage when I bought my first house, and you even helped me launch my first business. We have been through so much together.And I\u2019ll let you into a little secret?You were my first! Don\u2019t worry, I know I wasn\u2019t yours. I think this is why this relationship means so much more to me than you.You may not have noticed that our relationship has changed, you have been so busy since that big financial crisis that we are doing less together. I got my last loan from my supermarket as they had a better rate and my last mortgage from another bank. These days I am only using you to hold money for me and pay my bills.We are like passing ships in the night and I am worried that if we don\u2019t talk we might have to separate.Recently I made this new friend called Bitcoin; a form of Cryptocurrency, I call her Crypto, you have probably heard of her. She is fresh and exciting, and I want you to get to know her too. I want you to make her part of our relationship.I know I am neither a bank manager nor an economist and you have all these arguments for why Crypto will fail, but I am someone using Crypto in my daily life and I know that this is going to be an ever-increasing need for me, and I want us to share this experience.I know you are scared, or maybe you just don\u2019t understand it. Maybe you think Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme and everyone buying it is only doing so to make a quick buck. Sure, some of us are, like some of us who bought shares during the Dot Com boom and lost money when it crashed. But look what happened after that, we got some of the most significant companies in the world: Amazon, Google and Facebook.Look at the other cool things which happened too; Apple created these fantastic phones for us that do all kinds of cool stuff with the Internet. These devices do much more than making calls; they allow us to read books, access millions of songs, track our exercise and even find love.I think you will agree that the Internet is pretty cool and the Dot Com bubble brought lots of capital and developers into the market to figure out how best we could use it.The thing about Crypto is that it is doing the same thing; you may see it as a bubble or hear financial commentators saying it is such, but a bubble isn\u2019t a bad thing. You may be hearing all these stories of scams and hacks but this bubble is also bringing capital, smart people and developers into Crypto to drive innovation. And don\u2019t listen to Bill Gates, terrorists are using Windows too and as Naval said, a young Bill Gates would be building on the blockchain.I know you have heard of the blockchain, you have heard it can do some pretty cool things right? But you are questioning whether we need Bitcoin, but it is because of Bitcoin we have the blockchain. We\u2019re pretty loyal about this so you can\u2019t have one without the other.You may be wondering why we love Crypto? Firstly, I will confess, some of us have made some great money from it, I would be lying if this wasn\u2019t a significant factor. We also expect to make money from it in the future, we can see how Bitcoin is changing the world, so some of us are going to keep investing in it. You see we need global currencies and we don\u2019t trust any centralised body to run it, and because Bitcoin is decentralised it has solved this need.There is little point in leaving all our money with you at the moment, I mean you did use to give us some interest, but that is pretty much non-existent now. Don\u2019t think we haven\u2019t noticed that you do still lend out our money to others for a profit, we don\u2019t mind this, but do you share those profits with us? Not anymore.There are other reasons we like it too. You see it has this thing called censorship resistance, what this means is that we can spend it/transfer it without having to give a reason, once we have created a transaction it has happened, and this is quite cool. Recently when I withdrew \u00a32,000 from the bank, you asked me what it was for, you nosey bugger. I didn\u2019t realise I had to explain myself to you and I don\u2019t think the bank clerk saw the joke when I said I am a drug dealer.The other thing with sending money with Crypto is that it is pretty damn quick, something you guys still haven\u2019t figured out. I do appreciate the hard work you have put in providing me with the Internet banking, that is quite cool. I also love my mobile app, but let\u2019s get some perspective, Amazon can send me a package across the Atlantic in an aeroplane quicker than I can send money across the Internet. I mean, come on, I know you don\u2019t physically ship my pound notes across the pond, all you are doing is updating a database but yet I have to wait days and pay a fee for the pleasure.The other thing with Crypto is that we get to hold it ourselves. I know we should trust you, but in England right now, you only guarantee to protect \u00a385,000 of this. Yes, this is probably more than most of us have, but don\u2019t we have a the right to all of our hard earned money being protected?You may think that a problem with the banks is pretty unlikely, our friends in Greece and Cyprus would beg to differ because you started stealing their money to pay for their government\u2019s mismanagement of their respective economies. And I doubt our friends in places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela have any protection at all.Also, during the financial crisis, when you guys were playing the lottery with those funny derivative things we heard all about, a few of you nearly disappeared. Only when the government stepped in were we saved. Pretty hairy times right? You must excuse us for not trusting you 100%.You know I got into Bitcoin mining recently because I told you about it, I spent three hours in one of your branches filling in all those forms and had to wait a week for a decision, I\u2019ll tell you more about this in a moment. When I bought the mining equipment, it cost $70,000, after sending the cryptocurrency it confirmed in less than 10 minutes and cost less than $1. I have no idea how I would send that kind of money to China with you; I expect I would need a meeting, some documents and an interrogation, and who knows what you would charge me for that.Remember I mentioned the bank account I tried to open a moment ago, you said no. I tried a couple of your buddies too, and they also said no. They said they can\u2019t see where this money is coming from and I may be laundering it. A fancy accusation, especially as I have run multiple businesses and never once been convicted of a crime. Also, if you look into it, you have to be pretty stupid to use Bitcoin for crime, it is pretty easy to track where the money goes these days.Clearly, I think you are scared, probably why your mate Jamie Dimon was so against it, though I think he is changing his view now.Bitcoin isn\u2019t going away; I am buying more, my friends are buying more, lots of people are buying more. If we see this as a better place to keep our money, then you are going to have less to lend out. What then? You are going to have to borrow from your competitors, and this is going to get a lot more expensive for you and you are going to make a lot less money. Maybe only a little to begin with, but I recommend you read Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell, the dude with the crazy hair. I\u2019ve dropped a link in for you, sod it, I\u2019ll buy you a copy if you want?Another problem you need to think about is as it gets easier for us to buy things with Crypto, we are going to do more of this too, why? Well, it should be cheaper without those little % merchant fees you charge for all those people in the chain. Technology doesn\u2019t like middlemen.Reference: https://www.cardswitcher.co.uk/2017/01/card-payment-processing-fees/You probably think this isn\u2019t a threat yet, similar to when some weirdos were getting DVDs sent to their house in the post when others were going to Blockbuster, but then streaming came and where is Blockbuster now? Also what happened to HMV, Tower Records and all those magazines and newspapers we loved? Many a corporate grave has been dug by those companies who have failed to innovate.The infrastructure is changing, merchants are bringing out Crypto solutions, and before long you will see Pay With Bitcoin as much as you see Pay With Paypal. It took time for Paypal, it was a bit of a pain to begin with, but they persevered, and now many of us just use them, why? Well, it comes down to this thing called ease of use, creating an account on every website and entering your card details is hard work. A simple login with PayPal is so much easier.If someone makes things easier or cheaper for us, we tend to use it.When we get a simple login with Crypto and if the retailers pass on the savings from your merchant fees, then things will be cheaper. Yes, it might be negligible for a cup of coffee but a TV? A Car? A house? Then once we are using them more and more we might use them for a cup of coffee too. These fees are also relevant when travelling, and lots of us travel but have to pay all these expensive fees when spending money abroad. Our Crypto accounts are borderless so these fees don\u2019t exist.So if we aren\u2019t saving our money with you and we aren\u2019t using our debit and credit cards, then why do we need you? Everything else we can buy on the open market, there is no loyalty for mortgages and loans, we\u2019ll get them from whoever is offering the best rate, that might not even be a bank, that might be our supermarket. We don\u2019t care; we just want the best rates.Are you getting the picture?All these years of failing to modernise, thinking there is no threat to your model just isn\u2019t true, is it? Our hero, Mr Satoshi Nakamoto has thrown a spanner in the works. You should Google him, he is kinda cool, though if you see some stuff about this guy Craig Wright, it isn\u2019t him, don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s just some ridiculous man who pretended to be Satoshi.I myself have been using Crypto for a while now, and something I have noticed is that there are a lot of young people excited by it. The same people who don\u2019t buy CDs because they can just ask Alexa to play a song, the same people who don\u2019t watch TV because they find what they want on YouTube. They have no interest in the complicated stock market, and they have grown up using virtual currencies when playing computer games. Sure, your grannies and granddads will probably still come to the bank to talk to you, but what about these younger guys and girls? You must have noticed some new modern Internet-only banks that the youngsters love, Revolut has even added Cryptocurrency buying and selling.So I\u2019ll level with you, you have choices, two as I see it:Choice 1\u200a\u2014\u200aIgnore\u00a0ItBut like when I ignore a bill, it doesn\u2019t go away, by the time I deal with it, it usually costs me more, maybe a fine. I think you may have the same problem. Go and look at Circle, they just bought this exchange we use called Poloniex for $400m. I guarantee this is going to look cheap in a year or two. Like when Facebook bought Instagram for $1bn and then a few years later paid $19bn for Whatsapp.The longer you leave it, the more expensive it will get:If you choose to integrate Crypto into your business by acquiring other companies, then they are going to get more and more costly and the best ones will likely have gone.You are going to lose out on customers who have already moved to one of your competitors who adopted Crypto before you.Choice 2\u200a\u2014\u200aAdaptI think we can agree it is inevitable that you will have to modernise and face up to the fact we want Crypto. Mark Carney isn\u2019t going to be your shining knight, we all think he\u2019s an idiot anyway. Once your customers start going elsewhere and you have less money to lend you are going to feel like the people who didn\u2019t buy Bitcoin at $30, then $300, then $3,000.I know you love digging up these yellow lumps of metal and then burying them back under the ground, but like John Pfeffer told me at lunch recently: \u201cIn 100 years when we are flying around in our Millennium Falcons, do you think we are going to be using lumps of yellow metal as a store of value?\u201d You should read John\u2019s white paper too, he is a pretty smart dude and you\u2019ll soon realise that this isn\u2019t just some made up magic Internet money.We want Crypto, and we need banking services. Don\u2019t worry; Crypto isn\u2019t going to replace fiat money (apparently this is what \u00a3 and $ is, fiat money, I only found this out recently). I know there are some libertarians out there who say Bitcoin will replace money, but I also know the governments won\u2019t allow this. Look at America, did you see the Senate testimony on virtual currencies? No? I reckon you should watch it, especially this dude Christopher Giancarlo, we like him, he understands us, anyway, if America wants in then the whole world will have it at some point. Even China!The relationship will be symbiotic, we will use our pounds and dollars for some things, and our Crypto for other, and we will likely bank with whoever makes this easiest. You see, at the moment, you aren\u2019t making banking easy, you\u2019re making it a pain in the ass. You know recently you charged me \u00a350 for going over my overdraft in one account even though another was in surplus. Yup! So even though I had no debt with you, you still charged me, this behaviour makes me think you are kind of a dick.The only reason I haven\u2019t changed bank is that I am so busy I haven\u2019t gone through the process of writing down all those direct debits and things I need to move. I will though, it is on my to-do list. So you have some time but not a lot.My advice is this, go and open a Coinbase account, they are not a bank, but they do look a little like one. Have a look inside there, you will see that they give you an account for your Pounds, Euros and Dollar and also accounts for my Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. All together, one big financial happy family.Click on the accounts, and you can see that you can send and receive Crypto just like you can with a bank, but remember what I said earlier about speed and cost. The fiat ones are just for balances and buying Crypto, so not a threat to you yet, but could they be in the future?Also, take a look at the vault, it is kind of like a savings account, though like you, we don\u2019t get any interest. But what if Coinbase did mortgages and loans and used Crypto, well then maybe we would get some interest. Don\u2019t worry; they probably won\u2019t, the vault is just for security and most of us don\u2019t keep much Crypto on Coinbase, just a little; I keep mine on something called a hardware wallet, buried in an underground bunker, with a moat, armed guards and alligators. You\u2019ll learn about security pretty quickly when you get into this.So Coinbase, pretty cool right?It would be pretty cool, if when I logged into my bank account that I have a Bitcoin account next to my current and savings. You could probably give me better fees than Coinbase anyway. I would definitely buy and keep some Crypto with you because getting my money from my bank to Coinbase is a bit of a pain. Also, I think it will be much easier for you to add a Bitcoin wallet than Coinbase to provide banking services. To be honest, I don\u2019t think they will ever offer banking services but I do believe a large bank will buy them one day. Probably for gazillions.Does this all make sense?See Crypto isn\u2019t going away, and like my friend Gavin said to me: you can\u2019t undo the blockchain, and you can\u2019t divorce it from Bitcoin. I guarantee that if you aren\u2019t looking at it then your competitors are. Why wait for them? Why not set the trend? Why not be that cool, innovative bank with Crypto? You won\u2019t lose any customers by doing it, but you will gain some new ones.I know this is scary but come on, the Internet was scary and you adapted, you finally figured out web and mobile banking. Don\u2019t you think it is more frightening to ignore cryptocurrencies and face being left behind?Love Peter x", "responses": "106"}, {"title": "Bitcoin Is The Total Opposite of a Ponzi Scheme\u200a\u2014\u200aHere\u2019s\u00a0Why", "author_name": "Miguel Cuneta", "link": "https://decentralize.today/bitcoin-is-the-total-opposite-of-a-ponzi-scheme-heres-why-4d795f0ed?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 8, 2017", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "16.1K", "content": "Bitcoin Is The Total Opposite of a Ponzi Scheme\u200a\u2014\u200aHere\u2019s\u00a0WhyMiguel CunetaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 8, 2017What is a \u2018Ponzi Scheme\u2019, you ask?\u201cA Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam promising high rates of return with little risk to investors. The Ponzi scheme generates returns for older investors by acquiring new investors. This is similar to a pyramid scheme in that both are based on using new investors\u2019 funds to pay the earlier backers. For both Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes, eventually there isn\u2019t enough money to go around, and the schemes unravel.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aInvestopediaOther than using the Tulip analogy, if you want to let the world know that you are completely ignorant about Bitcoin Technology, saying \u201cBitcoin is a ponzi!\u201d is your best bet. It shows a fundamental lack of ability to do basic research into something you don\u2019t understand, before making any broad assertions about it.When you understand the technology behind Bitcoin and the reason it was invented, you will see that it is actually the total opposite of a Ponzi scheme.Let\u2019s break it down:\u201cA Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam promising high rates of return with little risk to investors.\u201dIf you have not read the original proposal paper of Satoshi Nakamoto published in late 2008, you should. It\u2019s eight pages long, quite technical, but is not too hard to digest. You\u2019ll notice that never in that paper does it mention any kind of return on an \u201cInvestment\u201d in Bitcoin. It never even mentions a price for one Bitcoin. It simply practically solved one of the oldest problems in computer science, the byzantine general\u2019s problem, and thus established its value in the process. Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition was never profit-driven, and holding Bitcoins in the early years was seen as \u201cjust for geeks\u201d or \u201cmagic internet money\u201d, sarcasm included.Absolutely nothing about Bitcoin is a secret. It is one of the most open technologies in the world. It\u2019s open source, anyone can review the code, anyone can contribute to the code, anyone can run the software voluntarily and participate in the network, and anyone can use the network without permission. The entire history of all Bitcoin transactions is visible to anyone in the world too.It\u2019s a total paradigm shift from any kind of financial system in the history of mankind. It\u2019s the total opposite of a fraudulent investing scam, which is shrouded in vague promises of high returns with capital inflows and outflows that are kept in a secret ledger.\u201cThe Ponzi scheme generates returns for older investors by acquiring new investors. This is similar to a pyramid scheme in that both are based on using new investors\u2019 funds to pay the earlier backers.\u201dImage from\u00a0HYIP.COMBitcoin doesn\u2019t generate returns. It\u2019s just software. The price of Bitcoin is directly correlated to its scarcity and demand. The demand is not forced on others, nor do Bitcoin\u2019s biggest proponents go around asking people for money and telling them to invest more into Bitcoin. New users that join the Bitcoin network don\u2019t fund the older users with new money. Not at all. It\u2019s just plain lazy to make this assertion.In typical pyramid scheme, the founders will be the richest ones, guaranteed. The more people join, the bigger they\u2019ll earn, as all the money flows to the top. They give their initial investment, and then they entice others to invest as well, funneling these funds into their pockets. This is the only way they can make money. In a ponzi scheme, the value for early investors rely solely on new entrants coming in with fresh capital, and their earnings come directly from this capital.With Bitcoin, the opposite is true. A lot of people who got in early on Bitcoin are not around today to enjoy their 50,000 % returns on their investments. I know many people who bought thousands of Bitcoins and spent them on things like Pizza, mining rigs, gambling sites, video games, and even weed or other drugs. Hell, I lost several dozen Bitcoins back in 2014 playing Blackjack on stupid gambling sites and Satoshi Dice! I also gave away a lot of Bitcoins to people\u00a0whenever\u00a0I\u00a0did\u00a0talks\u00a0in\u00a0universities and the like, just small amounts that today would be worth 50 to 60 times its value.Old Bitcoin \u201cHodlers\u201d, the ones that truly held onto their Bitcoins after all these years, are few and far between. Some of them are insanely wealthy today due to the market price of Bitcoin skyrocketing, but their net worth is not realized in fiat currency terms, just accounted for using them for convenient accounting purposes. They measure their net worth in the amount of Bitcoins they hold, not in its fiat value.They didn\u2019t \u201ccash out\u201d and get rich. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. Old Bitcoin hodlers are the ones who will never sell their Bitcoins. Maybe some will sell a small fraction of their holdings to support themselves, but usually this is done not in a cash out but in a value exchange using Bitcoins as the medium i.e. they will pay for their new house, car, or investment using the Bitcoins themselves, to someone who wants the Bitcoins. The people that want the Bitcoins are in no way coerced or fooled into doing so\u200a\u2014\u200ain fact, they seek people who are willing to pay them with Bitcoins. And believe me, most people don\u2019t want to easily part with their Bitcons. People spend bad money before they spend good money, and Bitcoin is far superior than any kind of money in the world today.In a Ponzi, the oldest members will one day dump it all for cash, leaving new entrants holding the bag, so to speak.In Bitcoin, new \u201cinvestors\u201d who are in it to get-rich-quick are actually the weakest hands. They will dump their Bitcoins at a loss with the slightest sign of a downturn in price.Their Bitcoins eventually end up with someone like me, and many others I know, who understands the technology and finds utility in it as a superior store of value or as a permissionless, censorship resistant, and secure transfer protocol. We are the people who will never dump our Bitcoins one day in some imaginary future so we can profit, but we will gladly use it as a medium of exchange for something we want or need, or to give back to the world either by investing it in worthwhile projects or helping others. Obtaining cash is not a goal, it never will be.Unlike\u00a0other\u00a0financial\u00a0systems\u00a0out\u00a0there\u00a0fueled\u00a0by\u00a0pure\u00a0greed, some of the old Bitcoin holders are also some of the most generous people on earth. Recently, an early Bitcoin adopter donated over $1 Million to Andreas Antonopoulos (she donated 37 BTC and then another 42 BTC shortly after). Andreas, one of Bitcoin\u2019s most selfless proponents, recently told people that although he got into Bitcoin in 2012, his advocacy of teaching people about Bitcoin around the world made him spend a lot of his early holdings, putting him in a position that made him unable to enjoy the price gains of 2017. She then said that, without him, she would not have started in Bitcoin\u200a\u2014 and then promptly sent over $1 Million to his Bitcoin address to show her gratitude.There are many more examples of this, the most recent one being the Pineapple Fund\u200a\u2014 a 5,057 BTC fund made by one guy who wanted to give back to the world with his Bitcoin earnings. That\u2019s over $90 Million to be given to many charities and organizations that need it.For us, Bitcoin is the end game. We cashed out, alright. We cashed out of the old system, the one we were using only because there was no alternative.Now we have a choice.\u201cFor both Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes, eventually there isn\u2019t enough money to go around, and the schemes unravel.\u201dBitcoin has since increased by 500% since this was publishedThe image above is a bit outdated, but gives a nice perspective of the size of Bitcoin compared to the rest of the world\u2019s wealth. Check out this visualization for a better view of all the world\u2019s money, including Bitcoin.For the \u201cnot enough money to go around\u201d argument to happen with Bitcoin, it would literally mean that the $7.6 Trillion coins and notes of all countries, the $7.7 trillion dollars in Gold, the $74 Trillion in stock markets, and the $90 Trillion dollars in the global broad money supply would have to flow into Bitcoin.Using these examples, Bitcoin\u2019s has a maximum upside of around $180 Trillion, not including the $217 Trillion real estate market and $544 Trillion derivatives market. At $180 Trillion, the price of one Bitcoin will be, at the maximum of 21 million Bitcoins, about $8,500,000. Will it ever happen? Probably not. Will Bitcoin take a big bite out of these markets? It already started.Bitcoin today, called a ponzi and bubble by \u201cexperts\u201d are worth a grand total of $200 Billion, a drop in the ocean of global commerce.\u201cExperts Hate Them!\u201dSeveral so-called economic experts have called Bitcoin a ponzi or a bubble, just like how some experts called the internet a worthless idea. They are not evil, nor are they our enemies. They are just ignorant\u00a0and\u00a0short\u00a0sighted. It\u2019s not our job to try to convince them and argue with them about it\u200a\u2014\u200aour job is to keep building value for the network, putting in the hours of work, and developing the ecosystem for future generations.Bitcoin opened up a pandora\u2019s box of new innovation that has spawned a $500 Billion market and an even bigger global industry in just eight years, with no signs of stopping, creating immense value on a global scale. This value is there not because new investors bought into the system. It\u2019s the thousands of startups and businesses built on this technology creating tens of thousands of jobs, services that provide value in the savings they provide to users, infrastructure, hardware, software and applications, and much more that bring value to the table.The market\u2019s determination of what one Bitcoin is worth has nothing to do with greater fools getting in the system, but an after effect of the it\u2019s true value proposition, one that it already had even when it was worth nothing.Bitcoin will not unravel because the ones that truly understand it will never cash out. We don\u2019t want cash, we want Bitcoin. Why would we trade a finite, scarce, and valuable asset for infintely printable pieces of paper?Bitcoin is not a bubble\u200a\u2014 It\u2019s the pin.For us and many thousands of others, we are not waiting for exit.

We ask, and are asked, about our interests in crypto and we discuss what got us interested and when. Everyone says, \u201cI\u2019m not a Bitcoin millionaire.\u201d Then the same thought gets passed around; \u201cI wish I\u2019d gotten in earlier,\u201d we say. It\u2019s a sort of litany. And it\u2019s true, I really do wish I\u2019d bought Bitcoin five, six, or eight years ago. Most of us had heard something about it back then but for whatever reason we didn\u2019t jump in. In my own case I remember thinking \u201c$100, too late to get in. I doubt they\u2019ll go higher.\u201d Of course the assumption is that we wouldn\u2019t have sold out at double or even at 10X but would still have our stake today, at around $6,500 per.That\u2019s the problem, spotting a moonshot while it\u2019s still on the ground. Back then, of course, we didn\u2019t know the value could even go so high. Today we do. If only I could go back and buy at least $100 or $1000 worth, why I\u2019d be\u2026.Perhaps some of us bought into ICOs and perhaps some of us even made some money on them. Ahhh, if only we were back in \u201817\u2026 but those days are gone too. Right?The problem with ICOs is that they have no fundamental values on which to base estimates of future value. When choosing a stock, even an IPO, you can look at company\u2019s performance, a real product, and maybe even current sales. Underwriters of new stock issues don\u2019t invest in idea level startups. With ICOs though future promise is almost entirely based on hype and faith; spray and pray. We\u2019ve come to accept that to get involved early enough to hope for 10X, 100X, or more we have to go on nothing more than a whitepaper and team description.To make the issue even worse, the vast majority of tokens have absolutely no use other than making money for the startup issuing them. Even if the company holds back a portion of them and locks them up to prevent dumping for a month or year after listing on exchanges, even if the company depends on their future value for their own profits, the tokens are nothing more than holders of market set by arbitrary value. If they drop by 99% the company has the proceeds of the sale in hand and the future token value will have little or no effect on the company\u2019s core business. The startup has gained funding but the token holders will never share in the profits, or have a say in company decisions. Perhaps the token is a medium of exchange in a closed network but that is rarely a necessity\u200a\u2014\u200aany other token, and sometimes even fiat, could take their place.The exception to this is AERUM. It\u2019s another reason why I joined the team (another is AERUM\u2019s UX and business focus discussed here). In solving the difficulty of transaction fees for the end user they, perhaps inadvertently, created something almost magic; a basis of fundamental value for their XRM token which also happens to be a Free Money Factory. Like any factory, its own value depends on the value of its output. That is the fundamental value which will give XRM its positive price pressure.The EIP-20 XRM token generates free transactions in the form of Aero tokens (the GAS equivalent in this system). If the holder is a business that needs the transactions, they can apply their Aero to their customers\u2019 transactions. If the holder doesn\u2019t need the transactions, say if the holder is an investor, the Aero can be sold to those who need them, for ETH.Let\u2019s take a look at the investor scenarios a bit closer. Let\u2019s say Ms. CleverInvestor buys XRM. Every day her XRM generate Aero. She doesn\u2019t need the Aero so she sells them and gets ETH. She still holds her XRM, all of them. In effect her XRM are a money factory. XRM is cryptocurrency that literally makes, as in manufactures, money\u200a\u2014\u200aEvery single day. She doesn\u2019t need to worry about buying low and selling high; timing the extremely volatile crypto market is simply nothing she needs to concern herself with. She sells low and she sells high\u200a\u2014\u200athe next day she sells again.AREUM hasn\u2019t launched its network yet\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s coming shortly, mid January of 2019, so obviously there is no demand for Aero yet. Like all business, there is a risk that there may never be. In other words, we are in a stage very like the one everyone wishes they bought into five or eight years ago with Bitcoin. The future is uncertain. The value of XRM is low.The core differences though, are:XRM plays a fundamental role in the Aero tokenomic model, that of generating Aero.The value of transactions, as reflected in the price of Aero vs ETH (or other currencies) will provide a fundamental support floor to the XRM price.Unlike the case of Bitcoin in 2011, we know that crypto can rise by 10X or 1,000X or more.Ultimately, crypto investments are risky. Calling the timing or the token is hard. The cost of making the wrong call is often complete collapse, 100% loss. But the potential in making the right call is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before. This we know. The value of tokens with no function or fundamental value has soared. How you predict the future value trajectory for a token with the unique properties of core tokenomic function and genuine fundamental value, that is capable of providing a passive income in ETH, in perpetuity, is up to you. The risk, as it was with Bitcoin, is real. The benefits and profits potentially outstrip Bitcoin, even Ethereum.===The AERUM system really is quite cool.

Alternatively it may seem foolish to invest in a digital asset that isn\u2019t backed by any commodity or government and whose price rise has prompted some to compare it to the tulip mania or the dot-com bubble. Neither is true; the bullish case for Bitcoin is compelling but far from obvious. There are significant risks to investing in Bitcoin, but, as I will argue, there is still an immense opportunity.GenesisNever in the history of the world had it been possible to transfer value between distant peoples without relying on a trusted intermediary, such as a bank or government. In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity is still unknown, published a 9 page solution to a long-standing problem of computer science known as the Byzantine General\u2019s Problem. Nakamoto\u2019s solution and the system he built from it\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200aallowed, for the first time ever, value to be quickly transferred, at great distance, in a completely trustless way. The ramifications of the creation of Bitcoin are so profound for both economics and computer science that Nakamoto should rightly be the first person to qualify for both a Nobel prize in Economics and the Turing award.For an investor the salient fact of the invention of Bitcoin is the creation of a new scarce digital good\u200a\u2014\u200abitcoins. Bitcoins are transferable digital tokens that are created on the Bitcoin network in a process known as \u201cmining\u201d. Bitcoin mining is roughly analogous to gold mining except that production follows a designed, predictable schedule. By design, only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined and most of these already have been\u200a\u2014\u200aapproximately 16.8 million bitcoins have been mined at the time of writing. Every four years the number of bitcoins produced by mining halves and the production of new bitcoins will end completely by the year 2140.Bitcoins are not backed by any physical commodity, nor are they guaranteed by any government or company, which raises the obvious question for a new bitcoin investor: why do they have any value at all? Unlike stocks, bonds, real-estate or even commodities such as oil and wheat, bitcoins cannot be valued using standard discounted cash flow analysis or by demand for their use in the production of higher order goods. Bitcoins fall into an entirely different category of goods, known as monetary goods, whose value is set game-theoretically. I.e., each market participant values the good based on their appraisal of whether and how much other participants will value it. To understand the game-theoretic nature of monetary goods, we need to explore the origins of money.The Origins of\u00a0MoneyIn the earliest human societies, trade between groups of people occurred through barter. The incredible inefficiencies inherent to barter trade drastically limited the scale and geographical scope at which trade could occur. A major disadvantage with barter based trade is the double coincidence of wants problem. An apple grower may desire trade with a fisherman, for example, but if the fisherman does not desire apples at the same moment, the trade will not take place. Over time humans evolved a desire to hold certain collectible items for their rarity and symbolic value (examples include shells, animal teeth and flint). Indeed, as Nick Szabo argues in his brilliant essay on the origins of money, the human desire for collectibles provided a distinct evolutionary advantage for early man over his nearest biological competitors, Homo neanderthalensis.The primary and ultimate evolutionary function of collectibles was as a medium for storing and transferring wealth.Collectibles served as a sort of \u201cproto-money\u201d by making trade possible between otherwise antagonistic tribes and by allowing wealth to be transferred between generations. Trade and transfer of collectibles were quite infrequent in paleolithic societies, and these goods served more as a \u201cstore of value\u201d rather than the \u201cmedium of exchange\u201d role that we largely recognize modern money to play. Szabo explains:Compared to modern money, primitive money had a very low velocity\u200a\u2014\u200ait might be transferred only a handful of times in an average individual\u2019s lifetime. Nevertheless, a durable collectible, what today we would call an heirloom, could persist for many generations and added substantial value at each transfer\u200a\u2014\u200aoften making the transfer even possible at\u00a0all.Early man faced an important game-theoretic dilemma when deciding which collectibles to gather or create: which objects would be desired by other humans? By correctly anticipating which objects might be demanded for their collectible value, a tremendous benefit was conferred on the possessor in their ability to complete trade and to acquire wealth. Some Native American tribes, such as the Narragansetts, specialized in the manufacture of otherwise useless collectibles simply for their value in trade. It is worth noting that the earlier the anticipation of future demand for a collectible good, the greater the advantage conferred to its possessor; it can be acquired more cheaply than when it is widely demanded and its trade value appreciates as the population which demands it expands. Furthermore, acquiring a good in hopes that it will be demanded as a future store of value hastens its adoption for that very purpose. This seeming circularity is actually a feedback loop that drives societies to quickly converge on a single store of value. In game-theoretic terms, this is known as a \u201cNash Equilibrium\u201d. Achieving a Nash Equilibrium for a store of value is a major boon to any society, as it greatly facilitates trade and the division of labor, paving the way for the advent of civilization.Over the millennia, as human societies grew and trade routes developed, the stores of value that had emerged in individual societies came to compete against each other. Merchants and traders would face a choice of whether to save the proceeds of their trade in the store of value of their own society or the store of value of the society they were trading with, or some balance of both. The benefit of maintaining savings in a foreign store of value was the enhanced ability to complete trade in the associated foreign society. Merchants holding savings in a foreign store of value also had an incentive to encourage its adoption within their own society, as this would increase the purchasing power of their savings. The benefits of an imported store of value accrued not only to the merchants doing the importing, but also to the societies themselves. Two societies converging on a single store of value would see a substantial decrease in the cost of completing trade with each other and an attendant increase in trade-based wealth. Indeed, the 19th century was the first time when most of the world converged on a single store of value\u200a\u2014\u200agold\u200a\u2014\u200aand this period saw the greatest explosion of trade in the history of the world. Of this halcyon period, Lord Keynes wrote:What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was\u00a0\u2026 for any man of capacity or character at all exceeding the average, into the middle and upper classes, for whom life offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences, comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most powerful monarchs of other ages. The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his\u00a0doorstepThe attributes of a good store of\u00a0valueWhen stores of value compete against each other, it is the specific attributes that make a good store of value that allows one to out-compete another at the margin and increase demand for it over time. While many goods have been used as stores of value or \u201cproto-money\u201d, certain attributes emerged that were particularly demanded and allowed goods with these attributes to out-compete others. An ideal store of value will be:Durable: the good must not be perishable or easily destroyed. Thus wheat is not an ideal store of valuePortable: the good must be easy to transport and store, making it possible to secure it against loss or theft and allowing it to facilitate long-distance trade. A cow is thus less ideal than a gold bracelet.Fungible: one specimen of the good should be interchangeable with another of equal quantity. Without fungibility, the coincidence of wants problem remains unsolved. Thus gold is better than diamonds, which are irregular in shape and quality.Verifiable: the good must be easy to quickly identify and verify as authentic. Easy verification increases the confidence of its recipient in trade and increases the likelihood a trade will be consummated.Divisible: the good must be easy to subdivide. While this attribute was less important in early societies where trade was infrequent, it became more important as trade flourished and the quantities exchanged became smaller and more precise.Scarce: As Nick Szabo termed it, a monetary good must have \u201cunforgeable costliness\u201d. In other words, the good must not be abundant or easy to either obtain or produce in quantity. Scarcity is perhaps the most important attribute of a store of value as it taps into the innate human desire to collect that which is rare. It is the source of the original value of the store of value.Established history: the longer the good is perceived to have been valuable by society, the greater its appeal as a store of value. A long-established store of value will be hard to displace by a new upstart except by force of conquest or if the arriviste is endowed with a significant advantage among the other attributes listed above.Censorship-resistant: a new attribute, which has become increasingly important in our modern, digital society with pervasive surveillance, is censorship-resistance. That is, how difficult is it for an external party such as a corporation or state to prevent the owner of the good from keeping and using it. Goods that are censorship-resistant are ideal to those living under regimes that are trying to enforce capital controls or to outlaw various forms of peaceful trade.The table below grades Bitcoin, gold and fiat money (such as dollars) against the attributes listed above and is followed by an explanation of each grade:Durability:Gold is the undisputed King of durability. The vast majority of gold that has ever been mined or minted, including the gold of the Pharaohs, remains extant today and will likely be available a thousand years hence. Gold coins that were used as money in antiquity still maintain significant value today. Fiat currency and bitcoins are fundamentally digital records that may take physical form (such as paper bills). Thus it is not their physical manifestation whose durability should be considered (since a tattered dollar bill may be exchanged for a new one), but the durability of the institution that issues them. In the case of fiat currencies, many governments have come and gone over the centuries, and their currencies disappeared with them. The Papiermark, Rentenmark and Reichsmark of the Weimar Republic no longer have value because the institution that issued them no longer exists. If history is a guide, it would be folly to consider fiat currencies durable in the long term\u200a\u2014\u200athe US dollar and British Pound are relative anomalies in this regard. Bitcoins, having no issuing authority, may be considered durable so long as the network that secures them remains in place. Given that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, it is too early to draw strong conclusions about its durability. However, there are encouraging signs that, despite prominent instances of nation-states attempting to regulate Bitcoin and years of attacks by hackers, the network has continued to function, displaying a remarkable degree of \u201canti-fragility\u201d.Portability:Bitcoins are the most portable store of value ever used by man. Private keys representing hundreds of millions of dollars can be stored on a tiny USB drive and easily carried anywhere. Furthermore, equally valuable sums can be transmitted between people on opposite ends of the earth near instantly. Fiat currencies, being fundamentally digital are also highly portable. However, government regulations and capital controls mean that large transfers of value usually take days or may not be possible at all. Cash can be used to avoid capital controls, but then the risk of storage and cost of transportation become significant. Gold, being physical in form and incredibly dense, is by far the least portable. It is no wonder that the majority of bullion is never transported. When bullion is transferred between a buyer and a seller it is typically only the title to the gold that is transferred, not the physical bullion itself. Transmitting physical gold across large distances is costly, risky and time-consuming.Fungibility:Gold provides the standard for fungibility. When melted down, an ounce of gold is essentially indistinguishable from any other ounce, and gold has always traded this way on the market. Fiat currencies, on the other hand, are only as fungible as the issuing institutions allow them to be. While it may be the case that a fiat banknote is usually treated like any other by merchants accepting them, there are instances where large-denomination notes have been treated differently to small ones. For instance, India\u2019s government, in an attempt to stamp out India\u2019s untaxed gray market, completely demonetized their 500 and 1000 rupee banknotes. The demonetization caused 500 and 1000 rupee notes to trade at a discount to their face value, making them no longer truly fungible with their lower denomination sibling notes. Bitcoins are fungible at the network level, meaning that every bitcoin, when transmitted, is treated the same on the Bitcoin network. However, because bitcoins are traceable on the blockchain, a particular bitcoin may become tainted by its use in illicit trade and merchants or exchanges may be compelled not to accept such tainted bitcoins. Without improvements to the privacy and anonymity of Bitcoin\u2019s network protocol, bitcoins cannot be considered as fungible as gold.Verifiability:For most intents and purposes, both fiat currencies and gold are fairly easy to verify for authenticity. However, despite providing features on their banknotes to prevent counterfeiting, nation-states and their citizens still face the potential to be duped by counterfeit bills. Gold is also not immune from being counterfeited. Sophisticated criminals have used gold-plated tungsten as a way of fooling gold investors into paying for false gold. Bitcoins, on the other hand, can be verified with mathematical certainty. Using cryptographic signatures, the owner of a bitcoin can publicly prove she owns the bitcoins she says she does.Divisibility:Bitcoins can be divided down to a hundred millionth of a bitcoin and transmitted at such infinitesimal amounts (network fees can, however, make transmission of tiny amounts uneconomic). Fiat currencies are typically divisible down to pocket change, which has little purchasing power, making fiat divisible enough in practice. Gold, while physically divisible, becomes difficult to use when divided into small enough quantities that it could be useful for lower-value day-to-day trade.Scarcity:The attribute that most clearly distinguishes Bitcoin from fiat currencies and gold is its predetermined scarcity. By design, at most 21 million bitcoins can ever be created. This gives the owner of bitcoins a known percentage of the total possible supply. For instance, an owner of 10 bitcoins would know that at most 2.1 million people on earth (less than 0.03% of the world\u2019s population) could ever have as many bitcoins as they had. Gold, while remaining quite scarce through history, is not immune to increases in supply. If it were ever the case that a new method of mining or acquiring gold became economic, the supply of gold could rise dramatically (examples include sea-floor or asteroid mining). Finally, fiat currencies, while only a relatively recent invention of history, have proven to be prone to constant increases in supply. Nations-states have shown a persistent proclivity to inflate their money supply to solve short-term political problems. The inflationary tendencies of governments across the world leave the owner of a fiat currency with the likelihood that their savings will diminish in value over time.Established history:No monetary good has a history as long and storied as gold, which has been valued for as long as human civilization has existed. Coins minted in the distant days of antiquity still maintain significant value today. The same cannot be said of fiat currencies, which are a relatively recent anomaly of history. From their inception, fiat currencies have had a near-universal tendency toward eventual worthlessness. The use of inflation as an insidious means of invisibly taxing a citizenry has been a temptation that few states in history have been able to resist. If the 20th century, in which fiat monies came to dominate the global monetary order, established any economic truth, it is that fiat money cannot be trusted to maintain its value over the long or even medium term. Bitcoin, despite its short existence, has weathered enough trials in the market that there is a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon. Furthermore, the Lindy effect suggests that the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society\u2019s confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. In other words, the societal trust of a new monetary good is asymptotic in nature, as is illustrated in the graph below:If Bitcoin exists for 20 years, there will be near-universal confidence that it will be available forever, much as people believe the Internet is a permanent feature of the modern world.Censorship resistance:One of the most significant sources of early demand for bitcoins was their use in the illicit drug trade. Many subsequently surmised, mistakenly, that the primary demand for bitcoins was due to their ostensible anonymity. Bitcoin, however, is far from an anonymous currency; every transaction transmitted on the Bitcoin network is forever recorded on a public blockchain. The historical record of transactions allows for later forensic analysis to identify the source of a flow of funds. It was such an analysis that led to the apprehending of a perpetrator of the infamous MtGox heist. While it is true that a sufficiently careful and diligent person can conceal their identity when using Bitcoin, this is not why Bitcoin was so popular for trading drugs. The key attribute that makes Bitcoin valuable for proscribed activities is that it is \u201cpermissionless\u201d at the network level. When bitcoins are transmitted on the Bitcoin network, there is no human intervention deciding whether the transaction should be allowed. As a distributed peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin is, by its very nature, designed to be censorship-resistant. This is in stark contrast to the fiat banking system, where states regulate banks and the other gatekeepers of money transmission to report and prevent outlawed uses of monetary goods. A classic example of regulated money transmission is capital controls. A wealthy millionaire, for instance, may find it very hard to transfer their wealth to a new domicile if they wish to flee an oppressive regime. Although gold is not issued by states, its physical nature makes it difficult to transmit at distance, making it far more susceptible to state regulation than Bitcoin. India\u2019s Gold Control Act is an example of such regulation.Bitcoin excels across the majority of attributes listed above, allowing it to outcompete modern and ancient monetary goods at the margin and providing a strong incentive for its increasing adoption. In particular, the potent combination of censorship resistance and absolute scarcity has been a powerful motivator for wealthy investors to allocate a portion of their wealth to the nascent asset class.The Evolution of\u00a0MoneyThere is an obsession in modern monetary economics with the medium of exchange role of money. In the 20th century, states have monopolized the issuance of money and continually undermined its use as a store of value, creating a false belief that money is primarily defined as a medium of exchange. Many have criticized Bitcoin as being an unsuitable money because its price has been too volatile to be suitable as a medium of exchange. This puts the cart before the horse, however. Money has always evolved in stages, with the store of value role preceding the medium of exchange role. One of the fathers of marginalist economics, William Stanley Jevons, explained that:Historically speaking\u00a0\u2026 gold seems to have served, firstly, as a commodity valuable for ornamental purposes; secondly, as stored wealth; thirdly, as a medium of exchange; and, lastly, as a measure of\u00a0value.Using modern terminology, money always evolves in the following four stages:Collectible. In the very first stage of its evolution, money will be demanded solely based on its peculiar properties, usually becoming a whimsy of its possessor. Shells, beads and gold were all collectibles before later transitioning to the more familiar roles of money.Store of value: Once it is demanded by enough people for its peculiarities, money will be recognized as a means of keeping and storing value over time. As a good becomes more widely recognized as a suitable store of value, its purchasing power will rise as more people demand it for this purpose. The purchasing power of a store of value will eventually plateau when it is widely held and the influx of new people desiring it as a store of value dwindles.Medium of exchange: When money is fully established as a store of value, its purchasing power will stabilize. Having stabilized in purchasing power, the opportunity cost of using money to complete trades will diminish to a level where it is suitable for use as a medium of exchange. In the earliest days of Bitcoin, many people did not appreciate the huge opportunity cost of using bitcoins as a medium of exchange, rather than as an incipient store of value. The famous story of a man trading 10,000 bitcoins (worth approximately $94 million at the time of this article\u2019s writing) for two pizzas illustrates this confusion.Unit of account. When money is widely used as a medium of exchange, goods will be priced in terms of it. I.e., the exchange ratio against money will be available for most goods. It is a common misconception that bitcoin prices are available for many goods today. For example, while a cup of coffee might be available for purchase using bitcoins, the price listed is not a true bitcoin price; rather it is the dollar price desired by the merchant translated into bitcoin terms at the current USD/BTC market exchange rate. If the price of bitcoin were to drop in dollar terms, the number of bitcoins requested by the merchant would increase commensurately. Only when merchants are willing to accept bitcoins for payment without regard to the bitcoin exchange rate against fiat currencies can we truly think of Bitcoin as having become a unit of account.Monetary goods that are not yet a unit of account may be thought of as being \u201cpartly monetized\u201d. Today gold fills such a role, being a store of value but having been stripped of its medium of exchange and unit of account roles by government intervention. It is also possible that one good fills the medium of exchange role of money while another good fills the other roles. This is typically true in countries with dysfunctional states, such as Argentina or Zimbabwe. In his book Digital Gold, Nathaniel Popper writes:In America, the dollar seamlessly serves the three functions of money: providing a medium of exchange, a unit for measuring the cost of goods, and an asset where value can be stored. In Argentina, on the other hand, while the peso was used as a medium of exchange\u200a\u2014\u200afor daily purchases\u200a\u2014\u200ano one used it as a store of value. Keeping savings in the peso was equivalent to throwing away money. So people exchanged any pesos they wanted to save for dollars, which kept their value better than the peso. Because the peso was so volatile, people usually remembered prices in dollars, which provided a more reliable unit of measure over\u00a0time.Bitcoin is currently transitioning from the first stage of monetization to the second stage. It will likely be several years before Bitcoin transitions from being an incipient store of value to being a true medium of exchange, and the path it takes to get there is still fraught with risk and uncertainty. It is striking to note that the same transition took many centuries for gold. No one alive has seen the real-time monetization of a good (as is taking place with Bitcoin), so there is precious little experience regarding the path this monetization will take.Path dependenceIn the process of being monetized, a monetary good will soar in purchasing power. Many have commented that the increase in purchasing power of Bitcoin creates the appearance of a \u201cbubble\u201d. While this term is often using disparagingly to suggest that Bitcoin is grossly overvalued, it is unintentionally apt. A characteristic that is common to all monetary goods is that their purchasing power is higher than can be justified by their use-value alone. Indeed, many historical monies had no use-value at all. The difference between the purchasing power of a monetary good and the exchange-value it could command for its inherent usefulness can be thought of as a \u201cmonetary premium\u201d. As a monetary good transitions through the stages of monetization (listed in the section above), the monetary premium will increase. The premium does not, however, move in a straight, predictable line. A good X that was in the process of being monetized may be outcompeted by another good Y that is more suitable as money, and the monetary premium of X may drop or vanish entirely. The monetary premium of silver disappeared almost entirely in the late 19th century when governments across the world largely abandoned it as money in favor of gold.Even in the absence of exogenous factors such as government intervention or competition from other monetary goods, the monetary premium for a new money will not follow a predictable path. Economist Larry White observed that:the trouble with [the] bubble story, of course, is that is consistent with any price path, and thus gives no explanation for a particular price\u00a0pathThe process of monetization is game-theoretic; every market participant attempts to anticipate the aggregate demand of other participants and thereby the future monetary premium. Because the monetary premium is unanchored to any inherent usefulness, market participants tend to default to past prices when determining whether a monetary good is cheap or expensive and whether to buy or sell it. The connection of current demand to past prices is known as \u201cpath dependence\u201d and is perhaps the greatest source of confusion in understanding the price movements of monetary goods.When the purchasing power of a monetary good increases with increasing adoption, market expectations of what constitutes \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cexpensive\u201d shift accordingly. Similarly, when the price of a monetary good crashes, expectations can switch to a general belief that prior prices were \u201cirrational\u201d or overly inflated. The path dependence of money is illustrated by the words of well-known Wall Street fund manager Josh Brown:I bought [bitcoins] at like $2300 and had an immediate double on my hands. Then I started saying \u201cI can\u2019t buy more of it,\u201d as it rose, even though that\u2019s an anchored opinion based on nothing other than the price where I originally got it. Then, as it fell over the last week because of a Chinese crackdown on the exchanges, I started saying to myself, \u201cOh good, I hope it gets killed so I can buy\u00a0more.\u201dThe truth is that the notions of \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cexpensive\u201d are essentially meaningless in reference to monetary goods. The price of a monetary good is not a reflection of its cash flow or how useful it is but, rather, is a measure of how widely adopted is has become for the various roles of money.Further complicating the path-dependent nature of money is the fact that market participants do not merely act as dispassionate observers, trying to buy or sell in anticipation of future movements of the monetary premium, but also act as active evangelizers. Since there is no objectively correct monetary premium, proselytizing the superior attributes of a monetary good is more effective than for regular goods, whose value is ultimately anchored to cash flow or use-demand. The religious fervor of participants in the Bitcoin market can be observed in various online forums where owners actively promote the benefits of Bitcoin and the wealth that can be made by investing in it. In observing the Bitcoin market, Leigh Drogen comments:You recognize this as a religion\u200a\u2014\u200aa story we all tell each other and agree upon. Religion is the adoption curve we ought to be thinking about. It\u2019s almost perfect\u200a\u2014\u200aas soon as someone gets in, they tell everyone and go out evangelizing. Then their friends get in and they start evangelizing.While the comparison to religion may give Bitcoin an aura of irrational faith, it is entirely rational for the individual owner to evangelize for a superior monetary good and for society as a whole to standardize on it. Money acts as the foundation for all trade and savings, so the adoption of a superior form of money has tremendous multiplicative benefits to wealth creation for all members of a society.The shape of monetizationWhile there are no a priori rules about the path a monetary good will take as it is monetized, a curious pattern has emerged during the relatively brief history of Bitcoin\u2019s monetization. Bitcoin\u2019s price appears to follow a fractal pattern of increasing magnitude, where each iteration of the fractal matches the classic shape of a Gartner hype cycle.In his article on the Speculative Bitcoin Adoption/Price Theory, Michael Casey posits that the expanding Gartner hype cycles represent phases of a standard S-curve of adoption that was followed by many transformative technologies as they become commonly used in society.Each Gartner hype cycle begins with a burst of enthusiasm for the new technology, and the price is bid up by the market participants who are \u201creachable\u201d in that iteration. The earliest buyers in a Gartner hype cycle typically have a strong conviction about the transformative nature of the technology they are investing in. Eventually the market reaches a crescendo of enthusiasm as the supply of new participants who can be reached in the cycle is exhausted and the buying becomes dominated by speculators more interested in quick profits than the underlying technology.Following the peak of the hype cycle, prices rapidly drop and the speculative fervor is replaced by despair, public derision and a sense that the technology was not transformative at all. Eventually the price bottoms and forms a plateau where the original investors who had strong conviction are joined by a new cohort who were able to withstand the pain of the crash and who appreciated the importance of the technology.The plateau persists for a prolonged period of time and forms, as Casey calls it, a \u201cstable, boring low\u201d. During the plateau, public interest in the technology will dwindle but it will continue to be developed and the collection of strong believers will slowly grow. A new base is then set for the next iteration of the hype cycle as external observers recognize the technology is not going away and that investing in it may not be as risky as it seemed during the crash phase of the cycle. The next iteration of the hype cycle will bring in a much larger set of adopters and be far greater in magnitude.Very few people participating in an iteration of a Gartner hype cycle will correctly anticipate how high prices will go in that cycle. Prices usually reach levels that would seem absurd to most investors at the earliest stages of the cycle. When the cycle ends, a popular cause it typically attributed to the crash by the media. While the stated cause (such as an exchange failure) may be a precipitating event, it is not the fundamental reason for the cycle to end. Gartner hype cycles end because of an exhaustion of market participants reachable in the cycle.It is telling that gold followed the classic pattern of a Gartner hype cycle from the late 1970s to the early 2000s. One might speculate that the hype cycle is an inherent social dynamic to the process of monetization.Gartner cohortsSince the inception of the first exchange traded price in 2010, the Bitcoin market has witnessed four major Gartner hype cycles. With hindsight we can precisely identify the price ranges of previous hype cycles in the Bitcoin market. We can also qualitatively identify the cohort of investors that were associated with each iteration of prior cycles.$0\u2013$1 (2009\u2013March 2011): The first hype cycle in the Bitcoin market was dominated by cryptographers, computer scientists and cypherpunks who were already primed to understand the importance of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s groundbreaking invention and who were pioneers in establishing that the Bitcoin protocol was free of technical flaws.$1\u2013$30 (2009\u2013July 2011): The second cycle attracted both early adopters of new technology and a steady stream of ideologically motivated investors who were dazzled by the potential of a stateless money. Libertarians such as Roger Ver were attracted to Bitcoin for the anti-establishment activities that would become possible if the nascent technology became widely adopted. Wences Casares, a brilliant and well-connected serial entrepreneur, was also part of the second Bitcoin hype cycle and is known to have evangelized Bitcoin to some of the most prominent technologists and investors in Silicon Valley.$250\u2013$1100 (April 2013\u2013December 2013): The third hype cycle saw the entrance of early retail and institutional investors who were willing to brave the horrendously complicated and risky liquidity channels from which bitcoins could be bought. The primary source of liquidity in the market during this period was the Japan-based MtGox exchange that was run by the notoriously incompetent and malfeasant Mark Karpeles, who later saw prison time for his role in the collapse of the exchange.It is worth observing that the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price during the aforementioned hype cycles was largely correlated with an increase in liquidity and the ease with which investors could purchase bitcoins. In the first hype cycle, there were no exchanges available, and acquisition of bitcoins was primarily through mining or by direct exchange with someone who had already mined bitcoins. In the second hype cycle, rudimentary exchanges became available, but obtaining and securing bitcoins from these exchanges remained too complex for all but the most technologically savvy investors. Even in the third hype cycle, significant hurdles remained for investors transferring money to MtGox to acquire bitcoins. Banks were reluctant to deal with the exchange, and third party vendors who facilitated transfers were often incompetent, criminal, or both. Further, many who did manage to transfer money to MtGox ultimately faced loss of funds when the exchange was hacked and later closed.It was only after the collapse of the MtGox exchange and a two-year lull in the market price of Bitcoin that mature and deep sources of liquidity were developed; examples include regulated exchanges such as GDAX and OTC brokers such as Cumberland mining. By the time the fourth hype cycle began in 2016 it was relatively easy for retail investors to buy bitcoins and secure them.$1100\u2013$19600? (2014\u2013?):At the time of writing, the Bitcoin market is undergoing its fourth major hype cycle. Participation in the current hype cycle has been dominated by what Michael Casey described as the \u201cearly majority\u201d of retail and institutional investors.As sources of liquidity have deepened and matured, major institutional investors now have the opportunity to participate through regulated futures markets. The availability of a regulated futures market paves the way for the creation of a Bitcoin ETF, which will then usher in the \u201clate majority\u201d and \u201claggards\u201d in subsequent hype cycles.Although it is impossible to predict the exact magnitude of the current hype cycle, it would be reasonable to conjecture that the cycle reaches its zenith in the range of $20,000 to $50,000. Much higher than this range and Bitcoin would command a significant fraction of gold\u2019s entire market capitalization (gold and Bitcoin would have equivalent market capitalizations at a bitcoin price of approximately $380,000 at the time of writing). A significant fraction of gold\u2019s market capitalization comes from central bank demand and it\u2019s unlikely that central banks or nation states will participate in this particular hype cycle.The entrance of nation-statesBitcoin\u2019s final Gartner hype cycle will begin when nation-states start accumulating it as a part of their foreign currency reserves. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is currently too small for it to be considered a viable addition to reserves for most countries. However, as private sector interest increases and the capitalization of Bitcoin approaches 1 trillion dollars it will become liquid enough for most states to enter the market. The entrance of the first state to officially add bitcoins to their reserves will likely trigger a stampede for others to do so. The states that are the earliest in adopting Bitcoin would see the largest benefit to their balance sheets if Bitcoin ultimately became a global reserve currency. Unfortunately, it will probably be the states with the strongest executive powers\u200a\u2014\u200adictatorships such as North Korea\u200a\u2014\u200athat will move the fastest in accumulating bitcoins. The unwillingness to see such states improve their financial position and the inherently weak executive branches of the Western democracies will cause them to dither and be laggards in accumulating bitcoins for their reserves.There is a great irony that the US is currently one of the nations most open in its regulatory position toward Bitcoin, while China and Russia are the most hostile. The US risks the greatest downside to its geopolitical position if Bitcoin were to supplant the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency. In the 1960s, Charle de Gaulle criticized the \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d the US enjoyed from the international monetary order it crafted with the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944. The Russian and Chinese governments have not yet awoken to the geo-strategic benefits of Bitcoin as a reserve currency and are currently preoccupied with the effects it may have on their internal markets. Like de Gaulle in the 1960s, who threatened to reestablish the classical gold standard in response to the US\u2019s exorbitant privilege, the Chinese and Russians will, in time, come to see the benefits of a large reserve position in a non-sovereign store of value. With the largest concentration of Bitcoin mining power residing in China, the Chinese state already has a distinct advantage in its potential to add bitcoins to its reserves.The US prides itself as a nation of innovators, with Silicon Valley being a crown jewel of the US economy. Thus far, Silicon Valley has largely dominated the conversation toward regulators on the position they should take vis-\u00e0-vis Bitcoin. However, the banking industry and the US Federal Reserve are finally having their first inkling of the existential threat Bitcoin poses to US monetary policy if it were to become a global reserve currency. The Wall Street Journal, known to be a mouth-piece for the Federal Reserve, published a commentary on the threat Bitcoin poses to US monetary policy:There is another danger, perhaps even more serious from the point of view of the central banks and regulators: bitcoin might not crash. If the speculative fervor in the cryptocurrency is merely the precursor to it being widely used as an alternative to the dollar, it will threaten the central banks\u2019 monopoly on\u00a0money.In the coming years there will be a great struggle between entrepreneurs and innovators in Silicon Valley, who will attempt to keep Bitcoin free of state control, and the banking industry and central banks who will do everything in their power to regulate Bitcoin to prevent their industry and money-issuing powers from being disrupted.The transition to a medium of\u00a0exchangeA monetary good cannot transition to being a generally accepted medium of exchange (the standard economic definition of \u201cmoney\u201d) before it is widely valued, for the tautological reason that a good that is not valued will not be accepted in exchange. In the process of becoming widely valued, and hence a store of value, a monetary good will soar in purchasing power, creating an opportunity cost to relinquishing it for use in exchange. Only when the opportunity cost of relinquishing a store of value drops to a suitably low level can it transition to becoming a generally accepted medium of exchange.More precisely, a monetary good will only be suitable as a medium of exchange when the sum of the opportunity cost and the transactional cost of using it in exchange drops below the cost of completing a trade without it.In a barter-based society, the transition of a store of value to a medium of exchange can occur even when the monetary good is increasing in purchasing power because the transactional costs of barter trade are extremely high. In a developed economy, where transactional costs are low, it is possible for a nascent and rapidly appreciating store of value, such as Bitcoin, to be used as a medium of exchange, albeit in a very limited scope. An example is the illicit drug market where buyers are willing to sacrifice the opportunity of holding bitcoins to minimize the substantial risk of purchasing the drugs using fiat currency.There are, however, major institutional barriers to a nascent store of value becoming a generally accepted medium of exchange in a developed society. States use taxation as a powerful means to protect their sovereign money from being displaced by competing monetary goods. Not only does a sovereign money enjoy the advantage of a constant source of demand, by way of taxes being remittable only in it, but competing monetary goods are taxed whenever they are exchanged at an appreciated value. This latter kind of taxation creates significant friction to using a store of value as a medium of exchange.The handicapping of market-based monetary goods is not an insurmountable barrier to their adoption as a generally accepted medium of exchange, however. If faith is lost in a sovereign money, its value can collapse in a process known as hyperinflation. When a sovereign money hyperinflates, its value first collapses against the most liquid goods in the society, such as gold or a foreign money like the US dollar, if they are available. When no liquid goods are available or their supply is limited, a hyperinflating money collapses against real goods, such as real estate and commodities. The archetypal image of a hyperinflation is a grocery store emptied of all its produce as consumers flee the rapidly diminishing value of their nation\u2019s money.Eventually, when faith is completely lost during a hyperinflation, a sovereign money will no longer be accepted by anyone, and the society will either devolve to barter or the monetary unit will be completely replaced as a medium of exchange. An example of this process was the replacement of the Zimbabwe dollar with the US dollar. The replacement of a sovereign money with a foreign one is made more difficult by the scarcity of the foreign money and the absence of foreign banking institutions to provide liquidity.The ability to easily transmit bitcoins across borders and absence of a need for a banking system make Bitcoin an ideal monetary good to acquire for those afflicted by hyperinflation. In the coming years, as fiat monies continue to follow their historical trend toward eventual worthlessness, Bitcoin will become an increasingly popular choice for global savings to flee to. When a nation\u2019s money is abandoned and replaced by Bitcoin, Bitcoin will have transitioned from being a store of value in that society to a generally accepted medium of exchange. Daniel Krawisz coined the term \u201chyperbitcoinization\u201d to describe this process.Common misconceptionsMuch of this article has focused on the monetary nature of Bitcoin. With this foundation we can now address some of the most commonly held misconceptions about Bitcoin.Bitcoin is a\u00a0bubbleBitcoin, like all market-based monetary goods, displays a monetary premium. The monetary premium is what gives rise to the common criticism that Bitcoin is a \u201cbubble\u201d. However, all monetary goods display a monetary premium. Indeed, it is this premium (the excess over the use-demand price) that is the defining characteristic of all monies. In other words, money is always and everywhere a bubble. Paradoxically, a monetary good is both a bubble and may be undervalued if it\u2019s in the early stages of its adoption for use as money.Bitcoin is too\u00a0volatileBitcoin\u2019s price volatility is a function of its nascency. In the first few years of its existence, Bitcoin behaved like a penny-stock, and any large buyer\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as the Winklevoss twins\u200a\u2014\u200acould cause a large spike in its price. As adoption and liquidity have increased over the years, Bitcoin\u2019s volatility has decreased commensurately. When Bitcoin achieves the market capitalization of gold, it will display a similar level of volatility. As Bitcoin surpasses the market capitalization of gold, its volatility will decrease to a level that will make it suitable as a widely used medium of exchange. As previously noted, the monetization of Bitcoin occurs in a series of Gartner hype cycles. Volatility is lowest during the plateau phase of the hype cycle, while it is highest during the peak and crash phases of the cycle. Each hype cycle has lower volatility than the previous ones because the liquidity of the market has increased.Transaction fees are too\u00a0highA recent criticism of the Bitcoin network is that the increase in fees to transmit bitcoins makes it unsuitable as a payment system. However, the growth in fees is healthy and expected. Transaction fees are the cost required to pay bitcoin miners to secure the network by validating transactions. Miners can either be paid by transaction fees or by block rewards, which are an inflationary subsidy borne by current bitcoin owners.Given Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply schedule\u200a\u2014\u200aa monetary policy which makes it ideally suited as a store of value\u200a\u2014\u200ablock rewards will eventually decline to zero and the network must ultimately be secured with transaction fees. A network with \u201clow\u201d fees is a network with little security and prone to external censorship. Those touting the low fees of Bitcoin alternatives are unknowingly describing the weakness of these so-called \u201calt-coins\u201d.The specious root of the criticism of Bitcoin\u2019s \u201chigh\u201d transaction fees is the belief that Bitcoin should be a payment system first and a store of value later. As we have seen with the origins of money, this belief puts the cart before the horse. Only when Bitcoin has become a deeply established store of value will it become suitable as a medium of exchange. Further, once the opportunity cost of trading bitcoins is at a level at which it is suitable as a medium of exchange, most trades will not occur on the Bitcoin network itself but on \u201csecond layer\u201d networks with much lower fees. Second layer networks, such as the Lightning network, provide the modern equivalent of the promissory notes that were used to transfer titles for gold in the 19th century. Promissory notes were used by banks because transferring the underlying bullion was far more costly than transferring the note that represented title to the gold. Unlike promissory notes, however, the Lightning network will allow the transfer of bitcoins at low cost while requiring little or no trust of third parties such as banks. The development of the Lightning network is a profoundly important technical innovation in Bitcoin\u2019s history and its value will become apparent as it is developed and adopted in the coming years.CompetitionAs an open-source software protocol, it has always been possible to copy Bitcoin\u2019s software and imitate its network. Over the years, many imitators have been created, ranging from ersatz facsimiles, such as Litecoin, to complex variants like Ethereum that promise to allow arbitrarily complex contractual arrangements using a distributed computational system. A common investment criticism of Bitcoin is that it cannot maintain its value when competitors can be easily created that are able to incorporate the latest innovations and software features.The fallacy in this argument is that the scores of Bitcoin competitors that have been created over the years lack the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d of the first and dominant technology in the space. A network effect\u200a\u2014\u200athe increased value of using Bitcoin simply because it is already the dominant network\u200a\u2014\u200ais a feature in and of itself. For any technology that possesses a network effect, it is by far the most important feature.The network effect for Bitcoin encompasses the liquidity of its market, the number of people who own it, and the community of developers maintaining and improving upon its software and its brand awareness. Large investors, including nation-states, will seek the most liquid market so that they can enter and exit the market quickly without affecting its price. Developers will flock to the dominant development community which has the highest-calibre talent, thereby reinforcing the strength of that community. And brand awareness is self-reinforcing, as would-be competitors to Bitcoin are always mentioned in the context of Bitcoin itself.A fork in the\u00a0roadA trend that became popular in 2017 was not only to imitate Bitcoin\u2019s software, but to copy the entire history of its past transactions (known as the blockchain). By copying Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain up to a certain point and then splitting off into a new network, in a process known as \u201cforking\u201d, competitors to Bitcoin were able to solve the problem of distributing their token to a large user base.The most significant fork of this kind occurred on August 1st, 2017 when a new network known as Bitcoin Cash (BCash) was created. An owner of N bitcoins before August 1st, 2017, would then own both N bitcoins and N BCash tokens. The small but vocal community of BCash proponents have tirelessly attempted to expropriate Bitcoin\u2019s brand recognition, both through the naming of their new network and a campaign to convince neophytes in the Bitcoin market that Bcash is the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin. These attempts have largely failed, and this failure is reflected in the market capitalizations of the two networks. However, for new investors, there remains an apparent risk that a competitor might clone Bitcoin and its blockchain and succeed in overtaking it in market capitalization, thus becoming the de facto Bitcoin.An important rule can be gleaned from the major forks that have happened to both the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. The majority of the market capitalization will settle on the network that retains the highest-calibre and most active developer community. For although Bitcoin can be viewed as a nascent money, it is also a computer network built on software that needs to be maintained and improved upon. Buying tokens on a network which has little or inexperienced developer support would be akin to buying a clone of Microsoft Windows that was not supported by Microsoft\u2019s best developers. It is clear from the history of the forks that occurred in 2017 that the best and most experienced computer scientists and cryptographers are committed to developing for the original Bitcoin and not any of the growing legion of imitators that have been created from it.Real risksAlthough the common criticisms of Bitcoin found in the media and economics profession are misplaced and based on a flawed understanding of money, there are real and significant risks to investing in Bitcoin. It would be prudent for a prospective Bitcoin investor to understand and weigh these risks before considering an investment in Bitcoin.Protocol riskThe Bitcoin protocol and the cryptographic primitives that it is built upon could be found to have a design flaw, or could be made insecure with the development of quantum computing. If a flaw is found in the protocol, or some new means of computation makes possible the breaking of the cryptography underpinning Bitcoin, the faith in Bitcoin may be severely compromised. The protocol risk was highest in the early years of Bitcoin\u2019s development, when it was still unclear, even to seasoned cryptographers, that Satoshi Nakamoto had actually found a solution to the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem. Concerns about serious flaws in the Bitcoin protocol have dissipated over the years, but given its technological nature, protocol risk will always remain for Bitcoin, if only as an outlier risk.Exchange shutdownsBeing decentralized in design, Bitcoin has shown a remarkable degree of resilience in the face of numerous attempts by various governments to regulate it or shut it down. However, the exchanges where bitcoins are traded for fiat currencies are highly centralized and susceptible to regulation and closure. Without these exchanges and the willingness of the banking system to do business with them, the process of monetization of Bitcoin would be severely stunted, if not halted completely. While there are alternative sources of liquidity for Bitcoin, such as over-the-counter brokers and decentralized markets for buying and selling Bitcoins (like localbitcoins.com), the critical process of price discovery happens on the most liquid exchanges, which are all centralized.Mitigating the risk of exchange shutdowns is jurisdictional arbitrage. Binance, a prominent exchange that started in China, moved to Japan after the Chinese government halted its operations in China. National governments are also wary of smothering a nascent industry that may prove as consequential as the Internet, thereby ceding a tremendous competitive advantage to other nations.Only with a coordinated global shutdown of Bitcoin exchanges would the process of monetization be halted completely. The race is on for Bitcoin to become so widely adopted that a complete shutdown becomes as politically infeasible as a complete shutdown of the Internet. The possibility of such a shutdown is still real, however, and must be factored into the risks of investing in Bitcoin. As was discussed in the prior section on the entrance of nation-states, national governments are finally awakening to the threat that a non-sovereign, censorship-resistant, digital currency poses to their monetary policies. It is an open question whether they will act on this threat before Bitcoin becomes so entrenched that political action against it proves ineffectual.FungibilityThe open and transparent nature of the Bitcoin blockchain makes it possible for states to mark certain bitcoins as being \u201ctainted\u201d by their use in proscribed activities. Although Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance at the protocol level allows these bitcoins to be transmitted, if regulations were to appear that banned the use of such tainted bitcoins by exchanges or merchants, they could become largely worthless. Bitcoin would then lose one of the critical properties of a monetary good: fungibility.To ameliorate Bitcoin\u2019s fungibility, improvements will need to be made at the protocol level to improve the privacy of transactions. While there are new developments in this regard, pioneered in digital currencies such as Monero and Zcash, there are major technological tradeoffs to be made between the efficiency and complexity of Bitcoin and its privacy. It remains an open question whether privacy-enhancing features can be added to Bitcoin in a way that doesn\u2019t compromise its usefulness as money in other ways.ConclusionBitcoin is an incipient money that is transitioning from the collectible stage of monetization to becoming a store of value. As a non-sovereign monetary good, it is possible that at some stage in the future Bitcoin will become a global money much like gold during the classical gold standard of the 19th century. The adoption of Bitcoin as global money is precisely the bullish case for Bitcoin, and was articulated by Satoshi Nakamoto as early as 2010 in an email exchange with Mike Hearn:If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there\u2019s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per\u00a0unit.This case was made even more trenchantly by the brilliant cryptographer Hal Finney, the recipient of the first bitcoins sent by Nakamoto, shortly after the announcement of the first working Bitcoin software:[I]magine that Bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world. Then the total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10\u00a0million.Even if Bitcoin were not to become a fully fledged global money and were simply to compete with gold as a non-sovereign store of value, it is currently massively undervalued. Mapping the market capitalization of the extant above-ground gold supply (approximately 8 trillion dollars) to a maximum Bitcoin supply of 21 million coins gives a value of approximately $380,000 per bitcoin. As we have seen in prior sections, for the attributes that make a monetary good suitable as a store of value, Bitcoin is superior to gold along every axis except for established history. As time passes and the Lindy effect takes hold, established history will no longer be a competitive advantage for gold. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that Bitcoin will approach, and perhaps surpass, gold\u2019s market capitalization in the next decade. A caveat to this thesis is that a large fraction of gold\u2019s capitalization comes from central banks holding it as a store of value. For Bitcoin to achieve or surpass gold\u2019s capitalization, some participation by nation-states will be necessary. Whether the Western democracies will participate in the ownership of Bitcoin is unclear. It is more likely, and unfortunate, that tin-pot dictatorships and kleptocracies will be the first nations to enter the Bitcoin market.If no-nation states participate in the Bitcoin market, there still remains a bullish case for Bitcoin. As a non-sovereign store of value used only by retail and institutional investors, Bitcoin is still early in its adoption curve\u200a\u2014\u200athe so-called \u201cearly majority\u201d are now entering the market while the late majority and laggards are still years away from entering. With broader participation from retail and especially institutional investors, a price level between $100,000 and $200,000 is feasible.Owning bitcoins is one of the few asymmetric bets that people across the entire world can participate in. Much like a call option, an investor\u2019s downside is limited to 1x, while their potential upside is still 100x or more. Bitcoin is the first truly global bubble whose size and scope is limited only by the desire of the world\u2019s citizenry to protect their savings from the vagaries of government economic mismanagement. Indeed, Bitcoin rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the 2008 global financial catastrophe\u200a\u2014\u200aa catastrophe that was precipitated by the policies of central banks like the Federal Reserve.Beyond the financial case for Bitcoin, its rise as a non-sovereign store of value will have profound geopolitical consequences. A global, non-inflationary, reserve currency will force nation-states to alter their primary funding mechanism from inflation to direct taxation, which is far less politically palatable. States will shrink in size commensurate to the political pain of transitioning to taxation as their exclusive means of funding. Furthermore, global trade will be settled in a manner that satisfies Charles de Gaulle\u2019s aspiration that no nation should have privilege over any other:We consider it necessary that international trade be established, as it was the case, before the great misfortunes of the World, on an indisputable monetary base, and one that does not bear the mark of any particular country.50 years from now, that monetary base will be Bitcoin.TranslationsThis article has been translated into:English podcast by Heardit.English podcast by Cryptoconomy.Podcast interview about the article with Peter McCormack.Korean by Hyungmok joh (part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4).Traditional Chinese by Flora Sun (part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4)Simplified Chinese by Flora Sun (part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4)Espa\u00f1ol by I\u00f1igo and Carlos Beltr\u00e1n (part 1, part 2, part 3, part4).Nederlandse by Wim, edited by Koen Swinkels (part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4).Fran\u00e7aise by Greg Guittard (part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4).Italiano by Ryan DeLongpre.Portugu\u00eas by Allex Fer (part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4).Tamil by Balaji Vaidyanath and Mahadevan Vaidyanath (part 1).\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439/Russian by CoinSpot (part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4).Bulgarian by Bo Mirchev (part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4).About meI\u2019m a former Google engineer who\u2019s interested in Austrian economics.

It can\u2019t get any more mainstream than that, right? The incredible popularity of Bitcoin in 2017 is of course, directly tied to its rapid increase in price and its success as the asset, currency, or investment to beat. With gains at almost 2000% in 2017, no other investment comes close. What more the gains of the last 2 or 3 years? Heck, if you bought $100 worth of Bitcoin in 2010, it would be close to $100 million today. So what are these better investments I am talking about?There are better investments, if you know where to look. An investment, by the way, is not just a \u201cmoney\u201d thing. It isn\u2019t just about profits or gains. An investment is a commitment to something you believe in, something you want to support not just financially but also in spirit. It can be money, effort, work, time, and other intangible resources.So here are the five investments you should prioritize over Bitcoin:Investing In Your Physical\u00a0HealthImage copyright 2003 by Randy Glasbergen. www.glasbergen.comHow many of you haven\u2019t slept for a full 8 hours in the past month? If you are deep into the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency space, I would say about 99% think sleeping is overrated and would rather watch the markets. Yet people who sleep less than the recommended 7 to 8 hours per night are more likely to suffer from chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, diabetes and even dementia, experts say. Research found that people who averaged 4 hours of sleep were 4 times more likely to catch colds. What is the point of accumulating wealth if you will end up suffering disease and illnesses in the future, or even today?A lot of Crypto traders and Bitcoin startup people also end up neglecting their physical well-being. Exercise takes a back seat, more time sitting in an office in front of a computer, and unhealthy diets of coffee and fast food are common. Again, you might have a lot of coins, but what\u2019s the point if you will end up spending that for medical bills?A crashing market is not a real problem in the grand scheme of things. You can always earn lost money back. But when your health deteriorates from neglect, it will take a lot more to get back to health.Take a few hours per day to invest in some exercise, even just taking short walks will do wonders for your health. Invest in a class like yoga or boxing to release some of the stresses that come with this industry. Make sure you get enough sleep so that you can attack the next day sharper and in better mental condition.Investing In Your Mental\u00a0HealthImage from www.cartoonstock.comAre you the type of person who checks on the price of Bitcoin and your altcoin portfolio every few minutes? Are you constantly checking reddit and other often toxic social media sites that gets you riled up and angry at others? Are you working in a Blockchain startup and are constantly on the edge due to uncertainty about your company\u2019s future? Did you put a lot of money in an ICO that isn\u2019t doing so well? All of these things are highly stressful, and stress is deadly.More important than your physical well-being is taking care of your mental health. Stress is the biggest killer out there, and people in peak physical form can break down from mental strain in the blink of an eye. The world of Bitcoin and Cryptos is a highly stressful world. Step back. Take breaks. Disconnect once in a while. Be grateful for what you have, don\u2019t stress too much about what you want.This is a marathon, not a sprint. Bitcoin and Crypto will still be around even if you take a week-long vacation. Do it now, if you havent had one in years. The investment will be worth it.Investing In Learning Something NewCopyright 2009. Image from Baloocartoons.comWhen learning something new, the brain releases endorphins, making you feel good! Always invest in learning something new. Bitcoin technology is a lot to process for any person, and there is always something new to learn every day. Take the time to invest in some books about Bitcoin or any of the related technologies like cryptography, blockchains, and even economics and monetary policy.But also, don\u2019t get stuck with trading or learning about Bitcoins or other cryptos 24/7. By investing in a new skill set, your brain gets a great workout and will stay sharp and excited to work. Learn to code if you haven\u2019t yet, learn public speaking and explain Bitcoin to groups of people, learn Jiu Jitsu or even a musical instrument\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally anything new to learn will be a great benefit to you as a person both physically and mentally. You will stay sharp and be able to face the day to day stuff with a better state of mind.Investing In Meaningful RelationshipsImage from someecards.comNo, your \u201crelationship\u201d with Blockfolio and Coinmarketcap doesn\u2019t count.Are you always on twitter getting on flame wars about which version of Bitcoin is better? Are you arguing with haters all the time trying to defend Bitcoin? Are you constantly trying to get validation from your peers by constantly being on feedback-loop places like Reddit? Take a step back and realize that these are unhealthy habits and relationships. Yes, that thing with that altcoiner you hate and always argue with online is a relationship, albeit a hateful, angry, and stressful one.Invest in meaningful relationships, and if you already have one, don\u2019t let Bitcoin or any kind of work get in the way of it. I have personally seen relationships break down because of Bitcoin obsession. Bitcoin and crypto are technologies that are exciting and people get passionate about it, but if it is at the expense of hindering new and meaningful relationships from developing, or worse, breaks down existing meaningful relationships, then I guarantee it won\u2019t be worth it.Meet new people. Connect with old friends (and stop talking about Bitcoin! Unless they ask!). Make sure to visit your parents if they are still around, because they wont be around forever. I spent way less time with my family when I started SCI in 2014, and when my father passed away last year, it was tough. You can earn back lost money, but you can never get back precious time spent with your loved ones. Invest more in that. You will never regret it.Investing In Your CharacterImage from www.spunout.ieUsain Bolt ran around a grand total of 2 minutes in his\u00a0finals\u00a0appearances\u00a0to\u00a0win\u00a0his\u00a0major\u00a0medals, earning millions of dollars in the process, and if you calculate his earnings per second, it is in the millions of dollars. Is he lucky? No. To get there, he invested twenty years of hard work and thankless training. This is the true meaning of investing.Invest in making yourself a better version of who you were yesterday. Be more courageous. Try new things. Stay humble. Take time for fun! Make new friends. Always be curious. Surround yourself with people who are smarter and more successful, people who can teach you something. Appreciate the present and let go of your toxic relationships. Find work that gives you fulfillment.Bitcoin is important, yes, but a lot of people have developed an unhealthy obsession about it\u200a\u2014\u200ajust check twitter and see for yourself. It is important that we focus on developing this new technology and the infrastructure that will allow future generations to enjoy its benefits, but if the cost is the deterioration of our physical, mental, and social well-being, then maybe it isn\u2019t worth it.These are just some of the things in which, if you just invest the right amount of time and effort, will pay off much more than Bitcoin or any financial investment, guaranteed.Happy holidays everyone\u00a0:)", "responses": "56"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "", "link": "https://medium.freecodecamp.org/future-of-bitcoin-cc6936ba0b99?source=search_post", "post_date": "", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "", "responses": ""}, {"title": "My Vision For SegWit And Lightning Networks On Litecoin And\u00a0Bitcoin", "author_name": "Charlie Lee", "link": "https://segwit.org/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 6, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "12.9K", "content": "My Vision For SegWit And Lightning Networks On Litecoin And\u00a0BitcoinCharlie LeeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 6, 2017You\u2019ve probably seen that I recently started advocating for SegWit to activate on Litecoin and Bitcoin. I wasn\u2019t doing any of this before because it would be wasted energy when the code was not finished. But now that the release candidate code is tagged and binaries close to release, I figure it\u2019s time for me to start making some noise.So you may wonder why I\u2019m pushing for SegWit. Litecoin does not have a block size problem. That\u2019s right, and SegWit is not just a block scaling solution. I would even say block scaling is just a side benefit of SegWit. The main fix is transaction malleability, which would allow Lightning Networks (LN) to be built on top of Litecoin. And there are a bunch more nice features of SegWit.But some people say LN on Bitcoin will kill any reason to use Litecoin. If people can do instantaneous transactions on Bitcoin, why would they use Litecoin? My gut feel is that this is not the case. Even with LN, Bitcoin still cannot service every person in the world. I think the calculation was that at 1MB blocks, LN and SegWit on Bitcoin can service 500M users. LN nodes will charge a fee for LN txns going through them and that fee will be relative to the Bitcoin network fee. So Bitcoin LN txns will be more expensive than Litecoin LN txns. It may make economic sense for a LN txn to go via Litecoin and back to Bitcoin to get the cheapest rate. Lightning makes this possible because it allows the two LN to be interoperable. I don\u2019t know that this use case will be economical or not, but we won\u2019t know until both LNs are built and running.Think of it being two highways: Today, Bitcoin is packed full of cars and Litecoin is empty. Even with Bitcoin packed, the cars are not coming to use the Litecoin highway today because it\u2019s not connected and it\u2019s inconvenient (centralized exchanges and slow on-chain transfers) to go across. LN will build bridges over the highways. But a side benefit is that these bridges will connect both highways together. Maybe the bridges on Bitcoin are enough such that cars will still stay on the Bitcoin highway. My bet is that the convenience and the cheaper tolls on Litecoin highway will convince cars to cross over and use Litecoin. But we won\u2019t know until both are built.Another benefit is atomic cross-chain transactions via LN. Two users can trade BTC and LTC instantaneous and without risk. Efficient decentralized exchanges are now possible. Or what if a merchant accepts only BTC but you only have LTC. You can now pay LTC and exchange them instantly through a LN exchange node and send BTC to the merchant. That\u2019s basically decentralized ShapeShift. One last thing I thought of recently is the ability to balance lopsided payment channels on both lightning networks. There are probably millions of other cool things that SegWit and LN open up that we have yet scratched the surface of.Until SegWit, LN, and Confidential Transactions, I didn\u2019t see a need for Litecoin to come out to help test features before they are on Bitcoin. So I was happy to let Litecoin go on without a lot of development. Hence my tweet about Litecoin not needing development. But with SegWit and Bitcoin\u2019s current block scaling deadlock, I see a potential for Litecoin to help Bitcoin break through this deadlock. Litecoin can take a lead and be a positive force in the cryptocurrency space. We have been drafting behind the Bitcoin race car for many years. It\u2019s about time to take a turn out front.This is my vision for how Litecoin and Bitcoin will work together to solve the world\u2019s transaction needs in the future. And it is why the Silver to Bitcoin\u2019s Gold analogy always resonated with me.

It kept grinding through the collapse of Mt Gox. It outlasted critics and doubters who declared it dead again and again and again. It outwitted an exchange and ICO ban from China. It hasn\u2019t suffered a major security breach, even as it moves billions of dollars around the world in the blink of an eye, something almost no major company or government\u2019s website can claim.When you think about just how many major corporations suffered hacks, from Equifax to Sony to Apple to JP Morgan (who\u2019s CEO laughably called Bitcoin a fraud when he can\u2019t even protect his own systems), as well as supposedly secure government websites, from the NSA to the Department of Defense to the Army, Bitcoin\u2019s incredible security is almost unbelievably mind-boggling.But Bitcoin\u2019s biggest battle is yet to come.Governments and banks.Master investor Naval Ravikant calls governments and the old world banking elite the \u201cfinal boss.\u201dFor a time, the powers that be only laughed at the little currency that could. But they aren\u2019t laughing anymore. As Bitcoin surges higher and higher, the eye of Sauron turns.Eye of Sauron in The Lord of the\u00a0Rings.And if you think central powers can\u2019t do major damage to crypto, think again. They wield the ultimate power:The violence hack.That\u2019s power to kill you or put you in jail.Back in October 2017, former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernake said \u201ceventually governments will take any action necessary to prevent Bitcoin.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t kidding. The only question is whether the distributed design of cryptos can survive the assaults to come? Only time will tell.But the efforts to reign in the decentralized money engine have already started.Classic cold war Russian propaganda.Proof of Work mining is the biggest choke point of the Bitcoin system. It leads to heavy centralization with specialized chips. Miners process transactions around the world and mint new coins. While China has so far laid off on attacking mega-miners like Jihan Wu, Russia already set the stage for the assault: Registration.By forcing miners to register they can keep track of them and tax them and if necessary seize their mines and take all the coins for themselves. In a time of war, that is exactly what they\u2019ll do, take the mines by sending in men with guns. It\u2019s hard to pick up a few thousand ant-miners and move them somewhere else. And because they pull so much electricity they\u2019re easy to spot.Alternative consensus protocols can stop this attack, like Proof of Stake. But more work is needed and Proof of Stake needs to prove itself with a major coin. Other consensus protocols will develop in the coming years, ones that don\u2019t burn as much energy but still provide proof that a job was done in the correct way and nobody cheated.But it\u2019s now a race against time.Congress is looking to expand its money laundering law to target crypto by making it a crime to hide any wallets or crypto you own with Senate Bill S.1241.It makes it illegal to conceal a digital wallet and cryptocurrency for any reason and while crossing the border. So just declare it, right? You\u2019re a good, law abiding citizen. You pay your taxes including your crypto taxes. You\u2019ve got nothing to hide.Except the border control folks have the right to steal it from you without just cause.In other words, they can take the money just because they feel like it and they don\u2019t even have to tell you why.If that sounds like legalized robbery, it\u2019s because that\u2019s exactly what it is.The ACLU documents thousands of cases of everyday citizens robbed of their life savings. It\u2019s called Civil Asset Forfeiture. And lest you think only liberal leaning organizations see it as a problem, think again. The arch-conservative Heritage Foundation has a page dedicated to the ever growing problems with the practice.It\u2019s one of those rare issues where both the left and right agree. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions looked to roll back Obama era restrictions on asset forfeiture he faced an immediate backlash from both sides of the aisle.So why do we still have state sponsored theft?Greed.Mostly the money is used to pad law enforcement pockets in a time when budgets are falling. According to the Washington Post the people who are supposed to protect us stole more money from Americans in 2014, over $5 billion dollars, than all the burglars in the US combined, who only managed to nab a measly $3.5 billion.The new Senate law creates a nasty dilemma that runs head first into the wall of civil asset forfeiture. If you fail to tell border agents you\u2019re carrying $10,000 or more in crypto you could spend 10 years in jail. If you do tell them, they can take it from you, by holding you indefinitely and demanding your password, even without charging you with a crime.It\u2019s a living, breathing Catch-22.These are the kind of things the healthy democracies don\u2019t do but that failing, flawed democracies with crumbling infrastructure and institutions do with impunity. That\u2019s why the United States crashed out of the top of the Democracy Index that lists full and thriving democracies and smashed down into the \u201cflawed democracies\u201d range.The Founding Fathers are rolling in their graves.Not for a second would they have allowed a law like that to pass unchecked. They would have tossed it in with the Intolerable Acts that lead to war with England. The Founding Fathers wanted to protect your private property at all costs. To them property was sacred. The government couldn\u2019t take it without a damn good reason. That\u2019s what the 4th amendment was all about and why they created it.\u201c The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201dDon\u2019t get me wrong. The Founding Fathers didn\u2019t want criminals and terrorists keeping their profits and I sure as hell don\u2019t either. But they wanted due process, rule of law, proof and convictions. They didn\u2019t want us turning into some banana republic, with arbitrary search and seizure and crooked cops ripping people off like they\u2019re Mexican cops rolling tourists for cash at a traffic stop.They did this because they lived in an authoritarian state. They knew exactly what it meant. The English government could force you to put a soldier up in your house and foot the bill. They sometimes charged people in secret courts, called Star Chambers with no possibility of appeal. The Constitution was specifically designed to halt these abuses but today they\u2019re running rampant because the people alive now have never lived in anything but a free society and don\u2019t know what it means to not live in one.They might want to study the history of the countries at the bottom of the Democracy Index because bad laws are a slippery slope that can slide a country right to the bottom of the list almost overnight.Check out Venezuela where they went from thriving democracy to utter collapse. Take a look at Zimbabwe, which suffered insane levels of hyperinflation, or any of the cutthroat political regimes of central Africa like Rwanda. Rwanda didn\u2019t just suffer a genocide in 1994, they\u2019ve been suffering them for a hundred years as one ousted group regains power and takes revenge on the other side yet again.These laws are only the beginning. More will follow.Yet all hope is not lost.Some countries, like Japan and Switzerland, have already taken an enlightened approach to crypto.The enlightened approach.They see cryptos as a game changing technology that will help create more wealth and prosperity than any other technology in the history of the world. Smart countries are embracing it with open arms.Other countries should learn from these smart countries.But less enlightened regimes are taking a dark view of cryptos, particularly the ones that worship power and control at all costs. Vietnam has already banned crypto. Indonesia did the same, despite the fact that their money is essentially worthless and most of their population is completely unbanked.None of these efforts will work in the long run.The decentralized nature of cryptos make them hard to completely stamp out but central powers can do serious damage to them in the short run and create a lot of pain and suffering for regular people, while utterly failing to stop the bad guys.Cryptos are not going away. Every day more and more traditional powers join the crypto party. The CME Group starts trading Bitcoin futures in a few weeks. The CBOE beat them to it and starts trading on the 10th. The more money that floods into them, the more incentive they have to protect them.And a world wide ban is never happening. In today\u2019s fractured society, there\u2019s almost zero chance that all the countries in the world will agree on anything. Some countries will oppose a ban just to spite their rivals or because they see it as a way to get around global sanctions. That means there will always be nodes running somewhere in the world to process transactions.Crypto is changing with the new threats, morphing and shifting. Anonymity technology is surging in popularity with privacy focused coins like Zcash and Monero leading the charge. If governments push too hard, they\u2019ll only make it harder and harder to get a better handle on their uses for illicit purposes.Better to embrace them openly and bring them into the light. Make them mainstream. Let people buy kittens and Snickers and books on Amazon!Crypto Kitties!Cryptocurrencies are incredibly resilient, world changing technologies. They\u2019re unlike any other asset class that has ever existed. For all the doubters who try to pigeonhole them as digital gold they\u2019re really missing the boat.They\u2019re programmable money.You can\u2019t program a dollar to self-escrow in a smart contract that pays out every month. But you can do that with Ethereum.Too often it\u2019s been psychopaths who\u2019ve run the\u00a0world.They\u2019re also a path to self-sovereignty and control of the money you earned. A refugee fleeing a war torn country can simply delete their wallet, memorize its special phrase and recreate it once they get to a safe haven. No more will ruthless regimes rob the poorest people of everything they have as they\u2019re fleeing the battles of psychopathic monsters.Cryptos can and will change the world for the better.But to get there they\u2019ll have to face the final boss, a relentless one that will do anything to keep control of the money supply. Never forget that money is power. And nobody gives up power without a fight.Bowser, the final boss in Super Mario Brothers.The war on crypto is coming like a dark storm.Governments will sell it with the same tired old song, as a way to stop criminals and terrorists.But it\u2019s never really about that.It\u2019s about control.It\u2019s about whether they can take your money just because they feel like it.The people who cheated the system\u00a0thrived.Cryptos have central powers scared. All the people who benefited from the collateralize debt obligations while you lost your house got away with their crimes. They didn\u2019t just get away with it, you helped bail them out. You gave retirement packages to the biggest perpetrators who are now living in even bigger mansions and laughing.Of course, it\u2019s always the short sighted and the wicked who try to stop new technology to make sure they maintain their own position at all costs.It\u2019s just that this time it won\u2019t work.Countries that stand against the blockchain will find that it blows back on them and punishes them severely, while the rest of the world roars past. They won\u2019t get to play in the new sandbox. They\u2019ll watch as other economies leave them in the dust, armed with brand new financial technology that makes the snail speed of current fintech worthless.And the people who robbed the world of its wealth and the dictators who crashed their economies and lived in palaces while their people starved will pay a terrible price.The world won\u2019t miss any of them.###########################################Get your Money Badger shirt right here for a limited time.

Right now, that catalyst is the \u201ctoken sale\u201d or \u201cInitial Coin Offering (ICO)\u201d phenomena.ICO vs IPO: The wild west of investmentWhat the heck is an ICO anyway?\u00a0\u00a0You may have heard of an \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d (IPO)\u200a\u2014\u200awhen a company goes public by selling some of its shares to institutional investors, who in turn sell to the general public on the securities exchange. The public gets excited about IPOs because they let anyone with a brokerage account purchase shares of companies like Snapchat.\u00a0\u00a0Are ICOs the same thing? Yes and no. IPOs and ICOs are both used by companies to raise capital. The main (and really important) difference is regulation. IPOs are regulated by the SEC and have a set of legal requirements and a formal process for how they\u2019re carried out. ICOs are currently unregulated and more of a \u201cwild west\u201d practice.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, there seems to be a lot of confusion and uncertainty when it comes to ICOs. Some argue that they have turned into a \u201cperverse and unsustainable Keynesian beauty contest.\u201d Supporters are optimistic and claim that it\u2019s a new form of Venture Capital.\u00a0\u00a0With drastically opposing viewpoints like this dominating the conversation, most of us are left on the sidelines scratching our heads.Necessary background knowledgeYou can\u2019t understand ICOs without understanding the underlying digital asset sold in an ICO.\u00a0\u00a0If you already know the basics of crypto, feel free to skip this section. For the rest of us\u2026 let\u2019s start from the top!The Cryptocurrency technology stackCryptocurrency technology stackBitcoinBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses a peer-to-peer technology.\u00a0\u00a0Peer-to-peer essentially means that there isn\u2019t a central authority issuing new money or tracking transactions. Instead, these operations are managed collectively by the network. The transactions happen between users directly and are recorded on the blockchain (more on that below).\u00a0\u00a0The Internet is filled with great Bitcoin explainers, so I won\u2019t delve much farther down the rabbit hole in this post. Instead, here are some starting points to get you up to speed:Bitcoin Wiki, Wikipedia, What is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Magazine, Why Bitcoin matters.BlockchainA blockchain is a decentralized public database that keeps a permanent record of digital transactions.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, it\u2019s a logfile storing an immutable record of all the digital transactions. This decentralized database is not controlled by a central administrator, but instead is a network of replicated databases (meaning each node in the network stores its own copy of the blockchain) that is shared and visible to anyone within network.\u00a0\u00a0Every \u201cblock\u201d in this blockchain contains a record of recent transactions, a reference to the block that came immediately before it, and an answer to a difficult mathematical puzzle, among other things.A blockchain is collectively maintained by \u201cminers\u201d, who are members within the network that compete to validate Bitcoin transactions in each block by solving the complex algorithmic problem associated with the block.\u00a0\u00a0They do this by buying or renting lots of computing power to run these complex algorithmic problems on. The incentive for them to use their computing power to verify transactions is that they are rewarded with Bitcoin if they solve the problem and validate a Bitcoin block.\u00a0\u00a0The power of such a decentralized network is that economic value and governance are distributed among the network\u2019s stakeholders (i.e. miners and consumers) rather than concentrated in a single organization (e.g. banks, governments & accountants). Thanks to this setup, anyone can own and transfer assets digitally without the need for a third party.Blockchain technology isn\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. It can be used to create any other cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum and Litecoin, which utilize their own blockchains.\u00a0You can read more about bitcoin and blockchain at Wikipedia or watch this great explainer video.Protocol layerNext, we have the protocol layer. In general, a protocol is the special set of rules that nodes in a network use when they transmit information. These rules specify the interactions between the communicating entities.One example of a protocol used in telecommunications is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is a set of rules for exchanging messages at the information packet level on the internet. TCP guarantees that the data packets will be delivered and that they will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent. Another example of a protocol is Internet Protocol (IP), which is a set of rules to send and receive messages at the Internet address level\u200a\u2014\u200ait essentially specifies the format of the data packets on the internet and the addressing scheme.TCP/IP ProtocolWhen discussing blockchains, the term \u201cprotocol\u201d refers to the \u201ccryptoeconomic rules\u201d that are enforced by a blockchain in order to maintain distributed consensus across the blockchain\u2019s peer-to-peer network.Cryptoeconomic rules are rules that govern a decentralized digital economy that:(i) uses public key cryptography for authentication(2) has economic incentives to ensure that the rules are followedFor example, in the case of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, it has financial incentives that are provided to the miners for validating every Bitcoin transaction and in turn, securing the network.What exactly are these financial incentives?TokensEnter tokens.The financial incentive for miners comes from the native token built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin. The coin serves as a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aminers who use their computing power to validate transactions are rewarded with a certain amount of coin.In general, when you hear the term \u201ccryptocurrency tokens\u201d or simply \u201ctokens\u201d, they are referring to tokens such as Bitcoin that are built on top of a blockchain and represent a digital asset which you own and can transfer to someone else.There are various ways to create tokens on top of a blockchain. For example, the simplest tokens to understand are intrinsic tokens like Bitcoin, which is directly built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Or you can choose to fork the Bitcoin blockchain and build tokens on top\u200a\u2014\u200asome examples include ZCash, Litecoin, Monero, and others. Or you can build an entirely new blockchain technology and build a token on top of that\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is what Ethereum did. The token on top of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is \u201cEther\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u2026you can even build tokens on top of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain itself. Gnosis (GNO) and Augur (REP) are examples of this. Perhaps confusing since \u201cEther\u201d is the intrinsic token built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. I\u2019ll explain later in the post. For now, just accept the fact that it\u2019s possible to build other tokens besides the intrinsic token on the Ethereum Blockchain.There\u2019s a helpful analogy here with traditional currencies\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can think of tokens as the currency itself (e.g. USD, EUR, etc.) and the blockchain protocol as the monetary policy.\u00a0\u00a0The main takeaway here is that every token is based on some underlying blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200awhether it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, or some other forked/new blockchain.Regardless of the cryptocurrency in question, tokens are valuable because the blockchain provides a backbone for asset manipulation that is immutable, decentralized, and impossible to counterfeit.The application layerSo far, we\u2019ve learned about Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain that enables it. We\u2019ve also learned about the protocol that determines the rules of the blockchain, and the tokens built on top of it.Together, these technologies have made us rethink our definition of money as something that is digital, easily transferrable, secure, and decentralized.But the important part to realize is that money is just one application of the blockchain. Besides money, the reason so many of us in the crypto-world are nerding out about the blockchain is because it has revealed a potential future for (1) protocols and (2) applications in general.(1) ProtocolsThe ultimate dream of cryptocurrency developers is that we can take advantage of this blockchain technology to build new and improved communication protocols from the ground up. Protocols being developed for cryptocurrencies have the potential to solve problems with centralization that have plagued the Internet since the first dial-up modem whirred and beeped into action.\u00a0\u00a0What are examples of such protocols?Well, they could include protocols for payments, identity, domain name systems, cloud computing, reputation systems, and much more. Many of these systems today are highly centralized (e.g. Stripe, Paypal, Google, Amazon) and there\u2019s no such thing as defaults or standards for these things on the Web.\u00a0\u00a0Hence, in the long term, our hope is that the blockchain technology will enable decentralized, open, and secure protocols to be built with use cases far outside cryptocurrency.(2) ApplicationsBlockchain enables what we call \u201cdecentralized applications\u201d.\u00a0Decentralized application, or \u201cdApp\u201d, is an application built on top of the blockchain. How does that work?Let\u2019s consider the Bitcoin blockchain as an example. Bitcoin uses a scripting system for transactions that occur on the Bitcoin blockchain. A script is a simple list of instructions. So the Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language enables us to write a script that is recorded with every transaction. The purpose of the script is to define the requirements the recipient must meet to gain access to the Bitcoins being transferred.For a typical Bitcoin transfer, the script will define what the spender must provide:a public key that, when hashed, matches the destination address included in the scripta signature to show evidence of the private key corresponding to the public key just providedBut the neat thing is that there\u2019s some flexibility in the parameters we can send with each transaction. For example, we can write a script that says \u201cthis transaction is only valid if it has two private keys\u201d. So essentially, this scripting language now lets us encode rules for how to move money, or more generally, any piece of information, around, without requiring us to trust some third party to follow a set of rules we care about. We simply trust the code and all is well.Because Bitcoin has this scripting language, it\u2019s possible to use this language to build certain types applications that transact on the blockchain. In other words, we can build applications that use Bitcoin transactions to communicate.For example, let\u2019s say we want to build a blockchain-based crowdfunding application. You might have a set of rules for how funds are transferred (or communicated) between one party to another which you encode in the scripting language. Then users of the application can run a crowdfunding event that is governed by the blockchain.This is the main idea behind dApps: a decentralized set of rules that define a specific application. This set of rules sits on a public and decentralized blockchain (instead of a central server owned by some large entity, such as Facebook or Amazon). This enables it to governed by autonomy and be resilient to censorship.\u201cWhere are the apps?\u201d\u00a0dilemmaMany of us in the crypto world were under the impression that developers would immediately hop on the bandwagon and use Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language to build decentralized applications on top.\u00a0\u00a0But fast forward eight years (Bitcoin was released in 2009), and Bitcoin has yet to become more than simply a store of value and a speculative investment.\u00a0Sure, we\u2019ve seen a handful of wallets and exchanges built. (Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex, and GDAX, to name a few.)\u00a0\u00a0\u2026And of course, we can\u2019t forget Silk Road, the digital anonymous drug marketplace that processed over $1 billion in sales in 2.5 years and was shut down by law enforcement in late 2013.\u00a0\u00a0In some ways, Bitcoin could be considered the first decentralized application since it runs on blockchain technology, is fully open-source, and runs without a central authority.\u00a0But seriously, a lot of us are here still looking around and wondering, \u201cWhere are the killer apps?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Sadly, almost no one I know uses blockchain-based applications in their day to day.\u00a0Here are some factors holding these applications back from popularity (note: these are my personal opinions):1. Lack of developer friendliness and\u00a0toolingProgramming applications using Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is not easy. Why?\u00a0\u00a0For one, the scripting language is too limited. A scripting language is a programming language where you can write code to perform some actions. An example of a scripting language widely used on the web today is JavaScript.const greeting = (name) => \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";const add = (a, b) => a + b;const subtract = (a, b) => a - bCompare this to Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language:OP_DUP OP_HASH160 62e907b15cbf27d5425399ebf6f0fb50ebb88f18 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGThe JavaScript on top reads pretty much like English. Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language, on the other hand, looks like machine code. Most developers are used to writing in expressive languages like JavaScript, Ruby or Python\u2026 not machine code. Bitcoin script is daunting for most developers.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, developer tooling and great documentation goes a long way in gaining adoption among developers. Take React, for example, which is one of the most popular front-end libraries today. One of the biggest reasons that React became so popular is because of how much effort the community has put into building a strong set of developer tools (e.g. IDEs, Babel, Webpack, boilerplates, Create React App, etc), documentation, and tutorials. Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem, on the other hand, is the opposite of user-friendly.\u00a0Lastly, Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is not turing complete. A turing complete programming language is one that can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine. In other words, it can be used to solve any computation problem that a Turing machine can run given enough time and memory. (for more on this, read this Stackoverflow discussion). By not being turing complete, Bitcoin script restricts what you can do.\u00a0Overall, Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language has historically been limited, difficult to use and lacked adequate tooling and documentation. As a result, it didn\u2019t encourage a developer community to form, which is the prerequisite to killer applications.2. Building a decentralized application with strong network effects isn\u2019t\u00a0easyMany of the applications we use in our daily work (marketplaces, exchanges, social networks, etc) derive their value from their strong network effects. A network effect is when a product or service increases in value as more people use it.\u00a0\u00a0A classic example is Facebook. Every new user connecting to other users on the platform non-linearly increases the number of connections. Similarly, Venmo is useless if you\u2019re the only person on the platform. For every new friend that joins, the value of the product goes up because you can now pay and/or receive payment from this friend.\u00a0Network effects help build better products and services. However, building up this network is one of the hardest parts of building a successful product, classically known as the \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problem.\u00a0\u00a0So even if a developer were to make the effort to build a decentralized crowdfunding platform on top of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, getting users on both side of the platform (i.e. investors and product-builders) is an incredibly hard challenge.\u00a0\u00a0The blockchain provides the technological underpinnings to create decentralized applications, but it doesn\u2019t provide the framework or tools necessary to drive adoption of the network.3. Decentralization alone doesn\u2019t provide a 10x improvementWhen we talk about decentralized applications built on top of the blockchain, we might think of transaction-based platforms, such crowdfunding, remittances, payments, coupons, etc. It might be a neat technical feat to have a decentralized version of these types of services, but the reality is, we already have existing apps that work perfectly fine for each of these use cases.\u00a0\u00a0For crowdfunding, we have Kickstarter. For remittances, we can use TransferWise. For payments, we can use Credit Cards, Paypal, Venmo, Square, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Peter Thiel\u2019s 10x rule is important to think about when we\u2019re considering how to get users to substitute existing solutions with the new decentralized ones. As of now, it\u2019s unclear what dimension these 10x advantages come from, so far as users go.\u00a0\u00a0Take WeiFund, for example, which is a decentralized crowdfunding platform. As a user, WeiFund's interface and user experience seems similar to conventional crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe. The main differences seem to be that they claim to have lower costs and that they use smart contracts to run the crowdfunding, allowing for more complex agreements. Is this enough to get users to make the effort to switch over (especially when the costs aren't that much lower)?\u00a0By no means do I believe that decentralized applications have no benefits. In fact, I foresee a future where applications are 10x more secure, 10x cheaper, 10x more efficient, or 10x more on some dimension than the current ones.\u00a0\u00a0The point is that these benefits have not been proven yet, so there's little reason for users to consider using a decentralized application today.The rise of decentralized applications\u2026 maybe.Enter Ethereum.Ethereum is a cryptocurrency launched in 2015 and built from the ground up using its own blockchain technology. It was designed to be a more generalized protocol than Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, with the explicit goal of doing more than just creating and recording transfers of a blockchain network\u2019s native tokens.As written in the Ethereum white paper:\u201cThe intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions.\u201dEthereumIn essence, Ethereum is simply a transaction-based state machine: we begin with a \u201cgenesis state\u201d and incrementally execute transactions to transform it into some final state. The final state is what we accept as the canonical version of the current state of the world of Ethereum.Ethereum transactionWhile Bitcoin is the intrinsic token for Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, Ether is the intrinsic token for Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain contains a log of transaction-like events. Users send Ether to one another using the \u201clog,\u201d and miners are incentivized to verify and secure these transactions within the network.But it can also go way beyond that\u200a\u2014\u200athe Ethereum blockchain can be filled with a wider variety of event information coming from any sort of computer program.Let\u2019s look at a few of the core concepts that underly the Ethereum blockchain to understand why this is possible:Ethereum basicsFirst is accounts. There are two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts and Contracts Accounts. Both account types have an Ether balance.The main distinction is that contract accounts have some piece of code associated with them, while externally owned accounts do not. Contract accounts, therefore, have the ability to perform any type of computation when its associated code is executed.Next we have what are known as transactions, which are cryptographically signed data packages that store a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain. When a transaction is sent to a contract account, the code associated with the contract account is executed by the \u201cEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u201d on each node (more on that below).Finally, there are messages. Messages allow contract accounts to call one another. When a contract account send a message to another contract account, the code associated with the account is activated. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it\u2019s produced by a contract account rather than an external account.Let\u2019s quickly explain the concept of the \u201cEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u201d. Remember how we learned that the protocol for the Bitcoin blockchain determines how transactions on the network get verified? Well, in Ethereum\u2019s case, every node that is participating in the Ethereum network runs the EVM as part of this verification process.Source: Coinspace.ioLet\u2019s say we have a set of transactions that were started by some external accounts. These get accumulated into a block, and then the nodes in the Ethereum network go through the transactions listed in the block and run the code associated with these transactions within the EVM. It\u2019s important to note that every node in the network runs the code and stores the resulting values. As you might guess, this tends to be computationally very expensive. To compensate for this expense and incentivize the nodes (or miners) to run these computations, the miners specify a fee for running these transactions. This fee is referred to as \u201cgas\u201d (you can read more on gas here). This is similar to how fees work in Bitcoin, where any fees attached to a bitcoin transaction go to the miner who mined the block that included the transaction.Note: This is a very high level description of how the Ethereum blockchain works and it certainly skips a lot of details for purposes of brevity. I\u2019ll write more in-depth articles in the future.Lastly, we have Ethereum\u2019s programming language for writing executable distributed applications and contracts. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s programming languages (Solidity which is similar to JavaScript\u00a0, Serpent which is similar to Python) don\u2019t look like machine code. It has the expressive power and functionality of languages that programmers are accustomed to developing on, like JavaScript or Python. Moreover, it lets you do pretty much anything an advanced programming language would let you do. Hence, it is \u201cTuring complete\u201d.The key takeaway from all this is that Ethereum stepped into the crypto-world and provided us with a generalized framework for running any type of code on the blockchain more easily. Because Ethereum\u2019s language is turing complete, stateful, and developer friendly, the hope was to open up the benefits of the blockchain beyond just enforcing one particular ruleset (e.g. how digital money gets transferred) and enable a safe, open, highly available, autonomously governed, efficient, trustable and reliable mechanism to build any ruleset on top. This would enable developers to develop any type of application imaginable.An example of an application that is incredibly simple to build on Ethereum is a \u201csmart contract\u201d. A smart contract is a distributed contract that is represented in code and basically says \u201cif this happens then do that\u201d. They can accept and store Ether and data, and can send that Ether to other accounts or even other smart contracts. Just like regular contracts (e.g. a property lease or an employment agreement), they are used to form agreements with people or entities, but unlike regular contracts, they act like autonomous agents that run entirely on the blockchain and remove the human out of the loop, making them automated, open, secure and trustless.Another example of an application is a decentralized organization. A decentralized organization is a programmatic organization that runs based on rules encoded within smart contracts. So instead of the typical hierarchical structure of an organization that is managed by humans, a decentralized organization encodes all its rules into a smart contract and then is completely managed by a blockchain.Despite the fact that Ethereum has made it easy for us to now build applications on the blockchain, let\u2019s admit it, most of us, even including us crypto-nerds, are still living in a world where we don\u2019t use decentralized applications in our day to day.Why is that?\u00a0\u00a0To explain, let\u2019s go back to my earlier hypothesis on why we ended up at the \u201cwhere are the apps\u201d problem, and see how Ethereum addresses each one.Problem #1: Lack of developer friendlinessAs we described above, Ethereum solves this problem by design through its expressive programming language and strong developer tooling.Problem #2: Building up network effects is hardWith or without Ethereum, seeding and spinning the network effects is still a huge roadblock. Replacing existing network businesses who\u2019ve built up huge networks effects is\u2026 as we said before, really HARD. If someone builds a decentralized Airbnb, they still need to convince both sides of the platform, the users and hosts, to come on board.Problem #3: Doesn\u2019t provide 10x improvementWe learned earlier that most users wouldn\u2019t be willing to switch to a decentralized platform unless it\u2019s 10x better than an existing solution on some dimension.Just because it\u2019s easier to build a decentralized application on Ethereum, doesn\u2019t mean it provides the 10x experience we\u2019re looking for. And so, the question we might ask is, are we still right back to square one? still stuck in the trenches?Well, not really.Because although Ethereum doesn\u2019t directly solve the network effects problem, nor the 10x problem, what it does do is enable the creation of a whole new set of applications that were never possible before. The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. I believe Ethereum makes inventing something completely new possible by making it easy to build smart contracts.The rise of protocols, tokens, and applicationsWhy the big deal about being able to build smart contracts?ProtocolsWell, the beauty of being able to easily build smart contracts on Ethereum is that it enables anyone to easily build a new protocol on top of Ethereum. Remember that a protocol is simply a set of rules that nodes in a network use when they to transmit information. Smart contracts allow us to do exactly this\u200a\u2014\u200acreate an automated trustworthy set of rules between two or more parties.Earlier, we mentioned how blockchain protocols have a intrinsic \u201ctoken\u201d associated with it, which is a digital asset that can be transferred between two users in the network without requiring the consent of a third party. In the case of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, the intrinsic token is Bitcoin and in the case of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, the intrinsic token is Ether.But just because the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchain protocols have intrinsic tokens associated with it to drive the network, doesn\u2019t mean a protocol built on Ethereum using a smart contract must have a token associated with it. Remember that the purpose of a protocol is simply to specify rules for communication between nodes.So essentially, there\u2019s two types of protocols:Ones which have a intrinsic token associated with it that help create economic incentives that drive a networkOnes which don\u2019t have a token that drives financial incentives and are simply used as a communication protocol between nodes (Note: these types of protocols CAN still have a token associated with it\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g. to represent membership in the network, shares on an open market, etc. The difference is that they are not used to drive some economic incentive.)For lack of better names, I\u2019ll call the first kind \u201ccrypto-token-protocols\u201d and the second kind \u201ccrypto-protocols\u201d.TokensNow onto tokens.Just like Ethereum makes it possible to build new protocols on top of its blockchain, it also makes it possible to use smart contracts to build new tokens on top of its blockchain. Let\u2019s call these types of tokens \u201cnon-intrinsic tokens\u201d.In this regard, broadly speaking, we can think of a token system as just a database with one operation: subtract X units from A and give X units to B, under the condition that:\u00a0 (i) A had at least X units before the transaction(ii) The transaction is approved by AEthereum makes it especially easy to implement such token systems. More specifically, ERC20 token interface provides a standardized way to develop a token that is compatible with the existing Ethereum ecosystem, such as development tools, wallets, and exchanges.What\u2019s more, these non-intrinsic tokens can exist as:Standalone tokens built on Ethereum (as shown in the above diagram)Be associated with any new underlying crypto-token-protocol built on EthereumBe associated with any new underlying crypto-protocol built on EthereumProtocols? Tokens? Protocols + Tokens? Why does this matter?\u00a0\u00a0Let\u2019s take a look.Token sale (i.e.\u00a0\u201cICO\u201d)Launching a new cryptocurrency blockchain is not easy\u200a\u2014\u200ait requires a massive bootstrapping effort in order to assemble the resources needed to get it up and running. But in the case of Ethereum, its intrinsic tokens were used to spin up their blockchains\u200a\u2014\u200ain order to kickstart a large network of developers, miners, investors, and other stakeholders, Ethereum created some Ether tokens and launched a presale of these tokens to the general public. It then used these funds to develop its blockchain.Ethereum was not the first to do this. In 2013, when Ripple started to develop it\u2019s Ripple payment system, it created around 100 billion XRP token, and sold these tokens to fund the development of the Ripple platform.This concept of fundraising via a token sale is sometimes referred to as an \u201cInitial Coin Offering\u201d, or ICO. But the structure of this token can vary significantly (as we just saw in the previous section), whereas the term \u201cICO\u201d makes it sound a lot more official and like an investment security, so let\u2019s stick to \u201ctoken sale\u201d.A token sale is when some party offers investors some units of a new cryptocurrency (i.e. token) for a certain price, that can then later be exchanged with other cryptocurrencies (i.e. tokens). The idea is that investors buy into these tokens, and the units of the token are fungible and transferable on cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g. Bitfinex, GDAX, Liqui, etc.) if there is demand for them.While most token sales in the past have been restricted to building a new cryptocurrency (e.g. Ethereum, Ripple, etc), the smart contracts of Ethereum are now enabling startups to also to use token sales to fund development of various protocols and applications built on top of existing blockchains.Before moving on, one important distinction to make is the difference between an application and protocol.Application vs. protocolAn application can be built on one or more protocols. One example is Augur, which is a decentralized prediction markets application that is built on top of two protocols:Decentralized oracle protocolExchange protocolThe decentralized oracle protocol is a \u201ccrypto-token-protocol\u201d that has financial incentives to drive the network to form consensus around the outcomes of real-world events using Augur\u2019s reputation tokens (REP). The exchange protocol, on the other hand, is a \u201ccrypto-protocol\u201d and does not have a token associated with it to drive financial incentives, but instead is a set of rules defined between buyers and sellers in order to move tokens between each other.But neither of these protocols need to be tied to a single application. Any application can in theory build on top of these underlying protocols.Token sales for protocols vs. applicationsEarlier, I mentioned how token sales can be used to drive development of a new protocol and/or to drive development of a new application.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So in essence, a team can use an token sale to fund:a blockchain (e.g. Ripple)a cryto-token-protocol built on top of an existing blockchaina crypto-protocol built on top of an existing blockchainan application built on top of a cryto-protocolan application built on top of a crypto-token-protocolan application built on top of crypto-protocol(s) and non-crypto-token-protocol(s)an applicationSo, pretty much anything\u00a0:)The last one is interesting, because to do a token sale, the application doesn\u2019t even need to be built under a protocol. I can build non-profit organization and use tokens as a mechanism to fund the project. In this sense, a token sale simply becomes a new way to fund a traditional centralized application. A plain old crowdsale.Okay, so investors buy these tokens and then what happens?Depends. When a token is tied to a cryto-token-protocol, they look much more like intrinsic tokens like Ether and Bitcoin and are used to drive the development and network of a protocol. But when they are not, tokens simply represent something much more general. In fact, these tokens are flexible enough to represent a lot of different things.For instance, let\u2019s say I want to build a decentralized storage service. I can build a storage protocol using smart contracts which serve as agreements between a storage provider and their client, defining what data will be stored and at what price.I would then build a token for this protocol and do a token sale. If the protocol becomes widely used, then the protocol becomes more valuable, which in turn could increase the value of the token. Moreover, as a developer of this service, I could choose to make the tokens represent purchase rights to the services provided in the application.What\u2019s important to note is that, broadly speaking, the mechanism for creating tokens are so flexible that they can represent lots of different things:Paid credits/membership within the decentralized applicationEntitlement to a share of profits and/or losses, or assets and/or liabilitiesOwnership or equity interest in the protocol (or project)Voting power in the companyNo function other than mere existence\u200a\u2014\u200asimply a digital asset that can be freely traded on cryptocurrency exchangesetc..There\u2019s a handful of projects which have successfully raise funds via a token sale, including as Augur, Antshares, Melonport, Gnosis, Antshare and many more. I\u2019d suggest you read their respective white papers if you want to learn more.Protocols, tokens, token sales, now\u00a0what?We\u2019re at a point where Ethereum has made it easy to not only build protocols that can power decentralized applications, but also to help get a network off the ground. Ethereum does this in two ways:\u00a01. MoneyThis one is obvious. As we already saw, a token sale now enables developers to easily release tradable tokens to raise funds for building a protocol and/or application. Using this money, the team could choose to invest in sales, marketing, etc. to drive the network.2. UsersThis is the more interesting piece of the puzzle. Protocols and decentralized applications can solve the network effects problem by using a token sale as a mechanism to get early contributors and adopters. Early adopters who believe in the protocol or application have an incentive to buy the token because there is potential for that token to be worth more in the future.So in essence, tokens could help bootstrap a network of early adopters because the incentives of the early adopters and the development team line up perfectly.Let\u2019s say you want to build a new file sharing protocol. You can launch a token sale through which you gain some early adopters, investors, and entrepreneurs who become interested in \u201cbuying in.\u201d They might be simply speculating or they might truly believe in the product. At that point, they become stakeholders in the protocol itself and are financially invested in its success. Then some of these early adopters either become users of the products built on top of the protocol or build products and services around the protocol themselves, with the incentive to drive the success of the protocol further in order to increase the value of their tokens. As the protocol gains adoption, it increases the value of the tokens, which further draws more attention from more investors, application builders and users, which leads to more applications, and so on.What Ethereum has done is create an incredibly flexible system to innovate at the protocol level and application level. We\u2019ll likely see a lot of experimental and innovative protocols and applications being built over the coming years. Many of these will fail, just like a lot of startups fail. But over time, it\u2019s likely that some core set of protocols and associated networks will successfully drive mainstream adoption.Finally, once the protocols begin to take shape and standardize, we\u2019ll see a whole host of decentralized applications being built on top.It\u2019s not a happy ending\u00a0yetToken sales are providing the fuel needed to drive development of protocols built on top of the blockchain, and to further drive developer interest in building applications on top of these protocols.Of course, this isn\u2019t the perfect happy ending.For one, getting a bunch of early adopters isn\u2019t enough. You also need to work hard to sustain the growth of the network effects, just like traditional businesses do. That means putting in years of hard work to building a useful application and driving adoption.Secondly, another trend I\u2019ve noticed is that most of the token sales we are seeing today are being used to drive network effects around specific applications rather than open and decentralized protocols. Since tokens are so flexible, dApp developers are creating tokens that are coupled to the dApp, instead of a standardized underlying protocol that can be shared among applications. This could lead to fragmentation in protocols.Third, the initial growth of the token value is mostly driven by speculation (since it takes some time for the platform being built to become valuable). Hence, there will likely have high volatility. It\u2019s unclear if and how we can mitigate this, and if we can even figure out a mechanism to get token prices to stabilize over time. Overall, there\u2019s a lot of open questions around the viability of a token\u2019s value over time. Ideally, we want the token\u2019s value to be tied to the value of the protocol or application, similar to how a public company\u2019s stock is tied to the company that issued it, or to represent some valuable digital right to a service. But as of today, the value of these tokens is still mostly speculation.Fourth, the market for token sales incredibly frothy right now. Because securities regulations makes it difficult to sell tokens (which are unregistered securities) as equity (remember that a token can represent anything, including equity within the protocol or application), developers are not doing it. Instead, they are structuring them as crowdsales. While there are some highly respectable projects raising much needed capital in this manner without the hassle of regulation, there\u2019s a long tail projects that are simply taking advantage of the high demand in the ICO market to raise millions of dollars in capital with very little to show for it\u200a\u2014\u200asome of which have even turned out to be outright scams that absconded with the funds collected during the process. We want these crowdsales to benefit the groups of people gathering together to build a common public good, but not the scammers. How do we achieve that?Besides these issues, there are still lots of unanswered questions that need to be figured out before token sales become a viable form of funding:What is the right design and structure for a token sale?In what cases does it make sense to structure tokens as an investment security? How should such token sales be regulated?What criteria should an individual investor use to evaluate token sales? (team, business model, etc)How is an investor guaranteed that the sale process in being managed in a safe and legal manner?Does there need to be a mechanism for distributing a portion of the liquidation value of the company among the token holders? Dividends?Can the token holders exercise control in the protocol or application via voting rights?How will the money be spent after the funds are raised?What metrics can an investor use to gauge trust that the team building the protocol or application will execute on the long-term plan and vision?Could it be more efficient to port the smart contracts of a token to use Ether directly, instead of creating a new token per protocol?What are the tax implications for the investor\u2019s gains or losses?If selling tokens become a new way to raise capital for startups, what happens to traditional Venture Capitalists?\u2026 and SO MUCH MOREIf these questions interest you, you\u2019re in luck\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ll write about some of them in upcoming posts!ConclusionI\u2019ve tried my best in this article to articulate my views on token sales and clear up some of the confusion around blockchain development in general.Talking about cryptocurrency and blockchain development is like trying to take a picture of a running cheetah.

What do I need to know? How not to lose money? How should I choose the right cryptocurrency for my portfolio, which will skyrocket in the future?In this guide you will find an exhaustive list of answers to many of these questions. But first, before giving you an explanation on how to invest, let me address the question: why should you even need to invest your hard-earned money? I\u2019ll try to explain this as simply as possible.Invest because it is\u00a0growing.Over the last 20 years with the invasion of the Internet, many people have earned amazing amounts of money on one simple thing - the Network Effect. What the hell is that? In the 70-s there was an engineer Robert Metcalfe. He invented what we now call the Ethernet. In order to make a profit on this invention, he began selling network cards. At that time people didn\u2019t understand why computers needed connect to the network. Robert realized that it was necessary to find a reassuring argument to prove that his network card was just the right panacea for all their illnesses. Robert said:The network\u2019s value is proportional to the square of the number of users in this network.Well, you buy 10 computers without a network card, their conditional costs are equal to 10. However,with network cards the conditional costs of 10 computers will increase to 45! This is 4.5 times more profitable! \u201cWow\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200acorporate workers said and then they began buying Robert\u2019s network cards.It turned out that Robert\u2019s idea is quite reasonable! You can use it to assess Telecom companies which have rolled out across the globe with redoubled force. The capitalisation of Telecom companies depends on the number of its users. The dependence is not a straight line but a quadratic. At the dawn of the social networks, venture capitalists quickly remembered the cherished formula and applied it to such things as Facebook, Twitter, Skype, etc. So the Metcalfe\u2019s law was proven correct and gave us millions of Ethernet grids which evolved into what we now call the Internet.Simple truth\u200a\u2014\u200aif the number of network users is steadily growing, the exponential growth of your investments is expected to grow with it. Thus, Facebook was worth more than $ 300 billion. The formula is simple. Looking for a network which is growing steadily at the very beginning => put money => wait => profit! The question is\u200a\u2014\u200awhy Bitcoin? Because it\u2019s the same network and it\u2019s growing. Is growing quickly. Check for yourself:2010\u201310 thousand users2012\u2013100 thousand users2014\u20131 million users2016\u201310 million usersOf course, these figures are very approximates, because there is no way to determine the exact number of users. The numbers listed above are my own assessment. To make it look more convincing here is a graph of Blockchain.info walletsQuestion: How long it will grow and when the growth will slow down?Answer: Blockchain technology refers to a class of technologies \u201cNo Way Back\u201d. This is when Homo sapiens starts to use something and could not imagine how they lived without it. Here\u2019s a graph in the case of TV, electricity and other technologies:Growth will be carried out at the S curve until saturation occurs.There are about 3.5 billion people who use the Internet, and about 20 billion connected devices or just bots. Considering that the Bitcoin network has properties that are not offered to us by any Government or Corporation, we can assume that there is a high probability that the majority of connected people and machines will use this network. What are these properties?No taxesFree opening of accounts. They are simply calculated from your private key\u00a0:-)Low transaction feesPredictable and transparent clearing. You always know what is the status of any transactionThe transaction cannot be rolled backNobody asks the personal identification informationNobody can write off your moneyNobody can block the accountNo stupid limitsSuitable for all forms of property, not just currency.A complete history of all transactionsPossibility of privacy and anonymityThe list of benefits can go on and on, but you get the idea. This is a kind of manna from heaven, which is better money in comparison with paper dollars. But most importantly:It\u2019s just the economic miracle of mathematics, cryptography and computer science.Investment in the blockchain as the best investment opportunity since the start of the InternetInvest to not be\u00a0cheated.In the current economic circumstances the deception is carried out in 3 ways:Disguised theft.The part of inflation caused by the \u201cprinting press\u201d. Watch movie \u201cThe Big Short\u201dTrivial racket.\u00a0It is not enough for Government to steal you money secretly. They openly steals from people by adding value to taxes. According to my estimates, at least half!\u00a0HALFNo warranties.\u00a0Banks may go bankrupt. They simply tell you \u201csorry, there is no your money\u201d. The point is that any of your assets at any time may not be yours. The state does not guarantee the safety of your money. The Government requires you to keep your money in the banks, and your right of property in the public registers. People naively believing that there is no any alternative.I believe, in the future, blockchain technology will become an immutable mathematical guarantor of the preservation of property and economic freedoms.Foreseeing the collapse.There are so many predictions of the collapse of the American financial system. Even billionaires already say this openly. Let\u2019s say that it will not happen. But if it happens, we will not go back to the existing world order. Such events in retrospect are called Black Swans. Nobody thought that the Second World War will happen, that the Internet will appear, that Trump will become a President. But in retrospect, all these events are obvious, and have a rational explanation. The collapse of the Fiat system would be the same. If the American economy collapses, the world will literally be in chaos. Our history in this regard is even more interesting because if the US economy collapses, other economies collapse even more. The mortgage crisis of 2008 proved this clearly. But it didn\u2019t teach anything.What\u2019s surprising here? How this bubble can burst if there is no alternative? For some reasons no one admits the idea that an alternative to the \u0441urrent outdated system is already there. Which is great! That suggests that a Black Swan is not such an unlikely event. In the case that a negative event has at least some probability, smart financiers are recommended to hedge risks. Let\u2019s guess\u00a0, what\u2019s the alternative?Right\u200a\u2014\u200ais Bitcoin.Investments in the blockchain as the protection from fraud of Governments and Central banks.Look in The\u00a0FutureThere is another argument in favor of the Blockchain: robots and artificial intelligence. The reality is that we don\u2019t know exactly when computer algorithms will be able to solve all the problems that we can, including creativity.Today is 2017. The computing power of the device which cost $1000 approximately equal the computational abilities of the mouse. In accordance with Moore\u2019s law in 2025 (and perhaps earlier, e.g., in 2022) the cost of computing by humans biological brain will be compared with the cost of computing by computers.Let me give you some real live examples from different areas:The Future of gaming is in DubaiComputers for Autonomous robotics made by 21.coAlphaGo victory over Lee SedolThe algorithm that broke one of the strongest players of Go is available on Github and it is called \u201cTensor Flow\u201d. Any school student can click on the \u201cFork\u201d button and make everything that comes into his mind. This accessibility of really smart technologies will inevitably lead to the emergence of a new generation of smart devices. Autonomous robots will be able to earn money and consequently make economic decisions. And as soon as the first striking example occurs\u200a\u2014\u200athe Homo sapiens may get nervous. His job may be under threat.There are more Bots than humans. This amount will increase and Bots will become smarter. Thus, the risk of devaluation of your (and my) intelligence is real. And the longer you deny it, the faster your brain will depreciate in value. The point is that the blockchain is convenient for a robot economy\u00a0. It is understandable, it is reliable, and it is easy to integrate. The Blockchain for the Internet of Things is a new megatrend. It is obvious that without the blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200arobot\u2019s economy simply impossible. The solution is right here:Investments in the blockchain as a hedge against the depreciation of your own intellect.In addition to the von Neumann architecture, there will be quantum computers in the future. The Moores law for quantum computers will work in the square.So, you have some incentive ideas in your head and you already want to buy Bitcoins. Your blood starts to boil. The brain anticipates an incredible profit. All the free energy is concentrated on the sources of investment.Calm down! Turn ON your BrainThe blockchain is a really cool technology and it is growing rapidly. But there is no guarantee that you will be able to make profit. I will list some necessary conditions that must be followed to increase the probability of a profitable outcome.Before invest-improve your technical competence.A mandatory condition for safe investments in the crypto-economy is a basic computer literacy. If you don\u2019t know how computers works, then think twice before putting your wealth. Then the question arises: How do you I know if I have this basic computer literacy? These bullet points will help you understand a little bit more about it:You have the same password for almost all services.Length of your passwords is less than 20 characters or it is copied phrase from the book.Do you use anti-virus software and believe that it will protect you.You don\u2019t backup your data.You have no idea about what is data synchronization and why it is needed.You don\u2019t know what is \u201ctrust a website\u201d, what is \u201coperating system and hardware security\u201d.You can\u2019t generate a mini-lecture for at least 10 minutes when you ask the question: what actually happens when a browser is driven google.com and then pressed Enter?If you answered \u201cYes\u201d to even one question\u200a\u2014\u200ayour computer literacy want to be better, and you need to take this into account when investing in the crypt-economy. Otherwise, you have a high probability that something will go wrong.Check my tutorial to know how to store Bitcoins and altcoins in a secured way.Define strategyYou have already realized that there is no freebies, and risks, in fact, are more than you thought! You need some time to determine how much to put down for investment. General recommendation: from 1% to 10% of an available financial assets you currently have. If you have confidence in your own computer literacy, then the percentage can be increased up to 30% and even 50%.It is very important to start from amount of your financial assets. An appropriate financial assets are currency, stocks, bonds, shares. Property, cars and other things that can be touched, are not included here. Although, I\u2019ve heard a story about one guy who sold his apartment and bought Ether on all the money. Heroes must be known in person, so let me know if you read this!So, if financial assets are greater than $100k\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re lucky:). Buy cryptocurrency in the amount of from 1% to 10%, depending of your risk appetite.If your financial assets are in a range of $10k-$100k\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have something to lose. You are neat, consistent and purposeful. Allow yourself a little risk and roll up to 3%-20%. Your well-being is not significantly affected in a case of losses, but it can teleport you into the category above sooner than you would want to leave your current work.If financial assets you have are up to $10K\u200a\u2014\u200ayou are still ahead. The amount is already nice, but it is not enough to feed itself. When there is a stable source of income, start from 5%, and when you will be confident\u200a\u2014\u200araise the rate up to 40%. Think about your strategy: 5% for retirement. When you got paid\u200a\u2014\u200aput 5% on the blockchain. If you maintain schedule within 1\u20132 years you will be pleased with your investments.If you do not have anything, then best suited strategy is \u201call-in\u201d, because you have nothing to lose. With such financial discipline\u200a\u2014\u200ahardly something will help you! So is there any chance that something will changes in your life\u00a0.But I\u2019m still a kid!Great! Bitcoins are for you! Governments, banks and even your parents think that you can\u2019t have something for possessions, without their permission. Prove to them that this is not true. If you are reading this article, probably your computer literacy is much better than most of the people around you. So don\u2019t believe them. They are stupid. By the time you finish school, banks may disappear altogether, Governments may become autonomous code, your parents may lose their job in connection with the invasion of artificial intelligence, and your kettle might be richer off than your entire family. But if you\u2019ll have a few bitcoins and tens of Ether, your coevals will look at you differently. Girls will love and parents will be proud. Look at Vitalik Buterin. His first bitcoins appeared when he was 16 years old. It was interesting. He began to write and study. Then he didn\u2019t go to University, but created Ethereum. Now, professors of the world call him Mr. Vitalik Buterin. If you will start to accumulate anything from 6, 8, 10, 12 years you will have a good future.Prepare to wait a long time.If you\u2019re not ready to freeze your money less than for 3 years\u200a\u2014\u200aclose the tab and move on. There is nothing for you. Blockchain market is in the embryonic stage. It may be rocking back and forth. The clear strategy is Buy & Hold. Bought and keep. I recommend to plan it as a long-term investment with some simple strategy of fixing. For example, detecting 10% each time when the net asset valuation increased 5 times from the previous commit. Well, it\u2019s simple! But this strategy will only work if you define the investment horizon in a radius of 3\u201310 years.Find entry\u00a0pointHere\u2019s what is thing about. There are all sorts of technology is growing unevenly. The guys from Gartner explained it very simply:New technology occurs and all at once are amazed from the new technology. This is called the peak of inflated expectations. But the technology is still not working as it should work. Therefore, the technology comes at some point of disillusionment. And then it either disappear or becomes productive.This principle works for all technologies.So. In our history, all looks the same.Any blockchain system grows very similar. I am telling this in order to give you one simple idea:Do not buy when everyone amazed.If you see that in the last month something has increased several times, this is a great reason to look at buying, study, and find a more optimal time to enter when the market goes down.Strategy \u201cBuy & Hold\u201d also means that if you find an interesting asset, it is the time to start buying when it falls, and purchasing until it starts to grow.What is crowdsales or\u00a0ICO?Previously, I have discussed about assets that already existed and were traded on the markets. But where did they all appear? After all, it\u2019s better to be at the forefront of \u201csomething great\u201d. Essentially there are two options:Some Satoshi Nakamoto or John Connor appears on some forum and says:\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cHere is the soft, let\u2019s do mining.\u201dSome Vitalik Buterin or Den Larimer appears on some forum and says: \u201cHere is the code. Let\u2019s chip in together.\u201dBoth approaches in different cases makes sense. Sometimes, these two approaches should be combined. But in the second case, we have the opportunity to participate in the creation of something which is risky. Thus was created Ethereum, and many more.Question: how to determine that this is something where I put the money is great, but not some sort of regular wiring?\u00a0Answer: Behold the root. We look at three things:A Coherent Whitepaper.\u00a0Real science should stand up for such projects. The people who create such things should be able to clearly express their thoughts on paper. Otherwise, the probability that the project is successful goes to zero. Here are two whitepapers: Concept and Protocol that were at my disposal (when I took the decision to invest in Ethereum). I saw these guys with a head on his shoulders. Here are a few papers (Steem.it, Augur, Digix) where I have issued a positive decision. Here\u2019s, an example of a paper of the project which took off. Do you ask why? Because it is natural for the question arise in your head regarding the competence of the creators. In General, there is a need of serious thoughtful approach and the ability to analyze all kinds of stuff.Source code.\u00a0It has to be open source. No code, no proof that you are generally able something to develop. In the case of Ethereum PoC v0.5 it was on C and v0.6 on Go. Theorists have no place here. You also must understand that in the end you need to trust the code that will work, but not the people. A story with TheDAO confirms this.Strong team.\u00a0It\u2019s not important whether you have anonymous team or not. People should make a good things. Everyone makes their own research here.If at least one item has not converged, then don\u2019t risk. Of course, there are a lot of additional factors:The Consensus Algorithm.\u00a0Let me just say that this is a complex topic which makes me passionate about this story. It is hard to explain in one line. But you should pay attention to it, yeah.Economic model.\u00a0This is an interesting area, due to which this industry will grow very quickly. Also it is the subject for a whole separate book. In General, the economic model needs to be effective, the system must have all necessary economic incentives to achieve the desired goals!The structure of the distribution.\u00a0If founders want to own 90%, that is a centralized thing, and the risks increase. The norm in ICO is the reward of the team in the amount of 10% -20%.A technological approach.\u00a0Some comrades are trying to create their own independent network of one feature. Or on the contrary try to implement over an existing network, which requires an independent network. Here it is necessary to pay attention, since architectural mistakes in the design of the blockchain system very quickly kill a potentially interesting project.Generally, all these criterias are not exhaustive. However it is enough to understand that making such decisions requires analysis and understanding of whole picture.Guys from cyber.fund collect significant ICO in their radarAbout \u201cpseudo Blockchain investments\u201dYes, there is such a thing. Recently a lot of my friends sent me a project in the field of bitcoins and blockchain with a question: Look? What do you think?99% of them are not the Blockchain investments at all. Basically, there are different companies registered in different jurisdictions and they provide variety of services. Here an example of such company. If the property is not registered on the blockchain and has its ends on paper in some jurisdictions, it is not a blockchain investment at all. Such an organization will never be more marginal than organization consisting of a code and not paying a bribe to all sorts of crooks. Of course, there are many situations where this approach is needed. Especially in the services at the junction with the Fiat economy, because the Government learned very well how to keep the ball of money holders.This article is NOT about investing in such kind of companies. It is highly recommended NOT to invest your hard-earned bitcoins in such enterprises because risks are much higher.It is a time to buy your first\u00a0BitcoinsAnyway, a journey to the blockchain investments begins from buying Bitcoins, as all existing cryptocurrencies and assets are traded primarily to Bitcoin. Of course, you can start from mining. But this article is not for those guys who are willing to wrestle over how to buy hardware to solve problems with electricity, cooling, to suffer with the software, and then monitor it around the clock. Such guys are not needed in this article. They\u2019ll figure it out. This article is for the lazy you. You want to make a decision, press the button (alone and green), and immediately get incredible profit.If you are lucky and your country do not prohibit the purchase of bitcoins (e.g like in Russia) you can buy Bitcoins by credit card or Paypal.But at first\u200a\u2014\u200aknow how to store your money! Start from this article.So, go to Localbitcoins. This is such a great global Bazaar where everyone can handle Bitcoins for the national currency. Vendors have build great reputation. So of course you can be cheated, but traders do value their reputation and the whole thing works quite well.Sign up. Go to the Security tab and go through the quest to get the \u201cStrong\u201d title.You can skip this step, of course, but I have warned you. Yeah. By the way, remember that the password must be unique and long. Next, select the seller. Not all sellers are good for you\u00a0. The amount may be not suitable for you or a transaction method. Sometimes seller can be muddy. Your task is to find a guy who has a large number of transactions, faster transaction processing, good rating, etc. Have a good time.Once the ad has attracted, go into it and look for seller\u2019s terms which are written on the right. Read them carefully! If you agree, enter the quantity you wish to purchase and write a short message. For example\u00a0:I\u2019m here for the first time. I can be blunt. But I\u2019ll try not to be blunt. And Yes! I will use bank transfer from \u201cname of the bank\u201d.And here the solemn moment! Big green button! Press. After a while you will get the answer. Send money according to specified details.After payment go to the ad and click on the \u201cI paid\u201d button. The seller may wait for while, and after some time, from 1 minute to hours, you will see updated balance in your account, and the transaction is deemed closed. If you like it, feel free to give good feedback to the seller. They love it and you can get feedback in return. You will be back, right?Congratulations! But it is early to rejoice. While bitcoins are stored in Localbitcoins it\u2019s not your bitcoins, but their. So we go to the next step.Thus, we assume that you successfully create secured wallet and your private key is only you and no one else.Well, you copied the address from your local wallet and now we return to the section Wallet on Localbitcoins. Paste the address from clipboard in the address box, then enter the amount of bitcoins\u200a\u2014\u200aevery last Satoshi. And click \u201cSend from wallet\u201d.You can see the address where money were sent, and the most valuable information is txid or transaction id. By this ID you can very easily check Localbitcoins, if he is lying to you or not. Copypaste this ID. Next, go to the website of any block explorer and enter this ID in the search. For example, here or here. By the way, it is the first historic transaction that Satoshi started.I should mention a little about block explorer. One of the sweetest pieces of blockchain technology is the ability to overlook this database (it\u2019s called the blockchain or chain of blocks) in real time to any person and robot on the Earth! It has nothing to do with auditor. Every last bit can be seen and proven. The government and banks do not want to give you such openness, because all the crooks will immediately light up.What next?So, you look in your wallet and get proud of your bitcoins. But, intuition tells you that it can\u2019t be actually so great. There is must be a catch. The source code of the bitcoin nodes (they confirm a transaction) is open-source, the entire historical database is available and verifiable, the source code for the wallet is opened. There must be a catch. The catch is that your bitcoins exist only as digital recording and this fact is accepted by all other users of Bitcoin network. For proving the right of ownership you can only provide a digital signature calculated using your unique private key. It turns out that this is the nature of digital ownership of new generation. We have to live in this digital illusion, in which the key religion and science is math, not even physics. That\u2019s the trick.Enough sentimentality. Now you have your bitcoins, but the path only begins, because the blockchain technology, which made the Bitcoin has spawned with a lot of interesting things.Where to invest bitcoins?This section generally worthy to write a separate book\u00a0. I will not stoop to the recommendations exactly where to invest, but just go through some areas to plant ideas.Decentralized infrastructureAny computer in any network does three things: (1a) receives some data, then (2) makes some transformation, i.e. calculates, then decides that (3) save for longer, and that (1b) forwards in response to the request. Our brain works identical. From this you can make the assumption that all decentralized infrastucture will move in three directions:Decentralized computing. Ethereum is the leader here. This is the most potentially powerful segment.Decentralized storage. In this segment there are 5 teams. Ethereum Foundation, Storj Inc, MaidSafe, Neboulos Labs and Protocol Labs.Decentralized transport. Motivated mesh networks are inherently complex, so in this segment there is no working solutions. We are waiting for it. I am really looking forward to. While the Internet traffic is so easily controlled by all sorts of crooks, the story is not so beautiful.Blockchain apps.And here the fun begins:Organizations. There are about 1 billion legal entities.\u00a0The capitalization of the public organizations\u200a\u2014\u200aabout $100 trillion. Evaluation of private is a mystery, but probably no less than 3\u20135 times more than the public. All of them can be transferred from paper to the blockchain. My bet is 10 years. All organizational artifacts, such as stocks, debts, rights, votes, etc are there.Robots. The blockchain allows (1) people to reliably control different robots using cryptographic keys, (2) organizations to coordinate the robots owned by organizations or leasehold, (3) robots to possess themselves, i.e. to be Autonomous, Independent, Free. When I say \u201crobots\u201d, I mean not only humanoid robots with AI, which we used to see in movies. I mean, all the electronic objects to which we have become accustomed to: phones, computers, cars, drones, machines, locks, sockets, and even light bulbs. Absolutely anything which will be powered by electricity.Currencies. Capitalization of M0 now is around $70 trillion.Bets. The capitalization of the derivatives is not less than 20 times bigger than M0 and is equal to more than $1 quadrillion. Just a crazy amount of money.Real estate.\u00a0I could not estimate. I think that a lot. All rights\u200a\u2014\u200ain the archaic registries. Draw your own conclusions.Products. In the future, the manufacturer will create digital token on every produced item that will reflect the property to him. This token will move from one organisation to another during their entire life path.Temporary law. Tickets to cinema, planes, trains, parties, events. It is also a large market that I don\u2019t know how to evaluate.Passports.\u00a0There about 50 billion passports in the world. I\u2019m not talking just about humans. Every technical object has its own passport. It is pointless to evaluate this market, because it\u2019s priceless.Titles.\u00a0Here goes a variety of academic diplomas, certificates, badges, reputation points, awards, and other bullshit that is attached forever to a digital ID and cannot be zeroed by the holder.Digital content.\u00a0Books, images, VIDEO. A very large market of copyrights for digital content.Governments.\u00a0Guess on your own. About 50% of the economy is controlled by these entities. Do not be surprised if they will be dematerialised in a computer code, and they will lose a substantial part of this share.Virtual worlds.\u00a0There are about 2 billion gamers. Every game has its own economy.It\u2019s time to make a\u00a0decisionAfter reading this point, dear reader, you hopefully realised that investing in cryptocurrencies is interesting, cool and really promising, but it seems difficult. So you need to decide (1) to invest your bitcoins independently or (2) to entrust this task to someone. Each approach has its pros and cons. Let\u2019s see them in order.Pros:Full control over the process. No need to trust someone your money.A lot of stuff to learn. Really interesting process.Cons:Labor-intensive. Will take a lot of time and effort for training.Difficult. You need to understand the economy, business, engineering, code, and whatnot.Responsability. You can lose everything because of the lack of computer literacy.Where to invest?So, you weighed all the \u201cpros\u201d and \u201ccons\u201d and decided to do it yourself. This is commendable decision. My initial idea was that all people can and want do it themselves. Today, unfortunately, this is not quite true. At this stage, such projects like cyber\u2022Fund may help you.Roughly speaking, it is possible examine the state of the economy in one place. Cyber.fund adjust the price and number of tokens in all significant blockchain systems. But the most important is cyber\u2022Rating. The complete methodology is disclosed in this paper.Transfer money to the\u00a0exchangeOnce you realised where to invest, you need to send bitcoins to the exchange, where the target asset is being traded\u00a0. In our case it will be Poloniex. The truth is that Poloniex may disappear tomorrow and we will got a new meme in the Internet.Therefore, you make these operations at your own risk. I estimate the probability of closing for each particular exchange during the year is 10%. In this series, and Coinbase and Poloniex and all sorts of banks like Xapo.But now we use Poloniex because there are a lot of currencies and good liquidity. Decentralized trade is one of the most promising areas, but it is still at the very beginning. I think with the development of projects such as BitShares and BitSquare for one year or two years it will be a worthy alternative to Localbitcoins and Poloniex with good liquidity.If Poloniex for some reason do not satisfy you, there are still a lot of other exchanges. Have fun choosing them. The process is the same everywhere:Go to the siteRegister. If you have a lot of money, verify the passports and photosTransfer bitcoins from wallet to the exchangeChoose the traded pairBuy at the current price or place orderWithdraw what your bought to your walletsKeep in mind that all serious. Exchanges are real.Install wallets and\u00a0clients.Here comes the fun part. This step depends entirely on what you decided invest. Without this step, you will not be able to guarantee the long-term safety of your investments. I can say that on every official website of every blockchain system there are links to different wallets. Which trust or not to trust\u200a\u2014\u200ait is your decision. I will list the tools that I use myself:Mist. Official Ethereum client. For many things.OpenLedger. Official client for BitShares network. For many things.CounterWallet. The official web client of the Counterparty Protocol. For Storj tokens and others.OmniWallet. Official web Protocol Omni. For SafeNetwork, Synereo and others tokens.This is not an exhaustive list, but may cover 80% of the needs for a beginner. Each of these software requires that you saved the private key. Do it.I have described in details the best way for storing Bitcoins and Ether in this articleAfter all of these procedures, you need to withdraw assets from Poloniex to your wallets. Save the private key as closely and carefully as you can. After these steps, the property becomes yours. Next you are faced with the task of monitoring the value of your portfolio.You can use such Google Spreadsheets with API integration or use such systems like cyber.fundThat\u2019s all. Still have questions? I will answer them with pleasure!Please, write your comments and questions below. And one more thing: let\u2019s spread the knowledge. Recommend and Share this article.

Are they letters or not? They read like letters, except they\u2019re digital. You can print it, yes, but does this make it any more \u201creal\u201d than when it was in digital form? Stripped down to its essence, it\u2019s just a bunch of ones and zeroes. Does this make it any less real than an actual letter?Do you know how Email\u00a0works?You might answer \u201cYes. You write a letter, you send it, and you are done!\u201dNo, that\u2019s not how it works. That\u2019s how you send an email. This is how it works.That looks damn complicated! Why would anyone want to use this? You mean I need an expensive computer?! (Image from Visiondesign.com)Seems complicated, right? Imagine trying to teach that to someone who has never touched a computer before. Here, let\u2019s jump back to 1984 and see how they explained Email back then.Until the 1990s, when the web browser made it easy for anyone to have an Email account and address, all of that stuff was as alien to people as Bitcoin and Blockchain tech is to mainstream users today.I still remember when Emails suddenly became accessible to everyone. It wasn\u2019t just because of the web browser. It was the humble Internet Cafe that allowed mainstream users to use Email cheaply and easily. We paid as much $2 per hour for this here in the Philippines, and they used dial-up 56K modems. It was unusable by today\u2019s standards, but I still remember sitting there in awe when the person I randomly chatted with on mIRC told me she was from the United States. We started exchanging emails after that. It was mind blowing.Computers were so expensive that only the rich had their own, and home internet connections were slow and clunky. You had to make sure no one called your home phone or else you would get disconnected. So the web cafes became the gateway to \u201ccyberspace\u201d, where people chat with other people and of course, send Emails. There was an internet cafe in every corner, and it was a huge business.It became so easy to create an email account, but you were advised to never use your real name. This was a just a fancy toy for geeks, and the internet, or \u201cCyberspace\u201d in general was considered dangerous. Emails were not even considered an official way to communicate. Everyone used some kind of fake name, and you were limited to a certain number of messages in your inbox or else risk emails being bounced back to the sender.People used weird Email addresses like HotLips69xoxo@hotmail.com. Business dealings still had to be faxed or done with printed paper or phone calls. It was a whole different world.Today, we send an Email with a swipe of a finger from a tiny supercomputer containing about $32 MILLION worth of separate 1984 devices in the palm of our hands, with unlimited storage in the cloud and machine learning helping us with automatic responses.We use Email without thinking about how it works because it has become a basic utility. It just works.It\u2019s 1984 For\u00a0BitcoinBitcoin is a protocol (Bitcoin), yet we send bitcoins as if it was money. Is it money or not? It transacts like money, except it is digital. You can print it, yes, but does this make it any more \u201creal\u201d than when it was in digital form? Stripped down to its essence, it is just a bunch of ones and zeroes. Does this make it any less real than actual physical money?Do you know how Bitcoin\u00a0works?You might answer \u201cYes.\u00a0Use\u00a0a\u00a0Bitcoin\u00a0wallet, you send it, and you are done!\u201dNo, that\u2019s not how it works. That\u2019s how you send\u00a0bitcoins. This is how it works.Feels familiar, right?The S-Curve of Technology AdoptionIf we add Bitcoin in this image, it would be at way below\u00a01%Explaining Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology today feels the same because it is the same.With Bitcoin and Blockchain tech, we are no different from the Email video from 1984\u200a\u2014\u200awe still need five-minute videos explaining how it works. People are still afraid of Bitcoin, thinking it is dangerous and only used by criminals in the dark web. The apps themselves are still clunky and too complicated for your average internet user. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges get hacked often, and scams abound the industry. The adoption of the technology on a global scale is not even at 1%, so we have a long way to go before we see this shift.It will happen slowly, then suddenly.Our Bitcoin startup in the Philippines provides services much like an internet cafe did in the 90s. We provide our users an easy way to access the Bitcoin network and use it for transferring and storing funds, paying bills, using it as a store of value, and pretty much any kind of financial service you can do with a bank. Just like going to an internet cafe where you still need some basic knowledge on how to use a computer, using our platform will need a basic understanding of how websites, payment apps, and smartphones work. It allows users to experience the technology in a user-friendly environment and safe. We also have regular education campaigns that educates those who want to learn about how it works and how it can benefit them.There are hundreds of services and apps today that are doing the same thing, with the goal being to make people comfortable with using the technology.In the near future, we will be sending money to each other using the Bitcoin protocol, with a swipe of a finger, without needing to understand how it works. Explaining Bitcoin and Blockchain technology then will be as unnecessary as explaining Email today. It just works.Bitcoin is a protocol. It\u2019s just software, running on a set of rules that needs to be followed in order to participate in the network. Trying to explain the nuts and bolts of it to everyone will be frustrating because not everyone can or wants to understand all the technical stuff, yet we do it anyway because even if only one out of a hundred people will get curious and want to learn more, it makes all that effort worth it.Bitcoin is money because that\u2019s what the software makes it seem to be, but the truth of the matter is, it is just pure information. The software you use makes it function like money the same way SMTP makes Emails function like letters, as a correspondence between people, with somewhat reliable certainty that the messages are transmitted securely and are valid.The only difference is that the certainty of the validity of a Bitcoin \u201cmessage\u201d i.e. transaction, is undeniable, censorship-resistant, and immutable.Not Just\u00a0MoneyImage from https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-2018-beyond-growing-list-use-cases-filipowski-1/?trackingId=R6J17arzemU1VIY2vtVhIQ%3D%3DOther Blockchain applications will also become basic utilities for a myriad of uses ranging from smart contracts, marketplaces, governance, provenance, and any service that requires agreement in a trustless environment.Before we know it, the world will be using the Bitcoin protocol like we use Email today\u200a\u2014\u200aas a basic utility for transferring information, but in this case, the information will have value.", "responses": "63"}, {"title": "Press release on Bitcoin.com", "author_name": "Truegame.io", "link": "https://medium.com/@truegame/press-release-on-bitcoin-com-53b84f53de14?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 17, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "791", "content": "Press release on Bitcoin.comTruegame.ioBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 17, 2018Mate Tokay: \u201cI am really excited about Truegame because their main goal is to improve transparency in the gambling industry.

That\u2019s over 8 million lightning bolts every day.Each lightning flash is about 3 miles long but only about a centimeter wide.A lightning strike discharges about 1\u201310 billion joules of energy and produces a current of 30,000\u201350,000 amps.A single lightning bolt unleashes as much energy as blowing up 1,000 Kilos of TNT.This is lightning at 7000 frames per second. Only the bright flash in the end is visible to the naked eye. Do you see how it looks like a\u00a0network?Oh wait, I\u2019m supposed to be talking about a different kind of Lightning\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Bitcoin kind.The Lightning NetworkWhat is the Lightning Network anyway? Simply put, the Lightning Network is a proposed solution to the problem of making the Bitcoin network scale to global capacity while still maintaining decentralization and keeping it trust-free. It\u2019s a second-layer solution on top of the Bitcoin network, secured by the Bitcoin Blockchain. It is open-source software, just like Bitcoin, and anyone can scrutinize, criticize, improve, and contribute to the code.There is simply no reason for anyone serious in the Bitcoin industry to still be ignorant about the network\u2019s capability to scale on-chain. To want your micro \u201ccoffee\u201d transaction to be recorded on the world\u2019s most secure global public ledger on tens of thousands of computers for all eternity seems a bit absurd\u200a\u2014\u200ait is practically impossible. Let\u2019s face it, Bitcoin transactions were never instant and free, and the problems we faced recently have long been predicted to happen. The network is voluntary, so anyone is free to come up with a solution for this problem. Some of the best software engineers in the world have done just that, and have been testing it extensively and are ready to take the technology to the next level. That\u2019s the Lightning Network.For the more technically inclined, Melik Manukyan elegantly used TCP/IP as an analogy in his excellent medium piece:\u201cLightning enables unicast transactions in a system [Bitcoin] that previously only supported broadcast transactions. To me, Lightning nodes in Bitcoin are the equivalent of IP hosts\u200a\u2014\u200awhere we can finally conduct or route one-to-one or point-to-point transactions to their appropriate recipients.In traditional IP, we send and receive data packets; in Lightning, we send and receive Bitcoin. IP is what allowed us to scale our small and largely primitive networks of the past into the global giant that it is today, the Internet. In a similar manner, Lightning is what will allow us to scale our global Bitcoin network.Where Lightning Nodes can be seen as IP hosts, I view Lightning Channels as established TCP connections. In Lightning, we establish channels with our respective parties and are able to directly [point-to-point] send and receive data (transactions) similarly to TCP. Where Blockchain is similar to Ethernet, Lightning Nodes are our IPs and Lightning Channels our TCP connections.\u201dLightning facts:Lightning is capable of millions of transactions per second and will blow away any legacy payment rail or existing blockchain implementation out there, while still enjoying the benefits of the Bitcoin Blockchain\u2019s security.A single lightning transaction will cost fractions of a penny. This will enable payments per click/ like/ interaction online, without an intermediary.There is no better implementation out there that can scale Bitcoin to 1000-times its current capacity and still maintain decentralization, with instant transactions at near zero cost, without needing trusted-third parties, and in such a short span of time. There are others that make this claim, but none of them will stand up to the most rigorous testing and peer-review in the world that Lightning has gone through so far.Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a on-blockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in milliseconds to seconds.Lightning is centralized\u2026 and by centralized I mean centralized on one planet, Earth. Kidding aside, the Lightning network itself is totally decentralized. If anyone tells you otherwise, show them this image of the different types of networks:And then this image of the now 100+ and growing mainnet lightning nodes:and this image of the Testnet version with 1500 nodes and 2900 channels.Does that look centralized to\u00a0you?On the Lightning Testnet, a user was connected to 1 node and can see 1016 out of 1071 nodes in the network. He had access to 3577 out of 3584 channels. So with just one active channel, he could pay almost anyone on the network!Lighting payments are much more private than payments on the main Bitcoin blockchain because network participants will not know the sender and recipient.Lighting network will be able to accommodate \u201cdust\u201d transactions (amounts too small to transact on the main chain) and possibly, sub-satoshi transactions in the future.The number of payments per second that can be routed over the lightning network has no practical upper boundaries. Global commerce transaction capacity is truly possible. We are talking in the billions of transactions on a daily basis.Lightning Network enables Unicast Transactions in Bitcoin. Lightning is Bitcoin\u2019s TCP/IP stack.Transact with other blockchains! Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly. So long as the chains can support the same cryptographic hash function, it is possible to make transactions across different blockchains with no intermediary.\u201cBut it\u2019s off-chain!\u201d says some critics. Well, according to Forbes, on-chain global Bitcoin transactions are around $2 Billion a day. A big number, yes, but off-chain transaction (exchanges, wallets, others) are roughly estimated at around $30 Billion a day, but the real number is probably much higher. This can all be done on the Lightning Network, eliminating exchange counter-party risk and even allowing near-instant and cheap inter-exchange deposit and withdrawal transactions. All the current off-chain transactions can be moved to Lightning, and it will be safer, faster, and cheaper, and in the end, it will all be recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain anyway, anytime the user wants.Testing, Development, ImplementationThere are three implementations of Lightning, eclair, c-lightning, and lnd, all open-source, and all interoperable.In January 21st, 2018, the first physical item was purchased on the Lightning network. It was a VPN router, how appropriate!As of this writing, there was about $9,500 in value that was live on the Lightning network Mainnet, and one day we\u2019ll look back and say \u201cRemember when the Lightning network had less than $10,000 on it?\u201d It\u2019s a bit reckless given that the software is still in testing stage and the people who volunteered to test it can potentially lose money, but these volunteer testers don\u2019t seem to care. It\u2019s for science!So when will the Lightning Network be rolled out, you ask? To quote Jameson Lopp, Bitgo Engineer and Cypherpunk extraordinaire,\u201cThe rollout has already begun. This is an iterative distributed learning process; it\u2019s unlikely there will be a single point in time at which we say LN is \u201cdeployed\u201d because it will grow organically. Software is never finished.\u201dEveryone today is focused on Blockchain technology, ICOs, Tokens, and all things crypto, but it\u2019s the Lightning Network that is a true game-changer. It\u2019s the layer on which new protocols and mainstream applications will be built, on which everyone will transact, where the killer app for Bitcoin will finally emerge. The Bitcoin blockchain will scale alongside Lightning, providing the immutable, trustless, secure, and censorship-resistant foundation that will have the final say on the legitimacy of every transaction we make.What an exciting time to be involved in the Bitcoin industry and to watch these engineers build solutions like Lightning in real-time. Imagine a world where money flows as freely as information does on the internet? It\u2019s happening. Hold on to your hats everyone, the future is here.Lightning will strike, and it will strike faster than a blink of an eye.", "responses": "39"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4?source=search_post", "post_date": "", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "", "link": "https://blog.producthunt.com/the-reason-bitcoin-ethereum-are-surging-33665c52d7a9?source=search_post", "post_date": "", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How does bitcoin work?

I built an app to show\u00a0you.Sean HanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 22, 2017https://coindemo.ioAs Bitcoin rose to unprecedented levels, it caught my attention & curiosity. I wondered, how does bitcoin really work?As I went down the blockchain rabbit hole, I found that many resources rarely go beyond the \u201crevolutionary\u201d, \u201cdistributed\u201d and \u201cimmutable\u201d dialogue. Many talk about the what, but not so much the why and how.I resorted to reading technical papers and source code to uncover this black box. I started sharing what I learned by building apps that demonstrated the inner workings of the blockchain.What I realized was bitcoin was just blockchain + transactions. This article will cover the transactions part of the equation. If you would like a refresher on blockchain, checkout Blockchain Demo or this article.A block on the blockchain has the following parts:A block on the blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://blockchaindemo.ioIndex (Block #1): Which block is it?Hash (#00001834d29f33\u2026): Is the block valid?Previous Hash (#000dc75\u2026): Is the previous block valid?Timestamp (Tue, 19 Dec 2017\u00a0\u2026): When was the block added?Data (I \u2764\ufe0f freeCodeCamp): What information is stored on the block?Nonce (1263): How many iterations did we go through before we found a valid block?Instead of having text (I \u2764\ufe0f freeCodeCamp) as data, cryptocurrencies have transactions as data.What is a transaction?Transactions are a record of payment between two parties. When there is an exchange of value, a transaction is created to record it.For example, let\u2019s say Satoshi has 100 coins.He wants to pay Dean 5 coins, with a mining fee of 1 coin. He uses the 100 coins he has to make the transaction. He expects to have 94 coins in change.When Satoshi mines a new block with the transaction above, he is rewarded with 100 new coins.The example above will create the following transaction outputs (to be explained):Transaction outputs\u200a\u2014\u200ahttp://coindemo.ioSince the initial 100 coins Satoshi had was used as an input to create the above transaction, the initial 100 coins is now spent. (to be explained)Spent transaction output\u200a\u2014\u200ahttp://coindemo.ioThe above concepts will be explained next.Three types of transactions:Reward\u200a\u2014\u200aSatoshi rewarded with 100 coins for mining new blockRegular\u200a\u2014\u200aSatoshi paid Dean 5 coins with change of 94 coinsFee\u200a\u2014\u200aMining fee of 1 for whoever mines the transaction (Satoshi in example above)TransactionA transaction consists of four parts:Inputs\u200a\u2014\u200aWhere value is coming fromOutputs\u200a\u2014\u200aWhere value is going toHash \u2014Uniquely identifies the transaction (using inputs & outputs)Type\u200a\u2014\u200aReward, Regular, or FeeOutputs\u200a\u2014\u200aWhere value is going\u00a0toAn output has two parts:Address\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat is the public wallet address to send the coins to?Amount\u200a\u2014\u200aHow many coins?Inputs\u200a\u2014\u200aWhere value is coming\u00a0fromAn input has to come from a previous output. However, an output can only be used as input once. When an output is used, it is considered to be spent. Outputs that have not been used as input are unspent.An input has five parts:Transaction Hash \u2014Transaction hash of the (unspent) outputOutput Index\u200a\u2014\u200aThe index of the (unspent) output in the transactionAmount\u200a\u2014\u200aAmount of the (unspent) outputAddress\u200a\u2014\u200aAddress of the (unspent) outputSignature\u200a\u2014\u200aSigned by the Address\u2019s private keyReward TransactionReward transactions are created as a result of finding a valid block on the blockchain. As a result, reward transactions do not have any inputs because it creates new coins.For example: Satoshi mined a new block with a mining reward of 100. The transaction on the block will look like this:Type: RewardInputs: NoneOutputs:Address: Satoshi\u2019s public wallet addressAmount: 100 (reward specified by the cryptocurrency)Hash: \ud835\udc53(inputs + outputs) = 000abcdefg\u2026Regular TransactionRegular transactions are transactions created when one party pays another.Continued example: Satoshi uses the (unspent) output from the reward transaction as an input to pay Dean 5 coins. He specifies a mining fee of 1 coin.Type: RegularInputs:Transaction Hash: 000abcdefg\u2026 (hash of reward transaction above)Output Index: 0 (first index of output is 0)Amount: 100 (output amount)Address: Satoshi\u2019s public wallet address (output address)Signature: Satoshi signs this input with his private keyOutputs:Output 1: (index 0)Address: Dean\u2019s addressAmount: 5 coinsOutput 2: (index 1)Address: Satoshi\u2019s addressAmount: 94 coins= 100 - 5 (payment) - 1 (fee)The first output is the payment going to Dean.The second output is the change going back to SatoshiBecause Satoshi\u2019s reward transaction output (from the previous example) has been used as an input for this payment, it is now spent and cannot be used again. If it is used again, then there is double spending.Why doesn\u2019t it add\u00a0up???The total input amount is 100.The total output amount is 5 + 94 = 99.In the example, Satoshi specified a mining fee of 1 coin. The difference between inputs and outputs of a regular transaction is the mining fee.Inputs must be greater or equal to outputs. If inputs and outputs are equal, then there is no mining fee.Fee TransactionWhoever mines the above regular transaction will add the mining fee transaction. Because there was a deficit of 1 in the regular transaction, the fee amount is 1.Continued Example: Bob mines Satoshi and Dean\u2019s transaction.Type: FeeInputs: NoneOutputs:Address: Bob\u2019s public wallet addressAmount: 1 (fee, difference of regular transaction input and output)Because Bob mined this transaction to the new block, there will be a reward transaction of 100 to Bob.On the blockchain:1. Satoshi spends his reward output 2. Satoshi pays Dean 3. Bob mines the transaction\u200a\u2014\u200ahttp://coindemo.ioFinal Balances:Satoshi: 94 = 100 (reward) - 5 (payment) - 1 (fee)Dean: 5 (payment from Satoshi)Bob: 101 = 100 (reward from mining new block with transaction) + 1 (fee)Total currencies in circulation: 200 = 94 (Satoshi)+ 5 (Dean)+ 101 (Bob)Two blocks were mined, and each block has a reward of 100, so there should be 200 coins in circulation.ConclusionOn a new block, regular and fee inputs and output totals must equal. This ensures that only reward transactions generate new coins.Deficits from regular outputs are offset with fee transaction outputs. Leaving the only output surplus to be reward transactions.Try it yourself at http://coindemo.io", "responses": "20"}, {"title": "The VERY simple bear case for\u00a0bitcoin", "author_name": "Savneet Singh", "link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/the-very-simple-bear-case-for-bitcoin-7f3a5d2953ba?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 17, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "6.8K", "content": "The VERY simple bear case for\u00a0bitcoinSavneet SinghBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 17, 2017Disclaimer: Before I begin and before I get trashed by the crypto mob, I should say that I\u2019ve been a bitcoin owner since 2012, was an early investor in ripple, changecoin, help run CoVenture Crypto\u2026and even helped launch a digital gold currency. I believe in the power of the technology and the power of a store of value, but this is my attempt at understanding both sides of the coin (get it)Every day I get asked by more family and friends if they should invest in crypto currencies. It\u2019s getting to the point where I feel compelled to share the other side of the story given how much blind faith I see being trusted in FOMO.Where\u2019s the tech?\u200a\u2014\u200awe are 8 or 9 years in this journey and there is still not even 1 enterprise or consumer application that we engage with regularly that leverages the blockchain. Given its been almost a decade since the start and the speed at which you can start enterprise and consumer applications has grown tremendously, it\u2019s surprising that not more is built. I\u2019m pretty sure 8 or 9 years after the launch of the public ISPs, we had numerous consumer and enterprise applications used or could imagine using. While it\u2019s easy to say that this is the internet in 1990, there are millions of non-tech people who know about it, believe in it and yet nothing has materialized yet. I have people tell me that the blockchain will replace every passive industry, but I think we forget that an inefficient process or industry can be dis-intermediate with the EXACT same automation technology we already have. Because something is inefficient doesn't mean the blockchain is the right solution. So yes SWIFT sucks, real estate titling is slow and insurance claims are sloppy, that doesn\u2019t mean the blockchain wins.The currency angle is dead\u200a\u2014\u200aearly on we heard the use case for bitcoin would be remittance and currency. I think that argument has died. It\u2019s pretty much well understood that NO country wants a parallel currency they can\u2019t control. Gold is a great analog. Gold already has 5,000 years of history where every culture, religion and society ascribes value to it (all attributes bitcoin would love to have). Yet almost no countries treats it like currency. Governments exert significant control by controlling the fiat we all use (taxes, printing, shrinking etc). That is not something that they will let go of. Moreover, given the cross border nature of currency, it requires massive cooperation among governments, something I wouldn't bet on.Satoshi must be in a perpetual smh mode\u2014 it\u2019s incredibly ironic and sad that the largest and most well funded startup in the space is Coinbase\u200a\u2014\u200athe crypto equivalent of a bank (#loveyouguysthough)! The Companies that help you hoard currency and not use it are the ones valued the highest in this economy. This is EXACTLY what Satoshi didn\u2019t want. We just recreated the financial system all over again. The people getting rich now are the same Wall Street traders, market makers and funds that dominate our securities markets\u2026and the same systems that Satoshi so badly wanted to dis-intermediate. The world\u2019s financial system is not global and keeps out literally billions of people (for credit or other reasons)\u2026every single person can own crypto, yet it\u2019s now being profited by the same type of institutions (different skin, same function) it was meant to challenge. The point of btc was not to not make people rich, it was to change the system.Markets don\u2019t go up vertically / Making Money isnt Easy\u2014 this is just fact. When your facebook feed is filled with your friends not in the tech world talking about trading crypto currencies, you\u2019re probably nearing the point of euphoria.5. Fake News\u200a\u2014\u200aI find that the industry suffers from fake news on 2 accountsa. Press Releases do not = revenue\u200a\u2014\u200aEvery day you see the currencies jump in price because they\u2019ve announced a partnership with a big bank or tech company. But that doesn't mean revenue. In fact, when you peel the onion you find that almost all these companies have done almost no business with these announced partnerships. Ask the banks how much money they transact on the blockchain, ask IBM how many people are actually developing core business processes on a distributed ledger.b. Valuation- this might be the most egregious thing I've seen. People compare the valuation of bitcoin to the value of the Nasdaq in 2000, the money supply of certain countries, the market caps of banks\u2026it\u2019s all silly. There is no real analog and it\u2019s not different then analysts making valuation calls on pets.com in 1999 off eyeballs. The idea that we can predict the valuation of something that goes up 20x in a year is just ignorance.6. The price going up doesn\u2019t mean you were right\u200a\u2014\u200aI think of the most bearish signals for this market is that everyone thinks that they were right about the blockchain because btc (and the other cryptos) have gone up in price.

The believers see Bitcoin as a revolution that will change the way we interact, not just with money, but with each other and the world.From the Crypto Anarchist Manifesto:So too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures.(I for the record, am a believer.)The skeptics, on the other hand, see Bitcoin as essentially valueless. Tulips, economic bubbles and the south sea are often used to dismiss the potential of Bitcoin.Side note: Speculative bubbles exist for world changing technology too. They are often the instigating spark that puts the tech on the map buy capturing the world\u2019s attention. Witness the Amazon bubble, for example. For a great explanation of this, see this article by https://medium.com/@zemacedoWhat does this have to do with\u00a0futures?Untill now, the only way the skeptics could influence the market was by refusing to participate. But with the arrival of futures, skeptics can now put their money where their mouth is\u200a\u2014\u200aand actively bet against Bitcoin.One camp sees Bitcoin as having near unlimited value\u200a\u2014\u200athe other sees is as essentially worthless. They both can\u2019t win\u2026But wait, there is\u00a0more.Another group is coming to the party\u200a\u2014\u200aThe institutional investors. And they love to crash parties.Take this tweet from long time FOREX trader @Crypto_Ed_NL:The implication is that large institutional players will want to suppress the price first, so they can accumulate Bitcoin at a discount. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time institutions were suspected of price manipulation:So to sumerize, we have three groups in this battle for the future of Bitcoin:The believers\u200a\u2014\u200aWar cry\u00a0\u201cHodl\u201dThe skeptics - War cry \u201cBut, but\u2026Tulips!\u201dThe institutions\u200a\u2014\u200aWar cry \u201cWe want your cheap Bitcoins now so we can sell them back to you later at a\u00a0markup.\u201dWho will win?I would be lying If I said anybody knows. All we know is we are entering a new era of price discovery, one where institutions trading Bitcoin without ever having to buy the underlying asset get to bet against us if they want.While we can\u2019t predict the future, we can look at the\u00a0past.History does not repeat itself, but it does\u00a0rhyme.-Mark TwainIf only there were some other type of rare asset, one that had to be \u201cmined\u201d.

I\u2019d like to share with you my thoughts on Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Lightning from a strictly networking background.To better understand how blockchain and the lightning network work, we should take a step back from the rage-infused battlegrounds of Twitter and Reddit (no good comes from this \ud83d\ude1b) and review the very network protocols and systems that power our Internet. I believe that there is a great wealth of knowledge to be gained in understanding how computer networks and the Internet work that can be applied to Bitcoin\u2019s own scaling constraints. The three protocols I will be primarily focusing on in this article are Ethernet, IP, and TCP. By understanding how these protocols work, I feel that we will all be better equipped to answer the great \u2018scaling\u2019 question for Bitcoin and all blockchains alike. With that said, let\u2019s get started.In computer networking, the two most common forms of data transmission today are broadcast and unicast. There are many other forms such as anycast and multicast, but we won\u2019t touch up on them in this article. Let\u2019s first start by defining and understanding these data transmission forms.Broadcast\u200a\u2014\u200aa data transmission type where information is sent from one point on a network to all other points; one-to-all.Diagram: Broadcast Data TransmissionUnicast\u200a\u2014\u200aa data transmission type where information is sent from one point on a network to another point; one-to-one.Diagram: Unicast Data TransmissionBased on our understanding of these types of data transmission forms, we very quickly discover that blockchain transactions resemble Broadcast-like forms of communication. When a transaction is made on the Bitcoin network, the transaction is communicated or broadcasted to all connected nodes on the network. In other words, for a transaction to exist or happen in Bitcoin, all nodes must receive and record this transaction. Transactions on blockchains work very similarly to how legacy, ethernet hubs handled data transmissions.A long time ago, we relied on ethernet hubs to transfer data between computers. Evidently, we discovered that they simply did not scale due to their limited nature. Old ethernet hubs strictly supported broadcast transmissions, data that would come in through one interface or port would need to be broadcasted and replicated out through all other interfaces or ports on the network. To help you visualize this, if you wanted to send me a 1MB image file over a network with 100 participants, that 1MB image file would, in turn, need to be replicated 99 times and broadcasted out to all other users on the network.In Bitcoin, we see very similar behavior, data (a transaction or block) that comes from one node is broadcasted and replicated to all other nodes on the network. Blockchains similarly to old, legacy ethernet hubs are simply poor mediums to perform data transmission and communicate over. It is simply unrealistic to me as a network engineer to even consider scaling a global payment network such as Bitcoin via Broadcast-based on-chain transactions. Even to this very day, us network engineers take great care and caution in spanning our Ethernet and LAN networks, let alone on a global level.To put it into perspective, if we were to redesign the Internet by strictly relying on broadcast data transmissions as exhibited in blockchains and ethernet hubs\u200a\u2014\u200awe would have effectively put every single person, host, and device in the entire world on the same LAN segment or broadcast domain. The Internet would have been a giant, flat LAN network where all communication would need to be replicated and broadcasted to every single device. In you opening up to read this article, every other device on the Internet would have been forced to download this article.

These are sometimes called \u201cforks\u201d. We wanted to provide a simple, non-technical explanation to add context to recent discussions (previous blog posts here and here).What is a\u00a0\u201cfork\u201d?A \u201cfork\u201d is a change to the software of the digital currency that creates two separate versions of the blockchain with a shared history.Forks can be temporary, lasting for a few minutes, or can be a permanent split in the network creating two separate versions of the blockchain. When this happens, two different digital currencies are also created.Why are changes made to digital currency protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum?Coinbase currently supports 3 digital currencies\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Each of these digital currencies use open-source software protocols with independent development teams responsible for changes and improvements to the network, much in the same way that changes to internet protocols allow web browsing to become better over time.Our mission is to create an open financial system for the world and we believe digital currencies will be fundamental in achieving this mission. However, many of these digital currencies are still in early development. Making improvements to the software\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as the number of transactions the network can support\u200a\u2014\u200ais crucial to creating finance 2.0.Why do forks\u00a0happen?There are a few reasons why a fork can happen. For example, when a change is proposed to a digital currency protocol, users need to show their support for the new version and upgrade\u200a\u2014\u200ain a similar way to people regularly update applications on their computer. In order for these changes to get approved many people need to agree, just as changes to cellphone networks require many phone companies to agree.What does this mean if I have digital currency stored on Coinbase?Coinbase actively monitors protocol developments and works hard to ensure customer funds are safe in these events. Our policy is to support only one version of a digital currency. In order to determine which fork to support we look at factors such as size of the network, market value and customer demand. We make this decision carefully because safely supporting a new digital currency requires significant work for many teams.We will keep users informed about these events through our blog, status page, twitter and supported assets page.", "responses": "70"}, {"title": "Bitcoin Data Science (Pt. 1): HODL\u00a0Waves", "author_name": "Dhruv Bansal", "link": "https://blog.unchained-capital.com/bitcoin-data-science-pt-1-hodl-waves-7f3501d53f63?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 17, 2018", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "9.2K", "content": "Bitcoin Data Science (Pt. 1): HODL\u00a0WavesDhruv BansalBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 17, 2018Bitcoin uses a curious accounting structure called a UTXO\u200a\u2014\u200aan Unspent Transaction Output. All UTXOs are timestamped by the transaction/block in which they were created. Since all bitcoin in existence is contained in some UTXO, this means that all bitcoins have an age: not the age/time when that bitcoin was first mined, but when it was last used in a transaction.Since Bitcoin stores its full transaction history in the blockchain, it is possible to look backwards and analyze the age distribution of UTXOs over time. Unchained Capital first analyzed Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO history a few years ago and what we learned encouraged us to start our crypto-lending product. We are now sharing our analyses publicly because we think they are fascinating and informative. Let us know if you agree.On to the data science!The Bitcoin UTXO Age DistributionThe following chart displays the age distribution of Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO set historically back to the genesis block (Note: this chart does not display correctly on mobile devices.)The colored bands show the relative fraction of Bitcoin in existence that was last transacted within the time window indicated in the legend. The bottom, warmer colors (reds, oranges) represent Bitcoin transacting very recently while the top, cooler colors (greens, blues) represent Bitcoin that hasn\u2019t transacted in a long time. Bitcoin\u2019s money supply grew from 50 BTC to ~17M BTC over this time period, so the chart has been normalized by the BTC in existence at each date (left y-axis). The black line shows the USD/BTC price (logarithmically, right y-axis). Chart lovingly made by Nelson Morrow based on prior work by @jratcliff [Direct Link]This chart is fascinating because it displays the macroscopic shifts that have occurred in Bitcoin\u2019s ownership through history. Spikes in the bottom, warmer-colored age bands (<1 day, 1 day\u200a\u2014\u200a1 week, 1 week\u200a\u2014\u200a1 month) indicate large amounts of bitcoin suddenly transacting. The steady growth of the top, coolor-colored age bands (2\u20133 years, 3\u20135 years, >5 years) shows bitcoin that\u2019s not being transacted with, idling between rallies. The interaction between these two patterns illustrates the behavior of Bitcoin\u2019s investors during market cycles.It is not possible to make charts such as the one above for traditional asset classes. It\u2019s only Bitcoin and other public blockchains that meticulously track these data throughout their whole histories. This enables post-hoc analyses of large-scale market behavior.Introducing: The HODL\u00a0WaveA common pattern after every rally in Bitcoin\u2019s price is what we have named a \u201cHODL wave.\u201d A HODL wave is created when a large amount of Bitcoin transacts on the way up to and through a local price high, becoming recent BTC (1 day\u200a\u2014\u200a1 week old), and then slowly ages into each later band as its new owners HODL.A HODL wave manifests visually on the chart as a pattern of nested curves caused by each age band becoming suddenly much fatter (taller) at progressively later times from the rally. The image below traces a few of the largest HODL waves.An annotated image of the UTXO age distribution. Local price peaks are labeled. The solid white lines trace \u201cHODL waves\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aa pattern of newly recent Bitcoin aging into each subsequent band, indicating that its new owners are HODLing. Only the three largest HODL waves are traced\u200a\u2014\u200amany smaller HODL waves are also\u00a0present.A Short History of HODL\u00a0WavesThe Genesis HODL: January 2009\u200a\u2014\u200aJune 2011 ($0\u200a\u2014\u200a$33)The Bitcoin UTXO age distribution zoomed in to a timespan covering the \u201cGenesis HODL\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe first HODL wave in Bitcoin\u2019s history.The first HODL wave\u200a\u2014\u200athe \u201cGenesis HODL\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awas not caused by a price rally because Bitcoin had no price at that time. Instead, it was caused by the initial acquisition of Bitcoin by Satoshi and the other first miners.During the first year of Bitcoin\u2019s history the community was extremely small, transaction volume was low, and there were no exchanges to establish a USD/BTC price. The coins being mined during 2009 weren\u2019t included in transactions very often for these reasons. They sat around and progressively accumulated into later age bands.Consequently, each of the colored age bands appears suddenly in the diagram once sufficient time has passed since the genesis block (e.g.\u200a\u2014\u200athe green 12\u201318 month age band appears exactly 12 months after the genesis block). The age band grows for a time, but then begins shrinking as all the existing Bitcoin ages into the next band.Because there was nowhere to sell Bitcoin at the time, the Genesis HODL is one of the clearest HODL waves on the chart: early miners had no choice but to hold their Bitcoin and surf the wave. Later HODL waves are much frothier as holders could exit into fiat whenever they wanted.The first time this pattern shifted was in mid-2010, going into 2011. The first Bitcoin exchanges, including Mt. Gox, launched in 2010. Bitstamp, Kraken, Coinbase all launched in 2011. The fraction of coins older than 12 months stopped growing in June 2010 for the first time. This is the first era where holders could trade Bitcoin online. Bitcoin\u2019s price wouldn\u2019t reach even $1 till February, 2011, but early miners likely had many thousands of BTC. Why not make a little cash?By April 23rd, 2011, Satoshi had left Bitcoin, right as Bitcoin reached $1. Satoshi is estimated to hold ~1M BTC, so he/she/they/it was already a millionaire at this point. Maybe that was enough?I\u2019ve moved on to other things.\u200a\u2014\u200aSatoshi Nakamoto, April 23rd, 2011 (1 BTC =\u00a0$1).What a casual bastard.\u00a0:)The HODL of 2011: June 2011\u200a\u2014\u200aDecember 2013 ($33\u200a\u2014\u200a$1k)The Bitcoin UTXO age distribution zoomed in to a timespan covering the \u201cHODL of 2011\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe second major HODL wave in Bitcoin\u2019s history.Starting in June 2011, Bitcoin\u2019s price suffered its first major collapse, from $33 all the way down to $2\u20133 by November 2011. It took almost two years to recover when it rallied to $198 in April, 2013.During the rally up to $33 in June 2011, all the holders who sold were early miners by definition. No one else could really have acquired BTC to sell.But the rally up to $198 was different. The age bands which shrunk the most leading up to the rally were between 12 months to 24 months. These were likely the first wave of investors\u200a\u2014\u200anot miners\u200a\u2014\u200aselling to realize gains. These investors would have acquired their BTC leading into the prior $33 price rally and afterwards.Bitcoin collapsed again from $198 in April, 2013, down to $69 in July, 2013 only to soar past $1k by December, 2013. There wasn\u2019t much time for panic-selling before a new surge of euphoria.This was the first major rally that was covered in the news. Many major exchanges such as Bitstamp, Kraken, & Coinbase\u200a\u2014\u200anot to mention Mt. Gox\u200a\u2014\u200ahad been around for a few years and were mature enough to service a large wave of demand for the first time.Right after the rally to $1k, more than 60% of BTC had been spent within the last 12 months. This was the most \u201crecent\u201d moment for BTC\u2019s money supply in history\u200a\u2014\u200athe moment at which the average last time of use of a Bitcoin was lowest. Who sold? Once more, it was the investors who purchased in the prior 2\u20133 years, through the $33 peak and the $198 peak.The Great HODL: December 2013\u200a\u2014\u200aDecember 2017 ($1k\u200a\u2014\u200a$19k)The Bitcoin UTXO age distribution zoomed in to a timespan covering the \u201cGreat HODL of 2014\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe third major HODL wave in Bitcoin\u2019s history.Ahh, the long winter of Bitcoin. After collapsing in December 2013, Bitcoin wouldn\u2019t reach $1k again till February 2017, more than 3 years later.But the rally to $19k, reached by the end of the year in December 2017, was truly spectacular. There was much more mainstream press coverage and many more new investors, including some extremely \u201ctraditional\u201d investors such as institutions and funds.As the price was crossing $1k in February, 2017, almost 60% of Bitcoin was older than 12 months. A year later, just after the peak at $19k, only 40% of Bitcoin was older than 12 months. During 2017, 20% of Bitcoin in existence was transacted with for the first time in years. Why? We see three separate, related reasons.Capturing GainsSome of the transaction volume in 2017 was about capturing gains. Investors who\u2019d held BTC for 12 months or more were the sellers, with particular emphasis on those who\u2019d held for 2\u20135 years. Fully 15% of BTC moved out of those age bands and became young again during this rally. The selling started almost as soon as BTC crossed $1k again, in February 2017.ICOsBut this time period also corresponds with the rise in Ethereum, ERC20 tokens, and ICOs. Many ICOs accepted Bitcoin and many Bitcoin holders felt that investing their BTC into ICOs was a way to capture the meteoric rise in value of the ETH-ecosystem, as no similar growth was yet occurring in Bitcoin. So perhaps it was ICO fever that compelled Bitcoin holders into the warm embrace of ETH and ERC20 after enduring many years of frosty Bitcoin winter?Bitcoin Cash & Segregated WitnessThe Bitcoin UTXO age distribution zoomed in to a timespan covering the Bitcoin Cash hard fork (Aug. 1) and the deployment of segregated witness (Aug.\u00a021).The final factor was the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash hard fork of August 1st, 2017, and the subsequent upgrade (on the Bitcoin side) to using segregated witness, on August 21st, 2017. Both these events caused large amounts of Bitcoin to transact for the first time in years as holders acted to claim coins on both sides of the fork and move their Bitcoin to new segwit addresses.The data clearly shows the significance of this event. In the month of August 2017, 25% of bitcoin became less than one month old. That equates to nearly 4M BTC, or $17B of value at then prices.The Next HODL: December 2017 onwards ($19k\u200a\u2014\u200a?)Today, after the rise of 2017 and the fall in 2018, the fraction of Bitcoin older than 12 months has dropped to just 40%, making the average age of Bitcoin almost as \u201crecent\u201d today as it was just after the last big rally to $1k.And after every great rally, there\u2019s been a great HODL. As the data shows us, there is already the development of another generation of holders settling in for the long haul. Beginning in January 2018, the category of bitcoin that are 6\u201312 months old rebounded from a low of 7.76% to 14.63%, a doubling of its population.It will be interesting to follow this new HODL wave over the next few months and years. What price will be required for the wave to break and a new cycle of gains-taking to occur? How much older will the average bitcoin get before the cycle begins again? How much larger will the next cohort of hodlers be?If you\u2019re curious about the answers, check back on this blog post over time. We will be continuously updating the UTXO age distribution chart above (also available as a direct link).Many thanks to Taylor Pearson, Kyle Samani, Tushar Jain, \u0647\u06cc\u0647\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0644\u0629, & Orie Steele for their invaluable feedback when reviewing this post.", "responses": "29"}, {"title": "Bitcoin Is Dead?

It has an uptime of 99.992044937 % since its inception in January 3rd, 2009, to be exact.By the time I finish this article, it would have issued new bitcoins as a reward to the miners who added the latest block, just as it has done since 2009 without fail.Ten minutes after the price of Bitcoin \u201ccrashed\u201d to $8,500 (as of this writing), it also added a new block to the chain and it will keep doing so until, well, until it doesn\u2019t.

Every ten minutes, the ledger is verified and updated. It does what it set out to do, no more, no less.As Bitcoin and the Blockchain moves forward, so does the industry behind it. Thousands of developers, entrepreneurs, investors, and users are building it as I write this. Transactions, hash rate, price, users, wallets, exchanges, developments\u200a\u2014\u200aon all of these fronts, Bitcoin software continues to accelerate. Lightning, Segwit, Schnorr, TumbleBit, MimbleWimble, and more are being developed by the best engineers in the world to make the network scaleable for global commerce.The Bitcoin Blockchain doesn\u2019t care about the price of a Bitcoin or what the media says about it\u2014 there is work to do now, and every ten minutes thereafter, for as long as it is running.

There is little I trust less than a diagonal trendline breakout before it retested the diagonal positively. (And even then I don\u2019t trust it much)Don\u2019t just blindly trust a trendline break, it doesn\u2019t have to mean anything if no one is buying afterwards and is often used by bigger players to sell their shares to newbie traders.The best way to screw as many people over is to make Bitcoin break out and dump right after.Markets tend to move the way that screws the majority.That is why I think we\u2019ll break the downtrend line but I doubt that the low we make before we do so is THE low.I\u2019d be ecstatic if it would be but I doubt it.This isn\u2019t to say I expect a 2014 like bear trend, I feel like the market is moving faster now than it did back then.I just expect the breakout traders to get majorly rekt and once they\u2019re out of the market an organic accumulation phase into new all time highs.For the people fuming ready to write an angry comment about how I\u2019m comparing 2014 and 2018 while the tech, acceptance and interest is far better now than it ever has been:After everything is said and done Bitcoin is a majorly improved currency but still relies on the people using it to think it\u2019s worth anything, to be worth anything.As long as there are more sellers than buyers at a certain level price will go down and vice-versa.That\u2019s all there is to it and a change in public perception will make it lose a lot of value quickly, no matter how good the fundamentals are.", "responses": "27"}, {"title": "Predicting the Rise and Fall of bitcoin\u2019s Price With\u00a0Math", "author_name": "Joe McCann", "link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/predicting-the-rise-and-fall-of-bitcoins-price-with-math-fb676e51c8dd?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 22, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "6.7K", "content": "Predicting the Rise and Fall of bitcoin\u2019s Price With\u00a0MathJoe McCannBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 22, 2018( The following was posted in realtime over at https://t.me/JoesCrypt )With the lack of traditional \u201cfundamentals\u201d in the cryptoassets markets, technical analysis has become essential in any investors toolkit for evaluating when and where to buy and sell said assets, particularly bitcoin.Technical analysis has been around for decades but many find it simply too confusing or complicated to understand.I will break down a number of technical analysis indicators below to make it easier to understand. In this case, I\u2019ll show why bitcoin\u2019s recent reversal was imminent.Let\u2019s take a look at a simple daily chart first.This chart is a fairly simple visualization of the past few months of bitcoin\u2019s daily price movement (opening price, closing price, the high price of the day and the low price of the day), including the trading volume (total number of trades for that day). The red and green symbols are called \u201ccandles\u201d.The long, downward sloping red line is called a \u201ctrend line\u201d and you can see the attempts of the bulls (buyers) to break through that downward trend line have failed a couple of times.In addition to that, the sinusoidal wave-like blue line is the 50 Day Moving Average. This average is useful for determining intermediate-term momentum while the slowly rising orange line is the 200 Day Moving Average which is useful for determining much longer term momentum and direction.You can see that bitcoin attempted to pierce the 50 Day Moving Average, which it did briefly on February 20th, but was stopped short of that red downward trend line.In addition to that, the selling volume (the large red rectangle at the bottom of the chart) on February 20th was higher than the previous day which tends to show control switching back to the bears (sellers).Finally, the chart\u2019s candle formation is called a \u201cshooting star\u201d.Shooting Star Formation ExplainedThe importance of a shooting star is key here as it is typically the most obvious warning sign of a reversal as the thin line (called the candle\u2019s \u201cwick\u201d) in the shooting star formation shows that many bulls were buying up here, but are quickly underwater (losing) in their position and now likely need to cut their losses (sell). This tends to trigger more selling. For the shooting star to be confirmed, the next day, in this case, February 21st, must fail to make a higher high (again in this case, trade above $11,775, which was the high on February 20th) followed by a closing price that is lower than the previous day.This was confirmed yesterday with bitcoin failing to get above $11,775 and closing at $10,454 which is below February 20th\u2019s closing price of $11,235.But this is child\u2019s play. Let\u2019s dig into a more technical chart to get even further confirmation of the reversal.Technical Chart of\u00a0bitcoinThis chart has a lot going on. Let\u2019s break it down.First, the light green region are the Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands, or BB, are a measure of the price volatility of an asset. The redline in the middle is the 20 Day Simple Moving Average while the top and bottom of the green region is +2 and -2 standard deviations from the 20 Day Simple Moving Average.When something is below 2 standard deviations of the mean, it is a good buying signal (it is what is referred to as \u201coversold\u201d).The opposite is also true. When the price moves above 2 standard deviations of the moving average (the mean), it is referred to as \u201coverbought\u201d which is typically a good time to sell.Overbought Bollinger BandWe can see bitcoin\u2019s nadir above the top of the BB, which implies an overbought state and a reversal in direction is more likely.But one signal is simply not good enough. Let\u2019s take a look at the next indicator, the Relative Strength Index, or RSI.RSI ResistanceRSI is a momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to measure the speed and change of price movements of an asset. When the RSI is above 70 it is overbought and when it is below 30 it is oversold.However, in bitcoin\u2019s case here, we aren\u2019t above 70 or below 30, yet, we can see that the RSI failed to move above 58, twice, also called a \u201cdouble top\u201d.The double top in this scenario also forecasts a reversal in trend and you can see the RSI subsequently began to drop as did the price of bitcoin.But there\u2019s more.Stochastic Oscillator Is OverboughtThis chart is known as the Stochastic Oscillator. The Stochastic Oscillator (SO) is a momentum indicator comparing the closing price of an asset to the range of its prices over a certain period of time.In layman\u2019s terms, when the SO is above 80 the asset is overbought and below 20 it is oversold. We can clearly see bitcoin well above 80, which is an overbought state and a reversal being even more likely.But there\u2019s one last indicator that shows bitcoin\u2019s imminent reversal: the Williams Percent Range, or Williams %R for short.Williams %R Is OverboughtWilliams %R, sometimes referred to as the Williams Percent Range, is another momentum indicator that measures overbought and oversold levels, by comparing the closing price of an asset to the high-low range over a period of time, typically 14 days.Speak English, Joe!In essence, when the Williams %R is above -20 it is overbought and when it is below -80 it is oversold.We can easily see that bitcoin was well above -20 and a reversal being likely. Surely enough the Williams %R reversed along with the price of bitcoin.Simple MathEnough with the advanced math! How can we use these indicators to determine whether or not it is a good time to sell?Simple. Let\u2019s just add up the positive or negative indicators.In this case, we only have negative indicators, and a lot of them.\u2705 Failure at downward daily trend line (the red diagonal line).\u2705 Failure to close above the 50 Day Moving Average.\u2705 More selling volume than previous buying volume (bears in control).\u2705 A \u201cshooting star\u201d candle formation.\u2705 A nadir above the first Bollinger Band (overbought).\u2705 A \u201cdouble top\u201d of the Relative Strength Index (RSI).\u2705 An oversold state of the Stochastic Oscillator.\u2705 An oversold state of the Williams Percent Range.That\u2019s eight indications of a reversal. Add these up and you have your answer\u200a\u2014\u200aa reversal is imminent.Where Does bitcoin Go From\u00a0Here?No one can predict the future and history doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does influence the future. In this case, we can use math again, to get an idea of where bitcoin may stop declining and in fact, start it\u2019s upward climb again.Fibonacci Retracement of\u00a0bitcoinThis chart is represents what\u2019s called a \u201cFibonacci Retracement\u201d.And yes, this we\u2019re talking about this Fibonacci:FibonacciAnd the Fibonacci you are likely familiar with:A Fibonacci retracement is used in technical analysis to identify areas of support (price stops going lower) or resistance (price stops going higher). Fibonacci retracement levels use horizontal lines to indicate areas of support or resistance at the key Fibonacci levels before the trend continues in the original direction. These levels are created by drawing a trend line between the high price (in bitcoin\u2019s case, $11,775) and the low ($5,873) and then dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 100%.Yeah, a lot of math, indeed.In the chart, you can see $10,382 as the first Fibonacci support level (23.6% from the high of $11,725) which was breached today, February 22nd. The next support level is $9,520 (38.6%), followed by $8,824 (50%), $8,127 (61.8%) then $7,136 (which is actually 23.6% above the low of $5,873) and then finally a full retracement back to the low of $5,873 itself (100%).These levels are of course not guaranteed but are great starting points to use with a number of other indicators to give you a better indication of when to start buying bitcoin again.If you liked this post, join me at https://t.me/JoesCrypt and if you would like to get realtime notifications of various buying and selling opportunities, have a look at: https://t.me/CryptDexBot, currently in Alpha.Connect with the Raven team on Telegram", "responses": "20"}, {"title": "Will The Bitcoin Bubble Pop?

Or Will It Envelop Us\u00a0All?On the society-enhancing power of hyperobjectsErik HoelBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 3, 2018More than a few people heard that distinctive sound several days before Christmas. It was a kind of spasm in the online ectoplasm, almost audible in the real world over the snowy silence of December 22nd, 2017. On that day, the great cryptocurrency bubble violently deflated as the price of one bitcoin ran from $20,000 to $10,500. In the immediate aftermath, the market seemed to recover, coming close to its all-time highs. Since then, however, it has become a vicious bear market, the mirror inverse of its previous bull market, losing 70 percent of its value in just months.Whether the worst is over for bitcoin holders, or still yet to come, it\u2019s worth stepping back and asking why this has happened. Why was the price of one bitcoin $20,000 in December but $6,000 this summer?Is the answer as simple as labeling it a bubble? For those who weren\u2019t paying attention to the insanity that was the 2017 cryptocurrency market, consider how amazing it is that during any particular day last year\u2014it could be a day without any remarkable weather; unmemorable in every other conceivable way\u200a\u2014\u200athere were people making and losing fortunes, experiencing agony and ecstasy, all through the portals of their screens. What were normal days for you might have been heaven or hell for them.\u00a0But beyond the hysteria and madness of the markets, to truly understand Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise and fall, one has to understand something about the underlying technology, since a big part of it is likely related to how novel the Bitcoin protocol is.There is a fundamental alienness to Bitcoin, which is amplified by the sheer scale of what it\u2019s trying to accomplish. At this point it\u2019s not far-fetched to say these entities, these cryptocurrencies, are the most interesting technological objects of the millennial generation. They are futuristic even for our futuristic times. In learning about them you are thrust into a tumbling wonderland where a thing most familiar and indispensable, money itself, is being interrogated.Bitcoin As HyperobjectThe philosopher Timothy Morton uses a term to describe \u201cevents or systems or processes that are too complex, too massively distributed across space and time, for humans to get a grip on.\u201d He calls such things hyperobjects. Morton goes on to say thatblack holes are hyperobjects; nuclear materials such as uranium and plutonium, with their deep-time half-lives, are hyperobjects; global warming and mass species extinction are hyperobjects. We know, we live with, the local effects of these phenomena, but mostly they are quite literally beyond our ken.Bitcoin is such a hyperobject, the first of its kind. Bitcoin expands across spacetime, a growing chain of ordered megabyte blocks, both everywhere and nowhere. Its fluid physical manifestations sprout up to gobble up cheap electricity, frigid warehouses stacked with buzzing thermodynamical demons solving computational puzzles that exist only to play a guessing game that is purposefully pointless. Input/output ports, like exchanges, or peer-to-peer sales, or accepting merchants, reach upward like tendrils from this ineffable otherworld where Bitcoin really exists. People in the community call the Bitcoin protocol \u201cthe honey badger\u201d because it simply will not die. All this from a distributed ledger no more complicated in its contents than an Excel document.Those contents\u200a\u2014\u200athe information on them\u200a\u2014\u200aalso mark it as a hyperobject. Like other hyperobjects, blockchains violate normal rules and transcend old paradoxes. For instance, some philosophers of mind have wondered how a physical object like the brain can contain information that isn\u2019t read-out subjectively by an observer. But the information contents of blockchains seem fundamentally fixed and definite in a way most other information is not. The distributed ledger composed of wallets and their holdings has a particular consensus\u200a\u2014\u200ait is agreed upon by all\u200a\u2014\u200aand this consensus is enforced by proof-of-work. Perhaps one fanciful hypothesis is that the brain itself works kind of like an organic blockchain, replicating its model of self and world across its hemispheres and modules, with consciousness being the current decentralized neural consensus of the state of that model.Even the actual value of an individual bitcoin denotes the protocol as a hyperobject. Its duality is fascinating. Unlike the objectively real information in a distributed ledger, the value of that ledger is totally subjective. A stack of accounts isn\u2019t meaningful unless the real world follows along. In this, paradoxically, the success of Bitcoin hinges on its own success. If the entire Bitcoin protocol is valued as the #1 currency in the world, it will have such an insanely high market cap that the intra-day volatility will necessarily be low. Low volatility is what is required for a usable currency. So the higher the market cap of Bitcoin gets, the more usable it becomes for purchases and pricing, and this is again the sort of ouroboros-like loop that signifies a hyperobject.For the sake of further argument, let\u2019s assume that the ultimate dream of Bitcoin works out (I don\u2019t mean to imply here that it\u2019s a foregone conclusion). In this dream, Bitcoin ends up replacing the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency and as a global repository of value. For those who think this is crazy, Bitcoin was briefly in the top 20 world currencies last year in terms of total value stored. At the number 1 spot, an individual bitcoin might be worth something like $300,000 to $500,000\u200a\u2014\u200aperhaps even millions.At first glance, such a suggestion might seem absurd. How can abstract unit of currency have value like that, especially something so recent and so untested? Yet isn\u2019t money itself like that?Money is a socially constructed unit of measurement. It is a yardstick; a ruler. But measurement works both ways. So we can instead label objects like cars and houses and computers the measuring devices, making money instead the object of real value. If we went with this latter view, money would be construed as value itself. So when someone creates a new and superior form of money, and it turns out that what we previously meant by \u201cmoney\u201d needs to shift to this new form, then its value is just all the old money.And correspondingly, in its price action there\u2019s a fundamental enormousness to Bitcoin that marks it as a hyberobject. It\u2019s like we can\u2019t quite get the thing in focus. Up close, on a daily level, there was immense volatility in the price last year (up 15 percent one day, down 10 percent the next). Then, zooming out, there were also longer monthly volatility cycles. Bitcoin would go up to $3,000, then, the next month, drop down to $1,800, etc. Yet even as these cycles spun out over time, the direction was always and inevitably up. Here\u2019s what this rather astounding process looked like the day before the crash.Taken from www.coinmarketcap.comBut one can zoom out even further. And from the perspective of cycles with cycles, the current negative price action looks no more mysterious than the process whereby a bitcoin can run up 15 percent one day and then lose 10 percent the following day. From this distance, the daily and monthly peaks and troughs can be conceptualized as Ptolemaic epicycles within the grand cycles that play out on the yearly basis (sometimes even every two or three years). Quite simply: There is no way to get from immensely low prices to immensely high prices in a straight line, even if everyone involved believed strongly that the outcome was preordained.A recent paper by a number of interdisciplinary researchers analyzed the boom and bust of Bitcoin, putting a mathematical spin on the same general idea of cycles. Their assumption, which is probably overly simplistic, is that the value of Bitcoin is derived (entirely) from Metcalfe\u2019s law, which states that the value of a system is proportional to the number of connected users squared (n\u00b2). Yet the price often gets ahead of itself, and in fact during a classic Bitcoin bubble the price begins to move super-exponentially, as if Bitcoin was striving to reach its teleological end state of world currency from whatever lowly point it\u2019s at in a single instant, and then inevitably collapses back upon itself, since singularities are outlawed in the real physical world. Wings of wax melt along with billions.Figure from Wheatley et al.\u2019s\u00a0paperThis same behavior has also been described as Bitcoin having a fractal nature, where it ramps through bubbles and then pops.Ultimately, I\u2019m not especially concerned with the mechanisms behind this behavior. Perhaps it\u2019s best represented as fractals, perhaps as singularities, but either way, both fit what I consider the real superordinate cause: the volatility along the path of an asset going from a price of one cent to trying to replace money itself is literally beyond human cognitive capabilities and timescales.Will The Bubble Pop\u2014Or Envelop Us\u00a0All?What will happen in the end? Maybe the decade of Bitcoin\u2019s life will all amount to nothing, and go down as one of the largest mass delusions in history. But I have my doubts. There is simply too much energy, intellectual and economic, now behind it. The internet started as a way of sending information across distant computers. It ended\u200a\u2014\u200aor, rather, has continued\u200a\u2014\u200awith social media reshaping our society, for both good and ill.Cryptocurrencies started as a way of sending money across distant computers. How will it end? How will it reshape our society, if indeed it does?It is possible the answer is already being built. A blockchain is both an asset but also a community of addresses interacting with each other. The combination of money and community demands a form of proto-government. Is it really so farfetched to think that in the future government itself might be similarly interrogated by this technology? If blockchains solve a lack of trust, and were kicked off by the loss of trust in the banking system due to the financial crisis of 2008, isn\u2019t there a similar lack of trust waiting to be colonized in the realm of government?I\u2019m not talking about incremental forms of assistance, such as recording votes on the blockchain; I\u2019m talking about a direction that is still embryonic, but mature enough to suggest incredible possibilities, especially in some of the newer Bitcoin-like projects. This is the idea of a \u201cdigital commonwealth\u201d which self-governs its technological and economic evolution, as well as laws and community standards. These digital commonwealths make it clear that the power of blockchains is not to completely eliminate trust, but rather to formalize it.If I had to place a radical bet on a black swan reshaping our world by the time I\u2019m older, I\u2019d pick the neotenous toddling forms of crypto-governance. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an unreasonable stab at the future to imagine that in a few decades there could effectively be a global crypto-neocameralism built atop the increasingly irrelevant foundations of nation states.Which gets to why this stuff is so interesting. Because despite appearances, there is surprisingly little that is new in this age. Some people think the world is changing a great deal, but beyond the small screens in our pockets, our infrastructure and culture are surprisingly close to stagnation. Big Tech still makes most of its money selling advertising. Movies are now mostly re-makes. Video games get better graphics but worse writing. Even last century\u2019s great political debate, between capitalism and communism, is playing out all over again, but with identity swapped in for class. Humans are the same as they ever were.So give me hyperloops and rockets! Give me Martian colonies! Give me radical new forms of governance! Let a thousand flowers bloom as we try novel forms of economic communities instead of repeating old mistakes. Give me positronic brains and artificial intelligence! Give me blockchains and dApps and new markets that anyone in the world can participate in. Please.

Take a look and share your opinion.Misplaced MoneyI bought a couple bitcoins in 2013. I bought them through a Bitcoin exchange and I can\u2019t find a record of the transaction now. I\u2019ve searched old emails and note files and can\u2019t recall the name of the exchange. I am concerned it was the now-defunct Mt. Gox, which \u201clost\u201d 750,000 customer bitcoins in a fraud-hacking-bankruptcy trifecta. So, I don\u2019t know how to locate those bitcoins or whether it\u2019s worth even ultimately discovering where I bought and kept them.Back then, I paid something like a hundred dollars per bitcoin. With the price of a bitcoin at close to $2,400 as I\u2019m writing this, that\u2019s real money. Real money I can\u2019t find. And, it\u2019s not like they will just turn up one day. I won\u2019t be moving the dryer and stumble across them. For all the talk about the permanency and immutability of bitcoins, you rarely hear talk about how things that only exist virtually have their own way of disappearing. But, they do.What is\u00a0Bitcoin?Bitcoin is a type of currency, specifically a cryptocurrency (there are many others, one or more of which may ultimately turn out to be far more broadly adopted than Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200athis is the early innings), which means it is a digital medium of exchange. Like the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin is both a store of wealth and a means for facilitating trading of services and products. You can use bitcoins to purchase products directly from a store in India. Press a button and BOOM, you can pay for a product or service by transferring bitcoins from your own wallet (of the electronic, not physical, variety) to the recipient\u2019s account. There is no middleman\u200a\u2014\u200ano intermediary to trust\u200a\u2014\u200ajust a relatively brief wait for the transfer to be completed and historically low transaction fees.What makes Bitcoin so interesting, though, is that it\u2019s not backed by a central bank or government. Bitcoins just exist out in the world and people assign them value, a significantly increasing amount of value (BTW, just to keep things confusing, it\u2019s Bitcoin with a capital \u2018B\u2019 when you refer to the overarching protocol that is Bitcoin, and bitcoin with a lowercase \u2018b\u2019 when you refer to the actual currency).A Bit About Blockchain TechnologyBitcoin was created by an individual or group of individuals under the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. It is built on an innovative and disruptive technology called Blockchain. A blockchain is essentially a public, cryptographically-protected, distributed ledger spread across a network of thousands of computers. This \u201cdatabase\u201d contains records of every transaction that ever takes place on it and it is constantly reconciling itself. In this way, it is virtually impossible to corrupt transactions that take place because, if anyone tried to change the record of a transaction, the entire system would be out of balance and immediately identify the inconsistency.Among the bevy of positive adjectives thrown around about Blockchain technology are:ImmutableTransparentDurableReliableFastEmpoweringBitcoin is a protocol built on Blockchain technology, and the currency we refer to as bitcoin is the first application of that protocol.What Makes the U.S. Dollar Valuable?You may wonder why bitcoins have value if there is no one and nothing backing them. That is an excellent question and one you might first direct you toward the U.S. dollars you\u2019re holding.\u00a0The value of the U.S. dollar used to be tied to gold. From 1867 to 1933, Americans could trade $20.67 for an ounce of gold, which directly linked the value of the dollar to a tangible asset. President Franklin Roosevelt took the U.S. off the gold standard, eventually spearheading the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, which allowed the government to pay its debts in dollars, not gold.\u00a0Throughout the 40s, 50s and 60s, the U.S. remained on a modified gold standard following the Bretton Woods Agreement, which again pegged the dollar to gold, only this time at $35 per ounce. At the same time, other participating countries decoupled their currencies from gold and pegged them to the U.S. dollar.On August 15, 1971, Richard Nixon broke the standing promise that $35 dollars was worth an ounce of gold and fully and finally severed the tie between U.S. dollars and gold. In doing so, he pressed the pedal on active monetary policy, which is a fancy-sounding way of saying he gave the Federal Reserve carte blanche to print dollars.\u00a0Today, U.S. dollars have value only because they are theoretically backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. I say \u201ctheoretically\u201d because there is reason to question how solid the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of our government is, whether its backing has much meaning at all.The U.S. is balance sheet insolvent. We have $3.5 trillion on the asset side of the ledger vs. approximately $23 trillion in liabilities. Apply old math, new math or no math\u200a\u2014\u200athe situation is clear and it\u2019s not good. According to a 49-page report issued by the U.S. government accountability office to Congress earlier this year, we face \u201can unsustainable long-term fiscal path caused by a structural imbalance between revenue and spending.\u201dTo date, our approach to solving our fiscal imbalances has been to print more dollars. And, it has worked so far. And, it will continue to work right up until it doesn\u2019t. Until then, U.S. dollars will have value because people think and act like they have value.What Makes Bitcoins Valuable?Like U.S. dollars, bitcoins have value because people think they have value. Unlike the U.S. dollar, however, the supply of bitcoins is fixed. Or, more properly stated, the total number of bitcoins that will ever exist is fixed. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in circulation (currently, there are roughly 16.5 million). The last bitcoin is expected to enter circulation around 2140.\u00a0Bitcoins aren\u2019t minted by a bank or central reserve, they\u2019re mined. The mining of a bitcoin is dictated by a preset, verifiable and immutable algorithm. This means that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like it are not subject to the whims or control of a single, central entity. Because there is no governing body, Bitcoin eliminates the ever-present temptation to run the printing press non-stop, creating currency to \u201ckick the can\u201d on problems. That\u2019s a game changer relative to existing fiat currencies, all of which are subject to the same risk of reckless printing and inflation.Gold, as a tangible asset, can\u2019t be freely printed, which makes it a great store of wealth. However, gold isn\u2019t easily tradable. You can\u2019t transfer gold to a store in India with one click of your mouse. But, you can do that with bitcoins.Despite its recent volatility, the worldwide recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of wealth, its easily tradable nature and the fact that its fixed supply checks off multiple serious risks of fiat currencies, are all traits that have combined to make Bitcoin the world\u2019s first global currency.The Long-Term Impact of Bitcoin on\u00a0SocietyWhat does Bitcoin mean for our\u00a0future?Occupying the title of the world\u2019s first global currency is impressive. But, is the legacy of Bitcoin going to be solely its role in eliminating intermediaries and lowering currency conversion transaction costs? I think there is more here. A lot more. I believe the existence of a global currency adds one more piece of the pie to a radical shift in the structure of worldwide governance.The story of humankind is a search for progressively greater personal freedom. The United States is an amazingly successful experiment in freedom and democracy. That said, we aren\u2019t THAT free. We are reasonably free. We aren\u2019t THAT democratic. In fact, in many ways, we look more like a republic. The reason the electoral college elects the President every four years is because the founding fathers didn\u2019t truly trust the people. And by \u201cthe people,\u201d I mean the land-owning white men of the time. The founding fathers wanted a mechanism to override a \u201cwrong\u201d decision by the landed gentry. Women and African Americans weren\u2019t even granted the right to make a \u201cwrong\u201d decision.Obviously, we started even less free and democratic than where we are today. Look back at the course of the last couple hundred years and tally the freedoms won by the American people along the way:Ending slaverySuffrage (women and African Americans)Women\u2019s reproductive rightsFreedom to marry interraciallyFreedom to divorceSame-sex marriageWhen I strain my eyes to look forward 100 years, I know we will have more and greater freedoms than we have today. What form will these new freedoms take? All the ones I mentioned above are freedoms we won within our border.However, I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before we demand freedom of geographic movement and the universal freedom to be a citizen of something other than the country where we were\u00a0born.I am convinced that within 100 years we will see the nation-state unseeded as the dominant form of political organization. And, I believe Bitcoin is another step toward that end. Earlier steps include the printing press, which unleashed free speech (and, ironically, played a big role in driving the growth of nation-states in the first place); the airplane, which made us globally mobile; and the Internet, which facilitates the free flow of information and knowledge and gives everyone a platform to be heard and a means to produce income without geographic restriction.The History and Core Functions of Nation-StatesA nation-state is a sovereign state with a strong government, political boundaries and citizens united by common language, culture or some other shared form of attachment. Nation-states are currently the most powerful participants in world affairs.\u00a0The nation-state is a modern political phenomenon that arose from the ashes of feudalism during the middle ages. During feudalism, kings didn\u2019t have a tremendous amount of power. Most power was dispersed to the feudal lords, the noble class. The local people were loyal to the local nobles in return for protection. Over time, kings consolidated their power, eventually gutting the power of the noble class and aligning themselves with the emerging commercial class.\u00a0With a much larger territory and a different model of distributed power, the old standby exchange where people were loyal solely to secure local protection, became a less obvious and less compelling deal. So, the rulers encouraged the people to be loyal to the newly-created nation for other reasons. Hence, the rise of nationalism\u200a\u2014\u200aloyalty and devotion to one\u2019s nation above others.\u00a0In a world going virtual, one Thomas Friedman famously labeled as \u201cflat,\u201d it strikes me as odd that borders define so much of our experience. A national border is an imaginary line with real consequences, an arbitrary line defining ingroups and outgroups. One of the main reasons Donald Trump was elected was based on his promise to keep jobs in the U.S.\u200a\u2014\u200ato keep them from people on the other side of our border.On balance, I believe nationalism has done much more harm than good in the world. It accentuates differences, rather than stressing common ground. And, I believe borders will become increasingly less relevant going forward. The reason for that is twofold. First, while it may be challenging to envision the future, you can count on it providing much greater personal freedom than we have today. Second, the unique benefits of national borders are rapidly diminishing, while their costs increase.The Declining Hegemony of Nation-StatesPolitical theorists widely believe nation-states have existed historically for four primary reasons\u200a\u2014\u200aguns, money, land and\u00a0tribe.Looking at those reasons in reverse order, as they relate to the United States, tribe matters less and less in a world quickly moving virtual. Going forward, the connections people forge online are likely to be at least as strong as those forged in person. Hit Me Up!, Hello Pal, Wakie and Airtripp are among the slew of apps whose value proposition is connecting strangers, especially ones living in different countries.The U.S. long ago ceased to be a nation of small communities. 75% of the U.S. population lives in urban areas. That percentage has consistently climbed since 1820. With 8.5 million inhabitants, New York City has a population roughly 56,667 times Dunbar\u2019s number. Increasingly, we live in dense anonymity.As a country, we are so widely dispersed and politically and culturally divided that the idea of the U.S. as one tribe is laughable. Sure, we collectively cheer for the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team every four years, although the ties that bind us grow looser every day. It is the same story worldwide.As for land, it is already becoming less of a national thing. For one, people are leaving the U.S. They\u2019re emigrating and choosing to live in other countries. During the last decade, the percentage of U.S. born people living abroad has increased significantly. Meanwhile, U.S. citizenship renunciations have skyrocketed. In 2008, 227 citizens renounced their citizenship. In 2016, 5,409 citizens did so (with 2,364 abandoning ship in the last quarter, maybe Trump will kill America!). While these are relatively small numbers, the trend is strong and clear.\u00a0Meanwhile, more and more of our land is occupied and owned by foreigners. The percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born has been on the rise\u200a\u2014\u200adoubling from 1980 to 2010. The current administration is trying to decrease that percentage, although they\u2019re unlikely to have significant long-term impact. And, they won\u2019t make any effort to stem the purchase of U.S. real estate by foreigners. The U.S. is motivated to allow foreign purchases of U.S. assets since it represents the transfer of wealth into our borders. That trend has been going strong for decades.Granted, there is more to the land component than physically making land available within our borders. Indeed, the U.S. offers the rule of law to enforce ownership interests, as well as a systematized method of titling and recording interests in real property. For this role, as well, we no longer need Uncle Sam. The Republic of Georgia recently became the first government to register land titles via a blockchain, a task ideally suited for that technology. For more on this milestone, check out this Forbes article.That brings us to the third core function of a nation-state\u200a\u2014\u200amoney. As the world\u2019s first global, digital currency, Bitcoin heralds a new era of global trade. A future where the central banks and nation-state governments aren\u2019t needed, which is fitting since they have long abused their role as stewards of our paper fiat currencies.Granted, Bitcoin is a small player today. But, it is up and coming. Japan just recently passed a law to recognize Bitcoin as a legal method of payment, and Russia is expected to soon do the same. Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization (the total worth of bitcoins in circulation, in U.S. dollars) quadrupled in the past year to $42 billion, evidencing increasing consumer and investor interest in the cryptocurrency.What\u2019s Next for the\u00a0U.S.?At his inauguration in January 1961, President Kennedy famously advised, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you\u200a\u2014\u200aask what you can do for your country.\u201d In 2017, the more relevant rallying cry would be \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you\u200a\u2014\u200aask what your country can do for you that you can\u2019t do for yourself.\u201dWith Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the mix, the answer is down to just one thing\u200a\u2014\u200adefense.

A number of coins have attempted to solve one or few problems that exists in the bitcoin chain. For example. Ethereum started to address low supply issue, while bitcoin cash came up with fork to resolve distribution issue. While there is not a single that has resolved all the issues that exists in bitcoin. BitCoinReal (BTR) is a next generation crypto asset that is going to cover all loopholes that exists in the current business and tech model.BItCoinReal will be covering issue of volatility, blocktime and mining process. Moreover, BitCoinReal coins will be enough in the blockchain to maintain its economic stability. Some of the features of BitCoinReal and how they are aiming to be the next big coin of the year are mentioned below;VolatilityToday, 16.95 million bitcoins are in circulation. These are very few to maintain BTC economic value, because of low supply, we observe extreme volatility in BTC prices. But, BitCoinReal will be a coin that will cover this problem by supplying enough coins in the blockchain. The main benefit of high supply is it paves way for mass adoption, exhibits low inflation and translates into stability for the project and tradable value of coin both.BlocktimeThe time to create a new block is known as blocktime; Bitcoin takes 10 minutes to create a new block, but BitCoinReal will take only two minutes to create a new block which is very less time to make a transaction. This blocktime is the lowest when compared to bitcoin space where BTC, BCH and BTG blocktime is 10mins while BitCore exhibits 2.5 mins as blocktime.Mining processMining is a process where transactions are verified, and consensus is built on algorithms. It rewards miners for their cost and energy utilized in form of new coins, however the issues and drawbacks are getting real which is why projects are moving towards newer ways of distribution. To make things simpler, BitCoinReal will incorporate fork mechanism for coins distribution. This will save up the cost and it is an efficient way to unlocking the coins.Transaction per dayAnother restriction of btc is limited transactions per day. Transaction of bitcoin can be till 1.2 million per day, but BitCoinReal can transact around 50 million per day. It is an essential evidence of proving BitCoinReal\u2019s technological advancements. Larger number of transactions act as a catalyst for mass adoption. Once, the coin will be distributed amongst masses, a large number of transaction per day handling will act as a plus point in the overall ranking of coin.

The aim was to make poor rich, but it happened the exact way around as those who had money bought BTC at cheap rates thus causing its price to surge and in the end made a fortune over it, while the poor remains poor.But, I kept financially unstable people in mind while starting a new campaign in crypto hub.

In this coin, I\u2019m trying to empower the financially unstable people; I\u2019m giving them a chance to be successful in crypto hub.BitCoinReal (BCR) is better than Bitcoin (BTC) due to its justice in terms of distribution of BCR coins, its transaction limits in BitCoinReal platform, its number of coins that are in circulation, and its security for BCR coins.In terms of distribution, I have formed a renowned formula named as Fork method distribution through which a person who has less Bitcoins will able to exchange more coins BitCoinReal and a person who has more Bitcoins will be able to exchange less coins of BitCoinReal. Basically, in this method, we divide the number of bitcoins from 100. I have a passion to give a new chance to financially unstable people and from my platform every merchant can start up his business in small investments. Furthermore, BCR coin is also stable in terms of economic value as it is pegged with gold\u2019s economic value.For the exchange in fork method, I also kept in mind the circulation of other coins of crypto currency by which I got the idea that there are approximately 90 million unlocked coins of other crypto currency. So, I supplied abundantly and threw 100 million BitCoinReal coins in circulation. Of these 100 million coins, 10 million coins are also in funds that are usually used for research and development purpose.There are so many features that are the evidences of proving BitCoinReal is better than Bitcoin.

It has been good to me and will always form the main part of my crypto portfolio.Those (mainly low-income copy & paste journalists) claiming Bitcoin is in a bubble are too lazy and/or stupid to become informed. There is no Bitcoin bubble for these reasons.GrowthBitcoin has had phenomenal growth in its price and MCap since inception. If we exclude other cryptoassets, Bitcoin has been the best performing asset in the world every year since 2009 through to December 2017 with the exception of 2014. It has beaten all global currencies, equities, commodities, bonds, ETFs, real estate throughout that period. Bubbles are by definition short-lived, they do not keep bubbling for eight years.As a result it has achieved a MCap of $56 billion and this place in a global table of iconic assets.Trading VolumesVolumes indicate the liquidity of an asset. The greater the liquidity the easier it is to buy and sell, even when there is turmoil, and the lower the Bid-Offer spread and therefore the cost of trading. You want to avoid assets with tiny liquidity as when the shit hits the fan it will be costly to exit. Bitcoin has world-class liquidity. I run a crypoasset analysis site named Blocklink.info. Here is a screen-grab of the most liquid assets in the world.Source: Blocklink.info. Volumes for cryptoassets are fetched from the Coinmarketcap API using the CRYPTOFINANCE Google Sheets Add-On. Volumes for stocks come from Google Finance. You can check the US stocks volume at the NASDAQ site.Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume is up there with the great iconic American stocks.Bitcoin\u2019s price will continue to be volatile, but Bitcoin is travelling along a secular bull trend road, and that spectacular volume is not going to evaporate overnight.Transaction FeesEvery month fees are ever higher which is watertight evidence of ever greater demand to use Bitcoin. That is, people want to send transactions across the blockchain, not just trade on the exchanges.Tx fees time-series data is maintained at Blockchair.comBitcoin and My PortfolioBitcoin holds a dominant place in my cryptoasset portfolio. As a result of recent changes in UK regulations I have allocated my entire personal pension (like a US 401k or retirement account) into Bitcoin via the XBTProvider ETN.Be more cautious about investing your 401k into Barry Silbert\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust $GBTC. The (European) XBT Provider ETN is an open-ended fund which means it maintains a premium to the NAV close to 0% at all times. The Bitcoin Investment Trust is an inferior investment vehicle because it is a closed-end fund (it does not increase its holdings of the underlying asset when demand for the product increases) which means it is subject to wild swings in its premium, which has been as high as 150%. So you could make the mistake of buying when the premium is high and suffer swingeing losses even when the Bitcoin price is stable.Rule 2: \u201cWhen you See it, Bet Big.\u201d George\u00a0Soros.Something extraordinary is happening. The cypto space in June 2017 is like the Internet space in 1995. It is a great opportunity.Stanley Druckenmiller has written about his dealings with George Soros whom he quotes as saying \u2018When you see it, bet big\u2019. The funny thing is, I was mocked by a Hedge Funder on Twitter named Sarah Cone (@impcapital ) when I revealed that I had seen it and I had bet big. I bet big with my entire fucking pension.George Soros: When you see it, bet big.Here is Charlie Munger expressing a similar thought:Rule 3: Index Track the Top 10 CryptoassetsUntil 18 May 2017 I held very little Ethereum and zero Ripple in my portfolio.I made a great mistake in not buying Ethereum and Ripple in 2017 until 18 May. My mistake was Bitcoin Maximilism. I refused to have anything to do with Ethereum and Ripple because I didn\u2019t like them. As a result I missed these returns.Source: CryptoCurrencyChartI came to my senses on 18 May, 2017 when I underwent an epiphany. I then made a new (self-imposed) rule\u00a0: broadly track the Top 10 cryptoassets in my portfolio, regardless of my opinion about their individual merits.I have applied a flexible, discretionary form of index-tracking since then.I execute index-tracking manually off this Google Sheet:At the time of writing, 20 June 2017, the results of index-tracking have been pleasing.YTD 2017 returns for Cryptocurrencies, 18 May 2017:My portfolio was up 106% YTD.YTD 2017 returns for Cryptocurrencies, 20 June 2017:My portfolio was up 281%. So in one month (18 May to 20 June) it has raced past Bitcoin, $GBTC, and Monero, and has made good ground in catching up with Global Cryptocurrencies.I ruled myself free to apply discretion in my index-tracking. It was very clear early on that Ripple was in a secular bear market against Bitcoin from 18 May and I quickly became and stayed underweight in Ripple.I also went underweight in Ethereum in mid-June at $350\u200a\u2014\u200a$360.Why? Because:Is Ethereum in a\u00a0bubble?I don\u2019t know. Applying the same metrics used above to $ETH it does pretty well, but not as well as Bitcoin. But there are clear risks and as a result I am underweight in Ethereum compared to its share of the global Cryptoasset Market Cap.Growth (Price & MCap): Ethereum has outstanding growth in its short life, but it was only created in August 2015 so it lacks the 8-year track record of Bitcoin. This is significant. Ethereum\u2019s explosive performance in 2017 could indeed fit into the time-frame of a bubble.Trading Volumes & Volume/MCap Ratio: Great. Similar to Bitcoin.Transaction Fees: All good. They are rising quickly indicating true demand for this cryptoasset.Source: Bitinfocharts.comMetrics aside, Spencer Bogart makes great sense in this thread where he describes the regulatory risk and other risks that might bring the Ethereum house of cards down. It is possible that the SEC will rule that the ICOs are illegal sale of securities. People might go to prison. It is for these reasons that I am under-allocated.Note: If Governments decide to put a stop to the cryptoasset economy, there is a crucial distinction between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is truly decentralised. It has honeybadger, even cockroach qualities and is resistant to such measures. Ethereum is a registered commercial legal entity in Switzerland and can be shut down overnight.Rule 4: Scale Out (Take Some\u00a0Profits)Anyone who has lived through a bubble knows the value of this.I have experienced several bubbles, namely London housing 1984\u20131988, DotCom in 1998\u20132000, London housing again 2002\u20132008, the Bulgarian property market (seaside apartments and ski apartments) 2004\u20132008.It\u2019s human nature to be cautious at first and then progressively relaxed, even reckless. My observations suggest that it is best to behave in the opposite, counter-intuitive way: commit yourself to the market with reckless abandon in the early days, and then start the scaling out process, applying the brakes and get the hell out when it appears to be the later stages.In all those bubbles I made great paper profits that disappeared in a matter of months. The paper profits were more than 2 million Euros in the Bulgarian property market. In none of them did I take profit off the table in the run-up. Christ did I regret that. I am taking profit off the table in the cryptoasset market.Finally, at the end, you must scale out completely. Jesse Livermore\u2019s advice for a bull market:It is not my opinion that we are near the last eighth:Rule 5: The Honeybadger Trade: Buy the\u00a0Dip.Lots of influential actors\u200a\u2014\u200aGovernments, banks, regulators\u200a\u2014\u200afear Bitcoin and try to kill it on a regular basis. Bitcoin takes massive hit after massive hit, but it has always rode the punches and bounced back. Experienced traders have noted this and the advice is to buy the dip. This is the Honeybadger Trade.I like the idea of BTFD, as I truly believe in Bitcoin. BTFD! people on Twitter yell. But it has puzzled me for a while.There is a solution. Buy on margin at the dips. The beauty of this is that you do not need to add funds to your account, you merely avail yourself of the leverage already available. Use Bitmex Exchange.I permit myself to use margin in the specific case of BTFD.You need to get the timing of BTFD right. Beetcoin on Twitter provided this great analysis (thread) demonstrating that you should stay out for the first 48 hours of a dip and then BTFD.Do NOT Sell the\u00a0DipYou need to be clear, is this a dip or is it a secular bear market? I BTFDd relentlessly in the DOTCOM unravelling in 2000 and lost every penny in the end.If it is an established, secular bear market then face the music and STFD.Rule 6: Don\u2019t Overtrade. Lock up\u00a0CoinsI over-trade stupidly at at tiny whims when I am bored or drunk. A solution I have found is to lock coins away out of reach.One way is to keep Bitcoins and others in your hardware wallet. I use Trezor. It can store Bitcoin, Ethereum (+ all ERC-20 tokens), Ethereum Classic, ZCash, Litecoin, and Dash.Another way is to lock them into terms deposits at Cryptopia (applies only to Dotcoin). This gives you the added benefit of earning interest on coins at interest rates that just do not exist outside crypto (about 18% p.a.).Rule 7: Let Profits Run. Cut\u00a0Losses.This guy turned $10,000 into $6 million by letting his profits run during the Ethereum run-up in the first half of 2017.Run profits Cut Losses is hard to do exactly. In my P&L Sheet I focus on the 7d (Price Change over 7 days) to decide whether to re-allocate my portfolio according to this rule. I largely ignore 1 h and even 24 h\u00a0.Rule 8. Treat ICOs and other Examples of Herd Mentality with\u00a0CareIn general you are better off holding Ethereum than going through the mad, greedy, FOMO process of buying ICOs.But ICOs or coins newly released on the exchanges can be great investments. Beetcoin played the IOTA new release on Bitfinex like a master. He turned 10 Bitcoin into more than 200 Bitcoin. He bought the $IOT Over the Counter (OTC) some time before Bitfinex listed it. He was ahead of the herd.Rule 9 Do Your Own Research. Examine Micro-Caps.I respect this strategy.I bought Elastic $XEL at the obscure Heat exchange. It was rather difficult discovering how to buy it because I was in this case ahead of the herd where the path was not well defined. In the end I bought it at a high price (average 31,367 Satoshis, should have got them at 25,000 Sats) as I got scammed over at Heat by a predator (Arsonic @Ars0nic on Twitter) playing the order book. We\u2019ll see how that plays out. I think the excessive price I paid will not matter too much.Rule 10 Be Careful as Hell with LeveragingObviously leveraging can work, as with the guy referenced above who has made $6 million relentless buy Ethereum on leverage since December 2016.I take out the rare leveraged position at Bitmex Exchange.It can also go horribly wrong when margin calls occur across the mass market.That said, those who lost everything were not the brightest traders. They could have avoided that by using judiciously set Stop-Limit orders, rather than plain Stop orders.So that is the Ten Rules.If you liked this please Clap and Follow me on Twitter: @ BambouClub", "responses": "26"}, {"title": "Speculative Bitcoin Adoption/Price Theory", "author_name": "Michael B.

CaseyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 27, 2016ProvisosThis is only a speculative theory and may be incorrect in part or in whole. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile in nature at this stage and no future performance is certain. DO NOT INVEST ANYTHING MORE INTO CRYPTOCURRENCIES THAN YOU ARE PREPARED TO LOSE IN TOTALITY.This paper refers specifically to \u201cBitcoin\u201d simply because it is the most historical, liquid and widely used cryptocurrency currently in existence. The ideas stated here do not apply exclusively to Bitcoin, but rather to cryptocurrency as a whole. Another cryptocurrency may one day supplant Bitcoin, in which case I would expect it to act in the same manner I am describing of Bitcoin. This may be potentially mitigated by studied diversification, but that is out of the scope of this writing.This paper assumes that eventual near-universal adoption of Bitcoin or 2nd tier technologies (ex. Lightning Network, Sidechains, etc.) based on Bitcoin is a foregone conclusion. While this notion is certainly debatable, the debate remains out of the scope of this writing.TheorySimply put:The growth of adoption of Bitcoin and therefore bitcoin price is following an S-Curve of Technological Adoption, which is itself characterized by fractally repeating, exponentially increasing Gartner Hype Cycles.This theory represents an overarching long-term fundamental factor that dwarfs the effects of other fundamentals such as: exchange hackings, government regulatory announcements, changes in economic policy and further technological advancement of the protocol. Although, it is important to note that these other fundamentals may spur transitions between Gartner Hype Cycle stages.The S-Curve of Technological AdoptionAs stated above, this paper assumes eventual near universal adoption of Bitcoin. So how does anything transition from a state of zero adoption to complete adoption?One of the most familiar concepts in marketing is the bell curve of adoption:The parabolic curve represents and exponential increase in adoption up until median saturation, then a logarithmic decline in adoption until the whole potential population has adopted. Assuming near-universal adoption, Bitcoin is still likely in the \u201cInnovator\u201d phase, or just barely into the \u201cEarly Adopter\u201d phase.If you make the bell curve cumulative to represent the total adoptive population at a given time, you get the S-curve of Adoption as characterized by the yellow line below:It\u2019s called the S-curve simply because of its letter \u201cS\u201d shape. Its defining characteristic is the extremely slow exponential ramp up to the point at which growth \u201cgoes vertical\u201d, and super-majority adoption is rapidly achieved. Throughout the 20th century every major mass-market technology that was near-universally adopted has exhibited some form of an S-curve, as indicated in the chart below:In addition, S-curves are becoming more compressed as technology advances, leading to more pronounced vertical growth adoption phases.So, if Bitcoin is following a standard S-curve, then why is so volatile? Over the long term (decades or more), technological adoption S-curves appear to be very smooth. However, in the short-term, rates of adoption (typically sales to new customers) are highly volatile. If Bitcoin is following a standard S-Curve, the massive exponential increase of the final majority mass adoption will make all present volatility look extraordinarily flat by comparison. This is why long term bitcoin price charts are best viewed on a logarithmic scale.S-curves can be volatile, but must sustain exponential growth in the long term.Bitcoin Bubbles & Gartner Hype\u00a0CyclesIf one researches Bitcoin for any length of time, one invariably encounters the phenomenon of the bitcoin bubble. The price, after rising slowly but fairly steadily for a length time, suddenly explodes by 5\u201310% a day for a sustained period of time culminating in typically a full order of magnitude (~1,000%) increase over its previous value. This is known in Bitcoin circles as a \u201cBull Run\u201d.Since these bubbles are inherently speculative in nature, they reach a point known as \u201cThe Height of Irrational Exuberance\u201d, where the sellers begin to outnumber the buys and the bubble pops and the price crashes down to a range above the pre-bubble price; but many multiples lower than the peak. This is typically the time Bitcoin begins to be pronounced dead by many economists and news outlets.The price stabilizes around this low value for some time, which I refer to as \u201cThe Boring Low\u201d. If you are looking to accumulate, this is typically the best time. In this stage no amount of good news seems to affect the price in any manner.Eventually, the market begins to view the price as stable and speculative investment resumes. This leads to the next stage (which we are currently in), that I call \u201cThe Volatilic Rise\u201d. In this stage, the price stair-steps its way back into the vicinity of the old high. Once the price reaches a sustained level of 80\u201390% the old peak, the bubble cycle typically starts over again with another bull run.The Nov. 2013 bubble to Present:When looking at the structure of the bubble phenomenon, it is difficult not to be reminded of another commonly accepted concept in technology: the Gartner Hype Cycle, which illustrates Amara\u2019s Law:\u201cWe tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.\u201dGartner Hype Cycle:Basically, for anything new there is a mad flurry of excitement over potential applications, followed by the realization that most of them don\u2019t work, followed by a slow learning of what does work, followed by sustained progress.After much careful examination; it becomes apparent that a roughly analogous pattern of excitement, disappointment, and cautious optimism occurs in both a Gartner Hype Cycle and bitcoin bubble.Unlike a typical Gartner Hype Cycle, a bitcoin bubble does not reach a steady state of gradual increase. As mentioned before, it must continue to follow the exponentially increasing path of the S-curve. Why then does it follow the hype cycle at all? This is because the nature of bitcoin investment is almost entirely speculative. Speculation is driven, in large measure, by hype.To illustrate the relationship of hype over bitcoin to bitcoin price, this chart shows the base-10 logarithmic bitcoin price plotted along with Google Searched for \u201cbitcoin\u201d as found on Google Trends:It has been noted that in the past, extreme spikes in google searches for \u201cbitcoin\u201d and \u201cbuy bitcoin\u201d have been leading indicators of bitcoin price increases be several weeks; presumably because of the historical learning curve required to purchase and manage bitcoin.Because the price of bitcoin rises so phenomenally fast during a bull run, speculators begin to view the price as illegitimate and unsustainable. A great many who bought in before or early on in the bull run, liquidate to lock in profits, leading to the crash. Only after the stable Boring Low and the steady Volatilic Rise, do the speculators consider the possibility of the bull run price being \u201clegitimate\u201d. Once legitimate and established as the new base line, the hype cycle begins anew with another bull run.Exponential FractalsFractals are a fascinating branch of mathematics, in which often relatively simple formulas evaluate to infinite complex patterns that repeat themselves over and over again at different orders of magnitude. Fractal mathematics are often employed in technical analysis of Forex markets and by high frequency trading bots.Though I have not seen any work toward a definitive fractal formula that describes the way bitcoin\u2019s price behaves, I believe there is ample evidence that a fractal pattern is present. It represents itself in the form of exponential bitcoin bubbles driven by Gartner Hype Cycles. I\u2019d imagine there is enough to study in this area for several Doctorate dissertations.The next few pages illustrate the striking similarity of the fractal pattern of the bitcoin bubbles, each roughly a full order of magnitude greater than the preceding.Nov 2013 bubble with preceding Feb 2013 bubble:Feb 2013 bubble with preceding Jun 2011 bubble:Jun 2011 bubble with preceding Jan 2011 bubble:Jan 2011 bubble with preceding Nov 2010 bubble:I believe that the pattern is a fairly pure representation of the psychology of large groups of independent speculators each attempting to act rationally trading a rapidly appreciating asset. The primary motivators of these movements are greed and fear and are fundamental to human nature. The bull run happens due to a tipping point of hype where greed and fear of missing out (FOMO) take hold and speculative fervor ensues. More speculators see this and jump on the bandwagon, accelerating the run. Eventually, the return for the initial speculators grows so large, their fear of losing the money they have earned outweighs their greed for more and they begin to sell. The price increase has been far too rapid to possibly be legitimate.From here, the bull run peaks out and the crash begins. People who bought in at the height of the fervor begin to lose money and sell to avoid further losses. These people are typically short term speculators generally uninterested in the technology and looking only to make a quick profit in fiat. They are commonly referred to as \u201cweak hands\u201d, because they fold (sell) at the first sign of trouble; usually losing money on the transaction. The crash is the process of the market shaking out all of the weak hands. The crash ends when nobody with bitcoin is willing to sell it, these are typically long term holders and the total number (and combined worth) of them grows after each bull run.After the crash, the narratives of Bitcoin dying or being too volatile to serve as a store of value need time to subside. During the boring low, there is not much speculative action and the price remains relatively stable. New speculators see no reason to jump into the market as the asset isn\u2019t appreciating and those holding don\u2019t want to sell at a low. This continues on until speculators begin to view the price as stable.As time goes by with a stable price, speculators collectively begin to see the value as potentially low. Several new whales research the technology and buy relatively large amount spurring mini-bubbles that spike and then reverberate stabilizing over time with a general uptrend. This stage I refer to as \u201cthe Volatilic Rise\u201d. The price basically stair-steps in increments on the order of magnitude of the pre bull run high (ex. right now they are ~$100). The price rises and falls, generally with a long term upward trend until reaching roughly 80% of the peak price of the bull run. The formerly impossible price of the peak now appears real and relatively stable. A new hype cycle begins and greed and FOMO lead toward a new bull run.That\u2019s the cycle. By my count is has happened in Bitcoin 5 times so far, and as human nature does not fundamentally change I see no reason why it won\u2019t happen 2\u20133 more times:The last bull run that happens will be the exponential increase that characterizes the S-curve; wherein the majority of the population of the planet will all adopt bitcoin in a relatively short period of time. This is known as the knee of the S-curve where it goes vertical and is likely still years away. When bitcoin takes over, it will happen quickly.ConclusionBitcoin is probably the purest example of speculative adoption humanity has seen to date. It is following a typical technological adoption curve at a rapid pace. The S-curve is made up hype cycles which repeat in a fractal manner. Each fractal repetition is roughly one order of magnitude greater than the one prior. Since reaching dollar parity, the percentage increase of each bubble over the last has been decreasing, even though the $ increase grows exponentially. There are likely 2\u20133 remaining hype cycles before Bitcoin becomes near-universally adopted.At present, all technical indications are that we are several months away from a new hype cycle and bull run. I anticipate we have one more plateau in the volatilic rise phase before then, likely around $900.It is impossible to tell the exact timing and exact peak of a bull run, however general time frame and rough order of magnitude seem plausibly predictable. I first identified this pattern in mid-2013 when the price was $70, with a former all time high of $258. I was able use this knowledge to forecast the rough timing and order of magnitude of the November 2013 bull run to $1,177. My models however had me convinced the peak of that bull run would be ~$2,500. I have since come to the conclusion that accurately calling the top of such a massive increase is a fool\u2019s errand. As a general practice, you are better off selling progressively toward the top, then waiting for the crash and buying back progressively toward the boring low; with the goal of increasing your long-term bitcoin holdings.Again, all of this is pure speculation.

In this post, I\u2019m going to discuss the Proof of stake of Bitcoinreal. First of all, let\u2019s discuss the definition of Proof of Stake (PoS).Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins he or she holds. This means that the more Bitcoin or altcoin owned by a miner, the more mining power he or she has.Both Proof of work (PoW) and Proof of stake (PoS) do same work, but the way both do the work is different. In PoW, computers are used for mining, but PoS connects all the wallets in a server which is used for staking. Staking verifies all the transactions along with unlocking the new blocks from the block chain. In wallets, users invest their coins that are used for the staking. PoS is cost effective way of unlocking the new coins and verifying the transactions. The people who invests coins through their valets are always be awarded. Amongst all forks of bitcoin, Only Bitcoinreal will be using PoS by which it will give the incentives or rewards to its users who have invested their coins on its platform as the four-time supply makes real sense for staking more than mining.Currently, Bitcoinreal is using Proof of work due to its low circulation of coins and the most important it has just come on a digital currency platform. But, the objectives that it is going to cover on a digital currency platform will surely fulfill the dreams of every Digital currency holders. The pricing of BCR coins will also not fluctuate due its mass adoption that is going to be gained by Bitcoinreal because of its valuable features. I, Real Satoshi, trying my best to fulfill all the dreams that were once kept in my mind while developing Bitcoin. By some unavoidable circumstances, the real objectives of Bitcoin are not fulfilled. But, Bitcoinreal has come now to fulfill all of my dreams from which the main dream of mine was to empower the less fortunate or financially unstable people. Bitcoinreal will be gained its mass adoption through using PoS and will also facilitate its investors by giving them enough rewards or incentive.Here, the main point about Bitcoinreal is to notify that it is the first coin that will be using PoS to minimize the cost of power and to maximize the mass adoption that is going to be done with Bitcoinreal through it facilities. The main facility which is being provided by BCR is a server that is connected all the users\u2019 wallets in which users have invested their BCR coins. The server is connected by itself and no electricity as well as no individual\u2019s working is needed in it.Keep updated with us to get to know more information about Bitcoinreal\u00a0!", "responses": "5"}, {"title": "Bitcoin might be the Crypto-Gold.

As such, they transcend the genre of crypto, and reach into the soul of blockchain for a new model humans could use to build a more transparent, decentralized and free society.That\u2019s a dream that\u2019s going to be popular with not just Millennials, but the GenZ and Alpha generations that grow up increasingly with artificial intelligence. If Millennials were mobile natives with an always-on internet, GenZ are video natives and Alpha are AI-natives.A number of progressive states have given us reason to believe their fiat currency will be on the blockchain before 2020, such as Estonia, Japan, Kazakhstan, India, Russia, China and others. While this doesn\u2019t mean they will be decentralized obviously, it means that cryptocurrencies are going mainstream, not just in terms of interest of investors, but by business and governments as well. Ethereum of all the crypto entities has the best chance of evolving into something much more persuassive and all-encompassing.Ethereum\u2019s market cap is on the way up, and as it scales its transaction frequency it can become something altogether unprecedented.If 2008 is known as the Great Recession, what will 2017 be known for? As American presidents become long forgotten footnotes, the blockchain will represent a significant crossroads of the web in its infancy and how it joined with artificial intelligence and a revolutionary kind of transparent system of trust for homo sapiens in the early 21st century.If altcoins are not always trustworthy, and if ICOs even can sometimes be fraudulent, a blockchain platform is trustworthy in a world that doesn\u2019t trust changing governments and rising and falling corporations, all of which amount to short-term interests.Even with many firms becoming blockchain as a service providers, Ethereum remains an attractive option for firms seeking secure transactions. Ethereum\u2019s founder recently spoke about a three to four year long-term plan for Ethereum.When one of the world leaders in blockchain is a 23-year old, there\u2019s a sense that we are in uncharted horizons of what the future might bring. Once the scalability problem is solved, Ethereum has the possibility of becoming one of the key blockchain platforms of the future, or could be overtaken by Chinese equivalent, NEO.We trusted Google because they weren\u2019t Microsoft and we trusted Facebook because it wasn\u2019t Google. Now we only trust in code.\u200a\u2014\u200aJoaquim Pedro AntunesBlockchain can solve our collective epidemic of trust, and as wealth inequality keeps pushing young people down, it\u2019s more badly needed than ever to be solved in the challenging next two decades or rapid technological change and automation.If Bitcoin has a somewhat shady reputation among GenX, regulators, police authorities and as a means of covert exchange of funds on the dark web, Ethereum has a totally different aura, possibility and probably, another destiny altogether.Correct me if I am wrong?", "responses": "21"}, {"title": "How demand of BitCoinReal (BCR) will shoot up by Fork distribution", "author_name": "Real Satoshi", "link": "https://medium.com/@realsatoshi1310/how-demand-of-bitcoinreal-bcr-will-shoot-up-by-fork-distribution-c501ec21ea9c?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 31, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "1.5K", "content": "How demand of BitCoinReal (BCR) will shoot up by Fork distributionReal SatoshiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 31, 2018Satoshi Nakamoto was the first person who wrote a white paper for Bitcoin (BTC). While inventing Bitcoin (BTC), he didn\u2019t want a poor to become poorer and a rich to become richer. However, it was done on a Bitcoin (BTC) platform in which a poor is becoming poorer day by day and a rich is becoming richer. So, BitCoinReal has been invented with the solution to empower the less fortunate people by a precious Fork method.In this method, a financially stressed person will be able to access more coins of BitCoinReal (BCR) by the exchange of Bitcoin (BTC) and a financially stable person will be able to access less BitCoinReal (BCR) by the exchange of Bitcoin (BTC). Further, it can be more elaborated by the formula in which number of Bitcoins will be divided from 100. For example; if a person has only 1 bitcoin, he will be able to access 100 BCR coins.By this example, you can understand our strategy of empowering a financially stressed man well. Many other CryptoCurrencies have used this strategy in terms of distributing their coins by the exchange of bitcoins. But, none of them kept it mind that they are just distributing their coins equally not justly.We are distributing our coins justly by this precious method. By this method of distribution, merchants and users will be prioritizing more to BitCoinReal as compared to Bitcoin as its economic value is stable and it is exchanging the coins justly. There are so many less fortunate people in crypto hub who will definitely be attracted with our Fork Distribution and will start exchanging their bitcoins in order to get the BCR coins.We have also provided you a platform of several merchants and users through which you will be able to do trading or purchasing by the coins of BCR that are stable in terms of economic value.Generally, BitCoinReal (BCR) is known for the transaction of daily purposes and for this every user or merchant wants a stable currency. As, you are aware about its linkage with Gold that\u2019s value is usually kept stable. BCR\u2019s economic value keeps stable; it just makes slightly changes when there are any technological advancements.In future, the demand of BitCoinReal will be high as there are so many people who are not financially stable in the crypto hub will definitely be attracted by the number of BCR coins that we are providing in terms of exchange of bitcoins.", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "The ExtraCredit Caravan is on a Mission to Educate\u00a0DC!", "author_name": "BitcoinHomework.com", "link": "https://medium.com/@BitcoinHomework/the-extracredit-caravan-is-on-a-mission-to-educate-dc-42bdf7bdc0f3?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 24, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "10.1K", "content": "The ExtraCredit Caravan is on a Mission to Educate\u00a0DC!BitcoinHomework.comBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 24, 2018Join our Presale\u200a\u2014\u200awww.ExtraCredit.ioThe ExtraCredit and BitcoinHomework Team are headed to\u00a0DC!The BitcoinHomework team along with ExtraCredit is forging strategic partnerships to bring Blockchain and cryptocurrency education to DC and beyond.

None of the fork of bitcoin including even bitcoin hasn\u2019t attained mass adoption due to many issues. The main issue that every fork including bitcoin has faced so far is about circulation of coins. This low circulation is back bone of the issues from which inflation increases. Low circulation of coins in the market also impede every currency from getting the mass adoption. In terms of circulation of coins of Bitcoin Gold, 21 million coins are in circulation which are very less to maintained liquidity/inflation or to get mass adoption. But, the total supply of Bitcoinreal is 10 Billion from which 1 billion are mined and being circulated in the market.Most of the digital currencies including Bitcoin Gold use Proof of work for mining the coins which is very cost effective; furthermore, it also takes a lot of time for verifying the transaction and for unlocking the new block from blockchain. But, Bitcoinreal will be using Proof of stake that is very efficient way for the verification of transactions and for unlocking the new coins. Read my detailed post related to proof of stake (PoS) that has been used by Bitcoinreal on the given link https://medium.com/@realsatoshi1310/bitcoinreal-bcr-the-first-bitcoin-btc-fork-implementing-pos-as-well-4ffa0f9c5675The circulation of coins Bitcoinreal is much more that that of Bitcoin Gold, so volatility is very low in Bitcoinreal. Bitcoin gold has very much volatility due to its low circulation which has also a huge impact on its inflation rate. Merchants don\u2019t prefer to use Bitcoin Gold because of these issue as they want a currency that is a non-volatile. Bitcoinreal is providing them a non-volatile currency for the use of their businesses. The most important point is to notify here, that both Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoinreal charge 0.2 percent fee in every transaction, but the circulation coins of Bitcoinreal is very much as compared to Bitcoin Gold due to which a merchant can transact a huge amount by paying fee once. It is a precious benefit for a merchant that he can grow his business on Bitcoinreal platform by low fees in his huge transactions.50 million transactions per day can be done by Bitcoinreal, but Bitcoin Gold can only do 20000 transactions per day. This differentiates Bitcoinreal from Bitcoin Gold through a merchant\u2019s point of view. Moreover, more than 5000 merchants from different countries have joined Bitcoinreal platform through which they will be spreading their businesses.So, these were the main differences among the Bitcoinreal and Bitcoin Gold.

There was some limitation in Bitcoin which made an arrival of forks necessary. Every fork is using BTC\u2019s coding, but with updated version. In today\u2019s post, I\u2019m going to distinguish the two forks that are Bitcoinreal and Bitcoin diamond.Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) is a fork that was established on November 2017. The total supply of Bitcoin diamond is 210 million that is as much as that of Bitcoin, Segwit 2X, Bitcoin gold, and Bitcoin cash but it is not as much as that of Bitcoinreal (BTCr). Because other forks including Bitcoin itself have supply of 21 million coins, but Bitcoinreal has a supply of 10 billion coins from 1 Billion coins are already mined. The total supply of coins matter for a merchant/user in terms of trading; low supply of coins makes a major impact on currency\u2019s economic value. These other forks including Bitcoin Diamond have totally been failed in terms of controlling inflation/liquidity. But, Bitcoinreal is going to make a history in crypto hub in terms of controlling inflation/volatility/liquidity.Bitcoin Diamond is using the mining claiming for the distribution of coins; this mining is done by proof of work that is not an efficient because it takes a lot of time and cost for unlocking the new block from the blockchain or for verifying the transactions. But, Bitcoinreal will be the first coin from digital currency which will be using proof of stake for unlocking the coins or for verifying the transactions. Please read my previous post in which I have discussed how Proof of stake is being used by Bitcoinreal? Or is it really more efficient than proof of work? click on this link https://medium.com/@realsatoshi1310/bitcoinreal-bcr-the-first-bitcoin-btc-fork-implementing-pos-as-well-4ffa0f9c5675Bitcoin Diamond takes 10 minutes to create a new block due to which it covers less transactions for verifying or it unlocks less coins. Every fork including even Bitcoin take approximately 10 minutes to create a new block, but again Bitcoinreal has been won with them as it just takes 2 minutes to create a new block due to which it will be able to cover more transactions for verification or more coins for unlocking. Bitcoinreal is continuously being won because it is using latest technology.The Bitcoinreal\u2019s Blocksize is 32mb which is evident of its fastest speed in transactions. While the Blocksize of Bitcoin diamond is 8 MB.So, these were some differences that make Bitcoinreal to be the best Fork in the history of crypto currency.

These differences make Bitcoinreal better than Bitcoin Cash. In this post, I\u2019m going to discuss the vital differences among Bitcoinreal and Bitcoin cash.Fork distribution methodCan I own coins of Bitcoin cash if I have bitcoins? Yes, you can exchange your bitcoins with the coins of Bitcoin cash, but the distribution of coins will be done equally. For example, if you have 100 BTC, you will get 100 coins of Bitcoin cash. The distribution method of Bitcoinreal is very different to that of Bitcoin cash. In Bitcoinreal, I, Real Satoshi, had a vision to empower the less fortunate or financially unstable users of crypto hub. So, I have a developed a unique method of exchanging the coins with Bitcoin holders. The more you have Bitcoins, the less you will get less coins of Bitcoinreal; the less you have Bitcoins, you will get more coins of Bitcoinreal. Basically, the number of coins of BTC will be divided from 100. For example, if you have 1 BTC, you will 100 coins of Bitcoinreal. By this unique distribution, both Bitcoinreal and users are being benefited. There are so many financially unstable people on the platform of Bitcoin due to its low circulation of coins and its mass adoption.Circulation and mass\u00a0adoptionApproximately, 21 million coins of Bitcoin cash are in circulation. But, the coins of Bitcoinreal are nearly 100 million in circulation that is 4X more than Bitcoin cash due to which Bitcoinreal is also getting mass adoption. Bitcoin cash was also the fork of Bitcoin, but it continued the main problem of Bitcoin that was low circulation of coins. But, I have identified and Bitcoinreal that is also the fork of Bitcoin is the first coin in crypto hub that is using the two technologies for unlocking the new coins which are proof of work and proof of stake.Proof of stake (PoS) and Proof of work\u00a0(PoW)Both Proof of work and Proof of stake are used for unlocking the new blocks from the blockchain. Proof of work is generally being used by every fork of Bitcoin; Bitcoin cash is also using the Proof of work that is an expensive as compared to Proof of stake. Due to which coins of Bitcoin cash are not enough in circulation. Less circulation of coins always increases the inflation rate, but it won\u2019t happen with Bitcoinreal as it is using both PoS and PoW. Find out the more detail about Proof of stake and Proof of work from my previous post https://medium.com/@realsatoshi1310/bitcoinreal-bcr-the-first-bitcoin-btc-fork-implementing-pos-as-well-4ffa0f9c5675\u00a0.In the beginning of Bitcoinreal, we are using Proof of work for unlocking the new coins and for verifying the transactions. But, after 2 to 3 months, Bitcoinreal will be using Proof of stake due to which it will also achieve mass adoption. (NOTE: In the history of crypto hub, no currency has achieved mass adoption till now.) Furthermore, Bitcoinreal is the first coin in the history of Crypto currency which will be using Proof of stake.So, these were the essential differences among the Bitcoinreal and Bitcoin cash. These differences make Bitcoinreal a unique coin in Crypto hub that is not only facilitating its users, but it is also getting its mass adoption.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "What are privacy coins, how bitcoinreal will solve supply\u00a0issues", "author_name": "Real Satoshi", "link": "https://medium.com/@realsatoshi1310/what-are-privacy-coins-how-bitcoinreal-will-solve-supply-issues-1d0866b455bc?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 7, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "1.6K", "content": "What are privacy coins, how bitcoinreal will solve supply\u00a0issuesReal SatoshiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 7, 2018Protection coins execute usefulness to shroud your personality when making exchanges.

As the supply is huge there\u2019s no chance of overwhelming demand and price will remain stable as there will be no shortage and due to that the inflation gonna go REKT. Bitcoin real actually represents the exact idea presented by Nakamoto that BTC will help poor but it was rattled by the whales and tycoons who just got even more richer and poor remained poor. Bitcoin real takes care of that manipulation, marking its sufficient supply to sustain any sort of manipulation and keep the price stable and in range of all.

In today\u2019s post, I\u2019m going to distinguish between Bitcoinreal and Bitcoin private.Circulation and supply of coins are essential for maintaining the inflation/liquidity/volatility. Bitcoin couldn\u2019t maintain its inflation rate due to which it is a volatile asset. Again, Bitcoin private that is a fork of Bitcoin is not able to maintain its inflation rate because of low supply of coins. Bitcoin Private has a supply of 21 million coins that are very less to maintain its liquidly due to which it also a volatile asset. In the history of crypto currency, Bitcoinreal is supplying 10 billion coins of which 1 billion coins are pre-mined; bitcoinreal is the one and only digital currency which is non-volatile.Only supply of coins doesn\u2019t maintain the liquidity or inflation rate, but it also needs the best technology for unlocking the new coins due to which circulation of coins will be maintaining demand and supply. Bitcoinreal is using proof of stake for unlocking the new blocks from the blockchain. Proof of stake is cost-efficient way for unlocking the new coins or for verifying the coins and it is also the speedy as compared to that of proof of work that is being used to Bitcoin private.Fork distribution method is being used by both the Bitcoinreal and Bitcoin private; bitcoin private is using the ratio of 1:1, for example, if you held 15.4 ZCL and 0.1 BTC, you receive 15.5 BTCP. But, bitcoinreal is using a unique method for distribution with the formula of 100 divided by number of bitcoins; for example, if you have 2 bitcoins, you will get 50 coins of Bitcoinreal. This was done by this calculation (100 divided by 2). In simple words, the more you have bitcoins the less you will be able to access coins of bitcoinreal, but the less you have bitcoins the more you will be able to access the coins of bitcoinreal. Basically, bitcoin private is using fare method, but bitcoinreal is using just method.While bitcoin private works as a centralized currency in which only Bitcoin private, sender and receiver know the amount of transaction, but bitcoinreal is following the main essence of crypto hub which was decentralization. In Bitcoinreal, you can get to know the information about any transaction if you know the public key of sender or receiver.Due to a non-volatile asset, speedy transaction, and high transaction limit in a minimum fee, bitcoinreal has become the most preferred platform of merchants from which they are spreading their businesses.

Some opportunities require full automation to be practical.Crypto Market\u00a0ProblemsVolumeVolume is low. Really low. Clear signals that are actionable are often constrained by volume.Bid/Ask SpreadsBid/Ask spreads are quite high on the low-volume pairs. This introduces a lot of variability and impacts predictability of opportunity signals.Order BooksBecause volume is low, order books are thin. This means that the \u2018depth,\u2019 or available interest at different prices is quite thin, which makes understanding the full scope of an opportunity much more complicated. For example, there may be a great trade that can net 5%, but only with a maximum of USD$3,000. The next opportunity might net 3% with an opportunity size of $5,000. And so on.Network Transfer SpeedsNetwork transfer speeds are VERY unpredictable. Bitcoin (BTC) transfers between wallets can be anywhere from 10 minutes to 8 hours. Network health and bandwidth is the key factor here. BTC has different considerations than ETH, and so on. We can talk more about mining fees and their impact on these transactions, but that is largely obfuscated from the exchange investor at present.Exchange ReliabilityThe exchanges are reasonably reliable. However, they are not even close to the level of an E-Trade or Interactive Brokers or Bloomberg Terminal. Not even close. Some of the exchanges have been shut down by governments. Some of the exchanges scale way too fast, like Kraken. Sometimes trades are not executed because of server overload. Some of the exchanges\u2019 API endpoints are quite unreliable at times.The Average\u00a0InvestorThe average investor should play it safe. Transfer times are scary and unpredictable. Crypto as a larger segment has proven its value and staying power. It might be more practical for a layperson investor to familiarize themselves with the main blockchain concepts first in order to understand why people are getting excited about different currencies. Maybe Bitcoin emerges the overall winner, perhaps not. Don\u2019t get romanticized by the numbers that the media trumpets about market cap and all the rest, I\u2019m not convinced that the various exchanges have proven these claims with real volume and trading activity.What Does The Future Look\u00a0Like?Who knows\u2026 The crypto market is emerging at an incredible pace. It is here to stay. Does Bitcoin win? Ethereum? Qtum? Zcash? Ripple? We really don\u2019t know. Whatever happens, it\u2019s going to be a fun ride.One note of caution: We don\u2019t yet know how Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies will respond to a significant downturn in the larger markets like the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq. We know that Bitcoin has so far outperformed the primary US markets by factors. Be careful out there. It\u2019s been very easy to be \u2018right\u2019 about the crypto markets in the last 24 months, perhaps that should be reason for a healthy amount of caution.https://www.tokenspread.com/", "responses": "33"}, {"title": "Bitcoin owners, you need to do these two things right\u00a0now", "author_name": "Subhan Nadeem", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 18, 2017", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "5.7K", "content": "Bitcoin owners, you need to do these two things right\u00a0nowSubhan NadeemBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 18, 2017source: newsbtc.comThe world has officially gone insane over Bitcoin and millions are rushing to buy it. There are a couple of things that need to be said, now more than ever. Let\u2019s get straight to the point.1. Take ownership of your\u00a0BitcoinsTrust nobody.That is the name of the Bitcoin game. Bitcoin works because when it comes to keeping track of who has how many coins or who sent how many coins where, neither you or I have to trust each other, or trust a central entity.It also works because we don\u2019t have to trust a central entity, like a bank, to hold our coins. Your coins are yours alone, provided you hold the private key to your Bitcoins.\u201cYour keys, your Bitcoin. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.\u201dTime and time again, even the most tenured Bitcoin hodlers have ignored this adage and suffered the consequences.Unsurprisingly, the use of centralized exchanges that facilitate the sales of Bitcoin has coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s growth and gone parabolic. With this rise in exchange usage, this message needs stressed upon now more than ever.The growth rate of one of world\u2019s most popular Bitcoin exchange grows as Bitcoin\u2019s does, source: Alistair\u00a0MilneThere\u2019s no measuring just how many people using exchanges to buy Bitcoin are keeping their coins on these exchanges for extended periods of time, short of asking exchanges for the numbers themselves. But as long as that number keeps rising, a larger and larger target is painted on these services\u2019 backs. The potential damage (or payday, depending on how you want to look at it) from a successful attack on any of the countless crypto exchanges also rises accordingly.For those who don\u2019t know, leaving your coins on an exchange does not mean those coins are yours. You are simply trusting the exchange to release them to you at some point if you so request it. You have no idea of what level of security these exchanges deploy, nor should you trust any security they report to have. Your coins are stored in a trust-maximized and centralized entity, almost entirely defeating the purpose of using Bitcoin.If you\u2019re not convinced that keeping your coins on an exchange is a massive problem, here are just a couple of horror stories to help you along.The timeline starts with Mt. Gox, the world\u2019s most popular exchange at the time. In 2014, it was the target of one of the first major cryptocurrency heists\u200a\u2014\u200a850,000 Bitcoins (over 4% of all Bitcoins that will ever exist) were stolen from Mt. Gox. Bitcoin\u2019s price then proceeded to plummet in the following year as a result.The fallout from Mt. Gox, signified by the drop in price of Bitcoin over the\u00a0yearThis event first brought to attention the importance of holding your own private keys. However, there have been several hacks on centralized exchanges resulting in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars since. It seems lessons aren\u2019t being learnt.The latest heist to come out was just two weeks ago. NiceHash, a mining marketplace service, was robbed of over 4,700 BTC (worth $89 million at the time of writing) on December 6, 2017. Although not an exchange, NiceHash is a centralized entity all the same that users entrusted to hold their coins. This hack was on the smaller end of the spectrum, but as the latest in a string of countless hacks, it proves that there will be no end to attacks of this nature. If you\u2019re a crypto trader that needs to keep coins in exchanges, know that this is a risk you must bare.The new face of nicehash.com, following the loss of $8.9 million of its\u00a0usersLuckily, there\u2019s a very easy fix to all of these problems:Move your bitcoins to a wallet that you control the private keys to. In particular, ensure that the wallet you use generates a 12\u201324 word mnemonic seed that easily lets you back up and restore your wallet.Short of you compromising your private key/seed by exposing it to malware or revealing it to a malicious actor, you can sleep well knowing your coins are safe.But there\u2019s a caveat. It\u2019s 2017 and Bitcoin has evolved, so you shouldn\u2019t use just any wallet.2. Use a SegWit wallet (and exchanges)If you didn\u2019t know, Bitcoin\u2019s growing. Its growing fast. Faster than almost anything we\u2019ve seen. As a result, its network effect has hit a wall due to the existing transaction limit of approximately 7 transactions per second, or approximately 2,000 transactions per 10 minute block. Transaction fees have risen at a similarly insane amount, as more and more people are competing for their transactions to confirm.The average transaction fee at the moment is $26.52, source: bitinfocharts.comA preliminary fix to this problem was deployed six months ago called SegWit. SegWit is a fundamental protocol upgrade that decreases the virtual size of transactions and allows four times as many transactions to fit into a block.The full explanation of Bitcoin\u2019s transaction throughput problem and SegWit\u2019s technical functionality can be found in an in-depth article I\u2019ve written about it here.Because transaction fees are measured on a per-byte basis and SegWit transactions have a lower virtual byte-size, if you send a SegWit transaction using a SegWit wallet right now, you save 30%\u201340% on transaction fees instantly.Still not convinced about the advantages of SegWit?If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again.Lower fees for you and more transactions in blocks can happen right now. The code is sitting there on every upgraded Bitcoin node, waiting to be used.The problem is that SegWit is not being adopted by wallets, services, and ultimately users.SegWit adoption is dropping, down to 10%, source: segwit.partySegWit is an optional protocol upgrade that Bitcoin wallets and services are not obliged to implement, despite the benefit it provides to the network. It was deployed in such a way to prevent a hard fork (i.e. a section of the community potentially branching off). As long as there is no demand from their customers, these services see no incentive to spend the time and money to upgrade to SegWit.It is in your absolute best interest, that you, Bitcoin hodler, use a SegWit wallet.Because SegWit is a relatively low-level change and there is some confusion surrounding it, it needs to be said that there are absolutely no disadvantages to using SegWit wallets, only significant network upside and lots of savings on transaction fees.If your favourite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so. Then, start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit until favourite wallet does so.A great list of SegWit wallets can be found here. I will quickly list a few of the most prominent ones for your convenience. If you know of any that aren\u2019t mentioned, please comment below so I can add them to the list!Hardware WalletsIf you\u2019re concerned about security, these should be at the top of your listLedger Nano STREZORDigital BitboxDesktop WalletsElectrumArmoryiOS WalletsEdge (AirBitz rebranded)GreenAddressAndroid WalletsSamourai WalletGreenBitsElectrumIf your preferred wallet isn\u2019t on this list, make sure it uses SegWit. An easy way to identify a SegWit wallet (but not the only way) is to ensure receiving addresses start with a \u201cbc1\u201d.If your preferred wallet doesn\u2019t use SegWit, it would be in your best interest to use one that does. Remember, you\u2019re saving up to 40% on fees right away.By extension, you should also make an effort to use exchanges that incorporate SegWit. This means they use SegWit transactions to handle transaction volume on the exchange. Because exchanges conduct a lot of transactions, any exchange that uses SegWit greatly benefits the network health of Bitcoin.Thankfully, there are several exchanges that have incorporated SegWit, listed here. It should be noted Coinbase, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, still has not yet implemented SegWit. If your favourite exchange isn\u2019t using SegWit, do your part and contact them asking them to implement it.", "responses": "28"}, {"title": "Mathematical Proof That the Lightning Network Cannot Be a Decentralized Bitcoin Scaling\u00a0Solution", "author_name": "Jonald Fyookball", "link": "https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 26, 2017", "readtime": "15 min read", "upvotes": "6.3K", "content": "Mathematical Proof That the Lightning Network Cannot Be a Decentralized Bitcoin Scaling\u00a0SolutionJonald FyookballBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 26, 2017Have you heard of the Bitcoin Lightning Network? It is a proposal that claims that:\u201cusing a network of these micropayment channels, Bitcoin can scale to billions of transactions per\u00a0day\u201dWhat it doesn\u2019t tell you is that this can only be accomplished by using large, centralized \u201cbanking\u201d hubs.Many in the Bitcoin community mistakenly assumed or were led to believe that the Lightning Network (LN) would be a distributed peer-to-peer network.However, this is infeasible. In fact, even using a generous set of assumptions, we will prove it is mathematically impossible.We will divide this document into sections. Part one will be a brief general overview of the LN. Part two will explain in simple terms why it cannot provide decentralized scaling. Part three will be a more rigorous mathematical proof.PART I: OVERVIEW OF LIGHTNING NETWORKThe Bitcoin Scaling\u00a0DebateBitcoin was originally designed as peer to peer cash that would scale with simple blocksize increases. However, the discussion over how to scale the network has become a lot more complicated and controversial.57 Bitcoin \u201cCore\u201d developers have signed their support to an official Capacity Increase Roadmap that advocates the Lightning Network as a \u201cnon-bandwidth scaling mechanism\u201d that may provide \u201cvery high decentralization\u201d.We disagree and will prove it does not. After reading and understanding the information here, we recommend you draw your own conclusions.What is the Lightning Network and How Does it\u00a0Work?Lightning Network (LN) is a protocol allowing for a series of off-chain bidirectional payment channels. Here is an excellent 3 part series by Aaron van Wirdum, if you would like to understand the technicalities.\u201cBidirectional\u201d simply means two directions, so Alice and Bob could open up a private channel and send bitcoins back and forth (outside of the blockchain):In order to open the channel, one or both parties have to deposit bitcoins into a special Bitcoin address.\u00b9 After that, they can do as many transactions as they want inside the channel, until either of them decide to close it, which settles (pays out the appropriate final balances) on the main Bitcoin blockchain.Linking Multiple\u00a0ChannelsGoing one step farther, if Alice had a channel with Bob, and Bob also had a channel with Carol, then Alice could indirectly send money to Carol: Bob would first pay Carol, and then Alice would reimburse Bob.The Envisioned NetworkLN evangelists promote the idea that if Alice can pay Carol through Bob, we should be able to keep extending this idea to build an entire network of payment channels, thus allowing a large percentage of transactions to occur off-chain.However, this cannot be realistically accomplished as a peer-to-peer network, at least not one of any significant size.\u201cDecentralized\u201d Vs \u201cDistributed\u201d SemanticsIn everyday talk about Bitcoin, most people say \u201cdecentralized\u201d to mean what is technically a \u201cdistributed topology\u201d.Conversely, a network with centralized hubs can technically be called \u201cdecentralized\u201d if it doesn\u2019t have a singular center.But let\u2019s not get caught up in word games. The diagram\u00b2 below should clear things up:PART II: AN EXPLANATION FOR THE LAYMAN: WHY THE LIGHTNING NETWORK CANNOT\u00a0SCALEI\u2019ll make this explanation as short as I can.First, you must understand that the Lightning Network is not like other networks in that you cannot simply connect to another user whenever you want.To send or receive bitcoins, you need either a payment channel with that specific user, or a linked series of payment channels (a \u201croute\u201d).It\u2019s pointless to create a payment channel for the sole purpose of sending an off-chain transaction, since it requires an on-chain transaction to open the channel (and another one to close). You might as well just send an on-chain transaction instead; you don\u2019t need the LN.The idea is that you\u2019re supposed to be able to route your payment to any destination through a series of connections. From the viewpoint of a user, the potential path to anyone else looks like a tree structure:It Starts Off Like a Basic Math\u00a0ProblemWe\u2019re going to assume the goal is to scale to one million users.Let\u2019s think about this: If you have a tree with 10 branches, and each of those branches has 10 leaves, you can reach 100 leaves.And if you have a tree with 10 branches, and each has 10 sub-branches, and each of those in turn has 10 sub-branches\u00a0, etc\u2026 you can go 6 levels \u201cdeep\u201d and get: 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10, or simply: 10\u2076, which equals one million.Since you have to hop from branch to branch 6 times to reach the leaf, we can say we have \u201c6 hops\u201d. So that\u2019s 10 branches with 6 hops, or in our case: 10 channels with 6 hops.So, what\u2019s the challenge?Your Money Can\u2019t Be In Two Places At the Same\u00a0TimeIf we assume we need 10 payment channels to reach the entire network in 6 hops, that means you\u2019d have to divide up your bitcoins into 10 parts.But, probably only one of these channels will reach the intended recipient at any given time. That means you\u2019ll only be able to send part of your money, for example 10%.Could we get around this by just having 2 channels and, say 20 hops? We\u2019ll come back to this question. First, let\u2019s understand another important fact:Everyone is Lending to Everyone\u00a0ElseImagine Alice wants to send 1 BTC to Carol through Bob like so: Alice->Bob->CarolIn order to route the money, Bob has to have at least 1 BTC in his \u201cbalance\u201d in the channel with Carol. Essentially, Alice is borrowing from Bob to pay Carol.Bob transfers his 1 BTC to Carol in the [Bob->Carol] channel, and Alice transfers 1 BTC to Bob in the [Alice->Bob] channel. That\u2019s how it works\u200a\u2014\u200aAlice cannot \u201cgive\u201d the 1 BTC to Bob to then pass along to Carol.It really is a loan because the network uses timelocks to eliminate custodial risk: Alice can\u2019t repay Bob safely until she\u2019s sure Bob has paid Carol.In fact, EVERY hop en route to a destination must have the funds available for each transaction. So, the more hops that are used, the more this lending burden is multiplied.Why is this a big deal?It Means a Large Number of Hops is a Deal-BreakerLet\u2019s say that everyone was using routes with 20 hops, and most users spent about $1000/month. If everyone did their fair share to help route payments, each user would need to route $20,000/month.Would that even be possible?It depends on many factors including: the amount of time required for a route and the number of transactions.Even if we make a (possibly generous) assumption that a user can route 20 times his normal transaction load and only suffer a reduction of 50% in the availability of his channels, then he would need double the number of channels he normally would have.In Reality, It\u2019s Even\u00a0WorseThere\u2019s at least 5 additional problems which worsen the situation.Even the basic math we started with: 10\u2076=1,000,000 isn\u2019t quite applicable. If we assume peers form mostly random connections without a central authority to plan routes, then there\u2019s a certain probability of success. A one-in-a-million chance, repeated a million times, only produces a 63% success rate. Choosing 2 million times improves this to 84%, which would mean increasing the number of channels.\u00b3As users spend their income, available routes degrade, until the time that more funds are deposited. In other words, when a person receives a salary payment and deposits funds in the network, their channels are at a maximum, with full routing power. But as their money is spent, this power drops toward zero. Averaged out, this pattern cuts the routing power by about half, requiring double the number of channels.Routing funds for others disrupts an otherwise even distribution of funds, which also diminishes the number of usable channels.There is a large wealth disparity in any population. Therefore, the number of users that can route funds for any other random user is only a fraction of the network. And this problem is magnified exponentially with an increasing number of hops.There always exists a risk of a routing channel becoming unresponsive (either intentionally or unintentionally). This risk also grows exponentially with an increasing number of hops.The \u201cTLDR\u201d\u00a0SummaryTo reach anyone in a big network with a series of branching channel connections, you either need a large number of channels, or a large number of hops.Both are a huge problem. A large number of channels means users have to divide up their funds and can\u2019t do anything except tiny purchases. And a large number of hops means everyone\u2019s money will be tied up routing everybody else\u2019s money.Conclusion: A Completely Unworkable SystemAs the network reaches a million users, it seems there will be no realistic way to avoid these problems. Dividing funds into many channels and continually loaning out money both make the network unusable.The only conceivable visions are either A) everyone deposits MUCH much more than they need to transact with, or B) the system depends on large centralized hubs.Neither is a decentralized scaling solution, or even a major part of one.PART III: INFORMAL MATHEMATICAL PROOF1. AssumptionsModeling a theoretical network that does not actually exist, of a large group of diverse people, is obviously impossible to do precisely. We acknowledge making a number of assumptions, some stated, some implicit, and some generous to critics of this proof.Within this context, we aim to demonstrate, through probability calculations, that a large number of open payment channels will be required for each user, thus making the system essentially inoperable at a size of 1,000,000 users.2. Channels and Hops Required, with No ConstraintsModeling the network as a complex graph of 1,000,000 nodes, we shall examine the probability of reaching a random peer given a certain number of open channels, C, and allowing for a certain number of hops, H.From the perspective of a user, reaching distant peers through a series of branching channels is similar to tree structure.\u2074 The number of leafs grow exponentially and are possible transaction destinations.To simplify the calculations, we will ignore the possibility that a branch on the tree could link to another branch already on the tree (such as an ancestor or cousin).This possibility happening would reduce the number of peers found from a purely exponential branching to a slightly lower number. Since we are attempting to prove that a relatively low number of peers would be reached without a large number of channels or hops, and the real number would be even lower, this is a generous assumption (strengthening the proof).Let n be the number of leafs, defined as C^H. For example, 10 open channels and 6 hops is 10\u2076 = 1,000,000.The probability P for failing to choosing a member of a set |N| with cardinality n by sampling n times, with replacement is:(In our case, obtaining a desired destination by matching to a leaf.)We can generalize this with the limiting form:Since 1/e = 0.3678\u2026 then the probability of choosing correctly at least once is (1- (1/e)) = 63.21\u2026%Having access to any given peer at a rate of only 63.21% is too low to be considered successful for a payment system.Using a different number of trials can be expressed as:For example:By taking various exponents of e, we can calculate the corresponding probabilities:Using a value of 1,000,000 users and the limiting form, we derive the formula:Using this formula, we can calculate some initial values reaching at least the 80% probability level; however this is not considering other factors not yet discussed:13. Channels and Hops Required, with a Basic Money ConstraintAll hops along the route must have sufficient funds to process any payment they wish to service. This is the money constraint.Modeling a network of a million users with a wide variety of financial profiles and spending patterns isn\u2019t possible to do precisely because there are too many unknown factors.However, we can make a very general common-sense assumption that many or most users will receive some kind of income at some kind of regular interval, and deposit an allowance of funds into the LN for spending.Deposited funds will generally be either spent or eventually withdrawn. (We will assume LN is not used as a savings vehicle)As users spend funds, payment channel availability for routing will degrade, either because a channel closes, or because the funded amount diminishes. When additional funds are deposited, the routing capabilities are revitalized.We do not have a detailed model of which and how many users are getting paid how much, when, and how often. However, we can aggregate the behavior of the set of users thanks to the law of large numbers, which states that \u201c the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value\u201d.The typical consumer cycles consist of receiving income, spending it, and then repeating. We can generalize this behavior as a reverse sawtooth wave:Visually, it appears as:Salary payments are represented by spikes, and income is then spent gradually until the next payment.Integrating the function gives half the value of the period, as expected:This is also apparent visually as the waves form right triangles cutting out half the area.The implication is that about half the channels that would be used for routing are invalid. Thus, the number of channels at each hop needs to be doubled.Our probability formula changes to:And our table of results becomes:There is also a huge generous assumption we are making, which is that all users are a useful part of set of routing participants for all other users. In reality, a vastly uneven distribution of wealth would likely put additional and significant constraints on the system.4. Additional Constraint of\u00a0LendingIn addition to the burdens of dividing funds and finding routes, we assume that the user also participates in the network by helping others route payments.This disrupts the user in two ways.First, it may cause the distribution of the user\u2019s personal funds to become unbalanced, diminishing the number of routes available. Over time, this could theoretically average out with money flowing in either direction of any given channel. However, each user would be subject to a large degree of variance at any given time.The second is that the money used in routing others\u2019 payments is unavailable to the user during the time that the route is in use.We shall generously ignore the first cause of disruption and only attempt to model the second. We\u2019ll take the simplistic approach of assuming all users have the same average number of transactions and spending volume, and assume each user participates equally in the routing.Let us define the following variables:U: the number of usersH: the number of hopsV: the total network transaction volume during a period of timev: the transaction volume per user during a period of time\u00a0r: the total routed volume per user during a period of time\u00a0D: the duration in hours of a time period of measurementt: average number of transactions per user for time period Dd: the duration in hours of the average routeSince each hop needs to route the entire transaction amount for any transaction in a route that it participates in, the total routed volume for the entire network during a period of time = VH.Thus, r= VH/U. And since V/U=v, r=Hv.For example, if v=$1000, the plot appears as:Let us introduce the concept of dollar-hours to measure routing capacity.Each user can only spend their own money once, of course. But for purposes of routing others\u2019 money, we can think of dollar-hours as the total dollars in their channels, multiplied by the number of hours they available. For example, $1000 sitting unmoved for a week is 168,000 dollar-hours.We can then calculate a quotient Q, which represents the percentage of available capacity remaining after routing for others:Q = 1- (d(H-1))/DNote that v and t do not appear in the equation as they are factored out, but they are implicit in the ratio d/D. The reason for H-1 is that one hop doesn\u2019t cost the network anything beyond a user\u2019s own transactions (r=Hv).For example, if the network uses 4 hops, and routes require 4 hours, and the user\u2019s balances for routing are based on 168 hours (1 week), then:Q=1- ((4)*(3))/168 ) = 0.92Our probability formula is now:Assuming D=168, and routing time d = 4 hours, we arrive at the following probabilities:5. Determining Transaction Limitations Based on a Pareto DistributionIt hardly seems necessary to prove that if funds need to be split into small buckets, there would be an enormous negative effect on usability. However, for completeness, we included this section.We assume most consumer and business spending follows a Pareto distribution in that each user makes a relatively small number of large transactions, several medium-sized transactions, and a larger amount of smaller transactions.The Pareto probability density function is expressed as:For the simplest type 1 Pareto curve, this simplifies to:The distribution does not change by applying constants, but we can better envision the model with some real world values by multiplying the y-values by 1000, so that dollar amounts for big items become substantial, and integrate over a typical set of x values (number of transactions at each dollar value), say 50.The total sum of transactions = $980. Using a 10% value of $98,\u00a0we can solve the equation: 98 = 1000/x\u00b2 to obtain 3.194 transactions.Next, we will integrate over the smaller set of transactions to obtain the sum value of the transactions that have amounts that less than the our minimum $98 value:Since 293.48/980=.299, we can say that only 29.9% of all desired economic activity would be possible if 10 channels were used.Final ThoughtsI expect critics to nitpick. I encourage you to do your own critical thinking. Do not forget the generous assumptions we have made to ignore wealth disparity.Remember, Bitcoin must be decentralized. Be wary of the rationalization of \u201cCentralization is ok as long as the base layer is kept decentralized.\u201d That is an insidious trap which allows forcing users off the base layer and into the centralized systems. We must never allow that.So, is Bitcoin in trouble because second layer solutions may not work? No, not at all. Bitcoin was designed to scale on-chain with simple blocksize increases. It can and will do so, if we allow it.AddendumI published a short follow-up addressing some misunderstandings and objections.Update June 7,\u00a02018The predictions of this article are now being proven correct as we are already seeing the network form into centralized hubs.

We expect this to be a vibrant and innovative community.When a digital currency forks, it creates a new digital asset. Adding new digital assets to Coinbase must be approached with caution. Not every asset is immediately safe to add to Coinbase from a technical stability, security, or compliance point of view.Our top priority is the safety of customer funds and we spend extensive time designing, building, testing and auditing our systems to ensure that the digital assets we support remain safe and secure. We may not always be first in adding an asset, but if we do, you can be sure that we\u2019ve invested significant time and care into supporting it securely. We believe this is the best approach for us to maintain customer trust.In the case of bitcoin cash, we made clear to our customers that we did not feel we could safely support it on the day it was launched. For customers who wanted immediate access to their bitcoin cash, we advised them to withdraw their bitcoin from the Coinbase platform. However, there are several points we want to make clear for our customers:Both bitcoin and bitcoin cash remain safely stored on Coinbase.Customers with balances of bitcoin at the time of the fork now have an equal quantity of bitcoin cash stored by Coinbase.We operate by the general principle that our customers should benefit to the greatest extent possible from hard forks or other unexpected events.Over the last several days, we\u2019ve examined all of the relevant issues and have decided to work on adding support for bitcoin cash for Coinbase customers. We made this decision based on factors such as the security of the network, customer demand, trading volumes, and regulatory considerations.We are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.Once supported, customers will be able to withdraw bitcoin cash. We\u2019ll make a determination at a later date about adding trading support.

I had begged for the job and I wasn\u2019t qualified but they gave it to me anyway because my boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss was a fan of chess and he accidentally saw me playing in the park after I failed the interview.My job was to get HBO streaming interactively on cable lines. Don\u2019t ask.I said to my boss, \u201cThe technology to do this is already done. It\u2019s called the web. Why do I have to invent an entire new way to stream content?\u201dHe said, \u201cJames. Calm down. The cable guys know what they are doing. This Internet thing is popular with academics but is just a fad.\u201dAnd that was that.A) CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE NOT A FADCryptocurrencies benefit from two 5000 year old trends.1) Theism ==> Humanism ==> Dataism in every industry. For instance, 2000 years ago if you got ill, you assumed you had sinned, or you would pray to get better, or you would assume a god was punishing you. 20 years ago, you\u2019d go to a doctor and take two aspirin. And now, you get EEGs, fMRIs, genetic testing, etc to diagnose and determine best solution.Money is \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d ==> Benjamin Franklin we trust ==> Cryptocurrencies (we trust data)2) Barter ==> Physical store of value (gold, silver, etc) ==> Money backed by metal ==> Paper money ==> Bank money ==> Pure data money (cryptos)These trends are not going away. They solve massive problems created by the scenario before them and crypto is front and center for both of these 5000 year old trends.B) CRYPTO CURRENCIES ARE NOT CRYPTOI hate the word \u201ccrypto\u201d.If someone asks me, \u201cWhat is Amazon?\u201d I would answer, \u201cA store\u201d.I wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s a software application that sits on top of the TCP/IP protocol.\u201d Nobody would say that. But, in fact, that\u2019s a valid way to describe what Amazon.com is.\u201cCrypto\u201d refers to the aspect of Bitcoin that makes it secure. It uses a branch of math called \u201cpublic key cryptography\u201d. But knowing this provides basically zero value in understanding of cryptocurrencies other than it is secure in a way confirmed by mathematicians.Better to call it \u201cdata currencies\u201d or simply \u201ccurrencies\u201d.BUT\u2026C) CRYPTO CURRENCIES ARE NOT CURRENCIESA currency is two things:\u2013 a store of value: e.g. One can say, \u201cI have $1,000,000\u201d. That\u2019s a number stored in the bank. It\u2019s the value of net worth the person saying it has.\u2013 a transaction mechanism. e.g. with $1 I can go into a deli and buy a cup of coffee.Bitcoin is the first but not the second (unless you want to wait ten minutes every time you buy a cup of coffee).And many other crypto-currencies are the second and not necessarily the first.And some are both and THEN\u2026they are more.See below.Editor\u2019s Note: James is Giving away a Bitcoin, worth more than $4,000, completely free. Click Here to Enter.D) CRYPTO CURRENCIES ARE CONTRACTS AND WILL EVENTUALLY REPLACE ALL CONTRACT LAWThe rise of ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) are because you can program functionality similar to contracts into a coin.For instance, a coin called \u201cFilecoin\u201d has an implicit contract that whoever owns a file coin is also allowing (by the contract embedded in the coin) that people can share files on that coin. It creates a decentralized dropbox.Cryptocurrencies can be used now to replace escrows, wills, and many other types of basic contracts. The entire field of contract law is a $400 billion market or more and will be completely replaced (and lead to the rise of) by legitimate cryptocurrencies.E) 95% of CRYPTO CURRENCIES ARE SCAMS OR WILL GO TO ZEROLike any field that is \u201chot\u201d the scammers have arrived. Ponzi schemes. Fake currencies. hacked exchanges, etc.But, like in every field of life, this will get regulated, criminals will get caught, and the legitimate coins will thrive. This is exactly like the Internet in the late 90s. You didn\u2019t want to avoid the Internet then because of the enormous gains. But you did want to avoid the scams.F) THE US GOVERNMENT SECRETLY LOVES CRYPTO CURRENCIESHow else will they transport millions of dollar into war-torn countries to pay off war lords and terrorists. If you think this is conspiracy theory, think again.G) CRYPTO CURRENCIES ARE NOT \u201cFIAT\u201d.There is explicit value backing a crypto currency, unlike a dollar bill, or even a bar of gold (which gold bugs will hate to hear).A dollar bill has value because we believe it does and we trust that the US government will take care of the value of the dollar by not printing too many of them.A piece of gold has value because for years we have used gold and other precious metals as money. They also have value because you have to work to mine a piece of gold and there is only a limited amount of gold in the world.But there are a limited number of any rocks in the world so this is not special.Cryptocurrencies actually solve enormous problems that have a definite value associated with them.Editors Note: Click Here to Enter James\u2019s Contest to win a Free BitcoinH) JAMIE DIMON IS WRONG.

Most of the companies and exchanges are willing to support BitcoinABC hard fork only.The cornerstone of the fork was the proposal to implement a pre-consensus on the block size. It means that miners will be able to determine the next size of the block that will be mined. BitcoinABC, by the way, is interested in development of Atomic Swaps technology. However, nChain, owner of the BCH community called BitcoinSV (Satoshi Vision), is not interested in the block-size pre-consensus and will implement the block size equal to 128 MB. (Currently, BCH maximum block size = 32MB).It seems that the real reason of the conflict is the effort to control the network. Craig Wright from nChain said that there will be a \u201chash war\u201d between nChain and BitcoinABC for the ability to control the network. And the fork will be splitted in two different chains: BCHABC and BCHSV.Fork in the crypto world means protocol changes that have no backward compatibility with the previous version. The whole blockchain will be copied and then set on the new rails working on the new network rules. As of November 15, the BCH hard fork means the BCH accounts will receive the same amount of crypto on their BCHABC and BCHSV addresses.The reason to make fork is to add some fixes/changes to the initial Bitcoin Cash Protocol. They can\u2019t be adopted without hard fork.How to protect your BCH during the hard\u00a0fork?Bitcoin Cash Core are not protected from auto replay attacks and if you move funds in the day of the work they can be transferred on the other chain. (For example you want to send BCHABC to the other address, and they can be transferred to the BCHSV address, as well); Be careful, wait till the split of the blockchains will end up. Then you will be able to manage your BCH comfortably. Or you can exchange your BCH to the other currencies and then come back to manage it.Where to store\u00a0BCH?Store Bitcoin Cash in Atomic Wallet.

Bitcoin has lasted 9 years. Bitcoin has a $100B+ market cap. Bitcoin has had better uptime than almost anything else and has spawned a pretty large ecosystem of businesses, open source projects and investors. Perhaps most tellingly, Bitcoin has also spawned a large number of imitators that compete against it.What\u2019s not obvious is why Bitcoin works or has value in the first place. We know that Bitcoin has value, but what gives Bitcoin value? We know that Bitcoin acts like money but why does it act like money? We know the mechanics of how Bitcoin works, but why does Bitcoin work?These questions and more are answered in Saifedean Ammous\u2019s new book The Bitcoin Standard. In this article, I\u2019m not going to review the book exactly, but explore some of the powerful ideas that are presented in the book as a way to answer why Bitcoin works.As far as what I thought of the book, it\u2019s very entertaining, and the book is worth buying just for the history of money alone. The thoroughly researched and logical explanations of what makes money useful were very insightful and the second and third order effects of monetary policy were well explained. This book is joining the select books that I reread every couple of years such as Taleb\u2019s Antifragile.If you don\u2019t like spoilers, please stop here, read the book and come back. If you like reading about my take on some of the ideas as a way to evaluate whether you should read the book or not, please continue. With that out of the way, let\u2019s take a look at some of the really powerful ideas from the book itself.Inflation Factors in Heavily into Time PreferenceTime preferences are critical to how a society functions. A high time preference person wants things now or as soon as possible. A low time preference person is willing to forego things now for something better later.A bunch of high time preference people will not think very much about the future. Instead of saving for tomorrow, they\u2019ll spend now, consume and not be very productive. They won\u2019t be saving for tomorrow, starting businesses or building large scale projects as they all require a lot of planning.As they say, Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. Building civilization with all the systems and large capital projects require lots of people that have a low time preference.Saifedean argues in the book that monetary policy affects the time preferences of the population quite a bit. High inflation, or quick reduction of purchasing power of money causes people to have a high time preference. This is evident in hyperinflating economies as people in such countries spend their money as quickly as possible.What\u2019s even more intriguing is the idea that high time preferences bleed into other areas of life. Obesity and type 2 diabetes, for example, are caused by over-consumption of unhealthy food, which is indicative of a high time preference. A society that has a looser monetary policy would expect to see more obese people if this were true. Indeed, obesity has tripled worldwide in the last 40 years. Correlation is not causation, obviously, but this is worth investigating.With Bitcoin, you have an iron-clad monetary policy. All inflation is expected and the supply is capped at 21 million. The behavior we would expect out of the people that own Bitcoin is that of people with a low time preference given the low inflation. At least anecdotally, this seems to be the case as most people start caring more about their saving a lot more once they get into Bitcoin. It\u2019s hard to tell which is the cause and which is the effect, but we can say that this is very much correlated.Bitcoin holders have a low time preference and that causes them to make Bitcoin more scarce. This, in effect makes Bitcoin more valuable and more desirable, causing even more people, especially those with low time preference, to hold Bitcoin. This is a virtuous cycle that has caused Bitcoin\u2019s value to go up in the past 9 years.Effort Will Always Go Into Increasing Money\u00a0SupplyOne of the most enjoyable parts of the book is the discussion of the various mediums that were used as money in the past. These include wampums, rai stones and of course, precious metals. What killed most previous mediums as money is technology. Specifically, people figured out a way to produce a lot of the same medium, inflating the supply to no longer make the medium scarce.Expending effort creating money, granted it costs less than the actual value of the money itself, makes all the sense in the world. The money medium has value so getting more of it for less than its value is a no-brainer. What\u2019s more, these don\u2019t actually add to the productive capacity of an economy. Adding to the supply of money doesn\u2019t actually help anything, just redistributes the wealth to those creating more of the supply from those that save.What\u2019s less understood is how much goes into creating more money supply in a fiat economy. Saifedean argues that a large part of the banking sector is essentially engaged in money creation activities. Given that banking takes up 7\u201310% of GDP in the US, you can see that this is an enormous redistribution of wealth that doesn\u2019t add productivity.Bitcoin\u2019s equivalent, of course, is proof-of-work mining. What\u2019s interesting about Bitcoin\u2019s creating more money supply is that it\u2019s got a secondary function. The act of creating more money in Bitcoin also adds to its security through proof-of-work. In a sense, creating more money supply in Bitcoin is not wasted like it is in any other monetary system. The redistribution of wealth is earned as adding security to the network has value. In a sense, the entire network is paying miners to add security. Eventually, it will only be the transactors paying miners to add security.Furthermore, this observation also makes clear the inferiority of proof-of-stake. Effort will be expended to create more money supply, we just don\u2019t know what form that will take as the work has no proof that it was done. Furthermore, that effort will not add security to the network in any way and the work really will be wasted.Fiat Money is Not\u00a0YoursOne of the most eye opening parts of the book is the discussion of what happened in WWI. What started as a small war between Serbian separatists and the Austro-Hungarian empire became a global war that exhausted the coffers of nearly every country involved in the war. The difference between this and previous wars was the presence of central banking.Specifically, fiat money allows central banks to inflate currency and that essentially takes value away from the owners of the currency without their consent. Instead of spending only the money the government has, fiat money allows the government to seize value from all owners of the money through inflation.Inflation is not the only way fiat money can be seized. Since most money is not in cash, seizing the money held in bank accounts is another popular way for the government to confiscate money. AML/KYC laws around financial institutions are a way to closely monitor cash traffic to seize money from people the government does not approve of. The quick and slippery slope to tyranny starting from terrorists to marijuana dispensaries to pornographers to political opponents is an exercise left to the reader.What\u2019s very different about Bitcoin is that the money is not controlled by a central party. Bitcoin is unseizable and requires the private key(s) to confiscate. This is not only different from fiat, but also from many altcoins. Tether has marked certain coins unredeemable. Ethereum has seized coins from people it deems \u201chackers\u201d.Sound Money Allows for\u00a0PlanningThere are a lot of reasons why sound money is important for society, but the biggest one that I learned from the book is that sound money allows people to plan effectively. Fiat money is generally pretty good at being divisible or transmitting across large distances (exceptions being foreign remittances or micropayments). What fiat money is not good at is being able to store value for the future (In the book, this concept is called salability across scales, distance and time).Sound money allows for savings and savings allows for capital accumulation. When sufficient capital has been accumulated, that can be utilized to create larger-scale projects to make production more efficient. The example in the book is that of a fisherman using bare hands vs using savings to buy a fishing rod and nets. The latter is more efficient and allows for more production.The sharp reader may be wondering why you wouldn\u2019t just fund that centrally and get the same benefits. Indeed, that\u2019s mostly what government expenditures try to do. Unfortunately, the decisions on what to invest in then come down to government bureaucrats who don\u2019t have the financial incentive nor the expertise to determine what to invest in. The result is lots of malinvestment or waste. Think corporate welfare, bridges to nowhere or green energy boondoggles.Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, have a huge financial incentive (especially loss aversion) and expertise to invest in that which has a higher probability of success. Furthermore, the successful entrepreneurs get more reward allowing them to invest more in large capital projects creating better and better investments with time.ConclusionBitcoin\u2019s main benefit to society can be understood as bringing back sound money. Sound money allows for capital accumulation which allows for investment, leading to better goods and services for less effort. This, in turn, benefits all of civilization. We\u2019re not there yet, but this is the main value proposition.Contrast this to our society which is based on fiat money and you can see the difference. Instead of a large number of rent seekers, we instead get entrepreneurs. Instead of people playing zero sum games, we get innovations that add to the pie.In short, Bitcoin works because Bitcoin is sound money. And sound money changes everything. Bitcoin will change the role of government, how people relate to one another, how people will perceive the future, how everyone will plan, etc. Bitcoin is nothing less than a complete upheaval of the current fiat system with large second and third order effects that incentivize building instead of rent-seeking.Welcome to the revolution.", "responses": "32"}, {"title": "Bitcoin: we don\u2019t expect new highs in\u00a02018", "author_name": "Tuur Demeester", "link": "https://medium.com/@tuurdemeester/bitcoin-we-dont-expect-new-highs-in-2018-97e6a7a385f7?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 2, 2018", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "6.6K", "content": "Bitcoin: we don\u2019t expect new highs in\u00a02018Despite an already six month cool-off period, for 2018 we see more sideways and downside potential in the Bitcoin price due to sluggish retail demand, hesitation from institutions, and a current market cap that seems too high relative to on-chain activity.Tuur DemeesterBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 2, 2018Many investors and advisors are on record stating that $5,700 was the bottom in Bitcoin for this year, and that higher prices lie ahead. While we are very bullish on Bitcoin\u2019s long term prospects, we do heed caution for more short term price optimism.To find the starting point of the historic parabolic rally in Bitcoin that ended at $20,000 we have to go as far back as August 2015, when Bitcoin traded at below $200. This past rally was a stupendous, historic move. Even in secular bull markets, the collective of economic actors need time to absorb the information embedded in its characteristic high volume rallies.As I\u2019ve indicated in my 2018 outlook, I think chances are high for this year to be remembered as a shakeout year: a lemon market in altcoins, regulators catching up, and infrastructure growing pains.Let\u2019s look at some data.Since January, the Bitcoin mining hashrate (aggregate computations per second made to secure the network ) has tripled, which means that a huge amount of new or more efficient mining rigs have come online. In combination with declining prices, this means that miners who weren\u2019t able to upgrade their machines or find cheaper electricity have been faced with a steep decline in profitability, a 90% drop in 7 months (altcoins have faced similar or steeper declines). With profit margins under heavy pressure, it\u2019s not unlikely that miners are and will stay responsible for a significant amount of selling in the market.Next, trading volumes are not dead, but still below those seen during last winter and spring. It\u2019s unclear how much of the recent pick-up in volumes are the result of a short squeeze and how much are coming from new long term buyers coming in.Aggregate Bitcoin trading volumes. Source: coinlib.io.After last year\u2019s FOMO, retail interest in Bitcoin has now become very sluggish:A Gallup poll conducted three months ago suggested that less than 0.5% of US investors \u201cwill probably buy Bitcoin in the near future\u201d.Despite transaction fees and volatility having dropped strongly, merchants are seeing +50% lower Bitcoin revenues compared to last fall.Google searches are not suggestive of a quick retail fueled recovery either:Next, here\u2019s some comments we\u2019ve gathered from Bitcoin analysts, market makers, and Wall Street insiders:The first Bitcoin ETF will likely not be approved before 2019. So any anticipation of approval by September will likely be met by disappointment.While institutional investors are certainly getting involved in Bitcoin, the vast majority of the firms are trading firms who are looking to make markets regardless of price: they\u2019re just as happy to take on short positions as they are to go long. Institutions who are known to be long biased, such as mutual funds and pension funds are not ready to invest because they\u2019re not yet comfortable with the available custody solutions.There\u2019s also the NVM Ratio, which is designed to reflect early stage adoption, now suggesting that there\u2019s now too little on-chain activity to justify Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap:The assumption here is that Bitcoin\u2019s market value is mostly derived from it being a network that connects users around the world: the more people and entities use the Bitcoin blockchain to settle transactions, the more it acquires the liquidity and utility that we\u2019d expect from digital gold. The NVM ratio approximates that by measuring daily active addresses on the blockchain.* Similar valuation models have been made for growth companies such as Facebook and Linkedin, where the number of monthly active users reasonably correlates with enterprise value.The related NVT ratio, which tries to measure if the daily dollar value of all Bitcoin transaction is relatively high or low versus the market cap, also suggests overvaluation.Finally, in the past few months we\u2019ve also seen a number of macro events that would appear to be bullish for Bitcoin as a safe haven: the North Korea debacle, a spike in volatility, Chinese stocks breaking down, etc. However, these shocks didn\u2019t move the meter for Bitcoin.All this being said, lower Bitcoin prices ahead are not a foregone conclusion:Bitcoin price has already come down by 62% since December.Since March, the Chinese Yuan has dropped by 8% against the dollar. If this slide continues, Chinese capital could flee into Bitcoin.Bitcoin dominance is gaining ground, which we think indicates the market\u2019s slow realization that there\u2019s a large moat around the Bitcoin ecosystem now which will make it hard to dislodge.The 2015\u2013\u201917 rally was historic but not entirely unique for this ecosystem: between late 2011 and April 2013, the Bitcoin price multiplied by 100x, and, after a 6 month correction, it multiplied again by 10x.Value investors are already anticipating the May 2020 block reward halving, which will cut down Bitcoin\u2019s annual supply inflation from 3.7% to only 1.79%.A Bitcoin ETF approval, even if it\u2019s delayed, would be a huge deal because it makes the asset extremely accessible for the retail investor. After the first gold ETF went live in 2004, the gold price rallied by 350% (and it\u2019s still 200% higher today). The 2017 rally has also set in motion a flurry of corporate activity on the Bitcoin infrastructure side, and the promise of established banks, brokers, payment processors, and security providers offering their own solution suites is catching the attention of value investors.ConclusionWe think the market likely needs more time to absorb the recent 30 month rally, which could produce lower prices. We don\u2019t foresee new all time highs in Bitcoin for 2018, and unless data starts suggesting differently, we are expecting mostly sideways or lower price action.*There are several objections one could raise against the NVM Ratio: it doesn\u2019t take into account transaction amounts nor the difference between old an new addresses, it doesn\u2019t discount spam attacks, it doesn\u2019t acknowledge limitations to the block size, and neither does it consider institutions coming into the market who build derivatives on Bitcoin that rely on a small amount of high value cold storage addresses. More work is needed to refine valuation models. That said, even though Bitcoin\u2019s core value proposition is store of value, we do think we\u2019re still in the early adoption phase, and hence using a valuation metric that reflects this adoption makes sense to us. In that context, we think the NVM\u2019s on-chain activity based valuation method has merit.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

We\u2019re going to dissect that beast and you\u2019ll know everything you need to and more before the end of this article to start trading like a pro. If you want to jump right to the dissection, go to Step 2\u2019s Dissecting the Interface subsection.Join the PoolDay Crypto Chat CommunitySad that no one around you talks about crypto enough? Join our channel and chat about crypto 24/7.discord.ggIn this tutorial, I\u2019m going to introduce you to the basics of cryptocurrency trading and how to get into coins like Ripple. Just like in those For Dummies books, I\u2019ll have highlights throughout the tutorial that give you some insight that I learned through hands-on experience:PRO TIPs\u200a\u2014\u200asome things that you should know if you don\u2019t alreadyDISCLAIMER\u200a\u2014\u200aclarifications so that things don\u2019t catch you off-guardThings you\u2019ll need if you want to follow along with this walkthrough:Coinbase AccountBinance AccountPassport/Photo ID to activate your Coinbase AccountMy tutorial is broken into four steps:Step 1 focuses on getting set up on Coinbase/GDAX and how to buy your starting cryptocurrency.Step 2 focuses on the exchange interface and maps out everything you need to know to start trading like a pro.Step 3 takes it a step further and brings you into a world of other exchanges, where you can start purchasing other cryptocurrencies like Ripple, Cardano, Verge, etc.Step 4 talks about good practices for safe-keeping and mitigating your risk of being hacked. I talk about the common scams/hacks to watch out for, and the different options for safe-keeping your items.If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments or DM me on Twitter\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m probably much more responsive on Twitter, although I think I have a responsive track record here, too.Step 1: Buying Your First Bitcoin/Ethereum/Litecoin/Bitcoin CashPRO TIP: You do NOT need to buy a WHOLE bitcoin/ethereum/litecoin/bitcoin cash, unlike in the stock market. You can own fractions of a cryptocurrency.Coinbase interface is much simpler to use than exchanges, but also comes with inflated prices and heavy\u00a0fees.There are many ways to get Bitcoin if you try hard enough, but the most straightforward way of getting it is by signing up on Coinbase to begin your purchase. While the fees on Coinbase are ridiculously high, right now it virtually monopolizes the market and is really one of the fastest ways to get your hands on cryptocurrency, so if you want to start trading immediately, Coinbase is one of the few options. An alternative is Gemini or BitStamp, but I recommend Coinbase because it has an exchange component to it, GDAX, which we\u2019ll get to soon.DISCLAIMER: Signing up on Coinbase, as well as many exchanges, will require you to identify yourself, and Coinbase will report your transactions to the IRS, so do yourself a favor and do not try to dodge taxes.If you want your cryptocurrency right this instant, then you\u2019ll have to buy from Coinbase. If you can wait a bit for it, then I\u2019d recommend doing the following to avoid the heavy Coinbase fees:Do a direct deposit/wire transfer from your bank account.Wait for the deposit to arrive (usually 5\u20137 business days)Once the deposit arrives, go to gdax.com and buy your cryptocurrency from there.PRO TIP: I recommend trickling investments rather than investing all at once to mitigate risk, unless you\u2019re extremely confident. This means that, if you have $1,000 to spend, instead of putting it all in on one price, maybe put $250 in to begin with, wait a day or if you see a dip, and put in another $250, and it\u2019ll average itself out to a lower buy-in price. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a term for this. But I call it trickling. EDIT: It\u2019s called Dollar Cost Averaging, thanks Matt Dorn!Step 2: Get On an Exchange (AKA What is GDAX? What Are Exchanges?)GDAX is an exchange that is owned and operated by Coinbase. If you\u2019re looking to own any cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Bitcoin Cash, then you\u2019ll need to learn about exchanges. This means if you want Ripple, or Verge, or yes\u200a\u2014\u200aany other currency.If you\u2019ve never dealt with an exchange before, don\u2019t worry\u200a\u2014\u200athe interface looks intimidating, and different exchanges have different layouts, but they all show the same information.Dissecting the Exchange InterfaceUsing the GDAX exchange interface as our specimen, we will dissect it bit by bit so you can understand what you\u2019re looking at. Please note that because this a guide for understanding the exchange, I will not be diving into the specific trading strategies that can be executed employing various aspects of the exchange.Exchanges have different layouts but will all display the same informationMarket: you are viewing the information about BTC/USD right now (screenshot). You can choose to view different markets by selecting other options like ETH/USD, ETH/BTC (you can actually buy or sell Ethereum for Bitcoin and vice versa directly, rather than trading back to money and then buying the other coin. This saves an extra step and also avoids an additional transaction fee. You can do this for LTC, too, but not BCH, currently).Summary Information: View the latest information about pricing (Last trade price), price changes (24 hour price), and the amount of BTC that was exchanged on GDAX in the past 24 hours (24 hour volume).Sign In: You have to log in before you can trade! Once you log in, you\u2019ll see options to DEPOSIT and WITHDRAW your cryptocurrency or money. We\u2019ll get into that more later. DISCLAIMER: If you bought crypto or transferred funds through Coinbase, you\u2019ll still need to hit the DEPOSIT button to move your funds from Coinbase over to GDAX, even though they\u2019re owned by the same company. On your GDAX Interface, just click DEPOSIT, select the COINBASE ACCOUNT tab and you can choose what to deposit and how much to deposit. It\u2019s instant and free.Trading Controls: This is where your control nobs are. You use this section to make deposits, withdraws, place buy orders, sell orders, etc. We\u2019ll take a closer look at this in the next section.Order Book: It shows the sell orders(in orange) and buy orders (in green) currently listed. There are three columns of information: (1) market size tells you how big the order is (e.g., 6.1 means the order is for 6.1 BTC if we are looking at the BTC market), (2) price shows you the price of one bitcoin that the sell/buy is being executed for NOT the total price of the order and (3) my size shows if you have any orders in that price and if so, how large your BTC order is. For example, you may see a buy order for 1.6 BTC (1) that is asking for a price of $13,800 (2) per bitcoin, and 0.6 BTC of that total order is yours (3) because you put in a buy for it at that price. One other thing to note is the \u201cspread\u201d in the center, which indicates how far apart the buys and sells are; i.e., the difference between the sell and the buy. If the lowest sell is 15,000 and the highest buy is $14,950, then the spread would be $50.Candlestick Charts: in a nutshell, the candlestick charts will tell you the prices that trades have been executed in the past; i.e., what were people buying and selling for a minute/hour/day/month/year ago? In trading, the candlestick charts are vital, so it\u2019s very important to know what they are saying. I won\u2019t go into the topic of \u201creading between the lines\u201d of the charts and trying to make pricing predictions but I\u2019ll explain the basics of what it\u2019s saying in the section following this.Orderbook Visualization: a visual representation of the orderbook. It gives a much faster way of digesting orderbook information, and can be important for trading analysis.Current and Historical Orders: take a look at the current orders you have in place, or view the history of your past orders. For current orders, you can cancel them if you want to in this panel.Trade History: The most recent trades that just took place by other people and you (if you made any trades). If a trade is sold at the sell price, it is orange, and if a trade is sold at the buy price, it is green.Trading Controls and Candlestick ChartsOkay, I had to separate this because if I added images into my numerical list it would screw up the formatting and what-not.Trading ControlsPRO TIP: Check out Investopedia for more information Market Buys/Sells, Stop Losses, and Buy Limits.Buy/Sell: selecting between whether you want to buy more or sell what you have. This button doesn\u2019t execute the trade.Market Order: doesn\u2019t ask you for a price because it will buy however much you specify in Amount (5) at whatever price is the market price (the best sell price). If the current best sell price is not enough to fulfill your entire order, it\u2019ll get the next best one, too, and keep eating all the sells until your order is fulfilled. The advantage of this is that you will be guaranteed to get your order filled, but disadvantage is that it may not be the best price if it drops lower.Limit Order: Limit Orders are made to maximize your earnings. Limit orders will execute your order at a certain price. For Limit Buys, it will buy at the price you specify or lower; a good use case for this would be if you think the price will dip later, and so you want to get in at a better price than the market price. You\u2019d want to set a Limit Buy at the price you think it\u2019ll hit, and once the price dips to that amount your buy order will execute. A Limit Sell will sell your specified amount once the price hits your specified Limited Price or higher. For example, if BTC is at $13,000 but you think it\u2019ll get to $13,500 before dropping, you can set a Limit Sell at $13,500 and if it hits that price, it\u2019ll automatically sell for you. DISCLAIMER: there are situations where your full order may not execute. For example, if you want to sell 10 BTC at $13,500 but buyers only buy 5 BTC before the price drops back down to $13,000, you\u2019ll still have 5 BTC remaining, still waiting to be bought at $13,500.Stop Order: acting as an antithesis to Limit Orders, Stop Orders are designed to minimize your losses. Stop Buys means you will buy if a price becomes higher than a certain amount. For example, if BTC is currently $13,500 and you set a Stop Buy at $14,000, then if the price hits $14,000, your order will execute. Similarly, Stop Loss will sell at your specified price or lower. So if BTC is at $13,500 and you only want to sell it if it hits $13,000 (maybe that\u2019s when you think it\u2019ll really plummet and you want to reduce your losses) then you can set a Stop Loss to do this for you. The DISCLAIMER for Limit Orders (3) apply to Stop Orders, too.Amount: Specify the amount you want to sell/buyTotal: The total crypto or money you\u2019ll get in exchange for your sell or buyExecute: Hit this button and there\u2019s no turning back. There is no \u201care you sure\u201d it\u2019s going to execute. So be absolutely sure. DISCLAIMER: for Limit or Stop orders, you can always cancel them in the Current and Historical Orders panel as long as they\u2019re not executed yet.Candlestick ChartsChart Type: you can select between line or candlestick, but do yourself a favor and stick with the candlestick.Time Marker: choose the time interval you want to view. Some exchanges let you zoom in and out with your mouse, GDAX is not one of them.Overlay: adds in some technical analysis trendlines to make you feel like a pro, but I\u2019m not going to go through the added value of those trendlines right now.Candlesticks: the meat of, well, the candlestick charts. Each candlestick represents the timeframe you selected; so if your Time Marker (2) is set to 1h, then each stick is 1-hour of time. The body demarcates the \u2018Open\u2019 and \u2018Close\u2019 prices, while the shadows show the highest and lowest prices of that time frame (also, the difference between the green and red candles being that the opening and closing prices are reversed)\u200a\u2014\u200aedit by Bernard Pato. Orange bars mean that sells were heavier than buys during that hours, and greens mean that buys were heavier than sells in that hour. As you probably guessed by now, tons of sells lower the price and tons of buys increase the price, which is visualized in the example.Stats: when you hover your mouse over the candlesticks, the stats bar gives specifics about the candlestick so you don\u2019t have to eyeball things. NOTE: Stats on GDAX are only available for candlestick charts, not line graphs (see Chart Type (1)).Y-Axis (Time): Well, the time.X-Axis (Price): And\u2026 the price.Step 3: Buying More Altcoins, Withdraws, and\u00a0DepositsIn order to buy more altcoins beyond what\u2019s offered on GDAX, you\u2019ll have to explore the other exchanges. Because not all coins are available on one exchange, you\u2019ll have to figure out which exchanges have the coins you\u2019re interested in first. Check out coinmarketcap.com for that information.PRO TIP: Coinmarketcap.com should be your right-hand man. Bookmark it. Whenever you are looking at a new altcoin, check CoinMarketCap to see its price and what exchanges it\u2019s traded on.To make this process easier to follow, I\u2019ll be using Ripple as an example.Let\u2019s pretend I just heard about this coin called Ripple. It\u2019s been in the news a lot and now I want to know how I can purchase it. First, I\u2019ll go to coinmarketcap.com to look for Ripple.After I find it and click on Ripple (ticker symbol XRP), it takes me to a page like shown above. Now, on the Tabs, click Markets to see which exchanges sell Ripple. You\u2019ll see there are many to choose from.List of available exchanges that trade Ripple\u00a0(XRP)There\u2019s a lot of information on CoinMarketCap (CMC), but I\u2019ll save that dissection for a later article. For now, one thing to look through is the Pair column. This is important because you don\u2019t only have to look for an exchange, but also one that trades using cryptocurrencies or money you have. For example, I have USD, so I shouldn\u2019t be trading with Korean Won (KRW) on exchanges like Bithumb or Coinone. Instead, now I see some pairs with XRP/ETH, meaning I can buy Ripple (XRP) with Ethereum (ETH) on those exchanges. I decide to use Binance, so I have to head over the binance.com and create an account (although there\u2019s nothing wrong with using Bittrex, I use Bittrex and Binance as well as many other exchanges). DISCLAIMER: The Binance link has my referral code, and I will make an affiliate fee if you click on it and sign up through me; I\u2019d appreciate it if this guide helps you! https://www.binance.com/?ref=10373725WAIT\u200a\u2014\u200ayou might be wondering why I didn\u2019t go for the XRP/BTC pair. That\u2019s because I don\u2019t like transferring BTC, and you shouldn\u2019t either; out of all the coins you can transfer out of Coinbase, BTC has the slowest network speed and the most expensive transactions. Additionally, if you transfer LTC or BCH, you would have to then trade on the exchanges to buy BTC or ETH (this incurs a transaction fee) and then use that to buy XRP\u200a\u2014\u200awhy go through the extra step and pay an extra fee?PRO TIP: NEVER transfer Bitcoin out of Coinbase/GDAX to another exchange for trading purposes. Bitcoin can have very slow transaction speeds and high fees; instead, consider LTC, ETH or BCH. Personally, if I see the exchange I\u2019m trying to transfer to has a marketplace of coins that can be purchased with Ethereum, too, then I\u2019d prefer to transfer Ethereum. This helps me save some exchange fees because if I transfer LTC or BCH, then I\u2019d have to convert it back to BTC by buying it on the exchange.So now it comes time to withdraw my Ethereum to Binance. After I go into the ETH/USD or ETH/BTC or ETH/EUR market on GDAX, I can click the WITHDRAW button within the BALANCE panel. Something like this should pop up:PRO TIP: you\u2019ll see that mine has Two Factor Code in the box. I highly recommend you turn on two-factor authentication (2FA)using Google Authenticator. It is much more secure than 2FA using text messages or emails (text messages can be easily intercepted but I won\u2019t go into the details, and email passwords can be compromised). It will prevent any unwanted guests from accessing your account and withdrawing your money.Once you see the Withdraw Funds box pop up, I will click on ETH Address (or BTC/LTC/XRP address depending on what you are transferring out). So, what is an ETH Address? Without going into the details of blockchain, it\u2019s essentially my identifier. Every exchange will have a different ETH address for me (as well as different addresses for every other crypto), and I can generate one myself as well (which I won\u2019t go into in this discussion). By giving GDAX my Binance ETH address, GDAX will be able to send my Ethereum to the right place so that I can start trading on Binance.So how do I find my ETH address? Well, usually wallet address and information and stored under header tabs such as Wallet or Funds. For Binance, it\u2019s Funds => Deposits Withdraws on the top right:After clicking, it\u2019ll bring you into a screen that lays out all of the available cryptocurrencies on its exchange.On the far right, you\u2019ll see DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, and TRADE. If you click Trade, it will bring you to the exchange where you can make trades just like on GDAX (remember, the interface is different but the information it\u2019s trying to tell you is basically the same). If you click Withdraw, it will bring up a screen that asks for similar information that GDAX asked for. What we want to do is (1) find Ethereum, and (2) click Deposit.Once you click it, the ETH Deposit Address should show up. Copy that and paste it back into GDAX in the DESTINATION box like so:PRO TIP: Check and double check your address because if it\u2019s not correct, you will probably not receive your money. Once it\u2019s out of your hands, there\u2019s no way of finding out where it went. Also, Ethereum address will ALWAYS start with 0x. Makes it easier to check. There have been reports of viruses that will generate different withdraw addresses when you \u201cpaste\u201d so be sure you double check.After filling everything out and clicking Withdraw Funds, the withdraw process will begin. Ethereum is usually fair quick (under 10 minutes) but sometimes the network can be congested and it may take longer (I\u2019ve experienced times when I don\u2019t get mine for an hour). Once it arrives on Binance, you can start trading by clicking Exchange => Basic on the top left. PRO TIP: on Binance, Basic exchange is all you really need. Advanced just looks flashier and takes up much more of your computer\u2019s memory. It can get pretty laggy, and last thing you actually want is laggy trades. So just stick with Basic.Once you\u2019re in the exchange, look on the right panel to start browsing through the available currencies you can trade. If you click ETH and then type in XRP, the ticker symbol for Ripple, you can quickly bring up the XRP/ETH pair. Once you click it, that exchange will load for you to start trading.The Binance exchange will look a bit different from GDAX, but that\u2019s okay. Remember that it\u2019s the same information, just displayed a little differently.For Bittrex, we can see order books on the left instead of right. On the bottom, we can make our Limit, Market, or Stop orders (they call it Stop-Limit). Trade History is on the bottom right, and the Market is on the top right. Stats are at the top\u200a\u2014\u200asee? It\u2019s just like GDAX but jumbled around.While I walked you through an example for buying Ripple on Binance, the same concept applies to any other currency you want to buy. The steps are simple:Check to see which exchanges the currency is on.

With that being said, one of the things racing through your mind right now is probably how to secure all your money. With all the news about hacks and scams, the crypto world is a wild west and you can never be too safe.PRO TIP: the majority of hacks (but not all) revealed in the news are spoof sites. Spoof sites are websites that claim to be the real thing so they can steal your login information. For example, a website can pretend to be Coinbase, and when you get there, it\u2019ll ask you to log in. Once you enter your username and password, game over\u200a\u2014\u200aagain, another argument for using 2FA, in case this happens to you.There are many different types of ways that \u201chacks\u201d in the cryptocurrency world occur. Most of the time, it\u2019s simply due to the investor not being careful enough; don\u2019t take this the wrong way, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re completely careless. Some of these \u201chacks\u201d are very intricately designed, they can fool even the most veteran of traders. Here is a list of a few of the most common forms of \u201chacks\u201d to keep your eyes and ears peeled (I put hacks in quotes because many times, it\u2019s not actually hacking rather than scamming, but I put both into the same category of unfortunate events that occur in crypto):", "responses": "24"}, {"title": "Bitcoin as the first anti-fragile economic\u00a0entity", "author_name": "Eran Shir", "link": "https://medium.com/@eranshir/bitcoin-as-the-first-anti-fragile-economical-entity-b52bc600ec91?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 26, 2017", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "4.7K", "content": "Bitcoin as the first anti-fragile economic\u00a0entityEran ShirBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 26, 2017Companies are extremely fragile and delicate objects.. Most of them do not survive their five year anniversary, and less than one tenth of one percent reach the age of 50. That means that 99.9% of companies get dissolved before they are 50 years old. 99.9% disintegrate during your professional career.Moreover, companies are fragile because they break down in the first sound of trouble or chaos. Massive events like stock market crashes or wars can dissolve countless companies. Long term technological or social changes can create wide scale extinction of whole sectors of the economy, not just few companies.On the other hand, cities are extremely resilient. There are cities that are four and five thousands years old. There are even older ones. Cities withstand floods, wars, plagues. Cities even survived throwing atom bombs on them. It\u2019s extremely hard to destroy a city.So why are cities so resilient while corporations so fragile? Why do cities thrive as they grow in size, while corporations slow down, many times to a halt? In one word: Evolution. A city is a continuously adapting complex network. This kind of network has been shown to be very resilient to network fault. It connects people in surprising ways, allowing for dissemination of information and influence through countless links. It\u2019s a decentralized, living organism where each person is free to change role, activity, occupation and domestic state as he wishes. For the most part, it adapts to changing times well, through the millions of decisions taken by its citizens every day. There is no central management (regardless of what its mayor may think), no \u2018strategic planning session\u2019. No \u2018chain of command\u2019. The citizens of the city tend to have a very high stake in the success of the city, either because they own a house, their largest asset, in that city, or because it is part of their self-esteem, culture and persona. Choosing a city is many times a life choice, and typically a decision people stay with for decades, as all of them are part-owners of the city. This adaptive and evolving nature results in a positive scaling law, where the larger the city, the more productive its citizens are.A corporation, on the other hand, is a hierarchical structure, tree-like in nature, with a centralized ownership and a centralized management. A tree is a highly fragile structure. It has single point of failures in each of its layers all the way to the top. Crisis can easily propagate up and down, and if an executive at the top is slow at adapting to the changing tides or makes the wrong call, it can destroy the company completely. Centralized ownership also means that employees have limited vested interest in the success of the company and can easily fathom moving from one company to another, as they often do the minute the going gets a bit tough. This centralized, rigid nature of a corporation results in a negative scaling law, where the larger a corporation is, the less productive its employees are.Bitcoin (and other blockchain-based assets) is essentially a decentralized network for producing trust where none exists, and as such it also possesses the highly resilient nature of other large-scale distributed networks like cities. It evolves through the integral actions of its members / miners, who decide what flavor of Bitcoin to run and support. Bitcoin is only v1 of this decentralized control concept, and as such still suffers from concentration and other problems due to the na\u00efvet\u00e9 that comes with being first, but already shows the promise of moving the economy from being a forest to an ensemble of networks.We can think of Bitcoin as a constant dare to the hackers of the world to try and break it. The ultimate hackers bounty competition. As the value of Bitcoin grows, the incentive to try and attack the network follows suit, and as the last decade has shown, Bitcoin is extremely resilient to 3rd party attacks, and in fact, we are not aware of a single attack of the network that succeeded. All successful attacks were done on the links between the network and the outside world, like wallets and exchanges.But Bitcoin\u2019s resiliency doesn\u2019t stop at the crypto level. Bitcoin is like the land of Fantasia from the Never Ending Story, which will survive as long as there is at least one human like Bastian, who still believes in it. As long as there is a group of people in the world that will believe in Bitcoin enough to operate a miner and a wallet, Bitcoin will continue to exist, with all of its ledger and transaction history. Once you understand this point, you will understand why comparing Bitcoin to a dot-com company is not understanding it at all. As long as there are people in the world for which Bitcoin provides a service, all of it will exist, regardless of how far its price drops. Bitcoin is like a hologram, which you may break in half, and then in half again, and each sliver and segment will still contain all of the information about the entire scene it captured.But Bitcoin doesn\u2019t stop with resiliency. There is an even higher level of existence, popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb: Antifragility.Antifragile entities thrive in disorder and chaos, not just weather them. They are more valuable in volatile times. That is exactly the case of Bitcoin. Western citizens (and senior bankers in particular) don\u2019t get Bitcoin and don\u2019t understand its value because they are living in a highly stable, highly predictable society, where the chances that everything you ever owned will one day disappear on a whim are virtually zero. Bitcoin\u2019s utility for such people is very low, and it functions mainly as a speculative asset. In chaotic regions and countries, Bitcoin and other crypto assets shine. Bitcoin allows a citizen of such a country to keep his fortune out of the arbitrary hands of his regime. It allows immigrant workers to easily and securely send back money to their families abroad, and allows refugees all over the world to take their assets with them regardless of where they go and what they need to tackle on their way. These are major innovations which will have profound, long lasting implications on the human condition.In fact, Bitcoin might end up fulfilling the wish of every Miss Universe who ever walked a runway: Usher World Peace.Why world peace? Because Bitcoin and other decentralized assets will make it extremely hard to maintain totalitarian regimes afloat. If rulers of totalitarian and oppressing regimes can\u2019t control and block the movement of funds and assets among their citizens and between their country and the rest of the world, they will end up waking up one day to learn their economy is barren, imploding into itself. Their total control of resources will be stripped from them, paving the way to the rise of democracies. In essence, Bitcoin gives people optionality and presents governments with a strong dilemma\u200a\u2014\u200asqueeze your population too much, and you may end up losing it all. The paradoxical trait of Bitcoin is that to the extent it will be successful in moving regimes to be more democratic and deterministic, the need for it will diminsh. In essence, in its success lay the seeds to his downfall.Bitcoin is just the first decentralized asset, and already today we see thousands of attempts of building new types of assets and currencies, and new economies based on them. Most will likely not leave their mark, but some undoubtedly will. Those that do, will chart a new blueprint for organizing human energy and creativity. If up until now the main large scale way to organize human energy was corporation (barring armies and religions, of course), which as we saw, are tree-like and highly fragile, we can now organize human innovation around synthetic economies run in a decentralized manner, while still building the right incentive structure that will attract people to invest their time and energy in solving humanity\u2019s grand challenges. We can move from a forest-like society into a much more resilient society, by creating a new type of a city-like corporation: self-organizing, always evolving networks of resources and humans.Cities, Companies, Currencies\u200a\u2014\u200athese are the foundations on top of which we build the human society. Making these basic building blocks resilient and ultimately anti-fragile is a worthy cause, which could fundamentally evolve the human condition for the better.I\u2019d like to thank Eden Shochat, Michael Eisenberg, Parker Thompson, Sam Lessin, and Matthew Barnett for looking at drafts of this post.", "responses": "37"}, {"title": "The History of Money & the Future of Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency Economy", "author_name": "Kenny Li", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/the-history-of-money-the-future-of-bitcoin-and-the-cryptocurrency-economy-5cc25e808275?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 30, 2018", "readtime": "17 min read", "upvotes": "5.8K", "content": "Icons from Flaticon.com PremiumThe History of Money & the Future of Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency EconomyThis article is an examination into the historical and current use of money and how Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies can fit into the the future of money.

Tone brought speakers from all over the world including Saifedean Ammous, Trace Mayer, Jimmy Song, Peter Todd, Johnny Dilley, Pavel Moravec, Stacy Herbert the one and only Max Keiser and several others. The conference and time was a wild success in my opinion. Great job Tone and Mike!In my interview with Max he spoke about several things including how he found his way into crypto, invented the worlds first digital currency, his thoughts on Central Banks, whether blockchain is needed beyond Bitcoin and what the ETF\u2019s and Futures markets could possibly do to Bitcoin and where Bitcoin is ultimately going and why it is so incredibly important.For me this was an incredible interview not just because of the incredible views and content but because this is the man who woke me up and introduced me and so many others to Bitcoin back in 2011. I was truly honored to hang out with this legend and hear his thoughts on so many things in and outside of the interview.For those who are going to watch the video interview, I must warn you there is an occasional curse word and as I mentioned Max can be controversial and wildly entertaining a great example was during the interview Max out of nowhere shouts Jamie Dimon is a bum. This was explained by Max due to Dimon\u2019s never having to work an honest day in Dimon\u2019s life as his sole existence is being a third party to transactions collecting the fee\u2019s.With Bitcoin, it\u2019s peer to peer and institutions like Dimon\u2019s are no longer needed to collect these fees. As we know in Bitcoin, the fees collected are by the miners for their actual work within the network. With the new Bitcoin Lightning Network, these fees drastically diminish to next to nothing as the bulk of the work is now done off the chain.I don\u2019t want to giveaway too many spoilers, so for anyone who wants to see and hear Max\u2019s views on a plethora of topics this is a can\u2019t miss interview.For those that want even more Max after this interview he hosts the Keiser Report on RT TV which is also wildly successful and thought-provoking, please make sure and check it out.It was a true honor hanging with Max, I hope you enjoy the interview and for those new to crypto make sure and drop by my YouTube channel, we do interviews all the time and I host a livestream every Monday 1PM PST on the channel where viewers can ask me anything and we do on-air live giveaways.

Alternatively it may seem foolish to invest in a digital asset that isn\u2019t backed by any commodity or government and whose price rise has prompted some to compare it to the tulip mania or the dot-com bubble. Neither is true; the bullish case for Bitcoin is compelling but far from obvious. There are significant risks to investing in Bitcoin, but, as I will argue, there is still an immense opportunity.GenesisNever in the history of the world had it been possible to transfer value between distant peoples without relying on a trusted intermediary, such as a bank or government. In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity is still unknown, published a 9 page solution to a long-standing problem of computer science known as the Byzantine General\u2019s Problem. Nakamoto\u2019s solution and the system he built from it\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200aallowed, for the first time ever, value to be quickly transferred, at great distance, in a completely trustless way. The ramifications of the creation of Bitcoin are so profound for both economics and computer science that Nakamoto should rightly be the first person to qualify for both a Nobel prize in Economics and the Turing award.For an investor the salient fact of the invention of Bitcoin is the creation of a new scarce digital good\u200a\u2014\u200abitcoins. Bitcoins are transferable digital tokens that are created on the Bitcoin network in a process known as \u201cmining\u201d. Bitcoin mining is roughly analogous to gold mining except that production follows a designed, predictable schedule. By design, only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined and most of these already have been\u200a\u2014\u200aapproximately 16.8 million bitcoins have been mined at the time of writing. Every four years the number of bitcoins produced by mining halves and the production of new bitcoins will end completely by the year 2140.Bitcoins are not backed by any physical commodity, nor are they guaranteed by any government or company, which raises the obvious question for a new bitcoin investor: why do they have any value at all? Unlike stocks, bonds, real-estate or even commodities such as oil and wheat, bitcoins cannot be valued using standard discounted cash flow analysis or by demand for their use in the production of higher order goods. Bitcoins fall into an entirely different category of goods, known as monetary goods, whose value is set game-theoretically. I.e., each market participant values the good based on their appraisal of whether and how much other participants will value it. To understand the game-theoretic nature of monetary goods, we need to explore the origins of money.The Origins of\u00a0MoneyIn the earliest human societies, trade between groups of people occurred through barter. The incredible inefficiencies inherent to barter trade drastically limited the scale and geographical scope at which trade could occur. A major disadvantage with barter based trade is the double coincidence of wants problem. An apple grower may desire trade with a fisherman, for example, but if the fisherman does not desire apples at the same moment, the trade will not take place. Over time humans evolved a desire to hold certain collectible items for their rarity and symbolic value (examples include shells, animal teeth and flint). Indeed, as Nick Szabo argues in his brilliant essay on the origins of money, the human desire for collectibles provided a distinct evolutionary advantage for early man over his nearest biological competitors, Homo neanderthalensis.The primary and ultimate evolutionary function of collectibles was as a medium for storing and transferring wealth.Collectibles served as a sort of \u201cproto-money\u201d by making trade possible between otherwise antagonistic tribes and by allowing wealth to be transferred between generations. Trade and transfer of collectibles were quite infrequent in paleolithic societies, and these goods served more as a \u201cstore of value\u201d rather than the \u201cmedium of exchange\u201d role that we largely recognize modern money to play. Szabo explains:Compared to modern money, primitive money had a very low velocity\u200a\u2014\u200ait might be transferred only a handful of times in an average individual\u2019s lifetime. Nevertheless, a durable collectible, what today we would call an heirloom, could persist for many generations and added substantial value at each transfer\u200a\u2014\u200aoften making the transfer even possible at\u00a0all.Early man faced an important game-theoretic dilemma when deciding which collectibles to gather or create: which objects would be desired by other humans? By correctly anticipating which objects might be demanded for their collectible value, a tremendous benefit was conferred on the possessor in their ability to complete trade and to acquire wealth. Some Native American tribes, such as the Narragansetts, specialized in the manufacture of otherwise useless collectibles simply for their value in trade. It is worth noting that the earlier the anticipation of future demand for a collectible good, the greater the advantage conferred to its possessor; it can be acquired more cheaply than when it is widely demanded and its trade value appreciates as the population which demands it expands. Furthermore, acquiring a good in hopes that it will be demanded as a future store of value hastens its adoption for that very purpose. This seeming circularity is actually a feedback loop that drives societies to quickly converge on a single store of value. In game-theoretic terms, this is known as a \u201cNash Equilibrium\u201d. Achieving a Nash Equilibrium for a store of value is a major boon to any society, as it greatly facilitates trade and the division of labor, paving the way for the advent of civilization.Over the millennia, as human societies grew and trade routes developed, the stores of value that had emerged in individual societies came to compete against each other. Merchants and traders would face a choice of whether to save the proceeds of their trade in the store of value of their own society or the store of value of the society they were trading with, or some balance of both. The benefit of maintaining savings in a foreign store of value was the enhanced ability to complete trade in the associated foreign society. Merchants holding savings in a foreign store of value also had an incentive to encourage its adoption within their own society, as this would increase the purchasing power of their savings. The benefits of an imported store of value accrued not only to the merchants doing the importing, but also to the societies themselves. Two societies converging on a single store of value would see a substantial decrease in the cost of completing trade with each other and an attendant increase in trade-based wealth. Indeed, the 19th century was the first time when most of the world converged on a single store of value\u200a\u2014\u200agold\u200a\u2014\u200aand this period saw the greatest explosion of trade in the history of the world. Of this halcyon period, Lord Keynes wrote:What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was\u00a0\u2026 for any man of capacity or character at all exceeding the average, into the middle and upper classes, for whom life offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences, comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most powerful monarchs of other ages.

Businesses building on Bitcoin, believing it a cheap global payments network, eventually became nonviable when blocks filled up in 2017. They weren\u2019t necessarily wrong, they just had a vision of the world that ended up being a minority view within the Bitcoin community, and was ultimately not expressed by the protocol on their desired timeline.In the absence of a recognized sole leader, Bitcoiners refer to founding documents and early forum posts to attempt to decipher what Satoshi truly wanted for the currency. This is not unlike US Supreme Court justices poring over the Constitution and applying its ancient wisdom to contemporary cases. Others reject textual exegesis and focus instead on a pragmatic analysis in context.Conflicts within Bitcoin thus arise from entities who hold visions of the protocol that are mutually exclusive\u200a\u2014\u200aand this leads to friction when these visions cannot be reconciled. Visions of Bitcoin are not static. Technological developments, practical realities and real-world events have shaped collective views. This post is an attempt to aggregate the various dominant narratives that have characterized Bitcoin throughout its 9-year history. This post builds on excellent prior work by Murad Mahmudov and Adam Tach\u00e9, and we suggest you add that to your reading list.Changing narrativesHere, we want to more granularly explore the prevalence of key narratives. We identify seven distinct major themes that have held positions of prominence among Bitcoiners throughout its history. Note that these do not necessarily have to be the most influential narratives\u200a\u2014\u200awe are instead focusing on major strains of thought that have characterized Bitcoin users.In rough order of appearance, these are:E-cash proof of concept: the first major narrative, this was the general view of Bitcoin in its earliest days. Back then, cypherpunks and cryptographers were still appraising the nascent project and determining whether it worked, if at all. Since all prior e-cash schemes had failed, it took a while for people to be convinced of its technical and economic viability and move on to more expansive conceptions of the protocol.Cheap p2p payments network: an extremely popular and pervasive narrative. Some believe this is what Satoshi had in mind\u200a\u2014\u200aa straightforward currency for peer to peer internet transactions. A decentralized Paypal or Venmo, if you will. Since microtransactions are a key component of internet commerce, proponents of this view generally believe that low fees and convenience are an essential characteristic of such a currency.Censorship-resistant digital gold: the counterpoint to the p2p payments narrative, this is the view that Bitcoin primarily represents an untamperable, uninflatable, largely unseizable, intergenerational wealth store which cannot be interfered with by banks or the State. Proponents of this view de-emphasize Bitcoin\u2019s use for everyday transactions, arguing that security, predictability, and conservatism in development are more important. We\u2019re callously lumping in sound money believers into this camp.Private and anonymous darknet currency: the view that Bitcoin is useful for anonymous online transactions, in particular to facilitate black market online commerce. This is not necessarily mutually exclusive with the e-gold position, as many proponents of the digital gold view believe that fungibility and privacy are important attributes. This was a popular narrative before the chain analysis companies had success de-anonymizing Bitcoin users.Reserve currency for the cryptocurrency industry: this is the view that Bitcoin serves an essential purpose as the native currency for the cryptocurrency/cryptoasset industry more generally. This is a view espoused by traders for whom BTC is the numeraire\u200a\u2014\u200athe currency in which the prices of other assets are quoted. Additionally, traders, businesses, and distributed networks that hold reserves in BTC de-facto endorse this view.Programmable shared database: this is a slightly more niche view, and generally involves the understanding that Bitcoin can embed arbitrary data, not just currency transactions. Individuals holding this view tend to see Bitcoin as a programmable, expressive protocol, which can facilitate broader use-cases. In 2015\u201316, it was popular to express the notion that Bitcoin would eventually absorb a diverse set of functionalities through sidechains. Projects like Namecoin, Blockstack, DeOS, Rootstock, and some of the timestamping services rely on this view of the protocol.Uncorrelated financial asset: this is a view of Bitcoin that treats it strictly like a financial asset and finds its most important feature to be its return distribution. In particular, its tendency to have a low or nonexistent correlation to all manner of indexes, currencies, or commodities makes it an attractive portfolio diversifier. Proponents of the view are generally not too concerned about owning spot Bitcoin; they are interested in exposure to the asset. Put another way, they want to buy Bitcoin-flavored risk, not necessarily Bitcoin itself. As Bitcoin has become more financialized, this conception has gained steam.In the chart below, we\u2019ve weighted these various narratives according to their popularity at the time.This isn\u2019t modern art\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s our representation of Bitcoin\u2019s changing\u00a0tides(High-quality version here)In this chart, we lay out the relative influence of the seven narratives we identified above. As you can see, the e-cash proof of concept was the dominant view at the start, although the p2p payments network and digital gold views were also espoused at the time. Later, Bitcoin as an anonymous darknet currency gained steam with the Silk Road. The idea never really died off, and Bitcoin is still used on the darknet today, even though other privacy-oriented alternatives exist.As ICOs were invented and a broader market of altcoins began to proliferate, BTC became the reserve asset for that larger economy. This grew to become a significant feature of Bitcoin, especially in the bull markets of 2014 and 2017. We note that the p2p payments contingent remained influential until mid 2017, when they largely migrated to Bitcoin Cash (some had already left for Litecoin and Dash). However, with the emergence of Lightning in 2018, there has been an upswing of enthusiasm for online microtransactions and fee-less internet payments.In 2015 and 2016, sidechains became a popular talking point, and it was assumed that Bitcoin would soon boast a much-expanded functionality, obsoleting most altcoins. Related functionality-extending projects like Mastercoin (now Omni), colored coins, Namecoin, Rootstock, Blockstack, and Open Timestamps, contributed to this general view. However, as sidechains proved complicated to implement, non-money uses of Bitcoin fell out of favor.As Bitcoin emerged from the 2014\u201315 bear market, analysts began to contemplate its status as a differentiated commodity-money. In November 2015, Tuur Demeester published an investment note entitled \u201cHow to Position for the Rally in Bitcoin,\u201d arguing that it had unique characteristics as a portfolio asset. In mid-2016, Burniske and White influentially argued that Bitcoin represented an entirely new asset class. These analysts noticed Bitcoin\u2019s stubbornly low correlations with traditional assets, and as this persisted, Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier gained steam among certain forward-looking corners of the asset management industry. Today this is a popular view, driving much of the demand for financial products which would give traditional investors exposure to Bitcoin.Throughout all these regimes, the digital gold conception has remained influential, and now is the consensus view, predominating over the p2p petty cash faction, which largely departed with Bitcoin Cash. Today, after years of strife and infighting, this is the majority view. However, not all Bitcoin users are ideological bitcoiners, and wanted to reflect this in the chart. Many Bitcoin holders hold it as a portfolio diversifier, some still use it for anonymous darknet transactions, and the p2p cash contingent has re-emerged alongside Lightning.Tension and\u00a0releaseIf you scrutinize the above chart, you\u2019ll notice that some of the visions of Bitcoin are entirely incompatible. For instance, a move to a global on-chain payments network conflicts with the digital gold view, as emphasized by Spencer Bogart. We\u2019ve depicted the conflict between these views of the world by isolating them on this chart.The conflict really began to be fought seriously with the release of BitcoinXT in 2015, although rancorous discussions had long preceded that. Further provocations including Bitcoin Classic, Unlimited intensified the conflict. It reached its peak in mid 2017 when Bitcoin Cash finally forked. During the bull run of late 2017, Bitcoin fees reached extreme levels, leading to defections to the Bitcoin Cash camp. However, since then, fees have settled down and the need for big blocks appears less urgent.Additionally, in early 2018, Lightning implementations became viable, and micropayments with Bitcoin emerged. Thus, the tension dissipated, as both camps were able to pursue their own objectives. We noted an uptick in the cheap payments school of thought from within the Bitcoin crowd in 2018, as there has been a resurgence of optimism for payments through second-layer solutions.An interesting conclusion that we think can be drawn from the analysis is that Bitcoin is currently benefiting from a rare period of relative harmony. While there is no single view that entirely dominates, the digital gold narrative is certainly most prevalent right now. The civil wars of 2015\u201317 ended with the Bitcoin Cash fork, and migrations to other p2p payment factions like Litecoin, Dash, and Nano. For now, the tension seems to be largely resolved, and we find ourselves in an unusually placid era in Bitcoin\u2019s history. Subjectively, it appears that under this comparatively peaceful regime, development seems to be progressing more rapidly. Endless social media battles, conference-driven agreements, and positioning for contention forks certainly created a drag on developer efforts. There is another battle looming, however.As depicted in this chart, the anonymous and fungible vision of Bitcoin (generally preferred by the digital gold camp) is somewhat at odds with the financialised, transparent version which is growing in popularity. Individuals that want exposure to Bitcoin the financial asset tend to prefer a Bitcoin which is compatible with AML/KYC and tend to put a lesser emphasis on privacy or fungibility. Many pundits believe this will be the next bitter fight for the soul of Bitcoin.Ultimately, both the conflict and the peacetime phases are important. Conflicts reveal where power structures reside, and tend to yield informative signals about how key stakeholders truly feel. Under duress, business, individuals, and developers are forced to take sides, revealing their genuine preferences for the development of the protocol.Timeline of\u00a0eventsWe are aware that much of our analysis relies on our subjective interpretation of old BitcoinTalk posts. If you disagree, we welcome you to suggest an alternative. To make subsequent analyses easier, we\u2019ve put together a timeline of key Bitcoin events, tracking its entire history. (We drew heavily on the 99bitcoins annotated price chart to make this.) We recommend considering our colorful \u2018changing tides\u2019 chart alongside the below timeline. The juxtaposition should help elucidate why exactly we made the decisions that we did.Click for high-quality version(High quality version here)ConclusionWe put together the changing narratives chart through an analysis of BitcoinTalk posts, a set of discussions with Bitcoiners who had been there from the very start, a healthy respect for Bitcoin history, and a recollection of major attitudes over the years. Anyone who has been around Bitcoin long enough should be able to perform a similar analysis.We\u2019re not positing our analysis as the absolute truth. Instead, we want to nudge Bitcoiners away from absolutism and acknowledge that major narratives within the Bitcoin community have changed over time. And that\u2019s ok\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s appropriate to change your mind in response to new data. Purity tests are generally weak, since they tend to require that individuals do not evolve. But if most Bitcoiners went back and contemplated their own past histories, they would probably find that they evolved over time, too. Both of the authors have certainly been through the cycle.In the end, a healthy respect for Bitcoin history is a necessary starting point of any attempt to define it. It is not unitary, and Bitcoiners are not ideologically homogenous. Bitcoin contains multitudes, and it\u2019s important to remind ourselves of that.Thanks to Dan McArdle and Murad Mahmudov for the input.", "responses": "24"}, {"title": "Money is a social construct and that\u2019s why you should run a #bitcoin full-node", "author_name": "Brand7", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/money-is-a-social-construct-and-thats-why-you-should-run-a-bitcoin-full-node-ea0330cb69a5?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 2, 2017", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "4.96K", "content": "Money is a social construct and that\u2019s why you should run a #bitcoin full-nodeBrand7BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 2, 2017Rai Stones: a fascinating form of\u00a0moneyBitcoin is a system with many strict rules but without any rulers.

It\u2019s true you can learn and have a great time\u00a0:-)Trace throughout the interview (and all time I got to hang around him) was very likable and humble considering his enormous successes and achievements. It\u2019s rare when a person acts as Trace does with his enormous level of success.Through the interview, he talks about his past investments in things like Kraken, Armory, BitPay and more. He talks about why Bitcoin is such a big part of his life, why Bitcoin is such a game changer and his thoughts on Bitcoins price and value.He talks about why he created The Proof Of Keys and Hodler Of Last Resort movements, the importance they offer to the crypto community and his thoughts crypto and blockchain outside of Bitcoin. He speaks about his Podcast Bitcoin Knowledge, his book, how he was in Bitcoin before most anyone was and so much more.One of the things I found really interesting was who he said the biggest influence on his life was as well as his favorite book and movie.I don\u2019t want to giveaway all the gems from this awesome and enlightening interview on who Trace Mayer is so I\u2019ll just say this interview here is definitely worth the watch if you have any interest in crypto, blockchain, Bitcoin, Trace Mayer and his thoughts on where we\u2019re all headed in this amazing cryptoverse we\u2019re all a part of or will be a part of whether we know it or not.Check out the interview here and let me know what ya think.

It\u2019s the dawn of a better, more free\u00a0world.\u2014 Roger Ver, CEO Bitcoin.comOver Labor Day weekend (Sept 2017), needing a break from my startup Harvey, I had the choice of binge watching Narcos 3 on Netflix or taking a deep dive into cryptocurrencies. Since learning about the impressive $100M fundraise by Coinbase at a $1.6B valuation, I was been eager to understand their product suite a little better and discover where there might be a new income opportunities, so I jumped in and went deep.Disclaimer: I am not an expert in cryptocurrency day trading, nor do I pretend to be one. I am not offering financial advice. Please understand your own risk tolerance and be responsible with your hard-earned money.I started by wanting to know, in particular, if bitcoin was going to be the punchline of jokes like beanie babies in the 90s, and featured in Economics 101 classes as part of bubble theory. My quick conclusion: I don\u2019t believe the bitcoin hype is over-exaggerated.While there will be significant volatility in the price and valuation of bitcoin over the coming years, I strongly believe it and the entire asset class of cryptocurrencies will become a core part of the financial system within 3 years or less. There is enormous risk in trading these assets\u2014more so than gold, REITS and other commodities\u2014but the global market capitalization of cryptocurrencies ($148 billion today) I expect to pass $1 trillion by 2019.Many of today\u2019s coins will die off, and the ones that survive will be colossal in significance, similar to the way Amazon emerged from the shadows of the dotcom bust in 2001. If you don\u2019t believe this core thesis, this article might not be for you, but I\u2019d love to hear from you.What I\u2019m going to explain is a 10-step guide on how to research, buy and trade some of the major cryptocurrencies and enjoy some of their growth.1. Learn how blockchain worksGoldman Sachs says blockchain technology \u201chas the potential to redefine transactions\u201d and will \u201cchange everything\u201d. But anyone who claims to fully understand how blockchain works, and is not named Satoshi Nakamoto, is probably lying to you. And anyone who claims to be Nakamoto himself, is probably also lying to you. Fortunately, just like the internet, you don\u2019t need to know how blockchain works to use it.But here are the basics\u2026 a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data, and serve as a public ledger of transactions between two parties. To date, the best analogy I\u2019ve heard for blockchain compares it to a Google Doc:\u201cThe traditional way of sharing documents with collaboration is to send a Microsoft Word document to another recipient, and ask them to save the document, make revisions to it, and send it back. The problem with this scenario was that you needed to wait to receive a return copy before you could see or make changes to the document. You are locked out of editing it until the other person is done with it. That\u2019s how banks work today\u2014they maintain money balances and transfer money by briefly locking access to the account (or decreasing the balance) while they make the transfer, then they update the other side, then re-open access (or update the balance).With a Google Doc, all parties have access to the same document at the same time, and the most up-to-date version of that document is always visible and editable to all parties. This real-time shared Google Doc is just like a distributed blockchain ledger. The \u201creal version\u201d of the transaction is verified by analyzing all the available blocks on multiple computers and taking \u201cthe average\u201d.The decentralized and transparent nature is what makes blockchain highly secure and almost impossible to hack, because a hack to one ledger would cause a discrepancy in the entire network that will be ignored. Functionally, to hack the ledger one would have to hack all the computers on a network at the exact same time in order to change the \u201caverage\u201d. For a currency like bitcoin, this would mean millions of computers. So the larger the network, the more stable the currency.Current payment systems require third-party intermediaries like Google, Facebook, banks and government agencies to process transactions, and many charge high fees for doing so. A blockchain system, however, allows for faster direct payments between individuals and can even support micropayments.\u201cBlockchain solves the problem of manipulation. In the West, people trust Google, Facebook, and their banks. But around the rest of the world, people don\u2019t trust their corporations as much. Blockchain opportunities are the highest in the countries that haven\u2019t reached that level [of trust]\u00a0yet.\u201d\u2014Vitalik Buterin, founder of\u00a0Ethereum2. Learn the top currenciesBitcoin is here to stay. But the world of virtual currencies is getting crowded with many other \u201caltcoins\u201d. There are over 100 types of cryptocurrency that sell for more than $1 USD, according to CoinMarketCap. Even more are in penny-stock range, but I don\u2019t recommend trading them right now.There are over 100 cryptocurrencies trading over $1 USD, with a market cap just under $150 billion. Bitcoin accounts for over 50% of the entire market. Source: CoinMarketCapWhat\u2019s important to note is that bitcoin accounts for about 50% of the entire cryptocurrency market, and has the highest volume. It is undoubtedly the most important currency today. You\u2019ll also notice a difference between the original version of bitcoin, Bitcoin Classic (BTC), and a newer version of bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Cash is a spinoff off of the original bitcoin blockchain. I\u2019m not going to get into the technical differences between Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Cash, but understand they are separate currencies. So far, Bitcoin Classic seems to be favored by the public over Bitcoin Cash, and has an 8X higher market cap. But when people say \u201cbitcoin\u201d (lowercase) they could be referring to to either currency.The other two currencies I would pay attention to are Ethereum (~40% the size of Bitcoin, also known as \u201cEther\u201d), and the smaller and more volatile Ripple and Litecoin. Despite a smaller market cap, Litecoin enjoys higher trading volume than Bitcoin Cash and Ripple, likely because it\u2019s one of the three currencies accepted by the #1 digital currency wallet, Coinbase.3. Understand all inherent\u00a0risksBitcoin is more volatile than practically any other type of asset, including gold or the stock market. Cryptocurrency is still a young technology, and faces many challenges. While I believe the overall trend for bitcoin is upwards, trading this currency comes with considerable risk. Bitcoin prices are highly impacted by public sentiment about the currency. It will continue to fluctuate as companies and financial institutions make decisions of how to incorporate (or not incorporate) it into their businesses and workflow. It\u2019s also highly sensitive to regulatory changes, as I will get to in a minute.To give an example, in early June 2017, Bitcoin was trading at $2,983, before losing 30% of its value a month later in July\u2014crashing to $1,992. Then it climbed up to $4,764 in September, posting an impressive 139% gain.What goes up must come down, eventually.Then as I sit here and write this on September 3rd, 2017, the Chinese government announced a few hours ago that they are banning all organizations and individuals from raising funds through Initial Coin Offering (ICO). They barred all banks and financial institutions from doing business related to ICO trading. This is significant news, although not a surprise to many people, as representatives from the People\u2019s Bank of China and China Securities Regulatory Commission had previously criticized ICOs as an unauthorized fundraising tool that may open the door to financial scams. (I will explain ICOs in the last section).The news of the ICO ban in China had bitcoin trading down 12%, Ethereum down 23% and Litecoin down as much as 32%, as shown below. So don\u2019t go throwing your entire savings account into Litecoin just yet, and being bullish long-term doesn\u2019t mean it will get there smoothly.High risk, high reward in trading cryptocurrencies.There is also risk inherent to the exchange itself. Just like the cash in your wallet, the safety of your bitcoins or other currencies depend on your own diligence. While your bitcoins cannot disappear, the transactions are permanent and can only be refunded by the recipient. This means you should only do business with people and organizations you know and trust, or who have an established reputation.Remember, bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on a network, which means that anyone can see the balance and transactions of any bitcoin address. However, only the bitcoin exchanges and/or the parties involved in the transaction can attach the addresses to a real person. So for the most part, the transactions are anonymous.Other trustworthy exchanges I considered before deciding on Coinbase were (in no particular order): Bitsquare, Bitstamp, ShapeShift, Kraken, Poloniex, CoinMamma and Gemini.For a full list of exchanges by country, click here.4.

I find this to be the most efficient way of consuming information quickly before making trades.Bitcoin Influencers on Twittertwitter.com/kaleazy news and entertainment on bitcoin, altcoins, cryptocurrencies and all the live commentary. We got you covered!5. Open a brokerage accountCoinbase is one of the most trusted and well-known exchanges for buying and selling Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. They are essentially a digital wallet for your cryptocurrencies, and their iPhone and Android app make sending currency and tracking prices super simple.Coinbase\u2019s iOS app for buying/selling bitcoin.What I like about Coinbase is they meet all the regulatory requirements in the countries they operate, and they have two distinctly separate but integrated products: Coinbase for buying and selling bitcoin or sending them to friends, and Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX) for more advanced and precise trading.Previously, the GDAX was called the Bitcoin Exchange, but mid-2016 they decided to rebrand. From a product standpoint, you can tell they built GDAX with their own engineers, as the user experience is similar to Coinbase.You can signup for Coinbase using my referral code, and you\u2019ll get $10 in free bitcoin to play around with.I would start by making a Coinbase account, then graduate over to GDAX once you feel comfortable. You can instantaneously transfer currencies between the two exchanges for free, which is really nice.6. Fund your\u00a0accountOnce you create an account on Coinbase (or another exchange), you will need to verify your identity by uploading a picture of your drivers license or passport. This only takes a few minutes, then you can fund the account.To add a new payment method, go to \u201cSettings\u201d and \u201cPayment Methods\u201d on the dashboard. You can choose a bank account or a credit/debit card. The bank account has higher limits, but takes longer for the funds to settle. The credit/debit card has lower limits, but the transactions happen instantly. If you go bank account route, you will need to verify two deposit amounts on your account. I personally did both\u2014I funded the account with a few grand from my checking account, and thanks to my impatience I also put few grand on my credit card just so I could get started right away.Keep in mind, Coinbase charges a 3.99% processing fee for all credit card transactions. I\u2019d recommend using a credit card that gives you at least 3% cash back so you can offset some of the fees (I\u2019ll cover the fee structure in more detail in the next section). You can use PayPay for selling currency, buy not buying currency; for PayPal the funds are available instantly but have lower payout limits. The bank account is usually your best bet.7. Buy and sell some\u00a0bitcoin!Once your account is funded, you can go ahead and make your first purchase. Remember, you do not have to purchase coins in full units. You can buy coins in fractions as low as one hundredth of a millionth, or about less than one-tenth of a cent at current prices. That makes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies easy targets for speculation.Coinbase does not charge to transfer bitcoin from one user to the other, which is the point of blockchain. But if you want to transfer money to or from an outside exchange, such as a US bank account, Coinbase charges a small conversion fee. The charge is 1.49% with a $0.15 minimum if you are using a bank account and 3.99% if you are using a credit/debit card. I\u2019d try to avoid funding with a credit card unless you get ample reward points to offset the higher fees.For a full breakdown of their fees, click here.Source: Coinbase.comLastly, if you choose the bank account payment method, the funds take 4\u20135 days to settle, and you are locked into the market price of BTC at the time of purchase. In the case above, I am buying 0.2233 BTC at a price of $4,411.93, totaling $985.32, and I\u2019m losing $14.68 in fees. I am guaranteed that price regardless how long the funds take to settle. Coinbase essentially buys the bitcoin at that time and saves them for you in a virtual vault, and releases them in your account once they receive the funds from your bank.8. Graduate to\u00a0GDAXOnce you\u2019ve bought and sold a few bitcoin on Coinbase, you should graduate to the big leagues. Coinbase\u2019s more advanced trading platform is called the Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX). It uses the same login and password as Coinbase, and you can easily transfer currency between the two platforms, which is really convenient. The GDAX features a pretty interface with real-time pricing data, order book, charting tools, trade history, and a simple buy/sell order process so you can at least pretend to be a pro.GDAX offers institutions and professional traders the ability to trade a variety of digital currencies on a fully regulated U.S. based exchange with lower transaction fees.Once you\u2019re comfortable with GDAX, you probably won\u2019t use Coinbase anymore. GDAX charges lower transaction fees than Coinbase\u2014ranging from 0.1% to 0.25% for \u201ctakers\u201d (buyers) and 0% fee on \u201cmakers\u201d (sellers), with the fees varying based on monthly trade volume.The advantage of the Coinbase system, however, is that it is more simple, instant, and your order is guaranteed to fill, in exchange for a higher fee. On the GDAX market, the \u201cmaker\u201d order is free, but you risk the order not getting filled and having to set a new price.Below is a short Reddit post comparing GDAX vs Coinbase.9. Study charts to find\u00a0trendsIf you, like me, believe that bitcoin and the entire market capitalization of cryptocurrencies will increase in value over time, then the goal is to collect as many coins as possible, getting in at the right prices, and build a strong diversified portfolio of crypto assets that you can hold.In order to do this, you must \u201cbuy the lows\u201d and let the profits run. I\u2019d recommend entering and exiting positions gradually in case the lows get lower or the highs get higher. Avoid buying/selling in big emotional or reactionary swoops, and try not to trade more than a few times a week to keep fees down and give your bets a chance to perform.One way to tell if a stock price is over/undervalued is by reading moving averages. Moving averages are plotted on stock charts to help smooth out volatility and point out the direction a stock may be trending. As short-term moving averages (red line below) cross over long-term moving averages (black line), this sometimes is followed by accelerated movement in the price. Also pay attention to spikes in trade volume, as this may imply that strong sentiments of fear or excitement just entered the market.There are many other strategies traders use to predict trends, which I won\u2019t get into today. These include Head and Shoulders, Trend Lines, Support and Resistance patterns and Candlesticks. Here\u2019s a great article explaining each of these in a little more detail. Within the GDAX dashboard, you will find a price chart that looks similar to the one above, accompanied by four other sections in the same viewport:The Price Chart in GDAX shows historical prices and volume data in two views: a line chart and candlestick chart (recommended) over various historical time frames.The Depth Chart right below the Price Chart shows a detailed visual representation of the bid and ask prices over a range of prices. You can increase or decrease the price range for the chart by using the plus or minus buttons at the top of the chart. The price in the middle of the chart is the midpoint price between the best bid and ask prices. Moving the cursor over the prices will allow you to select a price in which you can create an order. Clicking the price will fill in the buy/sell price for you automatically in the left sidebar. This chart is a useful to see how close buyers are from sellers in their ask/bid prices; the greater the surface area under the curve, the more bids there are at that price.The Order Book shows a live view of open orders on the entire Coinbase exchange, in what\u2019s called an order ladder. There are three columns that show the market size, price and order size of each order. You can click any row and it will fill in the buy/sell price for you automatically in the left sidebar. Once you confirm the order, it will immediately show up on the order ladder and attempt to get filled.The Open Orders section shows status of each of your open orders. It also shows filled orders. You can easily cancel any order at any time.The Trade History on the right shows all completed orders.On the upper-left (below) you will see a dropdown to change the currency, with nine different options. The most common views will be BTC/USD (Bitcoin), ETH/USD (Ethereum) and LTC/USD (Litecoin).GDAX allows users to see the Price Chart, Depth Chart, Order Book, Open Orders and Trade History all in one\u00a0view.The primary goal of these charts is to determine the general direction of the currency over a specified time period, and the prices at which you would be willing to buy and/or sell the currency before it takes a correction.It\u2019s important to specify a time horizon for your investment\u2014such as short term (7\u201314 days), medium term (1\u20132 months) or long-term (6\u201312 months). I don\u2019t recommend trading on time horizons shorter than 7 days unless you have access to margin (you probably don\u2019t) or have large amounts of money to play with; otherwise, the fees will be too high relative to the returns.10. Set limit orders, and be\u00a0patient.Once you are ready to place an order, you will accept the market price or set what\u2019s called a limit order. Limit orders provide investors and traders with a means of precisely entering a position without being victim of fluctuating prices. For example, a buy limit order can be place for $2.40 when a stock is trading around $2.50. If the price dips to $2.40, the order is automatically executed. If it\u2019s a GTC (good \u2019til canceled) order, it will remain open until manually cancelled by the investor.Once the limit order is set, be patient. Give the price time to fluctuate\u2014testing highs and lows\u2014and see if your limit order catches a buyer (or seller). There is no hurry to cancel you limit orders, so resist the urge to rapidly change your limit order prices. Many experienced investors will set multiple limit orders at consecutively lower prices to take advantage of a big selloff or take some profits when the price tests a new high. Limit orders are your best friend, use them.There are other more advanced limit order options you can make such as IOC, FOC and Stop Orders that are explained in this article below.Entering Market, Limit and Stop OrdersOn the order panel, you can choose to place a market, limit, or stop order. A market order will execute immediately at\u2026support.gdax.comConclusionIn future articles I will discuss in more detail some of the strategies I\u2019m using to set my limit orders. But hopefully this article serves as a comprehensive guide to getting started trading cryptocurrencies on an exchange.One advice I\u2019d give beginner traders is to avoid falling for ICOs, or Initial Coin Offerings, in the short term and stick with the more established currencies like Bitcoin, Eurotheum and Litecoin. According to MarketWatch, an ICO is \u201ca fundraising means in which a company attracts investors looking for the next big crypto score by releasing its own digital currency in exchange.\u201d The ICO is similar to a initial public offering (IPO), but with a crypto twist and (as of now) no regulatory hoops to jump through.A total of $1.6 billion have been globally raised via ICOs already, but as I mentioned, ICOs were recently banned in China, so the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is receiving immense pressure to propose similar rules to regulate the ICO phenomenon as well. So any US-based companies planning their ICO might want to reconsider. You can find a comprehensive list of upcoming ICOs on CoinSchedule.com, although I recommend that you look but don\u2019t touch. Now it not the time for ICOs.Chamath Palihapitiya, founder of venture fund Social Capital, in response to China\u2019s ban on\u00a0ICOs.For more information about ICOs in the US market, check out \u201cAround the Coin\u201d fintech podcast with Faisal Khan and Mike Jones, CEO of Science Inc, who talks about their $50M blockchain fund ICO coming later this year.Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin have enjoyed some of the highest returns in modern investment history (Litecoin +1,762.97% since last year), so there\u2019s really no reason not to trade them. If you\u2019re patient and disciplined, you will have a good shot at making money, or at least have some fun trading.If you have any questions, hit me up on Twitter or ask one of the members of my Bitcoin Influencers list, as they\u2019re far more experienced than I am.Don\u2019t own bitcoin yet?

This software will scan your hard disk, then it will find the private key. After a few milliseconds a new transaction appears on the bitcoin network that will take all of your hard-earned moneyIf your email provider will loose the database of its users. Then some guy John will buy it in the darknet and quickly begin to run different semantic analyzers. After a couple of hours, it will lead to the disappearance of all bitcoins from all of the services that use authorization via email.In other case, some guy Peter, who works for Google and has a admin rights (like Snowden had) simply steal your Bitcoins from some service. And nobody will notice that. Will be like magic.Some virtual exchange, where all of your crypto is stored will disappear along with all the money. Exactly what Mt.Gox did and dozens of others.If you catch some trojan in the process of hunting for a cool porn. It can encrypt all the files on the hard disk. Afterwards it will find all links to your wallets and it quickly realize how much money you have and how much money it can demand from you. If you wan\u2019t pay your hard drive will not be decrypted. This is a tragic scenario. After all, you can\u2019t even send money to this hacker, because your keys will stay on an encrypted hard drive!If you lose your unencrypted laptop or phone.If you catch a clever Keylogger, none of your activities will save you from epic fail.If you will get an email from the service where your crypto-money stored. However the name of website is not blockchain.info but, for example, blokchain.info, and all will look identical. If you click on the link and successfully authorises it, your bitcoins will disappear simultaneously.One morning you will wake up without your money because the NSA agent will take advantage of some delicious backdoor in Windows operating system.If you decide to transfer cash to the smart contract that you think will do what it supposed to do, in fact, it will do something else. So this smart contract turned out to be smarter than you are.Clearly, this is not a complete list. But maybe it will give you some ideas when something goes wrong. Now you see, cryptocurrencies\u200a\u2014\u200ais not bucks. You are fully responsible for it\u2019s safety. Neither Jesus Christ nor the Pope, nor Vladimir Putin nor Donald Trump will not be able to help you if you do something wrong. But those guys can\u2019t take your money if you do everything in a right way.With great power comes great responsibility.My overall recommendation is to increase computer literacy. A specific recommendation is act strictly according to instructions without unnecessary actions.What kind of wallets I do not recommend to\u00a0use?Here is one basic rule:Do not give ANYONE your private key.This means - do not use any of these wallets:Online web wallets, like blockchain.info, Coinbase, etc. In generally, all wallets which keep the private key on their servers.Any hot wallets. Any app on computer or phone which is used with Internet connection. It can be used with small amounts to make payments, but not for storing your whole money.Use Cold\u00a0StorateCold storage in the context of Bitcoin refers to keeping a reserve of Bitcoins offline.Methods of cold storage include keeping bitcoins:On a USB drive or other storage mediaOn a Paper walletOn a bearer item such as a physical bitcoin.Use a offline Bitcoin Hardware walletMy scheme.I will share my own method which I use. The main thing to understand is the basic rule:Do not give ANYONE your private key.Step 1\u200a\u2014\u200aCreate a bootable USB flash drive Create a bootable USB flash drive with permanent encrypted storage. Tails will be perfect, because it has an Electrum (Bitcoin wallet) and encryption in the box. Set up two passwords for login and for encryption.Tutorial hereStep 2\u200a\u2014\u200aCreate a cold wallet.Load with Tails (without the Internet). Create your cold wallet using Electrum. Come up with a complex password and write down 12\u201313 words (seed) on paper or think of something other place.This seed\u200a\u2014\u200ais your money!!! These 12 words will allow you to regain access to the wallet from any computer in the future.You must also select the check box on the option \u201cView Transaction Before Signing\u201d in the wallet Settings. Thus, you will cause Electrum to show the transaction details before enter a password (i.e. signature) and send the transaction to the network.Step 3\u200a\u2014\u200aCreate a \u201cwatch-only\u201d wallet in the main OS or mobile phone.Copy your Bitcoin public address from Electrum into a text document on a flash drive and shutdown the Tails.Create a \u2018watch-only\u2019 wallet using your public address or public key in any wallet app you like on main OS or on mobile phone. For example in Electrum you need to do the following steps:- Create new wallet- Choose \u201cstandart wallet\u201d- Choose \u201cUse public or private keys\u201d- Paste your PUBLIC key in the next window > CreateNow we can view the balance of our bitcoins and generate new addresses from public key, but we can\u2019t spend any of our bitcoins.Step 4\u2013Spend Bitcoins in a secured wayTo send your Bitcoins in a secured way: run Tails again (do not use Internet).Then make the transaction > a window will appear (as we have enabled the checkbox \u201c\u201cView Transaction Before Signing\u201d).At first click \u201cSign\u201d and then when you enter the password, click \u201cSave\u201d.\u00a0Do not send the transaction to the network and do not enable internet, just copy the transaction file to the flash drive.Start in the main OS > Open your wallet > In the menu choose something like \u201cLoad transaction from file\u201d > load the signed transaction from a flash drive > and push \u201cBroadcast\u201d buttonThus the signed transaction is sent to the Blockchain from the \u2018watch-only\u2019 wallet, and your private key is not leaked anywhere from your Tails usb.Very important. Always check address AFTER you have copied it in the field. Just going back to wallet, remember the first 2 digits and last 2, and then go to the form and check whether these are the numbers that you copied! First, we sometimes make mistakes. Practice shows that quite often. Second, now there are so smart viruses that will determine when you copied the bitcoin address to the clipboard, and replace it to another address.What about other cryptocurrencies?The same logic can be used in relation to all other cryptocurrencies.I agree that this scheme is not the most comfortable to use, because you need to make a lot of manipulations with multiple OS and usb devices.If you are looking for a good usability\u200a\u2014\u200alook at buying a hardware wallet. These hardware wallets works by the scheme described above, but also they have some unique advantages:multiple cryptocurrencies in one secured walletprivate keys are often stored in a protected area of a microcontroller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintextimmune to computer viruses that steal from software walletscan be used securely and interactively, as opposed to a paper wallet which must be imported to software at some pointYou can feel like James BondSome of these wallets (e.g. Ledger Nano S wallet) support not only Bitcoin but also Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, ZCash, DASH, Stratis and more. Also it has integrations with many wallet apps like Electrum, BitGo, Copay, GreenBit and others.That\u2019s all. I hope you got the main rule. Please, write your comments and questions below.

Here is a graph of the bitcoin \u2018mempool\u2019 (the backlog of transactions, and the bigger the backlog the higher the estimated fee to get your transaction confirmed and skip the queue):Highlighted as 1\u00a0, 2, 3\u00a0, these kinds of spikes were really hard for us, we saw incoming transactions delayed for hours or even days, we had trouble paying out to our users onchain (and had to move 100% fully offchain, payouts are now via coinbase only).Area 4 however, today and the last few days is basically just crippling our whole business, we are seeing transaction fees of $150++ and even then delays of several hours to a day to actually get the transaction confirmed into a block.We just can\u2019t keep paying out BTC when the network is\u2026. well, I don\u2019t really want to say it like this, but \u201calmost broken\u201d, or at least unusable for smaller time everyday lower value users\u2026 for normal people\u2026What is Digital Artists\u00a0Online?We are a \u201cbitcoin faucet 2.0\u201d. A platform containting simple sites where you can earn small amounts of bitcoin as you browse bitcoin and altcoin stats, watch videos, play games, read books even.Every week we have around 7500 new users register with us and pay out thousands of people each week\u200a\u2014\u200athis week paying out over 0.4 btc ($6,000+) in total.Although this is not really a political decision, it is an emotional one. Over the last 3 years we have given away over 1085 BTC, worth over $14 million!But this week\u2019s payment is our last BTC payment, from now on it will be 1000s of new bitcoin/digital currency enthusiasts receiving Bitcoin CASH.Our PoliticsWe\u2019ve been in the bitcoin/blockchain space since 2014, I was a very stubborn bitcoin maximalist in 2014\u201315, but since then due to the stalling of bitcoin development and total lack of compromise we started to go the other way..There is a lot of crap, a lot of outright fraud and scams in the Altcoin markets, but there are some interesting, even exceptional things being developed and there could be room for more than 1 coin/blockchain.Now I actually still really like BTC/Core, I hope that Lightning works and alleviates the transaction fees and BTC is the one, but the space is larger than just bitcoin now, some of these other Altcoins have futures, dedicated teams, funding, and a desire to build something big.So over the next few months we are going to showcase some other Altcoins and give them away through the Digital Artists Online platform.Why Bitcoin\u00a0Cash?Because it actually works\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can send and receive it quickly and for low (almost $0 fees)\u200a\u2014\u200aas bitcoin used to work 2 years ago.

No probably not, or I don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care about this \u201cbig question\u201d.But I do think it has a future, a bright one, there are multiple teams submitting whitepapers and debating about scaling and protocol updates, it has a nice positioning as \u201cCASH\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200atransactional money for everyday purchases, and after a few months it is still around and at much stronger $ value, so we don\u2019t feel it is likely to die anytime soon.", "responses": "121"}, {"title": "The ABC\u2019S of Bitcoin and Everything You Need To Know About\u00a0\u201cForks\u201d", "author_name": "James Altucher", "link": "https://medium.com/the-mission/the-abcs-of-bitcoin-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-forks-b4de38969f04?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 7, 2017", "readtime": "10 min read", "upvotes": "1.7K", "content": "The ABC\u2019S of Bitcoin and Everything You Need To Know About\u00a0\u201cForks\u201dJames AltucherBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 7, 201799% of Cryptocurrencies are total scams.

If you disagree with my approximations, I encourage you to perform your own exploration of fundamentals vs. price and share your findings with the world.Before going on Bloomberg or CNBC, I always run through the fundamentals of the network(s) I\u2019ll be talking about. When doing this last, I realized that fundamentals of quality cryptonetworks are down less than prices, and significantly so.For me, fundamentals of a cryptonetwork come down to the health of the supply-siders and demand-siders. Supply-siders are the folks who provision the network\u2019s service (currently, the most common form of supply-sider is a miner), and demand-siders are the ones who consume the service. For this post, I\u2019m going to focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, comparing prices to fundamentals. You can do the same for other networks, so long as they actually exist (many ICOs still do not have operating networks).As a more accurate representation of price, I\u2019m going to use network value (\u201cNetwork Value\u201d = \u201cPrice per Unit\u201d x \u201cUnits of the Cryptoasset Outstanding\u201d), as this shows the aggregate value the market is placing on a cryptonetwork at present.In terms of demand-side and supply-side fundamentals, here are the simple ones I\u2019ll showcase:Bitcoin Demand-Side: Number of Daily Transactions (#), Estimated Daily Transaction Value (USD), Daily Unique Addresses Used (#).Ethereum Demand-Side: Number of Daily Transactions (#), Total Daily Gas Used (if you don\u2019t know what gas is, read this).Bitcoin & Ethereum Supply-Side: Hash Rate.In the graphs that follow, I\u2019m going to contrast how fundamentals and network values have performed since 12/17/17 and 1/13/18, for Bitcoin and Ethereum respectively. These two dates were the peak network values for both assets, per Blockchain.info and Etherscan, which is where I sourced all data.If a fundamental is down since those dates, then we\u2019ll look at how down and compare it to how much network value is down. If the fundamental is not down, then we already know it\u2019s outperforming the market\u00a0:-)Number of Daily Transactions (Demand-Side)Blue Line = Network Value, Orange Line = # of Daily TransactionsBlue Line = Network Value, Green Line = # of Daily TransactionsBitcoin is currently processing ~250,000 transactions per day, and Ethereum ~500,000. Looking at the tail end of both charts there is a clear divergence, where network value has continued to slide over the last few months, but the number of daily transactions is stable to ticking up.From peak, Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s network values are down 81% and 93%, respectively, whereas daily number of transactions are only down 41% and 52%, respectively.To derive a proxy of value from network activity, I\u2019m going to use a very simple interpretation of Metcalfe\u2019s Law [1], squaring the network activity that remains.In the case of Bitcoin, 59% of the network activity remains since the peak, while for Ethereum only 48% remains. The proxy of value for Bitcoin is then 0.59\u00b2, or 0.35, which implies a 65% drawdown in network value is justified, much less than the 81% decline in Bitcoin\u2019s network value we currently witness in the market.In the case of Ethereum, 0.48\u00b2 = 0.23, implying a 77% drawdown in network value is justified, again much less than the 93% drawdown we currently see.Native Functionality (Demand-Side)Blue Line = Network Value, Orange Line = Estimated Daily Transaction Value\u00a0($)Blue Line = Network Value, Green Line = Total Daily Gas\u00a0UsedThe two charts above are my favorite, as they show what I consider the most native demand-metric of each network. For Bitcoin, that\u2019s securely moving value, and for Ethereum, it\u2019s processing smart contract computations.Bitcoin continues to regularly process over a billion dollars in transactional value a day (NOT trading volume), and it\u2019s clear how tightly the orange line of this fundamental is coupled with price. Meanwhile, developers and consumers using Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts continue mostly unabated, as witnessed by another divergence between this fundamental (green-line) and network value.Since their respective peak prices, Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s network values are down 81% and 93%, respectively, whereas demand for their respective native functionalities is down 74% and 7%, respectively.In the case of Bitcoin, 26% of the network activity remains since the peak, while for Ethereum 93% remains. The proxy of value for Bitcoin is 0.26\u00b2 =\u00a0.07, which implies a 93% drawdown in network value is justified. In the case of Ethereum, 0.93\u00b2 = 0.87, implying a 13% drawdown in network value is justified, jaw-droppingly less than the 93% drawdown we currently see.Bitcoin\u2019s daily transactional value is the only fundamental metric I encountered in the brief analysis that constituted this post, which actually justified the market reaction we\u2019ve seen. It led me to look at daily active addresses (which I would have done for Ethereum as well, but that data is harder to find\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019d ask DAR, but it\u2019s the weekend!).Below is what I found for Bitcoin:Blue Line = Network Value, Orange Line = Daily Unique Addresses UsedBitcoin is currently in the 300,000\u2013500,000 daily unique active addresses range, with current values down 51% from the December 2017 peak. Once again, deriving the proxy for value, we have 0.49 of a network that remains. That network\u2019s implied value of 0.49\u00b2 = 0.24, implying a justified drawdown of 76%, close to the 81% that we currently see in the market, but still less\u00a0:-)Hash Rates (Supply-Side)Both Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s hash rates are higher now than they were at both of their peaks. Yes, hash rate is (usually) a lagging indicator that follows price, and both Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s hash rates are on negative slopes which require us to keep a close eye on them. But right now, this fundamental is outperforming price.At this point, I\u2019m running out of steam. To round out the supply-side investigation, it would be good to look at the number of nodes supporting the network, and miner revenues for both networks (transaction fees + block subsidy).While I haven\u2019t posted the data here, developers are a core component of the supply-side (though often forgotten), and from Placeholder\u2019s internal analysis developer metrics are outperforming the market as well (some of this makes its way into demand-side metrics, most obviously with gas use).ConclusionFew people believe cryptonetworks have fundamentals. Even fewer have thought through how to quantify those fundamentals. Then, even fewer consistently have access to blockchain level data to perform the actual calculations [4]. Placing these points in the context of the idea that \u201ctheory follows price, price follows theory,\u201d it\u2019s clear to me that Mr. (Crypto) Market has only a vague idea of what he\u2019s doing right now.Most asset classes have widely agreed-upon models to value them; analysts just bicker over the inputs to those models. In crypto, we currently bicker over both the models and the inputs, hence the insane whiplash of the markets. Data availability for the inputs is also not great, though services like Blockchain.info, Etherscan, Coinmetrics, and CryptoCompare are helping\u200a\u2014\u200athat said, we\u2019re still a ways off from the Bloomberg of crypto.Fortunately, as the fundamentals of these networks grow, and their services become more mission critical to the world, swarms of analysts will converge upon models and inputs that will give Mr. Market better control over his tantrums.

According to Raiden\u2019s team lead, the software is getting close to launch.What if ETH finds a way to make PoS work, and people buy into the good sounding narrative that PoW is more wasteful?In short, what if Ethereum manages to become a good enough cryptocurrency and thereby wins this protocol\u00a0war?At the risk of making an all-too-simplistic comparison, Betamax had better picture quality than VHS. But VHS had a better marketing strategy (rental market), and had tapes that ran the length of a feature film, which was more in line with what the market wanted.On the flip side, I see the following:Bitcoin has a consistent track record of being an immutable ledger (ideal for long term value preservation), versus ETH\u2019s interventionist historyLikely higher developer activity in Bitcoin vs EthereumBitcoin has 100 core contributors, ETH has\u00a0???Core dev Vlad Zamfir: Ethereum isn\u2019t money, safe, or scalableLegal concerns about ICOs and ETH/ETC launches, SEC fallout possibleButerin\u2019s & Zamfir\u2019s approaches to scaling (Casper) seem to divergeProblematic scaling future, e.g. \u201cmathematical proof that it is impossible to determine the \u2018true\u2019 transaction history in a proof-of-stake blockchain without an additional source of trust\u201d, sharding\u2026Future inflation rate unknownUncertain fundamental value proposition over Bitcoin\u2019s modular designBitcoin also has a few aces up its\u00a0sleeve:Segwit can be activated via UASF, circumventing miners and allowing immediate activation of alpha status lightning payments. (If that fails, Lightning can be implemented even without segwit.)Rootstock could port Ethereum\u2019s tech to Bitcoin.Sidechains are close to production-ready, don\u2019t need segwit and allow for unfettered experimentation with additional features. (In this way, anyone who just wants cheap extra block space can find it on a sidechain.)If it is true that over time one cryptocurrency will overwhelmingly dominate as the basis for an \u2018internet of property\u2019, then a lot of capital is at stake when considering the question who is winning this protocol war, Bitcoin or Ethereum?In that regard, here are some questions I\u2019m hoping to find answers\u00a0for:What are the different challenges for implementing payment channels (lightning, raiden) on Bitcoin vs. on Ethereum?What are today\u2019s non-speculative ETH use cases? (What do people need ETH for?) And, related, what are some revenue generating ETH smart contract based businesses?Are there ways to quantify the differences between Ethereum\u2019s and Bitcoin\u2019s security model?What proxies do we have to assess the aggregate quantity and average quality of Bitcoin vs. Ethereum core development?What are potential analogies with historical protocol wars?What kind of security analysis has been done on blockchain bloat and sharding?Thanks for reading, I\u2019m eager to hear your thoughts and discuss.I own BTC, I don\u2019t own ETH (for the time being).", "responses": "85"}, {"title": "3 Things Not to Do When Bitcoin is Going\u00a0Down", "author_name": "Reza Jafery", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/3-things-not-to-do-when-bitcoin-is-going-down-e80097d15796?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 27, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "7.6K", "content": "3 Things Not to Do When Bitcoin is Going\u00a0DownReza JaferyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 27, 2018Trading or investing in cryptocurrency is a psychological war against yourself. Stock traders often say that investing in traditional markets requires extreme mental discipline. That discipline is how they control themselves when the market is volatile. How they stop from making stupid decisions, and keep on track with their strategy.If traditional trading requires extreme discipline, crypto requires the mental fortitude of Jedi. The crypto market is more volatile than any market the world has ever seen. You need to be the emotional equal to Yoda meditating on top of a mountain during a meteor shower.Yes the world might be ending, but it\u2019s all good, you\u2019re hanging out on your mountain top.Photo by Ian Stauffer on\u00a0UnsplashYour fortress of solitude.I\u2019ve been in this space for a few years now. I started off as a investor but fell deeper down the rabbit hole. I work with an accelerator helping token sales, and recently joined the team of a project I fell in love with. I like to think this gives me a comprehensive understanding of fundamentals at play.What this understanding of the players involved in this market has given me is..Well, the knowledge that this market is almost completely sentiment driven. Which means it doesn\u2019t always make sense. Crypto has more retail investors than any other market. You can see this if you look at the Bitcoin price chart next to a chart of Google search trends for the word \u201cBitcoin\u201d. The charts are pretty similar, it would seem, The more people that google Bitcoin, the higher the price goes. The Search Volume graph seems more smooth because less data points were used to plot the graph.Bitcoin Price Over 12\u00a0MonthsBitcoin Google Search Volume Over 12\u00a0MonthsThe search volume actually starts to pick up just before the price goes up.When a market is sentiment driven, price movement is driven by emotion. To come out on top in a market driven by emotion, you have to remove emotion from your trading.The reason I\u2019m telling you all this is so you understand that it\u2019s not always about what you do, but what you don\u2019t do. It\u2019s what you refrain from, when exhibiting that mental fortitude we talked about. When the price of Bitcoin goes down, and you watch all of your cryptocurrency holdings lose their value, it\u2019s hard to remain calm. When the market gets bloody, you might even be wondering if Bitcoin will ever go back up again. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but can say with a decent amount of confidence that it will return to its former glory.Don\u2019t try to catch the exact\u00a0bottom.If you\u2019re lucky enough to have some of your investment capital in fiat or BTC when the market takes a tumble, it can be a good time to construct your portfolio. I like to think of market corrections as \u201cCrypto Flash Sales\u201d. I almost always keep some fiat or BTC tucked away in case of a large dip in the market\u200a\u2014\u200abut my obsession with catching the bottom of a downtrend has made me lose out on some big wins.When you\u2019re staring at a coins chart, watching it plummet in price, wondering when it will stop. You\u2019re trying to catch the bottom. \u201cCatching the bottom\u201d means you\u2019re attempting to enter into a trade at a bottom of a downtrend. It\u2019s extremely difficult to catch the exact bottom on a trade. So difficult that it\u2019s often called, \u201ccatching a falling knife\u201d.Photo by Thanh Tran on\u00a0UnsplashIf you\u2019re constantly trying to catch the exact bottom, chances are you\u2019re going to miss out on trades. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve waited, and waited, only to have a trend reverse before I got in. I\u2019ve missed out on far more than I\u2019ve gained by trying to be a perfectionist with my trade entries. Sometimes, if you\u2019re planning on entering a trade, it\u2019s better to just get in near the bottom rather than wait.If you\u2019re a technical analysis wizard, the likes of Gandalf the White or my friends at Cosmic Trading: you might be better equipped to catch bottoms. This isn\u2019t directed at you. This is for everyone else, the retail investors that make up the majority of this market. You\u2019re not the Wolf of Wall Street, and you\u2019ll bank more coin if you stop thinking you are.Don\u2019t sell your coins for ones that are going\u00a0up.Everyone\u2019s done it. You don\u2019t have to be ashamed. It\u2019s only human. We\u2019ve all sold the bottom of a downtrend only to see it immediately reverse and shoot upwards.It seems like everytime I abandon ship on a coin to FOMO into another one, the coin I sell goes up. FOMO stands for Fear of Missing Out, it\u2019s a common fear that causes a lot of bad decisions in trading.Let me paint you a picture.You buy $XYZ at $0.25 cents, you\u2019ve done your due diligence, studied the charts for a while, and you\u2019re ready. You didn\u2019t even try to catch the bottom, you know this is a long term hold so you\u2019re fine with your entry. You\u2019re cool as a cucumber.Two weeks pass, $XYZ is still at $0.25 cents. You\u2019re starting to question your beliefs, sense of logic, even your reality. You start getting into arguments with old people at Denny\u2019s about what \u201cmoney\u201d means. The longer your bag sits firmly on the ground and not the \u201cmoon\u201d\u00a0, the more bitter you become.Two more weeks pass. $XYZ is at $0.20 cents. You\u2019re friend John who just got into crypto last week told you about some sh*tcoin called $ABC. You laugh at him for even considering any coin besides $XYZ. Then, a mere 6 hours after John buys $ABC it skyrockets. It goes up 70%, John thinks he\u2019s the king of crypto. He offers you advice, knowing that your coin is still in the gutter.It\u2019s at this fateful moment that you lose sight of what is most important.Your strategy.\u201cScrew it!\u201d, you exclaim.\u201cThis market doesn\u2019t make sense if it rewards idiots like John\u201d, you think.After all, he\u2019s only been trading for 12 hours and he\u2019s up 80%, what kind of sick joke is this. He already got that promotion over you, and now he\u2019s getting all the good trades?!The next day John\u2019s stupid $ABC coin goes up 150%. You stare out your window, not at the beautiful LA skyline, but at the street below. Wondering if jumping out the window would hurt less than watching John tell everyone in the office what \u201cHodl\u201d means as he waves around his hardware wallet. You get home, open up your exchange, and say goodbye to $XYZ. You sell all your holdings, at a loss, and move your capital into $ABC.The next day, $XYZ goes up 800%. John calls you, excited, \u201cCongrats! I saw $XYZ mooned today, oh man I wish I got out of $ABC while I was ahead, It\u2019s down now, practically the same as when I got in. I should have listened to you and bought $XYZ\u201d.Don\u2019t be that person. I\u2019ve been that person, it sucks.Don\u2019t stare at the charts all\u00a0day.Believe it or not, you can\u2019t force a chart to go up or down with Jedi Mind Tricks.Sorry for all the Star Wars references, I watched the Han Solo movie last night.Trust me, I\u2019ve tried. When I first started trading I used to spend countless hours \u201ccharting\u201d. Looking back, if I\u2019m being honest with myself, a lot of those hours were wasted. Sure, I spent a lot of time actually studying and applying what I learned to my trading, but I also spent a lot of time aimlessly staring at a computer screen for hours on end.I learned that the majority of my mistakes where made in moments like those. When I wasn\u2019t being productive, I was needlessly monitoring my holdings like a hawk. It made me more emotional, and it made me overtrade. Two things I now know to avoid at all cost.Sometimes the best thing you can do, is set a limit-order, and walk away.

These include well known tokens, like Stellar, EOS, Tron and Tether\u200a\u2014\u200abut also smaller and less well known cryptocurrencies, like, for example, Civic and Storj.savedroid founder and CEO Dr. Yassin Hankir sees this innovative step as the logical continuation of their business model: \u201cFor us, this was an obvious decision, because savedroid actively wants to contribute to crypto inclusion. With the new ability to be able to take advantage of more than 50 other cryptocurrencies to purchase the savedroid token, we create a unique use case in the crypto community. We are already making a valuable contribution to the easier use of cryptocurrencies today.\u201dHankir wants to especially highlight the Stellar token Lumen (XLM): \u201cWe are convinced that the Stellar Network and XLM have huge potential. That\u2019s why we will offer Lumen beside Bitcoin and Ethereum as one of the first three cryptocurrencies in our new crypto-saving app.\u201dPayment with these cryptocurrencies is possible starting from a purchase amount of 100,000 SVD (1,000 Euro). This is due to the higher administrative overhead associated with this type of payment. Anybody who wants to take advantage of this unique opportunity should hurry.

This has been cited as a \u201ccentral point of control\u201d of the Bitcoin protocol by various parties over the years, but I argue that the question itself is a red herring that stems from an authoritarian perspective\u200a\u2014\u200athis model does not apply to Bitcoin. It\u2019s certainly not obvious to a layman as to why that is the case, thus the goal of this article is to explain how Bitcoin Core operates and, at a higher level, how the Bitcoin protocol itself evolves.The History of Bitcoin\u00a0CoreBitcoin Core is a focal point for development of the Bitcoin protocol rather than a point of command and control. If it ceased to exist for any reason, a new focal point would emerge\u200a\u2014\u200athe technical communications platform upon which it\u2019s based (currently the GitHub repository) is a matter of convenience rather than one of definition / project integrity. In fact, we have already seen Bitcoin\u2019s focal point for development change platforms and even names!In early 2009 the source code for the Bitcoin project was simply a\u00a0.rar file hosted on SourceForge. Early developers would actually exchange code patches with Satoshi via email.On October 30 2009, Sirius (Martti Malmi) created a subversion repository for the Bitcoin project on SourceForgeIn 2011, the Bitcoin project migrated from SourceForge to GitHubIn 2014 the Bitcoin project was renamed to Bitcoin CoreTrust No\u00a0OneWhile there are a handful of GitHub \u201cmaintainer\u201d accounts at the organization level that have the ability to merge code into the master branch, this is more of a janitorial function than a position of power. If anyone could merge into master it would very quickly turn into a \u201ctoo many cooks in the kitchen\u201d scenario. Bitcoin Core follows principles of least privilege that any power bestowed to individuals is easily subverted if it is abused.From an adversarial perspective, GitHub can not be trusted. Any number of GitHub employees could use their administrative privileges to inject code into the repository without consent from the maintainers. But it\u2019s unlikely that a GitHub attacker would also be able to compromise the PGP key of a Bitcoin Core maintainer.Rather than base the integrity of the code off of GitHub accounts, Bitcoin Core has a continuous integration system that performs checks of trusted PGP keys that must sign every merge commit. While these keys are tied to known identities, it\u2019s still not safe to assume that it will always be the case\u200a\u2014\u200aa key could be compromised and we wouldn\u2019t know unless the original key owner notified the other maintainers. As such, the commit keys do not provide perfect security either, they just make it more difficult for an attacker to inject arbitrary code.The Keys to the\u00a0KingdomAt time of writing, these are the trusted PGP fingerprints:71A3B16735405025D447E8F274810B012346C9A6133EAC179436F14A5CF1B794860FEB804E66932032EE5C4C3FA15CCADB46ABE529D4BCB6416F53ECB8B3F1C0E58C15DB6A81D30C3648A882F4316B9BCA03882CB1FC067B5D3ACFE4D300116E1C875A3DThese keys are registered to:Wladimir J. van der Laan <laanwj@protonmail.com>Pieter Wuille <pieter.wuille@gmail.com>Jonas Schnelli <dev@jonasschnelli.ch>Marco Falke <marco.falke@tum.de>Samuel Dobson <dobsonsa68@gmail.com>Does this mean that we are trusting these five people? Not quite. Keys are not a proof of identity\u200a\u2014\u200athese keys could potentially fall into the hands of other people. What assurances do you really get if you run the verify-commits python script?python3 contrib/verify-commits/verify-commits.py\u00a0Using verify-commits data from bitcoin/contrib/verify-commitsAll Tree-SHA512s matched up to 309bf16257b2395ce502017be627186b749ee749There is a valid path from \u201cHEAD\u201d to 82bcf405f6db1d55b684a1f63a4aabad376cdad7 where all commits are signed!The verify-commits script is an integrity check that any developer can run on their machine. When executed, it checks the PGP signature on every single merge commit since commit 82bcf405\u2026 in December 2015\u200a\u2014\u200aover 3,400 merges at time of writing. If the script completes successfully, it tells us that every line of code that has been changed since that point has passed through the Bitcoin Core development process and been \u201csigned off\u201d by someone with a maintainer key. While this is not a bulletproof guarantee that no one has injected malicious code (a maintainer could go rogue or have their keys stolen), it reduces the attack surface for doing so enormously. What are maintainers and how did they attain this role? We\u2019ll dig into that a bit later.Layered SecurityThe integrity of Bitcoin Core\u2019s code must not rely solely upon a handful of cryptographic keys, which is why there are a multitude of other checks in place. There are many layers of security here to provide defense in depth:Pull Request\u00a0SecurityAnyone is free to propose code changes to improve the software by opening a pull request against the master branch on bitcoin/bitcoin.Developers review pull requests to ensure that they are not harmful. Anyone is free to review pull requests and provide feedback\u200a\u2014\u200athere is no gatekeeper or entrance exam when it comes to contributing to Bitcoin Core. If a pull request gets to the point that there are no reasonable objections to it being merged, a maintainer makes the merge.Core maintainers set this pre-push hook to ensure that they don\u2019t push unsigned commits into the repository.Merge commits are optionally securely timestamped via OpenTimestampsThe Travis Continuous Integration system regularly runs this script to check the integrity of the git tree (history) and to verify that all commits in the master branch were signed with one of the trusted PGP keys.Anyone who wants to can run this script to verify the PGP signatures on all of the merge commits going back to December 2015. I ran it while writing this article and it took 25 minutes to complete on my laptop.Release SecurityGitian deterministic build systems are run independently by multiple developers with the goal of creating identical binaries. If someone manages to create a build that doesn\u2019t match the builds of other developers, it\u2019s a sign that non-determinism was introduced and thus the final release isn\u2019t going to happen. If there is non-determinism, developers track down what went wrong, fix it, then build another release candidate. Once a deterministic build has succeeded then the developers sign the resulting binaries, guaranteeing that the binaries and tool chain were not tampered with and that the same source was used. This method removes the build and distribution process as a single point of failure. Anyone with the technical skills can run their own build system; the instructions are here.Once the Gitian builds have completed successfully and been signed off by the builders, a Bitcoin Core maintainer will PGP sign a message with the SHA256 hashes of each build. If you decide to run a prebuilt binary, you can check its hash after downloading and then verify the authenticity of the signed release message with the hashes. Instructions for doing so can be found here.All of the above is open source and auditable by anyone with the skills and desire to do so.Finally, even after going through all of the above quality and integrity checks, code that is committed into Bitcoin Core and eventually rolled into a release is not deployed out onto the network of nodes by any centralized organization. Rather, each node operator must make a conscious decision to update the code they run. Bitcoin Core deliberately does not include an auto-update feature, since it could potentially be used to make users run code that they didn\u2019t explicitly choose.Despite all of the technical security measures that are implemented by the Bitcoin Core project, none of them are perfect and any of them can theoretically be compromised. The last line of defense for the integrity of Bitcoin Core\u2019s code is the same as any other open source project\u200a\u2014\u200aconstant vigilance. The more eyes that are reviewing Bitcoin Core\u2019s code, the less likely that malicious or flawed code will make it into a release.Code CoverageBitcoin Core has a lot of testing code. There is an integration test suite that runs against every PR and an extended test suite that runs every night on master.You can check the code coverage of the tests yourself by:Cloning the Bitcoin Core GitHub repositoryInstalling the required dependencies for building from sourceRunning these commandsViewing the report at\u00a0./total_coverage/index.htmlAlternatively, you can view the coverage report Marco Falke hosts here.Code Coverage\u00a0ReportHaving such a high level of test coverage means that there is a higher level of certainty that the code functions as intended.Testing is a big deal when it comes to consensus critical software. For particularly complex changes, developers sometimes perform painstaking mutation testing\u200a\u2014\u200athat is, they test the tests by purposely breaking the code and seeing if the tests fail as expected. Greg Maxwell gave some insight into this process when he discussed the 0.15 release:\u201cThe test is the test of the software, but what\u2019s the test of the test? The software. To test the test, you must break the software.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aGreg\u00a0MaxwellFree Market CompetitionBitMEX wrote a great article about the ecosystem of Bitcoin implementations. There are over a dozen different Bitcoin compatible implementations, and even more \u201ccompeting network\u201d implementations. This is the freedom of open source\u200a\u2014\u200aanyone who is dissatisfied with the efforts of the Bitcoin Core project is free to start their own project. They can do so from scratch or they can fork the Core software.Competing with Bitcoin CoreAbstract: We examine the power and dynamics of the \"Bitcoin Core\" software project and we draw distinctions between the\u2026blog.bitmex.comAt time of writing, 96% of reachable Bitcoin nodes are running some version of Bitcoin Core. Why is this the case? How can Bitcoin Core have near-monopoly status over the network of nodes if the effort required to switch to another software implementation is minimal? After all, many other implementations provide RPC APIs that are compatible with, or at least highly similar to Bitcoin Core.I believe that this is a result of Bitcoin Core being a focal point for development. It has orders of magnitude more developer time and talent backing it, which means that the code produced by the Bitcoin Core project tends to be the most performant, robust, and secure. Node operators don\u2019t want to run the second best software when it comes to managing money. Also, given that this is consensus software and the Bitcoin protocol does not\u200a\u2014\u200aand arguably can not\u200a\u2014\u200ahave a formal specification because no one has the authority to write one, it\u2019s somewhat safer to use the focal point implementation because you\u2019re more likely to be bug-for-bug compatible with most of the rest of the network. In this sense, the code of the development focal point is the closest thing to a specification that exists.Who Are the Core Developers?People who are unfamiliar with the Bitcoin Core development process may look at the project from the outside and consider Core to be a monolithic entity. This is far from the case! There are frequent disagreements between Core contributors and even the most prolific contributors have written plenty of code that has never been merged into the project. If you read the guidelines for contributing you may note that they are fairly loose\u200a\u2014\u200athe process could be best described as \u201crough consensus.\u201dMaintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will judge the general consensus of contributors.Who are the Bitcoin Core maintainers? They are contributors who have built up sufficient social capital within the project by making quality contributions over a period of time. When the existing group of maintainers believes that it would be prudent to extend the role to a contributor who has exhibited competence, reliability, and motivation in a certain area, they can grant commit access to that person\u2019s GitHub account. The lead maintainer role is for someone who has oversight over all aspects of the project and is responsible for coordinating releases. It has been voluntarily passed along over the years:Satoshi Nakamoto: 1/3/09 - 2/23/11Gavin Andresen: 2/23/11 - 4/7/14Wladimir van der Laan: 4/7/14\u200a\u2014\u200apresentActing as a Bitcoin Core maintainer is often referred to as janitorial work because maintainers don\u2019t actually have the power to make decisions that run contrary to the consensus of contributors or of the users. However, the role can be quite taxing due to the extra attention from the ecosystem at large. For example, Gregory Maxwell gave up his maintainer role in 2017 for personal reasons, likely due to the public pressure he experienced during the scaling debate. Wladimir wrote a thoughtful post about the stress of being a Core maintainer and why it was appropriate to remove Gavin\u2019s commit access, which upset a lot of people.Dazed and confused, but trying to continueI'm happy with the job I'm doing, happy to work with a few very smart people on an extremely interesting project\u2026laanwj.github.ioSimilarly, when Jeff Garzik was removed from the GitHub organization, he and others were upset about it, but he had not contributed to Core in two years. Leaving his GitHub account with write access to the repository was providing no benefit to the project\u200a\u2014\u200ait was only creating a security risk and violated the principle of least privilege to which Wladimir referred in his post.Others may look at Core and believe it to be a technocracy or ivory tower that makes it difficult for new entrants to join. But if you speak to contributors, you\u2019ll find that\u2019s not the case. While only a dozen people have had commit access over the years, hundreds of developers have made contributions. I myself have made a few small contributions; while I don\u2019t consider myself a \u201cCore developer\u201d I technically am one. No one can stop you from contributing!One of the most difficult things for people to wrap their mind around seems to be that the focal point for Bitcoin development is not simply the structure that is defined by the Bitcoin Core GitHub account. While Bitcoin Core has some structure (it uses centralized communications channels in order to coordinate), the project itself is not subject to being controlled by any of its participants\u200a\u2014\u200aeven those who have escalated privileges on the GitHub repository. While it is technically possible for a maintainer-organized coup to hijack the GitHub repository, censor dissenting developers, and perhaps even maintain the brand name of \u201cBitcoin Core,\u201d the result would be that Bitcoin Core would stop being the development focal point. Developers who disagreed with the actions of the maintainers would simply fork the code and shift their work to a different repository over which the Bitcoin Core maintainers had no administrative privileges.Even absent a \u201ccoup\u201d per se, if a controversial change did somehow make it into Core, some developers would fork the software, remove the controversial change, and make it available for users. You could argue that this is exactly what happened when Amaury Sechet forked Bitcoin Core and removed the Segregated Witness functionality to create Bitcoin ABC. Alternatively, if Core rejects proposed changes that some people want, developers can fork it and add those changes. This has happened many times, such as when:Mike Hearn forked Core to create Bitcoin XTAndrew Stone forked Core to create Bitcoin UnlimitedJeff Garzik forked Core to create BTC1Forking the code is easy. Shifting the focal point of Bitcoin development is hard\u200a\u2014\u200ayou must convince contributors that their time is better spent contributing to a different project.It\u2019s also hard to convince many people that users do not blindly follow Bitcoin Core\u2019s changes\u200a\u2014\u200athis may be a self reinforcing belief, because if users don\u2019t participate in the consensus process by staying aware of their options, they are ceding some of their power to developers. However, the power of the users was exercised during the UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) movement of 2017. An anonymous Bitcoin developer using the pseudonym shaolinfry proposed BIP 148, which would force miners to activate Segregated Witness functionality at a block height that would occur near August 1. However, BIP 148 proved to be too controversial to be adopted by Bitcoin Core, so shaolinfry forked Core and made \u201cBitcoin UASF\u201d software available. This software implementation gained a nontrivial amount of traction and seemed to create sufficient pressure to convince miners to adopt BIP 91 to activate the fork before the BIP 148 deadline.In my opinion the best Bitcoin Core contributors are those who practice extreme ownership. Case in point\u200a\u2014\u200awhile John Newbery did not write the code that contained this particular consensus bug, he feels responsible for not preventing it from being merged via careful review and for not finding it later while writing test cases.We are all Satoshi.Visualization of Bitcoin Core developmentContributing to Bitcoin\u00a0CoreIt can feel daunting to start contributing to Core, though there are plenty of resources available to help aspiring developers. The guidelines for contributing can be found here though you may wish to start off with Jimmy Song\u2019s gentle introduction:A Gentle Introduction to Bitcoin Core DevelopmentIf you\u2019re a developer and you own any Bitcoin at all, contributing to Bitcoin Core can be one of the best things you\u2026bitcointechtalk.comCore developer Eric Lombrozo also penned a piece about understanding how changes take place within the Core repository:The Bitcoin Core Merge ProcessA major point of confusion, especially among people who have not worked a lot on free open source software development\u2026medium.comAlex B. wrote an excellent article about the philosophy behind Bitcoin development\u200a\u2014\u200aanyone who wants to become a serious contributor can save themselves a lot of time by reading this.The Tao Of Bitcoin DevelopmentOver the last few years, the buzz generated by Bitcoin\u2019s scaling debate has drawn unprecedented attention towards the\u2026medium.comA specific example may be helpful\u200a\u2014\u200awhile writing this article I encountered difficulties while trying to run the verify-commits.py script on my machine in order to audit the integrity of the GitHub commit history. In order to save future developers from having to deal with these issues, I opened a pull request to improve the documentation. As you can see from the PR history, 4 different developers chimed in with suggestions for how I could improve my pull request. This ranged from using different wiki markup to a simplified bash command to a new parameter that could be used in the verify-commits.py script. I agreed that all of the suggestions made sense, so I incorporated them into my code and pushed an updated version for my pull request. At that point, the developers who were participating in the review acknowledged that they found the PR to be acceptable, and maintainer Marco Falke tagged it for inclusion in the 0.18 release. After several more days went by with no objections from developers, the code was merged into Core by maintainer Samuel Dobson.Who Controls\u00a0Bitcoin?As I\u2019ve argued extensively over the years, it\u2019s practically impossible to fully comprehend Bitcoin as a system. The definition (control) of Bitcoin the protocol is like the definition of a language. Languages emerge spontaneously; the consensus over the meaning of words is organic rather than dictated by dictionaries. Much as dictionaries describe the phenomenon of a language rather than define it, so do Bitcoin implementations describe the language of Bitcoin with code. No one is forced to agree with the definition of a given word in a dictionary, neither are they forced to agree with code in a given Bitcoin implementation by running it.Languages are not governed by democracy and neither is Bitcoin; while you may hear people make references to miners, nodes, developers, or users \u201cvoting\u201d there is no such mechanism that can enable a majority vote of any kind to coerce a minority of dissenters into accepting changes with which they disagree. Bitcoin is anarchy\u200a\u2014\u200awithout rulers, but not without rules. The rules are defined and enforced by individual participants on the network.While changes to the Bitcoin protocol itself are usually made via the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process, even this is only a recommended best practice and no one can be forced to follow it. It is merely a more formalized way of trying to guide a change through a process of peer review and consensus building.As difficult as this is to explain and understand, it is a crucial aspect to Bitcoin\u2019s antifragility\u200a\u2014\u200aif there was a single point of control, it would also be a single point of failure that would be exploited by powerful entities that are threatened by Bitcoin\u2019s success. Ultimately, each node operator governs themselves by ensuring that no one else on the network is breaking the rules to which they agree. This security model is the foundation for Bitcoin\u2019s bottom-up governance.How self governance results in emergent consensus.No one controls Bitcoin.No one controls the focal point for Bitcoin development.", "responses": "20"}, {"title": "Why the heck Bitcoin \u2018might\u2019 split in\u00a0two?", "author_name": "Mohit Mamoria", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-august-1-fork-5d8249407f3a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 25, 2017", "readtime": "12 min read", "upvotes": "1.8K", "content": "Why the heck Bitcoin \u2018might\u2019 split in\u00a0two?Everything you wanted to understand about potential August 1 fork but were afraid to\u00a0ask.Mohit MamoriaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 25, 2017https://themerkle.com/should-you-be-concerned-about-a-bitcoin-chain-split-on-august-1st/There\u2019s a lot of fuss in the bitcoin community about what will happen on August 1. Will the cryptocurrency split into two new ones? Will it not? What is BIP 91? What is BIP 148? What is SegWit?The incredibly significant date is just around the corner but there are still so many unanswered questions!By the way, I am curator of a weekly newsletter, Unmade, which delivers one idea from the future to your inboxes.I have put together this guide to walk you through the whole situation to keep you informed about the developments. As of this writing, it seems like, bitcoin will avoid the chain split\u200a\u2014\u200afor now. However, even though it seems like the opposing parties have reached a joint conclusion, there\u2019s still a lot that needs to happen to avert the split.To understand what\u2019s actually happening and why the bitcoin community has split into two, it\u2019s best to take a look at one of the fundamental issues of cryptocurrency\u200a\u2014\u200aor to be more exact\u200a\u2014\u200ahow people disagree about how to fix that issue.On one side, there are the people who manage the open sourced software for bitcoin. They are like the organisation/community that keeps the development on the bitcoin protocol running. On the other side are the miners, who deploy computers to run the bitcoin network (blockchain). Both sides are crucial to keep the bitcoin running\u200a\u2014\u200aone side can\u2019t do it without the other. And to fully understand the issue, you need to understand the mechanics of bitcoin, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to explain the complete deal with bitcoin chain split in this guide.What is the problem with\u00a0bitcoin?\u201cDeath is the solution to all problems. No man\u200a\u2014\u200ano problem.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aJoseph\u00a0StalinMost people think of bitcoin as a digital currency that you can use to buy and sell things online. That\u2019s technically correct, but that\u2019s not bitcoin\u2019s real value.Bitcoins aren\u2019t really feasible for everyday transactions, and we\u2019re nowhere near being able to walk into a Starbucks and pay for our coffee in bitcoins. But why is that? Wouldn\u2019t make sense for the makers of bitcoin to implement it as an real alternative to other currency, and thereby increase the value of bitcoin?Well, the reason that hasn\u2019t happened is that the bitcoin blockchain is slow and expensive. It\u2019s nowhere close to meeting the standards for payment technology as the bitcoin network can process up to six transactions per second, while the VISA network can process over 1600 transactions per second.The only way the general public will adopt to the decentralized network is if it will be as fast and convenient as existing payment networks. Unless that happens, bitcoin will be used mostly as an instrument to store value.Why is the network so\u00a0slow?\u201cThe horse I bet on was so slow, the jockey kept a diary of the trip.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aHenny\u00a0YoungmanBitcoin\u2019s network is built on top of a blockchain. If you haven\u2019t yet read the ultimate guide to understanding blockchain, think of blockchain as a register containing several pages (blocks) where each page contains several transactions. As soon as a page has been filled with transactions, it needs to be added to the register before starting to record transactions on the next page.Before a page (block) can be added to the register (chain), there\u2019s some processing that needs to be done to ensure that everyone agrees with the contents it contains. The process approximately takes 10 minutes for each block.Imagine, you are sending 1 BTC to your friend, Joe. The transaction will look something like this.Among other things, a transaction contains information about the sender, the recipient, the amount and the transaction fee.Wait a minute, transaction fee? Yes, there\u2019s an additional fee that you can pay to incentivize miners to include your transaction in a block as soon as possible. There\u2019s no set price and it\u2019s entirely up to you how much you are willing to pay to speed up the process.At any given moment, there are several transactions available to be recorded on the current page. If you look for number of unconfirmed (pending) transactions any time through the day, the number will always be close to ten thousand. That\u2019s when the 99 percent of the world is yet to come to cryptocurrencies. The number then can easily be north of several millions.The miners (computers working in the blockchain network) have to decide which of the available transactions to include in the current block. To help them decide, they look at which transactions yield the most rewards\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning that the transactions with the highest transaction fee will be included first.If there are enough transactions with higher transaction fee than yours to fill up the block, your transaction will have to wait in queue. The wait can last from a few minutes to a few hours. And sometimes, even days. The more you pay in transaction fee, the quicker your transaction is processed.For the users, using Bitcoin has become slow and expensive. Not exactly what the \u2018money of the internet\u2019 should be like.However, this has prompted smart people to ask an important question: \u201cHow can we scale the capacity of the bitcoin blockchain?\u201dThe funny thing is that there were too many smart people asking that question. The people who are running Bitcoin (the people who are maintaining the open sourced code that runs on people\u2019s computers) believe in one solution, while the miners (the people who run the code on their own computers) believe in another.The solution proposed by the people running Bitcoin favors the users, while the solution proposed by the miners favors themselves (what a surprise!). It\u2019s this disagreement that\u2019s led to the confusion around August 1 and the potential split of the Bitcoin blockchain.

While browsing throughout the day I realize there is very few information given related to the bitcoin mining. It\u2019s necessary to understand bitcoin and also the terms associated with the digital currency (bitcoin). To know their importance and how they are used and when you have to read this article. Bitxoxo has every answer to your question.Let\u2019s get introduced to one of its parts and its peculiarities.What does the term bitcoin mining mean?Have you ever thought from where does this currency (bitcoin) generate? As we all know it is a virtual currency that circulates everywhere on the web. You can buy, sell and takes it for a gift card that works globally. The answer to your question is a single word that is \u201cmining\u201d. Yes, bitcoin is mined that involve some method. The bitcoin is mined by the miners and serves as both generating new bitcoin and to add a transaction to the blockchain.The miners who solve the complicated puzzle first get an opportunity to place its block on the blockchain and for each new block, the miner claims and receives a reward. The rewards are a bitcoin which is given to the miner and include its incentive of mining, transaction fees and for newly released bitcoin.Is Bitcoin Mining is Secure?Bitcoin is a free-flowing currency that does not govern by any authority or a central government. In brief, it is a decentralized currency. Anybody who uses the internet well and has a good knowledge of hardware with the high-speed internet connection can begin with mining of bitcoin and become the miner.The bitcoin mining is well secured, as it is a decentralized currency it makes decisions depending on consensus. That is, if there is a conflict regarding the block to be added or not into the blockchain, the decision will be taken with the majority. The mining power goes with the greater majority consensus.In the case where a company or an individual have the large proportion of bitcoin network\u2019s mining power, then they get the authority to corrupt the block chain using their power. This process of controlling and damaging the blockchain applying the mining power is known as 51% attack.The cost loss from this type of attack on blockchain depends on what quantity mining power was concerned with the bitcoin network. This indicates the protection of the bitcoin depends on the miners engaged for the mining power. The earning of the miner straightaway depends on the mining power that is used in the network. The incentives block releasing reward and the transaction fee enclosed within the value.Bitcoin Supply and Block RewardBlock reward is the amount that is given to the miner in a form of reward for every new bitcoin created with each block mined and added to the blockchain. There is no limitation in mining a bitcoin. It can be released every hour with each new block. The quantity of new bitcoins produced per block is estimated to diminish geometrically, with a 50% reduction every 210,000 blocks.The first block added to the blockchain was referred to as Genesis block in 2009 released by Satoshi Nakamoto. And that was the first time the block reward was awarded that was 50 BTC. Within the year 2014, it was 25 BTC. From then it is decreasing and reached to the 25 bitcoin, which will be cut half soon from 25 bitcoin to 12.5 bitcoin. It is believed that the halving in the reward bitcoin will be reflected somewhere in the middle of 2016 when 420,000 blocks are presumed to be mine.Transaction FeesThe transaction fee is calculated with the bitcoin while transaction from one to another address. Basically, it is given in a form of reward to the miner with every new (bitcoin) block that is produced successfully. The miner has the authority to assign the fee to himself for every new bitcoin released. As the entire data for the transaction including block and transaction fee is managed by the miner of bitcoin. The incentive is given as a reward also works as a motivation for the miner to stay attempting to come up with the new blocks even though the worth of the block isn\u2019t abundant or zero in way future.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Bitcoin Gold: What you need to\u00a0know", "author_name": "Jimmy Song", "link": "https://bitcointechtalk.com/bitcoin-gold-what-you-need-to-know-8b3e645be409?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 9, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "3K", "content": "Bitcoin Gold: What you need to\u00a0knowJimmy SongBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 9, 2017There\u2019s a Bitcoin hard fork around the corner and it\u2019s not 2x.

The goal of BTG is to become a better gold than Bitcoin.

The proof-of-work that they\u2019ve chosen is Equihash, a memory-hard algorithm that\u2019s fairly ASIC resistant and also used by ZCash. The idea is to give mining back to the users who can start using CPUs and GPUs to mine.BTG developers are also considering a premine of up to 1%. How that will be executed is unclear, but will probably consist of taking some of the mining reward as they\u2019re committed to keeping BTG at the 21 million limit.What\u2019s so special about ASIC resistance?ASICs are Application Specific Integrated Circuits. They\u2019re different from CPUs in that they do only one thing, but they do it really, really well.Bitcoin mining is currently completely dominated by ASICs, mostly produced by Bitmain, Bitfury and Canaan. This is largely due to the proof-of-work function (SHA256) being reasonably simple and not requiring much RAM. Equihash, on the other hand, is a pretty complex hashing function and requires a lot of RAM to perform. That means it\u2019s much more expensive to produce ASICs for Equihash and the speed gain isn\u2019t nearly as much.To give you an idea, a normal CPU can mine SHA256 at around 5\u201310 MH/s. An ASIC can mine SHA256 at around 5\u201310 TH/s, or about 1 million times more work per second than a CPU can. By comparison, a normal CPU can mine Equihash at around 10\u201330 H/s, where as specialized equipment can do something like 1000\u20133000 H/s, or about 100 times more work per second.In other words, the playing field is a lot more level with Equihash than SHA256 due to the ASIC-resistance. Of course, it\u2019s hard to know how much economics would change if Equihash were to become as profitable, but suffice it to say that the efficiency gain would still be much less than SHA256.When are they going to Hard\u00a0Fork?Their plan is to pick a block on October 25, 2017 to fork from, hence the date on their webpage. That does not mean that their coin launches on that day, just that the Bitcoin blockchain gets frozen for the BTG chain on that day and new BTG blocks built on top later.Currently, they are planning an early November release, which means that their blockchain will have no blocks for a week or so in between.The Bitcoin Gold developers plan to create a testnet sometime in mid-to-late October. They\u2019ll make their software available soon after.What does it mean for\u00a0me?Bitcoin Gold will only affect you if you own Bitcoin when they pick the hard fork block, that is, around October 25. You will receive the exact amount of Bitcoin Gold as Bitcoin you hold at that block.They are planning strong replay protection, so you probably won\u2019t have to worry about replay attacks. However, you will most likely need to download a wallet or construct transactions manually to be able to move your Bitcoin Gold tokens.Basically, if Bitcoin Gold isn\u2019t worth very much (less than 0.0001 BTC or so), it\u2019s probably not worth doing anything. If it\u2019s actually worth something (say 0.01 BTC or higher), there will be tools that wallet developers will most likely write so you can access your Bitcoin Gold.If you have your Bitcoins on an exchange, the exchange will likely credit you with your Bitcoin Gold eventually. This will especially be true if BTG has value above 0.01 BTC. Generally, it\u2019s better to control your own private keys as that gives you the most flexibility. That said, the fiduciary duty any exchange or merchant has when they take possession of your Bitcoin means they probably have to give you the Bitcoin Gold due to you.ConclusionBitcoin Gold is another hard fork that will bring some changes to the ecosystem. If you\u2019re a holder, there isn\u2019t that much to fear here, and there may be some free money in it for you! If you\u2019re a developer for any wallet or exchange, that\u2019s another story.Want to get curated Technical Bitcoin News?

For months, concerns had been circulating in the media and in online forums that something was off. The company that produced the coin, Tether Limited, had promised since its inception that for each unit it created on the blockchain, one actual U.S. dollar would be held in reserve. But in August 2017, a blogger on Hackernoon.com who goes by Bitfinex\u2019ed started raising questions about whether Tether was really sitting on all those greenbacks. If it wasn\u2019t, the coin wouldn\u2019t really be tethered at all.In response, Tether Limited published a memo from an accounting firm affirming that it was fully backed. But the document fell suspiciously short of an official audit, and doubts only increased. On January 27, 2018, Tether parted ways with the auditor. Then, three days later, Bloomberg\u2019s Matthew Leising reported that Tether Limited and its associated exchange had been subpoenaed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in another attempt to determine whether Tether is in fact backed by dollars. (To date, no charges have been filed.)The fact that a cryptocurrency could shrug off a string of red flags would hardly be newsworthy were it not for the systemic importance of\u00a0Tether.For a currency whose stock-in-trade is reliability, the swelling tsunami of doubt was reason enough to send investors stampeding for the exits. But then, something funny happened: nothing. Buoyed along by the unshakable faith of crypto enthusiasts, Tether sailed on as it always had, hewing within a penny of parity with the greenback. Not only that, but on the same day Tether Limited fired its auditor, it went ahead and issued another $600 million worth of coins, raising its market cap by nearly half.\u201cIf everything was on the up and up with Tether,\u201d wrote blogger and Tether skeptic Bitfinex\u2019ed, \u201cthere\u2019s no way in hell they would have fired the auditor\u2026because the fallout from firing them would be big. Interestingly, they do fire them and nobody cares.\u201dThe fact that a cryptocurrency could shrug off a string of red flags would hardly be newsworthy (indeed, some would say the entire industry has done precisely that since the beginning) were it not for the systemic importance of Tether. It\u2019s currently the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, but even that fact fails to convey its influence over the sector as a whole. Tether is more than just another cryptocurrency; it\u2019s the main currency by which other cryptos, including bitcoin, are priced. The flood of Tether that poured into crypto markets starting in mid-2017 is believed responsible for much of past year\u2019s remarkable run-up in cryptocurrency markets.That was the finding of University of Texas finance professors John M. Griffin and Amin Shams, who in mid-June released a paper on the Social Science Research Network asserting that half of the increase in bitcoin value was due to the injection of Tether. The authors state that patterns observed in publicly available trading data \u201ccannot be explained by investor demand.\u201d Instead, they theorized that \u201cTether is used to support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices.\u201dThe allegation by Griffin and Shams\u200a\u2014\u200awhich no one has managed to refute\u200a\u2014\u200aleads to a staggering conclusion: that the foundation of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, on which billions of dollars now depend, is not what it seems. For all investors know, they have handed Tether a license to simply print money\u200a\u2014\u200amuch like the U.S. Treasury but without the accountability. \u201cIf Tether was in fact able to issue tokens not backed by fiat reserves, then effectively they would be printing U.S. dollars in the cryptocurrency ecosystem,\u201d Wang Chu Wei, a researcher at the University of Queensland who has also studied Tether\u2019s impact on the cryptocurrency market, wrote in an email. \u201cIf that was the case, Tether Limited\u2019s role/power would be not dissimilar to that of a central bank; i.e., the ability to increase money supply and boost asset prices.\u201d", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Getting started with Bitcoin, blockchains, and cryptoassets", "author_name": "Stephen McKeon", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/getting-started-with-bitcoin-blockchains-and-cryptoassets-2e9c1c685576?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 15, 2017", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "3.7K", "content": "Getting started with Bitcoin, blockchains, and cryptoassetsStephen McKeonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 15, 2017Friends and family often ask me where to begin learning about Bitcoin and blockchains.

It\u2019s what you know for sure that just ain\u2019t so.\u201d -Mark Twain***I should have known that even a relatively innocuous bitcoin cash tweet would blow up my notifications over night.What happens when you tweet about Bitcoin\u00a0CashIf you read what I said here, it\u2019s basically:+ the probability is rising that BCH eclipses BTC+ it\u2019s still more likely that BTC fends off BCH+ my probability assumption changed because one of my underlying assumptions about the economic majority in bitcoin changedThe reaction was (maybe predictably) that I was a fickle BCH/ETH/bankster shill who hates BTC. That I\u2019ve changed my positions every other week with respect to my crypto holdings.While that makes for an interesting narrative for the people who are pissed off Bitcoin Cash isn\u2019t dead yet, it\u2019s got the drawback of not actually being true.I was a vocal supporter of the UASF. I was a vocal opponent of SegWit2x. I\u2019d like to see privacy enhancements that improve bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance, and mining decentralization is important. I believe bitcoin thrives as a settlement ledger with layer two solutions for smaller, less important payments (coffee). And Bitcoin has never, to this day, made up less than 50% of my crypto net worth.I\u2019ve not walked back any earlier arguments or assumptions.But you have to think about the universe of cryptoassets in terms of probabilities, and today, bitcoin cash seems relatively undervalued based on my personal probability estimate that it takes the mantle from bitcoin as the industry\u2019s dominant cryptocurrency.So I\u2019m staying hedged.When I first invested in bitcoin in 2013, my assumption was that bitcoin could go to $100k+ in ten years, or it would go to zero. Back then I put the probability of zero at 99%, and $100k at 1%, so expected value was $1,000.I bought at $125. Nice. (I wish I had bought more.)When Ethereum came out, I had 50 reasons to not invest\u200a\u2014\u200athey were boiling the ocean, you could run the smart contract logic off chain and use bitcoin as the settlement chain, it was an unregistered securities offering, there was no defined valuation during the crowdsale, there was large anticipated annual inflation, blah blah blah.I didn\u2019t think in expected value terms because I was an idiot. I finally corrected the mistake and invested a little at $8. (I wish I had bought more.)Today, with most of my net worth tied up in crypto, I take managing risk very seriously. I spend my days working on things that are important to me philosophically and that I think are critical for the long-term health of the industry. (Check out Messari.)But I do not fuck around when it comes to managing my family\u2019s savings.While my core holdings don\u2019t move much, allocations change when there are big price moves or my core assumptions change.And since bitcoin is, has been, and probably will continue to be my largest holding, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about bitcoin cash since SegWit2x was called off. My conclusion is that even if you hate BCH, you have to take it seriously, and understand the near-term threat it poses to BTC. However low you set your own probability assumption for that outcome.Let me explain why I\u2019m no longer convinced the economic majority of bitcoin holders are necessarily wed to BTC by venturing into areas that just aren\u2019t polite to discuss in public:Politics, religion, and bitcoin cash.The Bitcoin Political FrameworkIn many ways, the BTC <> BCH dynamic reminds me of the Brexit vote or the Trump election.The problem is that everyone\u2019s getting sick of the bitcoin scaling / bitcoin hard fork / BTC vs. BCH debate. This comes down to \u201cvoter turn out\u201d and who\u2019s even actively engaged in the election at this point.Those with any remaining energy on the BTC side of things are like the populist backers of Brexit and Trump. Vocal minorities who believe that Core developers can do no wrong because they are the champions warding off the evil miners and corporates.Even when they talk like this:Discourse amongst bitcoin\u00a0friends.On the other side, we watched in slow motion as the NYA signers slowly lost interest and grew tired of supporting their deeply flawed Hillary candidate\u200a\u2014\u200athe 2x hard fork\u200a\u2014\u200aoften at great personal and professional costs.Ultimately, they lost because they were simply worn down by the more aggressive side.But the reality is that the vast majority of voters are sick of both sides\u200a\u2014\u200athe Core developers and the SegWit2x crowd. They\u2019re \u201cexiting\u201d and moving on to other candidates: ETH, XMR/DASH/ZEC, and yes, even BCH, which has truly galvanized the anti-Core base.These are people who think that the way Gavin was treated was bullshit after carrying the project on his back in its formative stages.People who silently shake their heads as they watch the industry\u2019s pioneers get ridiculed and shamed and outright attacked.People who do not care about 1mb vs. 8mb today because they believe that a) mining centralization already exists and b) the bigger and more immediate problem is blockchain usability and congestion, not solving decentralization.The BTC \u201cwin\u201d last week was far from permanent, and may have simply reinvigorated the BCH base, which could now be in a position to attack BTC through a combination of hashing wars, price manipulation and potentially even a large-scale 51% attack.We saw a teaser of this last weekend, and even seasoned execs in the industry were alarmed at the BCH volumes.I know this because several told me as much.The question is whether the BCH tactics will be successful, and whether the economic majority cares more about their savings or their philosophical interests.I am not convinced the BTC crowd can survive the simultaneous price and hashing war.To see why, and at the risk of confusing political analogies (ignore the presidential election example above for a second), I want to revisit a framework that I laid out back in June when I wrote about the UASF:\u201cSatoshi developed a framework (constitution) that set the rules for the initial system design and the mechanisms by which that system should scale. New popular open-source protocol upgrades would get passed once majorities of two primary groups invested in bitcoin\u2019s development, the Core Developers (Senate) and the Application Developers (House) agreed to them. But those upgrades would still need to be recognized and enforced by the nodes in the network itself (Executive) who represented the economic majority. To keep everyone honest, miners were introduced to keep the system humming and select the correct interpretation of the consensus rules whenever there were disagreements (Judiciary).It was never anticipated that those checks and balances would be perfect by themselves. So there was even a process for soft forking the protocol (a constitutional amendment), or hard forking it (a secession from the old state). Bitcoin has had several \u201cconstitutional amendments\u201d in the past, including the original 1mb per block limit and the allowance for multi-sig transactions. The amendment process works.\u201dMy assumption then was that the \u201cHouse Reps\u201d in bitcoin were simply being impatient, and setting bad precedent by allowing miners to \u201clegislate from the bench\u201d and hold up upgrades the vast majority of developers, businesses, and HODLers wanted in the core protocol.I believed that the solution was to band together, and force the issue with the miners. Essentially tell them: \u201cYou guys are utilities. You don\u2019t get to block upgrades you don\u2019t like that everyone else agrees upon.\u201dMy mistake was underestimating how exasperated the business community had become in dealing with the Core developers.Where I previously believed there was general alignment around SegWit from business interests, developers, and holders, I now think the business interests and a large percentage of the holders have gotten so disgusted with Core obstinance that they will follow whichever chain takes economic control\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if it\u2019s one that is ultimately propelled forward by a small handful of Chinese miners in the short-term.In particular, I\u2019ve been reading between the lines from official statements, social media interactions, and conspicuous silence alike from the major bitcoin infrastructure providers.Here\u2019s what I see:The miners: Team Jihan. If the BCH price rallies and there\u2019s a clear path to profitability, the miners will swarm to BCH and maybe even attack BTC. Read Jihan\u2019s tweets and ask yourself this question: \u201cDoes Jihan sound as if he is anything other than in complete control?\u201dThe exchanges: None of them give a shit which asset wins. The rise of BCH is phenomenal for business. Volumes last weekend were absolutely staggering. If you assume the exchanges made an average of 50bps in fees on the BCH pump, the exchanges made $50mm+ of revenue in a 24 hours period last Saturday night. As far as they are concerned, bring on the chaos.Bitfinex\u2019s Phil Potter, last weekend, probably.BitPay: The team here has contributed a great deal to bitcoin\u2019s open-source development\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe more than any other venture-backed company not named Blockstream, yet they have has also caught the most flak for being outspoken about following the bitcoin blockchain that the miners adopt.Blockchain: They are prioritizing BCH support over SegWit. They have been making a push into Ethereum. They were outspoken supporters of SegWit2x until the bitter end.Coinbase: Coinbase is an interesting one. I hope Brian Armstrong reads this and publicly corrects me if I\u2019m wrong. But if I were to speculate on the decisions Coinbase has made to wait until January to release users\u2019 bitcoin cash, it\u2019s not out of corporate greed or a lack of urgency, or anything like that.It\u2019s because Brian knows that he under-estimated Ethereum for a long-time, then underestimated Ethereum Classic\u2019s ability to survive. And it\u2019s because he also knows there is a *small* chance BCH eclipses BTC. To interpret this, you need to check out some of his social media activity, and conspicuous silence on the SegWit2x debate from the get go.One problem is that Coinbase is onboarding a reported 100k users per day. Unfortunately, those new users aren\u2019t getting both coins. Coinbase is between a rock and a hard place there.But I\u2019ll bet you a beer that Brian has not touched his personal BCH. He may be doing users a favor by not facilitating their sale of BCH, and by instead forcing them to have taken the extra step in August to remove balances from Coinbase if they wanted to trade on early information.If you\u2019re Coinbase, facilitating BCH liquidations amidst so much uncertainty could end up seriously reducing your AUM in 2018. Why risk it when you don\u2019t have to? Especially when you\u2019re already worried about the risk to your new users.Grayscale: One of the largest single holders of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, the Bitcoin Investment Trust, is in the process of unwinding 170k+ units of BCH in the next 90 days. Auctions for 20k BCH increments are happening daily via their authorized participant, Genesis. This is in motion, and there\u2019s no going back. Once the largest centralized seller of BCH is finished unwinding their position, who is making the next largest BCH sales to depress price?Xapo: To me, this is the most fascinating company to watch. Xapo is still the Fort Knox of bitcoin, and we will learn a TON about how the BTC <> BCH drama unfolds based on Xapo\u2019s positions related to their proposed \u201cforced conversion\u201d of BCH to BTC in mid-December.I\u2019d put Xapo in the Coinbase bucket, but Wences is a bitcoin maximalist, and has ignored the Sirens\u2019 song of alternatives like Ethereum to date. He\u2019s been unwavering regarding bitcoin as the one true global currency.Anyone who has met Wences for five minutes knows he is the most intense dude in the industry. He\u2019s patient zero for many of the larger institutional investors, his back story about growing up amidst hyperinflation in Argentina borders on folk lore, and if there is anyone that wants bitcoin to succeed for philosophical reasons, it\u2019s him.But as a vocal early proponent for SegWit2x and the NYA, the Xapo team is clearly frustrated with the lack of block scaling. Wences\u2019 gracious tweet about being \u201cimpatient\u201d on scaling was far from a tacit endorsement of Core\u2019s approach. Given the alternative between a BCH chain that wins price and hashing power dominance, and a BTC chain that has developer mindshare, I\u2019m not sure which direction Wences and Xapo goes.I don\u2019t even know if they know yet.Xapo could, for liability reasons, rethink its position on the forced December conversion of BCH if the asset keeps rallying.More FUD.All of the above companies, save Xapo, are actively embracing alternatives to BTC, in most cases including Bitcoin Cash. That means that BTC\u2019s moats are eroding like never before as support for other substitutes takes shape, and switching costs plummet.The default option for the vast majority of holders is to sit on both assets and see what happens. And I simply don\u2019t see many large BCH sellers right now.The vocal #no2x sellers liquidated months ago.On the other hand, there may be over one million BTC that get sold into the next BCH attack / bull run (depending on your perspective)\u200a\u2014\u200aas much as 10% of the total BTC money supply.The religious BTC congregation sold BCH at $300+. The religious BCH congregation is selling BTC at $7,000+.Will BTC proponents truly have enough faith to withstand the savage swing a coordinated BCH pump and BTC attack would entail? Will they double down with their savings?Religious Conversions & the End of BTC FaithTo me and many others, bitcoin is not a technical revolution as much as it is a triumph of political and economic incentives. And that\u2019s where the shared illusion of money comes in.The bitcoin faith. The religion of our savior, Satoshi Nakamoto.The key question then has to be whether BTC is on the right side of the political and religious equation and truly has a hard-core economic majority that will buy the dips in the face of an attack on the BTC blockchain.When looking at which way the economic majority may swing, I\u2019ve considered:1) The muted \u201cwhale\u201d support for BTC, and the fact that most of the vocal #no2x community members have already sold their \u201cfree\u201d BCH many months ago. Current potential selling pressure is limited.2) The silent majority of HODLers who just want the whole digital gold and peer-to-peer cash system to not break, and whose only concern is that things get resolved one way or the other so we can move forward. I submit that they will follow the chain with the highest price and hashing power without fuss.3) So we\u2019re left with the question: what of the religious BCH base? Do they have the juice to brute force BCH into prominence?And this is where you have to look at Bitcoin\u2019s religious roots and clarify what the bona fide BCH sympathizers and zealots are thinking today\u2026For literally years now we talk about raising the bitcoin block size. We talk about rising fees threatening existing bitcoin business models and pricing out the unbanked that were supposed to benefit from Satoshi\u2019s peer-to-peer electronic cash system.SegWit gets widely accepted as a novel approach to scale bitcoin, but many contended that it won\u2019t be enough (by itself) to solve block congestion issues in an exploding bitcoin economy.Bitcoin Jesus wants people to be able to use bitcoin as currency. Then Bitcoin Jesus becomes Bitcoin Judas in the eyes of many for a stark philosophical difference that he won\u2019t back down from.A crusade ensues.Theymos vs. Roger. Bitmain vs. Blockstream. SegWit vs. Big Blocks.The Eastern miners take exception to what they feel are moving goalposts by arrogant Western Core developers, and get sick of being vilified as the evil trusted third parties in bitcoin transaction processing. \u201cNo SegWit until we raise block sizes,\u201d they say.A vocal contingent of the bitcoin community starts banging the drum for the UASF. Blockstream\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer goes full Trump campaign and uses hats and trolling to go on the offensive.It kinda works.So \u201cthe adults\u201d head to NYC and compromise. The miners say \u201cwe\u2019ll give you SegWit, if you give us our 2mb blocks.\u201d The NYA gets struck by the oligopoly and it (rightly) raises alarm bells for those who weren\u2019t in the room.Wtf is this? OPEC?Only some of the signers have a religious conviction in bitcoin.Most simply want a united front and for bitcoin to evolve organically in the same direction.But a schism proves unavoidable because one contingent asserts that they need to protect against the UASF, especially since many of the current core developers that support it had previously dismissed bitcoin for years before \u201chijacking\u201d the project. They create BCH.Months later, that decision proves prescient. The #no2x contingent wins the SegWit2x debate, and 2x gets called off.The 1mb block size and bitcoin as a settlement layer with layer two scaling solutions is seemingly codified as the BTC roadmap. But an 8mb blockchain now exists that has been laying in fallow. It now has the support from the scorned Eastern miners and a not-to-be-ignored contingent of uber-wealthy BTC whales who have been quietly doubling down on their back-up plan.That back-up plan starts picking up steam in Asia. The BCH price ticks up in the days following the SegWit2x cancellation. Then the first pump comes in the middle of the night on a Saturday. $10 billion of volume isn\u2019t something that can be easily faked. The test run raises eyebrows.Many start to viscerally hate the BCH crowd. \u201cNow they are truly attacking us.\u201dThe Eastern zealots think: \u201cWe were patient. We compromised. We tried the united front thing. But some people can\u2019t be reasoned with. We\u2019ll do a hostile upgrade of the network if needed. Because we can, and it\u2019s right. Let\u2019s see if the BTC crowd has the conviction to withstand a fork of bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work. Because we can withstand some short-term price hits.\u201dThis doesn\u2019t end well for anyone, perhaps, but the scenario I can\u2019t get out of my head is this:Last Saturday was a trial run.Most BTC zealots have sold their BCH.The vast majority of bitcoiners will default to the most secure chain with the highest price and accumulated difficulty.And the BTC defectors haven\u2019t even showed their true economic clout, which is in the many billions of dollars.The next play could be the all-out BCH pump and BTC dump. It could be paired with a massive and sustained shift in hashing power to the BCH chain, and potentially a series of 51% attacks on BTC.As people who don\u2019t have the pre-fork BCH exposure panic to buy BCH as a hedge, others panic sell, a flippening occurs, and BCH has a multi-week sustained premium while BTC remains cripplingly slow crawling into a difficulty adjustment.I hope it doesn\u2019t happen. But we aren\u2019t in economic territory anymore.This is the last battle in the great crusade for bitcoin\u2019s future as settlement chain or peer-to-peer cash. And the only assumption that matters is how big a BTC stake you think the BCH purists have. I think it could be north of 5% of total supply and as high as 10%.And I\u2019m not going to be underweight BCH during that sort of all-out war. Because it\u2019s stupid from an expected value perspective.***Some or all of what I wrote above could be wrong. Much of it is informed conjecture based on multi-year relationships in the industry, intuition, and of course, my personal probability estimates, which are that BCH has a ~20% chance of eclipsing BTC.I welcome clarifications from the companies referenced above. And I\u2019ve never shied away from being wrong. Cunningham\u2019s Law is how I\u2019ve developed most of my relationships in this industry, anyway. I just haven\u2019t seen much informed and measured discussion about the BCH threat to date.Either way, I\u2019m HODLing.***If you\u2019ve been in this industry for any length of time\u200a\u2014\u200adespite the peaks and valleys and chaos\u200a\u2014\u200ayou know we\u2019ve got a lot to be thankful for this year especially.Stay safe out there, and Happy Thanksgiving!", "responses": "25"}, {"title": "We\u2019ve All Heard The Question \u201cShould I Invest in Bitcoin?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aHere\u2019s The Best\u00a0Answer", "author_name": "Miguel Cuneta", "link": "https://medium.com/sci-ventures-blog/the-best-way-to-answer-should-i-invest-in-bitcoin-c07a5956620d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 4, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "4.1K", "content": "We\u2019ve All Heard The Question \u201cShould I Invest in Bitcoin?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aHere\u2019s The Best\u00a0AnswerMiguel CunetaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 4, 2017As we near the end of 2017, we are seeing an unbelievable rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price. For us who have been in the industry since the early days, the questions have always been the same, but this time they happen more frequently than ever. It is not uncommon for me to receive at least a message per day from dormant friends (from way back in high school!) or ancient casual acquaintances asking:\u201cIs it too late to invest in Bitcoin? How much do I need to invest in Bitcoin? or Should I invest in Bitcoin?\u201dAnd I have always answered the same thing:\u201cIf you have to ask these questions, maybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201dIf you\u2019re buying Bitcoins just because someone you know doubled their money in the last two months, then your \u201cinvestment strategy\u201d is as sophisticated as trying slot machines with warm seats in a casino. High-risk investing yields high rewards, yes, and there is nothing wrong with that, but you really have to evaluate your decision making process to make sure you are not doing the following:Buying while daydreaming about getting rich without effort.Buying into the hype and immersing yourself in pro-bitcoin websites and forums and other groups that create an irrational feedback loop that, although seemingly harmless, is the last place on earth to get sound financial advice.Making decisions based on the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), which tends to drive people into irrational territory.Borrowing money or investing more than you can afford to lose in numerous younger (and riskier) cryptocurrencies.Although this advice applies to any kind of financial investment, the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency world is highly speculative, maybe even more speculative than any other asset class out there today. It would be foolish to put all your money in even a single stable and traditional investment, what more a brand new technology that is still in an experimental stage?Although the probability of Bitcoin\u2019s value dropping to zero is close to never at this point in time, it has shown that it can drop precipitously in the past.There are many reasons to justify this recent rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price today, and trends show that the price will likely keep rising in the near future, fueling more speculation, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts. The problem begins when people start to think that the price will keep rising, never stabilizing, never stopping to an incredible 6 or 7-digit dollar value in a year or two.The entire market capitalization of cryptocurrencies have increased 1,000% in the last eleven months alone, so to think that \u201cwe will never see $5,000 per BTC again\u201d is pure hubris. Big downswings are almost guaranteed in this business. It could drop from $12,000 to $6,000 or go to $25,000 down to $5,000 in the blink of an eye. Anything can happenIMAGE FROM\u00a0CNBC.COMSome important points to consider:About four years ago, in December of 2013, the price of one Bitcoin hit $1,242, and then fell slowly and painfully down to $195 by January 2015. That\u2019s a drop of 87%. Now imagine this happens again: The price drops sharply to $5,000 or something and then just continuously decreases down to a low of $1,950 over the course of a whole year. I\u2019m not saying that this will happen, but will you be ready if it does?Funny, because that would still be more or less a 100% annual gain from the start of 2017, yet people will be quick to call it the death of Bitcoin, like they have done over 200 times in the last five years.People are free to do what they want to do with their hard earned money. The thing about Bitcoin is that it is all voluntary\u200a\u2014\u200ano one is being forced to invest in it or to use it. Since people will do it no matter what, the best thing to do is to help them be aware of the risks and know how to reduce these risks if possible.Some Tips:Learn about Dollar-cost averaging. It is a great strategy: Buy in small increments over a fixed period of time, in fixed intervals. This way, you can get an average cost on your purchases and avoid the stress of trying to time the swings of the price.You don't have to buy ONE Bitcoin! You can buy fractions of a Bitcoin. Start by trying to buy the minimum, it's as small as P1,000 ($20).Set aside only a small percentage of your net worth or income in investing, not just in Bitcoins but in any kind of investment for that matter. Start at 1% if you must. Make sure that you are not getting in debt or investing more than you can afford.Inform yourself. Resources on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are free and widely available. Learn about what you are getting into, if you have to get into it.Remember that Bitcoin is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme. The technology behind Bitcoin is what makes it valuable, not the exchange rate on Bitcoin exchanges. They have nothing to do with the actual technology that enables Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies.Avoid scammy businesses like cloud mining or Bitcoin investment clubs that ask you for minimum investments, make you recruit others, and guarantee earnings. That is not what this is about.Although Bitcoin and Blockchain technologies are here to stay and have much more room to grow, nothing rises in value to infinity. Have realistic expectations about your financial investments.Finally, this piece is not intended to convince anyone to invest or not to invest in Bitcoins or cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s a public service announcement to everyone out there who is curious about what is going on in the Bitcoin world and want to be informed about the risks and rewards of participating in this technological experiment.At SCI, we strive to build financial applications using Blockchain technologies, connecting people to the digital economy with accessible products and services, and building valuable infrastructure that will facilitate our mission to bring financial inclusion into every Filipino\u2019s hands. Speculating on the price of Bitcoin is not part of our advocacy, and we will never encourage people to buy Bitcoins for this reason.If nothing can stop you and you\u2019ve done enough research to know exactly what you are getting into, use legitimate exchanges (each country or territory usually has a local exchange or brokerage business) with a good track record and proper consumer protection practices.The next couple years will be crucial in the growth of this industry. Reckless investments from the public will only serve to hamper the last nine years of steady growth and innovation. Let\u2019s all help one another by working together and watching each other\u2019s backs as we blaze the trail for the next generation of financial technology, connecting the five-plus billion people that are currently excluded from today\u2019s systems.", "responses": "23"}, {"title": "Bitcoin has Hacked the Attention Economy", "author_name": "Michael K.

We now know that cryptocurrencies will radically alter the future of transactions, innovation and decentralized systems of globalization.For many global citizens, it\u2019s a bit of a revelation and Bitcoin is the flag bearer. It\u2019s so much so, search about Bitcoin has overshadowed everything else as its price has leapfrogged expectations.Traditional money is on the defensive and fiat currencies as they exist now, are outdated. Bitcoin itself is now valued at $160 Bn. and exploding. At $160 billion, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap just passed GE\u2019s. A company that was once the largest company in the world, founded in 1892 with 295,000 employees and 123 billion in revenue.Since it was created in 2009, Bitcoin has experienced significant highs and lows, but at not even 10 years old, nothing could prepare us for 2017. As history reads this, the fanfare and brand recognition of Bitcoin today is unprecedented. How to convey this trend of search and mainstream interest? Bitcoin exceeds searches for controversial publicity seeking President Donald Trump.Business InsiderBitcoin has captured the population imagination, and we now know that Bitcoin and crypto derivatives (dubbed Bitcoin futures) will flood the markets. New more advanced smart contract platforms will be invented and quickly gain in value as cryptocurrencies, evolving faster than money itself is exchanged.Cryptocurrencies and ICOs are signaling a boom of blockchain innovation, unlike the tech and finance world have seen before. They can alter entire industries in months to years, in addition to creating thousands if not millions of new jobs. Further blurring the lines between virtual and real, the Crypto Singularity is disruptive.Chris Burniske via\u00a0Twitter.The frenzy phase of the Crypto Singularity is also a time when foundational new systems can be born that will represent the future infrastructure of blockchain in the quantum web.Bitcoin futures means futures contracts give traders a way to bet on bitcoin prices and earn profits without even buying the actual cryptocurrency. This is a global movement, as inevitable as fiat currencies entering the blockchain with their own cryptocurrency versions. This will kill \u201cmoney\u201d and cash as we know them.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission clearing the way for three firms to launch bitcoin derivatives is less about regulation and more about trying to profit from what amounts to a crypto big-bang. In Japan they\u2019ve embraced Bitcoin and it\u2019s another kind of integration, years ahead of many nation states. Bitcoin trade in Japan accounts for about half of the global trade volume.The Great Bitcoin Rally is just a\u00a0SymbolIf Bitcoin has hacked the attention economy, it\u2019s because the Crypto Singularity is aligned to the values of Millennials. There\u2019s no other way to explain it, young people around the world are tired of elitist centralized institutions and governments controlling their destiny, from big banks, to greedy politicians to very ideas of inherited wealth and stifling wealth inequality.As blockchain momentum grows, capitalism must adapt or face the consequences. The Crypto Singularity in this sense is nothing short as a war of values for a better world.If Bitcoin has gained nearly 1,000% against the dollar, it\u2019s not only that we\u2019re putting our money where our mouth is, it\u2019s that our heart wants to invest in a new kind of world, not only where the 1% gain the majority of all future earnings and profits. At the root of the Crypto Singularity is the preference of young people for a decentralized implementation of social justice, and however many decades it takes, in the scope of history, that\u2019s the end-game of how disruptive the blockchain could be on the global banking system, economy and outdated identity politics of nation states.If Bitcoin is a virtual currency and commodity (crypto asset) unlike any the commission has dealt with in the past, the rate of innovation in cryptocurrencies, ICOs and blockchain is the transition from one world, to the next. It\u2019s up to the young people involved to shape the future where wealth distribution itself can be fundamentally altered and anything less than this would be a failure of the original intention behind Bitcoin.Crypto assets aren\u2019t just digital stores of value then, they are the representation of the momentum of disruptive values on corrupt and outdated infrastructures, institutions and governments that no longer are aligned with the people. Humans collectively need the blockchain just like we need artificial intelligence, to help us govern ourselves in a more enlightened way. Disruption fundamentally is not just digital or technological, it\u2019s economic and political.The values of Satoshi Nakamoto is a weapon against fraud, corruption and the machinery where a few profit at the expense of the many. The Bitcoin surge is indicating that as young people embrace ideas of decentralization, transparency, security, smart contract consensus and evolving methodologies of proof of work, we are engineering a better future for humans.", "responses": "26"}, {"title": "The Big Bitcoin Battle: What I Found Out About Bitcoin VS\u00a0BCash", "author_name": "Miguel Cuneta", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/the-big-bitcoin-battle-what-i-found-out-about-bitcoin-vs-bcash-d9ebca8d370e?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 14, 2017", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "5.7K", "content": "The Big Bitcoin Battle: What I Found Out About Bitcoin VS\u00a0BCashMiguel CunetaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 14, 2017Image Source: Leaprate.comUPDATE: Since I last posted this a few days ago, the Segwit2X fork had a fatal error that doomed its implementation. If Bitcoin had adopted it, it would have been a catastrophic failure costing tens of billions of dollars. This is the very reason why I focused on the competence of the development team and engineers in this piece.The last several days have been quite the roller coaster ride for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency holders. If you are new to this, fix your hair, have a sip of water, walk it off a little bit, then settle down and grab a seat. If you are a grizzled veteran, you\u2019re likely a bit excited about the free fall (after months of going up, up, up) and your heart rate is probably a bit elevated, but nothing to lose sleep over\u200a\u2014\u200ayou know Bitcoin will be fine after the dust settles.One thing that has been proven time and time again in the last 8 or so years is this: Bitcoin is not resilient or resistant to attacks. Bitcoin is much more than that\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin is Anti-fragile.Antifragility is a property of systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures. Bitcoin has come out stronger after every attack on the system and this is no different from past attacks, nor will this be the last attack on the Bitcoin network.So what is happening, you might ask? Simply put, the people running Bitcoin Cash are \u201cplotting the death of Bitcoin\u201d by launching a coordinated attack on the Bitcoin network. Why would they want to do this instead of just making a better version that people will actually want to use, and beat Bitcoin fair and square in the market? Did the Bitcoin Core team force their hand into doing something so desperate? Each side thinks they are right, so it is hard to make an objective call on the matter.So I did a little bit more digging into it. Here\u2019s what I came up with:Bitcoin and BCash in a nutshell:Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, while Bitcoin Cash or Bcash (BCH) is a hard fork of Bitcoin that was activated on August 1, 2017.BTC\u2019s main value proposition is its decentralization, reliability as a store of value, censorship resistance, network effects, and being the \u201cDigital Gold\u201d of the internet age. They want the world\u2019s wealth to transfer into the Bitcoin network.BCH\u2019s main value proposition is that it claims to retain \u2018the original vision\u201d of Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin to be a minimal-fee payment system, much like VISA or Paypal, and to be the \u201cDigital Cash\u201d of the internet age. They want the world\u2019s entire population to be able to use Bitcoin for daily transactions.I also did a lot of research into the nitty gritty on the strengths and weaknesses of both implementations, things like the blocksize debate, scaling, rising transaction fees, network congestion, and more, but I am afraid that would take up too much time and turn this piece into a boring technical discussion. Instead, I will focus on the development team behind both, the main public proponents of each side, and touch on the network\u2019s miners and nodes.The Development Team Behind BTC and BCH:I believe this is probably the most overlooked and underestimated part of the Bitcoin project. Bitcoin is software, and as seen in the recent Ether Parity wallet hack that froze US$300M in user funds, tens of billions of dollars should never be allowed to be run on code that has not been extensively tested by the best engineers in the world. If you were to create a massive bridge that will transport millions of people across an ocean, would you hire low-level engineers to build and constantly maintain and upgrade it? You would want only the best to handle such a project. With Bitcoin, potentially trillions of dollars will flow through the network\u200a\u2014\u200awe can\u2019t have amateurs tinkering with the code.Bitcoin Core development has some of the best crypto-developers in the world working on the project. It has a large open source developer community with many casual contributors to the codebase, as well as research, peer review, testing, documentation, and translation. They have an unparalleled record of releasing well-tested and thoroughly reviewed code. In the last week alone, there have been over 100 commits on Github\u200a\u2014\u200athe development is constant for the last half a decade and of the highest level possible for any open-source project. The confidence needs to be high because the project is now worth $100+ Billion. I would say you can be sure they are putting out top-notch code every single time.Bitcoin Cash, at the time of this writing, had one Github commit in the last 13 days. Their development team is composed of one to two full-time developers and a handful of unknown others. If you want to know who they are, you cannot even find them on the Bitcoin Cash Website (please correct me if I am wrong). The level of development on the project is largely untested, has no track record on how disputes between developers are resolved or when something is production ready, and no diverse set of developer testing. For an overnight $20 Billion project, this does not inspire much confidence in people.The Main Proponents of Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash: Who are the people behind the two?Here is where it got a bit interesting.Bitcoin has the Bitcoin Core development team, a group software engineers that have been working on Bitcoin development for the last several years, mostly voluntarily. Known personalities are Dr. Adam Back, the inventor of hashcash, the proof-of-work system used by several anti-spam systems and is the work quoted by Satoshi Nakamoto himself as the basis behind Bitcoin\u2019s POW system. He is also the CEO of Blockstream. Then there is lead developer Dr. Pieter Wuille, who discovered Bitcoin in 2010 and has been a Bitcoin Core developer since May 2011. In 2012, Wuille published BIP 32, which added hierarchical deterministic wallets to Bitcoin. SegWit is his brainchild, now activated in the network. Then there is lead maintainer Wladimir Van Der Laan, whose salary is paid by the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.These people are software developers of the highest order, no doubt about that. They have been working on Bitcoin before it was cool, and naturally got the support of the largest players in the community simply on the merits of their work and their stellar past reputations.Bitcoin Cash\u2019s, most well-known proponents are Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, Calvin Ayre, and Craig Wright\u00a0, publicly championing their version of Bitcoin as the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin and \u201cplotting the death\u201d of Bitcoin. Of these people, only Dr. Wright is a programmer. These are the owners of Bitcoin Cash- They control its code, its mining, its nodes, its marketing, everything. Not only do they claim BCash should be called the only Bitcoin, they have claimed that it is \u201cthe only Blockchain that can do it all\u201d. Some quick research on the backgrounds of these people reveal a few things:Roger Ver was one of the original Bitcoin \u201cevangelists\u201d and did a lot to help Bitcoin early on, investing in several big companies such as Blockchain.info and Localbitcoins, and was known as \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d, but now known more as \u201cBitcoin Judas.\u201d He is also the CEO of Bitcoin.com, which has nothing to do with Bitcoin but is actually a BCash website. He is also a convicted felon in the US after serving 10 months in Federal prison for selling explosives on Ebay. He is the main proponent of Bitcoin Cash.Calving Ayre, a billionaire, was, in 2013, in the top 10 Homeland Security most wanted fugitive list in the US for illegal online gambling and money laundering but was then cleared of his charges in early 2017. He owns Bodog, one of the biggest online gambling platforms. He also insists that BCash should be called Bitcoin, even though he has never contributed anything to actual Bitcoin development in the past.Dr. Craig Wright is known as \u201cfake Satoshi\u201d after claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto but failing to prove it. He is a computer programmer and businessman. He tried to pass off a fraudulent signature, in public, and failed. His \u201cproof\u201d that he is S.N. was proven to be fake and an attempt to dupe people into believing his claim.Jihan Wu is the proprietor of Bitmain, a large mining operator and mining equipment seller from China that controls almost all the hashrate of Bitcoin cash. Known for his patented ASICBOOST, a hidden mining software discovered by the community that gives them an unfair advantage over other miners. Segwit, Bitcoin Core\u2019s upgrade, nullified this, hence the hatred for Bitcoin core.Yes, these are the most notable people behind Bitcoin Cash.Just going to leave this\u00a0here\u2026Bitcoin VS Bcash Mining and Nodes: Know your networkBitcoin Mining has become more distributed and more powerful in the last five years. The funny thing about this is that the biggest supporters of Bitcoin Cash (Antpool, others) are still mining Bitcoin, because it is simply more profitable. Bitcoin Core also has more than 7,800 active full nodes running which is one of the most important factors to be truly decentralized currency. These are real nodes, not run on AWS and paid for by one company.Bitcoin Cash mining is highly centralized. Just check out the image above. If we combine the hash power of Antpool, ViaBTC, and BTC.com (Roger Ver and Jihan Wu\u2019s mining pools) which makes more than 50% hash power. These two people can do a 51% attack anytime they want. Bitcoin Cash also has only 1,200 nodes, with a lot of them running on AWS and bought by the main proponents of Bitcoin cash.Well, we now have some very basic knowledge of the two versions of the protocol, a closer look at the development team which is without a doubt most important part of any software project, an overview of the main personalities supporting each side, and an objective look at the network health in terms of hashrate and node count. If you wish to go down deeper into this rabbit hole, I wish you luck. This was a bit exhausting to write.Supporting the Bitcoin network should be about the merits of the software and the open and decentralized nature of the project. This is a massive undertaking the likes of which the world has never seen before\u200a\u2014\u200ait aims to replace the old way of using and moving money itself. Inevitably, attacks will happen as people resist this change. Thankfully, Bitcoin is Anti-fragile. I believe it will come out stronger.My personal view is that all of these things happening in the crypto world will be part of of a much bigger story in the history of the evolution of money. Years from now, we will look back and probably laugh at this, seeing that all this in-fighting was a big waste of time and will attribute it to growing pains.The real mission remains: a world where value flows as freely as information, and the evolution of money itself rapidly accelerates in the wake of the most disruptive technology ever seen by society\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin, Cyrptocurrency, and Blockchain Technology.Whatever happens after this whole debacle is over, only one thing seems certain\u200a\u2014\u200aThe technology is here to stay and here to break the status quo.All views and opinions in this piece are my own.*", "responses": "40"}, {"title": "The Many Faces of\u00a0Bitcoin", "author_name": "Adam Tach\u00e9", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/the-many-faces-of-bitcoin-1c298570d191?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 10, 2018", "readtime": "20 min read", "upvotes": "5.4K", "content": "The Many Faces of\u00a0BitcoinAdam Tach\u00e9BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 10, 2018By Murad Mahmudov and Adam Tach\u00e9.To nocoiners, gold-bugs, and Keynesians, the cryptocurrency space is best seen as a parasite infecting millennials with technobabble, forcing them to spout economic gibberish, and sucking them into believing the pipedream that a crypto-anarchist society could exist. To believers in the technology, cryptocurrencies represent an escape from the imprisonment of the traditional financial system in which they are forced to participate by being born; a system which has been plagued by inflationary monetary policy, monopoly by nation-states on money creation, malinvestment, and debt. To believers, cryptocurrencies are a starting point to rebuild honesty and a true measure of value in society among borderless, apolitical and decentralized systems.The most prominent and powerful of the cryptocurrency communities\u200a\u2014\u200athe Bitcoin community\u200a\u2014\u200ahas fractured into multiple factions based on desires for various directions to take the protocol and tribalism over different projects altogether. This article will explain some of the current motives driving these ideologies and try to express the reasoning behind this schism.Although this article will be split into four main sections, there is certainly some overlapping thought between individuals who espouse these theories. The two schools of thought which we outline initially\u200a\u2014\u200abitcoin, first and foremost, as a store of value, and bitcoin cash as digital cash\u200a\u2014\u200aare typically considered more mainstream, whereas the last two\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin as catalyst for something John Nash called \u201cIdeal Money,\u201d leading to bitcoin-backed fiat currencies, and finally, looking at Bitcoin from the perspective of information theory and computation\u200a\u2014\u200aare less commonly known.Four Theories About\u00a0BitcoinBitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency ever created. It was released in 2009 as the culmination of nearly three decades of discourse on the key concepts within the cypherpunk community. It was cited by the anonymous founder(s) Satoshi Nakamoto to be inspired by Bitgold by Nick Szabo and B-Money by Wei Dai, two earlier attempts by well-known members at creating functional electronic currency.Most individuals within the Bitcoin community envision an endgame where an implementation of Bitcoin will be a massively adopted cryptocurrency that is both a store of value and a medium of exchange. They see bitcoin eventually being the predominant global currency. However, the ideology then diverges sharply on how this can be accomplished, and which priorities should take precedence along the way.First Theory: BTC as a tamper-proof store of\u00a0value.Tenets: Sound Money. Set-in-stone monetary policy. Full-node affordability. Sovereign-grade censorship-resistance. Maximized decentralization and security.Individuals that fall within the Bitcoin-as-sound-money camp generally believe BTC is the only legitimate cryptoasset, with everything else ranging from being entirely useless at best to blatant scams at worst. Commonly called Bitcoin Maximalists, they desire \u201csound money\u201d by the Austrian Economic School definition, that cannot be inflated away or be at risk of confiscation, as the case was in 1933 when Executive Order 6102, issued by Franklin D. Roosevelt, made ownership of gold illegal in the United States.These individuals believe that, for the foreseeable future, the goal of the Bitcoin project isn\u2019t to facilitate the buying of coffee, but to become \u201chigh-powered\u201d money, an even better form of gold. They claim it to be a digital asset superior to physical gold due to a truly limited supply and more deflationary emission. They also claim that, if used properly, it is unseizable, unhackable, arbitrarily unprintable, and is an attempt to engineer a superior form of money. Bitcoin is often discussed as a settlement network where the raw block space is not meant to facilitate small-value individual transactions. It is believed, rather, that its usage is for settling transactions of a larger value, where fees are less of an issue. This would likely include once-in-a-while settlement transactions of secondary payment solutions, for example, settling millions of Lightning Network payments in one finalizing transaction on the blockchain.Although there are many brilliant concepts that were first brought together in Bitcoin, many Bitcoin Maximalists believe the mining difficulty adjustment may be the most ingenious, as it allows for true digital scarcity that is tied to the external, physical world. Saifedean Ammous is one of the most vocal and prominent BTC Maximalists, and in his new book, The Bitcoin Standard, he states that it is Bitcoin\u2019s high stock-to-flow ratio coupled with its untamperable monetary policy that will eventually make it both the most attractive and the most robust store of value.As of now, most bitcoin holders insist on not spending, a common statement being, \u201cit would be foolish to spend when the price can still increase by a factor of 100x or more.\u201d Instead, many are hoarding the asset, which has become known colloquially as \u201chodling.\u201d For them, hodling is the main use case of Bitcoin during the time before the Tipping Point. The positive feedback loop of hodling and the price increasing encourages an ever-growing army of hodlers. This army in turn collectively increase both the value of the asset and the desirability to hoard it, as supply available on the market becomes increasingly scarcer.This logic is nicely illustrated by Pierre Rochard in the diagram below to show that hoarding may create a positive feedback loop to increase the BTC price, resulting in increased mining profitability, hashing power, user adoption, and more.Bitcoin Market ComponentsBitcoin Maximalists hold the opinion that the key element of Bitcoin is the money it represents, rather than technology behind it. They cite Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cperfect monetary policy\u201d (illustrated in the graph below) combined with the Lindy Effect due to first-mover advantage to explain why BTC will become and remain the dominant currency. The caveat being: Bitcoin must maintain its status as a peer-to-peer, decentralized system which produces a new block randomly, roughly every ten minutes. These Bitcoin Maximalists believe that as long as this is done, eventually hyperbitcoinization will occur, resulting in BTC being the dominant currency in existence.In terms of monetary policy, Bitcoin Maximalists tend to believe that the hyper-disinflationary total money supply of Bitcoin gives it the best monetary policy of any existing asset, and fractional reserve banking is rotten to the core. They prioritize saving and capital accumulation as opposed to superficial consumption. They believe, in line with Austrian school economists, that government meddling, especially with the money supply, causes malinvestment, makes interest rates artificially low, and enriches a select few at the expense of many.Bitcoin Maximalists believe that bitcoin as sound money is to be accomplished through maximizing both the collective and individual security within the system. Currently, the Bitcoin blockchain is by far the most difficult to tamper with of any cryptocurrency in existence, based on hashrate alone. As of April 2018, it is estimated that transactions in Bitcoin are currently secured by confirmations from a network of computing power that produces over 29 exa-hashes per second. This rate is estimated based upon the mining difficulty, which has approximately tripled in the last six months and has grown every year since the release of Bitcoin in 2009.Bitcoin Hashrate (as of April\u00a02018)Bitcoin Maximalists believe that the network hires miners to do one specific job: mine the blocks that full nodes determine to be valid. Thus, they believe users are in control of what Bitcoin validates, not miners. To facilitate this, Bitcoin Maximalists emphasize that users should attempt to be self-sovereign by controlling their own private keys and verifying their own transactions by running full nodes. By minimizing block size and data stored on-chain, users can still manage to run full nodes even on low-bandwidth connections. There are currently over 9000 reachable full nodes among over 100,000 total, which all store copies of the Bitcoin blockchain.Bitcoin Core is the most dominant open source project that uses the Bitcoin protocol. The developers currently responsible for Bitcoin Core are primarily focused on supporting the Lightning Network and other payment channels. They also support CoinJoin for privacy, and are developing more support for side-chains as future second-layer or even third-layer solutions for payments emerge, MAST, and Schnorr signatures and signature aggregation in order to maximize how efficiently block space is used on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are also looking into implementing confidential transactions, potentially using Blockstream\u2019s Elements Project. There is also a proposal to implement confidential transactions as a softfork, using segwit.***Second Theory: BCH as peer-to-peer Digital\u00a0CashTenets: Peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant, borderless cheap transfer of value, without middlemen. High on-chain throughput and on-chain utility. Set-in-stone monetary policy.The members of the Bitcoin Cash community believe that Bitcoin should have unrestricted block sizes in order to facilitate peer-to-peer payments without bounds, and that Satoshi\u2019s original intention was to create a peer-to-peer electronic currency, as opposed to something like digital gold. They generally cite the title and abstract of the Bitcoin whitepaper as proof of their correctness, as well as Satoshi\u2019s statements regarding a phased-in approach to increase the block size, among other writings. These supporters generally believe that the Bitcoin system should not be a settlement layer solely for those who can afford to pay increasing fees, such as banks and other wealthy entities. They are completely against that use case for technological and ideological reasons, and they want to see most activity on-chain.The implementation of Bitcoin that these individuals prefer is called Bitcoin Cash. It aims to gain adoption as a medium of exchange before becoming a store of value by keeping blocks large enough for nearly infinite transactions to take place. It aims to allow all users to transact on-chain, including those who may be underbanked or unbanked, some of whom earn as little as the equivalent of 2 dollars a day.This Bitcoin fork to an alternate implementation was the result of increasingly differing opinions on the technological and social directions the Bitcoin community should head. One example is the disagreement between prominent developers on the implementation of a protocol change implemented in February of 2016, referred to as replace-by-fee. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash supporters clashed on this point of contention: some siding with Mike Hearn\u2019s replace-by-fee counterargument, and some in favor of 0-confirmation transactions to allow for instantaneous payments to maximize utility of Bitcoin, and allow it to essentially be used the same as cash. The side in favor of bitcoin as cash often cites Satoshi\u2019s vending machine example as reasoning for this always being desirable within the system. Still, others believe in researching alternative methods altogether instead of relying on controversial 0-confirmation transactions.Bitcoin Cash supporters believe that a cryptocurrency can only become the dominant currency in existence if it is primarily used in a transactional capacity. Therefore, instead of encouraging hoarding within the community, they maintain that a certain percentage of an individual\u2019s bitcoin cash should be used for spending each month, and some encourage constantly replenishing the spent BCHs. By doing this, they hope to encourage the adoption of Bitcoin Cash as a payment system by incentivizing as many merchants as possible to accept the currency. This seems to be rooted in a desire to smash the nation-state monopoly on money and create a closed loop, with people earning bitcoin cash, spending bitcoin cash, and merchants paying suppliers and employees bitcoin cash.Bitcoin Cash chose not to add segregated witness to their implementation and believe that full nodes that receive and validate transactions but do not mine are irrelevant to the base security of the system. Instead, they believe that hash power is the only thing that can determine the direction of Bitcoin. They believe that miners are the only true full nodes: serving as competing entities, forming a consensus state and generating new blocks. They believe it is normal for large mining farms to arise in such a system, and as supporting proof, they often cite Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s server farm post.In \u201cProof of Work as it relates to the theory of the firm,\u201d Bitcoin Cash supporters describe the system as a multi-leader-follower Stackelberg game where miners serve as rational actors controlling hash power. Under this type of Stackelberg game, miners are to be in constant, non-cooperative competition with each other to maximize profits by optimizing their efficiency in generating new blocks by handling their quantity of hashrate.In the medium-term roadmap, Bitcoin Cash developers plan to re-enable certain scripts included in Bitcoin transactions, known as op-codes, which would allow for more utility with smart contracts. They want to launch tokenization on-chain over the next year as an upgraded version of Colored Coins, through a competition for a five million pound prize. The goal being to both increase merchant adoption of the cryptocurrency and consume alternative smart contract platform use cases by unlocking the full ability of scripts in Bitcoin. They also plan on launching on-chain privacy through Oblivious Transfers.A paper investigating Bitcoin Cash as infrastructure for internet commerce discusses miners being divided into specific task groups without modifying the underlying Bitcoin protocol. For example, processing nodes could reference a limited subset of the blockchain, others could store the complete blockchain, others could be for monitoring, and still others for propagating information. The paper also introduced distributed autonomous corporations as systems that live on additional layers to allow for more efficient information propagation. These corporations could also be autonomously verified for integrity by third-parties. The paper goes on to describe hypothetical fast payment networks which would operate through on-chain assurance contracts for merchants to pay for \u201cpreferentially propagated transactions,\u201d and be operated by distributed autonomous corporations. The paper also proposes that distributed autonomous corporations could be used for double-spend monitoring to allow merchant rejection of consumer payments within seconds, or in time for vending machine to stop from releasing an item.Bitcoin Cash supporters view it as more than a simple payment system; for example, some view Bitcoin as a robust dual-stack pushdown automaton (2PDA) from the alt-stack and main-stack present in the Bitcoin scripting language. As discussed in this video from a Bitcoin Cash supporter conference, it is hypothetically possible that Bitcoin can operate as a Universal Turing Machine, which means Bitcoin would allow any computable functions to operate as a script executed on-chain. Some computations, such as cellular automata, would require multiple transactions.In another Bitcoin Cash paper, a Bitcoin Cash supporter states that an unbounded single-tape turing is analogous to an unbounded blockchain, and can store a genetic algorithm that will be able to provide Turing Complete results on any given mathematical problem. Therefore, the paper posits, the eventual result of Bitcoin Cash will be to create the Church-Turing-Deutsch Principle Machine, as described by David Deutsch in his 1985 paper \u201cQuantum theory, the Church-Turing principle and the universal quantum computer\u201d which states \u201cevery physical process can be simulated by a universal computing device.\u201d***Third Theory: Bitcoin is a catalyst for John Nash\u2019s Ideal\u00a0MoneyTenets: Apolitical store of value. Mining difficulty as solution to John Nash\u2019s theoretical Industrial Consumer Price Index. Idealized settlement layer between central banks issuing their own currencies.A niche number of individuals, the most prominent of whom posts under the names Juice (Medium) and SoakerPatoshi (Twitter), generally agree with the Bitcoin Maximalist thesis that Bitcoin is likely to become the new modern Gold Standard, and that it is likely that it becomes a massive, trillion-dollar asset. However, they have a different view with respect to the endgame. This group believes that even if bitcoin grows such that is surpasses the market cap of gold, nation-state backed fiat currencies will nevertheless remain. Instead of causing the collapse and disruption of that fiat money, Bitcoin will instead act as a catalyst to force central banks to manage their fiat currencies in a more responsible manner.This possibility was initially thought of by Hal Finney, who is best known for being an early Bitcoin developer, being the first person to transact with Satoshi Nakamoto, and being a developer of the secure communication method known as Pretty Good Privacy. He posted on the bitcoin forums his thoughts about hypothetical Bitcoin banks in 2010.Hal Finney on Bitcoin\u00a0BanksJohn Nash, a Nobel Prize economist who made significant contributions to game theory such as the Nash Equilibrium and Bargaining Problem, believed that although Keynesian economic policies were, in theory, intended to be for solely noble objectives and general welfare of the people, in practice these policies simply gave governments the ability to literally print money, collecting seigniorage by way of inflation of the money supply. Nash often likened Keynesians to Bolshevik Communists, as he saw that both groups gave credence to the notions of a centrally managed system and a lack of transparency surrounding decisions, especially with regards to the nation-state\u2019s currency issuance.Nash wrote that by discussing inflation targeting, central banking officials are essentially revealing that is possible to control inflation by controlling the supply of money. Central banks, in their calculations, use a cost-of-living index made up of domestic prices for goods in a given region of their nation-state. Nash introduced a notion he called the Industrial Consumer Price Index, or ICPI, which would provide an international standard for value comparison of goods via a formula incorporating differing prices of goods in a variety of locations.Nash believed that a return to the Gold Standard was sub-optimal, because he believed that technological changes would result in increasing unpredictability of the future cost of gold production. He also considered the locations of gold mines to not be \u201cpolitically appealing\u201d nor ideal, and that a return to the Gold Standard would arbitrarily enhance the economic importance of those particular areas.Nash\u2019s Ideal Money proposal, in a nutshell, is an idea that although we cannot design a perfectly stable money, a money that approaches \u2018stable\u2019 would also approach a limit that would be comparable to an optimally chosen basket of commodity prices. While an ICPI would be a step on the path towards Nash\u2019s vision of an Ideal Money, pegging a currency to the ICPI is not a solution, as it could fluctuate with changes in the supply or demand of commodities chosen for the index, thus necessitating an adjustment process that would be prone to political pressure.Currently, global reserve currencies face the Triffin Dilemma, resulting in a conflict of interest between short-term domestic and long-term international objectives, such as a desire to increase inflation to spur economic growth, versus keeping a strong domestic currency with stability of purchasing power. Nash believed that money would be stronger if it were put on a stage of competition where it must compete to survive, and improve itself. Nowadays, however, currencies don\u2019t really compete in a typical way like that which results in better products over time, but rather, they sometimes compete in a race to devalue. For Nash, rather than focusing on the utility of money for everyday transactions, of paramount importance was for the global economy to arrive at the same incorruptible value standard.Bitcoin is seen by some as the catalyst for the evolution of global monetary systems toward something that would resemble stabilizing a currency versus an optimally chosen basket of commodity prices. Some believe that Nash\u2019s writings from 1960\u2019s may have even predicted the emergence of something like Bitcoin. Nash wrote: \u201cHere I am thinking of a politically neutral form of a technological utility. To be quite respectable, in a Gresham-advised sense, money needs only to be as good as other material commodities that might be hoarded.\u201dCoincidentally, over the last several years, a global consensus over the nature of Bitcoin has slowly been converging on phrases like \u201cdigital gold\u201d. Bitcoin has all the characteristics to acquire a global monetary premium, much the same as gold. The relation between scarcity and new supply is actually more important than scarcity of supply. In the next several years, bitcoin\u2019s stock-to-flow ratio, the relation of its scarcity to its new supply, will drop below that of gold. Bitcoin\u2019s annual inflation will continue to decrease. Many believe that during this time, bitcoin will draw growing interest as an inflation hedge from many around the world.It is plausible that if Bitcoin continues seeing infrastructural improvements and growing place in the market, central banks and fiat currencies will themselves be forced to compete with Bitcoin in the future for relevance. It is likely that citizens of nation-states will put pressure on their central bank to print less money of a superior quality, resulting in a slower rate of inflation. If this were to occur, Bitcoin would likely usher similar effects to value stabilizing a currency versus an optimally chosen basket of commodity prices, without ever implementing an actual ICPI. This would force fiat currencies closer to Nash\u2019s vision of Ideal Money. Nash\u2019s goal is believed by some to be near, as Bitcoin represents competition to the nation-state control of money for the first time in centuries.***Fourth Theory: Bitcoin is an information and energy black hole that will result in the evolution of traditional moneyTenets: Perfect information and computational markets. Bitcoin is fractal and the sum of its forks. Peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant, borderless, cheap transfer of value, without middlemen. High on-chain throughput and on-chain utility.\u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t money. It\u2019s past money, which is scary because it\u2019s actually a new paradigm. We\u2019ve never had access to perfect market information before, so the concept of money will have to evolve to fit reality, not stay the same because legacy deems it so.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aanonymousBitcoin forksBitcoin forksThere is also a niche number of individuals, the most prominent of which are George Gilder, author of a number of books on the monetary system and capitalism, Andrew DeSantis, former engineer at the Bitcoin startup 21.co, now earn.com, and Mark Wilcox, Director of Strategy at Nyriad, that discuss Bitcoin primarily as interpreted by Claude Shannon\u2019s information theory. In simplistic terms, information is defined as surprise under information theory.Claude Shannon, the founder of information theoryThis group believes Bitcoin is a breakthrough in information theory because it allows anyone to conduct verifiable, timestamped, tamper-proof and transparent transactions without any third parties. Information theory says creativity requires a stable medium to experience fractal growth, and these individuals view Bitcoin as an extremely stable medium for doing so. In Knowledge and Power, Gilder argues \u201cit takes a low-entropy carrier (no surprises) to bear high-entropy information (full of surprisal).\u201d This camp also agrees with Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary policy because they view capitalism and technological progress as a fundamentally deflationary system.Similarly to Bitcoin Cash supporters, these individuals favor pushing Bitcoin to its limits to maximize the utility of an open data layer, and they are not fond of a future of Bitcoin where throughput is limited so that all users can verify transactions with a full node. This group views one use case of Bitcoin as an oracle machine to prove that a specific piece of data existed at a given point in time, and the bitcoin scripting language as much more capable than Ethereum in the long run due to the parallel nature of Bitcoin in comparison to the current serial execution forced by contracts on the Ethereum platform. They also believe Bitcoin will \u201cwake up\u201d in the future as a superintelligent AI and allow intelligence augmentation for humans.This group views Bitcoin as a platform to re-build computer software and the web upon. For example, they are interested in the parallels between Ted Nelson\u2019s Project Xanadu, the first hypertext project, and Bitcoin. Project Xanadu was envisioned to bring about a highly interconnected, parallel universe of documents for reading, writing, learning, and earning through hypertext, \u201cnon-sequential writing\u200a\u2014\u200atext that branches and allows choices to the reader, best read at an interactive screen.\u201d Xanadu was to operate through worldwide distributed servers and facilitate micro-transactions across the web.As discussed in \u201cBlockchain Control Flow,\u201d Ethereum has made design decisions that allow the network to have control over contract execution, and thus users\u2019 money. Wilcox writes \u201cFor a peer-to-peer network to be politically decentralised, it needs to have decentralised control, so we should at all times try to keep control completely in the private section.\u201d He also writes that the \u201climitations\u201d of Bitcoin as cited by Vitalik Buterin in the Ethereum Whitepaper are protections not limitations.Individuals within this camp generally have negative opinions towards the Lightning Network and other secondary-layer solutions. DeSantis states the \u201cLightning Network makes the base chain strict, or predictable,\u201d and thus reduces Bitcoin\u2019s information theoretic value by constraining experimentation space and reducing the chances of surprise discovery. Wilcox views the Lightning Network as \u201ca scam designed to function as an abstraction layer between you and the miners.\u201dWhen Wilcox discusses transaction processing, he is referring to verifying a transaction and hashing it into the merkle tree. Transaction processing can refer to almost anything, and he proposed a thesis that the same economic incentives that allowed Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate to grow exponentially over the last nine years could be used to exponentially grow transaction processing, which is currently done serially on a CPU.Nyriad, the company Wilcox co-founded, created the Nsulate for the Square Kilometre Array project, the world\u2019s largest radio telescope. The Nsulate innovatively uses the GPU as a storage controller and makes processing and storing data the same thing. It has built in blockchain support through cryptographic hash algorithms, which would allow miners to process transactions in parallel.Many of Wilcox\u2019s arguments, therefore, are based on seeing Bitcoin as a platform to enable competitive general purpose computational markets where users and companies submit transaction puzzles via scripts for miners to compete to solve using GPUs and write-on chain to seek rewards. Transaction puzzles can mean nearly anything here, from deep learning to CRISPR searches.With on-chain computational markets on Bitcoin, a user looking to submit computations to miners will care a lot about efficiency, to get the most computation per unit of reward they are including in a puzzle, and hashrate, to ensure the system they are submitting to is as secure as possible.It is worth noting that similar projects can be built on secondary and third layer solutions, as well. For example, a \u201cLayer 3\u201d project called Fabric Protocol, led by former Blockstream engineer Eric Martindale, is aiming to become a distributed supercomputer and decentralized operating system using Bitcoin as a trust anchor, a Fabric sidechain, and payment channels.Wilcox and DeSantis typically argue against the traditional supply and demand outlook of economic markets for blockchains, as described in the tweet above insinuating that hashrate will be price in the future.

Computational markets sitting atop Bitcoin are particularly likely to expand if they prove to achieve cheaper and more efficient computation than established behemoths of the industry.Source: TwitterConclusionThe four schools of thought presented in this article do not necessarily contradict one another, and, in fact, oftentimes overlap. In particular, the First Theory\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin being like a digital gold\u200a\u2014\u200aand the Third Theory\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin leading to Nash\u2019s Ideal Money\u200a\u2014\u200arun pretty much in parallel to one another, with the key difference being that the latter states that fiat currencies survive and adjust, while the former states that hyperbitcoinization will disrupt fiat currencies entirely, with everyone eventually demanding payment for their goods, services, and labor in bitcoin.Similarly, the Second Theory\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin Cash being a dominant peer-to-peer digital cash\u200a\u2014\u200aand the Fourth Theory\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin being the key element in further developing information theory\u200a\u2014\u200ahave many of the same supporting points and arguments, with the key difference being that the latter is not fork-biased and believes that any possible fork that can happen, will happen, and they will compete against each other.Thanks to armor123123 and others for giving us feedback on earlier versions of this post.", "responses": "18"}, {"title": "Forget Bitcoin, Our Future is Moneyless", "author_name": "Andrew Chakhoyan", "link": "https://medium.com/swlh/forget-bitcoin-our-future-is-moneyless-b2d229accef3?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 19, 2017", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "3.1K", "content": "Forget Bitcoin, Our Future is MoneylessIf data are the new oil, can time be the new\u00a0data?Andrew ChakhoyanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 19, 2017Nimses turns your time into digital\u00a0coinsReleased in 2011, Justin Timberlake\u2019s film In Time was mediocre at best. Set in 2169, it painted a grim future, where the rich are virtually immortal, as time became money, literally. In the best tradition of science fiction, this film exaggerated an idea that will likely turn into mundane reality of tomorrow and made it seem suspenseful and apocalyptic.Yet In Time\u2019s premise is both simple and radical: the future unit of exchange is not a dollar or Bitcoin. It is a minute of human life. Before we laugh off this idea, let us first acknowledge how ridiculous gold coins might have appeared to Stone Age tribe or our trust in pieces of paper, the banknotes, to a medieval merchant.All prior currencies could be amassed, but human time\u200a\u2014\u200aat least right now\u200a\u2014\u200ais roughly bounded and equally distributed.

This happened even before it launched in the US and Western Europe.To most of us, the notion of time as the unit of exchange, time as actual money, is either inconceivable, offensive, or both. But here too, before we cry wolf and demand that the network be shut down on the grounds of morality or breach of privacy, we must examine today\u2019s reality.CPM isn\u2019t a commonly used term, but it would sound quite familiar to marketing professionals\u200a\u2014\u200ait stands for \u201ccost per thousand impressions.\u201d Every minute we spend on a social network, every minute we spend on the Internet generates impressions, which are then monetized by the Facebooks and Googles of this world.

He explained that \u201cthe most valuable asset that Facebook possesses is the data that its users, often unwittingly, hand over for free before they are in effect sold to advertisers. It seems only fair that Facebook makes a bigger social contribution for profiting from this massively valuable, collectively generated resource.\u201d Thornhill believes that other data-driven businesses, such as Google, Apple, and Amazon, could also contribute.Plainpalais square in Geneva, Switzerland | Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty\u00a0ImagesAs strange as the logic of Nimses may seem, we already convert time into dollars via intermediaries, and this startup is offering a sort of shortcut.

If humanity\u2019s future is indeed workless, and we move into the age of abundance, it is only fitting that we start pondering the question of what our future unit of exchange will be.Evolutionary psychology postulates that we are hardwired to think about social status, to know where we stand vis-\u00e0-vis our peers.

In this article, I\u2019m going to explain what Bitcoin Cash (aka BCC) is, how it affects you and how you should prepare for August 1.What is Bitcoin\u00a0Cash?Here is the project announcement on Bitcointalk.Here is the project website.From the project website\u2019s FAQ:What is Bitcoin Cash?Bitcoin Cash is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the Internet. It is fully decentralized, with no central bank and requires no trusted third parties to operate.The prominent use of \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash\u201d is purposeful here. Bitcoin Cash is seeking to be a cryptocurrency that\u2019s focused on transaction capacity.Why is this fork a surprise?Many people (including myself) thought that this fork would only trigger if BIP148 were able to split the network. In other words, many people thought Bitcoin Cash (and its client Bitcoin ABC) was just a credible threat to prevent a contentious user-activated soft fork (UASF). Bitmain actually stated that the Segwit2x (aka New York Agreement) would be preferable:So naturally, when BIP91 (first part of Segwit2x) locked-in and activated ahead of BIP148, which is scheduled for August 1, most assumed this would prevent the so-called user-activated hard fork (UAHF) from triggering.But, it looks like Bitcoin Cash supporters had other ideas.Why should I\u00a0care?You should care because Bitcoin Cash is a permanent fork of Bitcoin.Again, from the FAQ:Is Bitcoin Cash different from \u2018Bitcoin\u2019?Yes. Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the Bitcoin project as peer-to-peer digital cash. It is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain ledger, with upgraded consensus rules that allow it to grow and scale.This means that if you own Bitcoin (that is, you control your own private keys) prior to the fork on 2017 August 1 12:20 UTC, you will have the same amount of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash after the fork.Lest you think these BCC isn\u2019t worth anything, BCC futures are currently trading at about $475 on ViaBTC.What do I need to\u00a0know?First, you should know that many exchanges, including Coinbase, are simply not prepared for this event.Again, from the FAQ:If I own Bitcoin, do I automatically own Bitcoin Cash too?Yes. Because Bitcoin Cash is a fork of the ledger, that means you own the same amount of Bitcoin Cash as you did Bitcoin at the time of the forking block. However, if your Bitcoins are stored by a third party such as an exchange, then you must inquire with them about your cash.Note that last sentence. Exchanges or third-party bitcoin storage providers may or may not give you your Bitcoin Cash. It\u2019s likely that third party services will try to do the right thing, but there\u2019s no way to know if they can get everything set up in time to be able to give you the Bitcoin Cash you\u2019re entitled to.Second, all hard forks present two risks: replay and wipeout attacks. Wipeout is not a as much risk since this is a permanent fork (there are scenarios where one chain\u2019s miners may attack the other, but this isn\u2019t in play yet). Replay protection is provided as part of the Bitcoin Cash release as explained in the FAQ:How is transaction replay being handled between the new and the old blockchain?Bitcoin Cash transactions use a new flag SIGHASH_FORKID, which is non standard to the legacy blockchain. This prevents Bitcoin Cash transactions from being replayed on the Bitcoin blockchain and vice versa.Rest assured that as long as you control your own private keys, you should be able to use those keys to create transactions on either chain safely.I thought Bitcoin solved scaling! Why is this happening?Good question. After the scaling drama of the past few years, we finally made progress when BIP91 locked in on Thursday. Though Segwit increases transaction capacity, it\u2019s not done so in a way that everyone is happy with.BCC looks like an appeal to the segment of the Bitcoin users that don\u2019t like Segwit. Since Segwit is getting activated on Bitcoin, this fork gives many of these people a place to go.From the FAQ:Why was a fork necessary to create Bitcoin Cash?The legacy Bitcoin code had a maximum limit of 1MB of data per block, or about 3 transactions per second. Although technically simple to raise this limit, the community could not reach a consensus, even after years of debate.So what features does Bitcoin Cash\u00a0have?Bitcoin Cash offers three new features. First, it offers a much larger block size of 8MB.Second, it offers replay and wipeout protection. The transaction signature is slightly different and the forking block has to be greater than 1MB.Third, it offers a way to adjust the proof-of-work difficulty quicker than the normal 2016 block difficulty adjustment interval found in Bitcoin.From the project announcement on Bitcointalk:Forking rule:\u201cREQ-7 Difficulty adjustement in case of hashrate dropIn case the MTP of the tip of the chain is 12h or more after the MTP 6 block before the tip, the proof of work target is increased by a quarter, or 25%, which corresponds to a difficulty reduction of 20%\u00a0.RATIONALE: The hashrate supporting the chain is dependent on market price and hard to predict. In order to make sure the chain remains viable no matter what difficulty needs to adjust down in case of abrupt hashrate drop.\u201dIn other words, the difficulty will adjust pretty quickly should there be a low hash rate.What does this mean for\u00a0Bitcoin?This is the hardest thing to answer. It may mean nothing, it may mean a lot. Some obvious things that we\u2019ll now need to think about are:Who will mine Bitcoin Cash?Who will have the larger hash rate? Both coins will use double-sha256 as the proof-of-work.What will the price ratio be?What will the volumes on both coins be like?How will hash rate react to price? How will price react to hash rate?How will this affect the 2x HF part of Segwit2x?What chain will coins that operate on top of Bitcoin like Omni and CounterParty choose?ConclusionUnfortunately, the Bitcoin Cash announcement brings more questions than answers. One thing is for certain: if you want to maximize your holdings, it\u2019s in your best interest to get your Bitcoin off third-party services and control your own private keys before August 1st.Want to get curated Technical Bitcoin News?

You can create an account on an exchange and manage your BTC in Atomic Wallet. This is a reasonable option if you trade it and constantly buy and sell it. However, if you just want to keep and HODL Bitcoin to the Moon, it\u2019s better to stick with the other option.So you can create the Bitcoin wallet or even the multi-asset one and manage your BTC, LTC, ETH, XRP and other cryptos in one interface. The is a great abundance of different wallets, and choosing of the best cryptocurrency wallets is vital.Where to buy\u00a0Bitcoin?There are many services to buy BTC. The market is full with different solutions. Finding out which one deserves your trust becomes very difficult\u2026One of the options is to use third-party intermediate services. These services ask you to send your USD or EUR to some address, in order to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.The another way to buy Bitcoin is open the wallet or create an account on some exchange service and ask someone you know to send BTC to you. It\u2019s okay if you know the person who can sell it to you, but please, don\u2019t buy something like this \ud83d\ude05The third and most robust way to buy Bitcoin is a credit card.

Demand was so tiny you could send any amount for free. There was no real congestion, so software didn\u2019t handle it, nor did business plans: gambling service Satoshidice famously sent a 1-satoshi payment to losing bets, using the infinite-capacity blockchain as a signaling layer. It was all free money.Bitcoin was a new, barely-understood technology. It was hard enough to comprehend the interactions of its constituent parts, let alone extrapolate to what this would mean in future. Several factors made this worse:The pseudonymity and lack of central authority was deeply attractive to scammers, who became pervasive enough to make the permeation of real information extremely difficult and also lead to widespread distrust.The success of the system brought others who tried to replicate it (often with the main goal of simply generating money) and almost always with minimal understanding of the system.[1]The early adopters had not only the normal tribalism of an emerging clique, but a concrete financial self-interest in adoption. The resulting boosterism meant it was extremely difficult for any awkward facts to permeate the wider ecosystem.The result there was surprisingly low awareness that this phase of \u201cfree money\u201d was not the natural state of bitcoin. The developers were aware, so added some configurable settings in the reference client to minimize the worst abuses. These rules did not change bitcoin, just the default behavior: they added a minimum fee[2], stopped relaying tiny payments[3], and enhanced the scripting language to reduce the size taken up by unspent outputs[4].Second Era: Satoshi\u2019s Subsidy (We Are\u00a0Here)\u201cBitcoin is shifting to a new economic policy, with possibly higher fees.\u201d\u2014 Jeff Garzik https://medium.com/@jgarzik/bitcoin-is-being-hot-wired-for-settlement-a5beb1df223aThe bursty statistical nature of block production, combined with the volatile market of bitcoin, began to produce intermittent capacity issues. These had been previously dealt with by code optimizations and tweaking settings by miners; now they became more regular and significant, causing rising awareness that the First Era was at risk.Inevitably, many people wanted to prolong the free ride. This pressure was exacerbated by software and services unprepared for dynamic fee conditions, and the difficult nature of such fee conditions themselves: reliably guessing what fee would allow a transaction into the next block turned out to be difficult at best, and extremely difficult to present to users[5].The developers\u2019 general reluctance to support a naive increase stemmed from several factors:Previous increases on the network had driven significant centralization pressure, including a period where over half the network was under control of a single pool.[6]This would be the first backwards-incompatible change since Bitcoin\u2019s introduction.Providing a \u201cone-off\u201d bump risks moral hazard, as lobbying for expansion is seen as cheaper and easier than engineering improvements.Despite being expected, neither software nor services were preparing for the transition. This may have been because they didn\u2019t really believe the transition would occur.[7]The developers generally want to follow the community, not lead. Changes which are economically significant or contentious feed a narrative of developer reliance.[8]Transitions in a large, complex system need to be as gradual as possible to avoid unintended side effects. As the Third Era approaches, the Second Era provides that gradual transition, with time for software and services to gain experience with bitcoin as it will eventually be.The developers implemented several improvements to address congestion. First among them was wide-ranging and significant optimizations[9] designed to handle the network now running at capacity. Block propagation was improved by a global network of node relays[11] and new strategies for better propagation[12]. Fee estimation algorithms became more sophisticated[13], along with restoring the ability to replace transactions (by increasing the fee)[14] and having the recipient boost transactions[15].Despite centralization fears of larger blocks, an opt-in block expansion[16] was added which will eventually double the network throughput as software is updated to use it. Work is ongoing on packing more transactions into blocks[17], which increases throughput without the centralization risks of block expansion.It is not surprising that such efforts were seen for what they were: insufficient to maintain the First Era. Bitcoin\u2019s use as a payment network, always awkward due to block time variance, became even harder: a whole class of payments below $20 were no longer viable. Businesses and users established in the First Era began looking longingly at alternate coins still in their own First Era, and also lobbied for relief. A significant mining monopoly had formed at this stage, and it joined these efforts.[18]Though these efforts failed, it\u2019s important to note that while some who wanted the First Era to continue considered the Third Era avoidable[19], many just felt it shouldn\u2019t happen now. The most convincing argument was that it would harm adoption, which is a major factor for both usefulness and regulatory resistance. Unfortunately this argument never becomes less compelling, and carries all the hazards enumerated above.It is undeniable that an increase in transaction capacity reduces the eventual burden of fees, and is the main motivation for the growth plans which were implemented in this era.[20]Third Era: Self Sufficiency (2028?\u00a0onwards)\u201cOnce a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.\u201d\u2014 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash SystemOnce the \u201cfree money\u201d bootstrap phases of bitcoin are complete the system enters the phase of self-sufficiency, where users bear the cost of securing the network against double-spending (currently billions of USD each year[21]). This is phased in by halving the block subsidy every four years.[22]Current levels suggest fees will be comparable with the subsidy at the 2024 halving, and consistently dominate from 2028 onwards.[23]User-facing businesses established in the First Era who flourished into the Second Era will find the Third Era extremely difficult. One large business claims to be responsible for 25% of the bitcoin transactions: in 10 years they would be paying $700M per year to secure the network at current levels[24]. Yet no business is telling their investors about this impending cost, nor that they plan on reducing their on-chain percentage[25] nor suggesting that they are depending on significant bitcoin appreciation to offset these costs[26].Miners will find the Third Era equally difficult. Directly supported by users, they will be in constant tension with them over fee levels, and in danger of having their income squeezed by large businesses or cliques of users. This may lead to further centralization, as miners consolidate under revenue pressure. This centralization may be offset by businesses choosing to invest directly in mining, however.[27]The Third Era Will Start With Civil\u00a0WarThe mathematics of this situation seem inevitable: The miners and businesses with large transaction volume will both decide to (re)introduce inflation. For the large-volume businesses this will externalize their costs, and for miners it\u2019s simply \u201cfree money\u201d. The battle lines will be similar to the early Second Era New York Agreement, but this effort will be more nuanced and far broader, with mainstream arguments such as:The founder was not an economist; Economists recommend inflation around 1% to encourage spending.[28]The support burden of the network should be shared by the wealthy bitcoin holders, not just those actually using their bitcoin.The counter-arguments are:The 21 million bitcoin limit was a key reason for bitcoin\u2019s success,The system\u2019s founder made a conscious and deliberate choice for bitcoin to be a store-of-value over subsidizing payments, by eschewing inflation, andChanging the rules now is stealing from early adopters (notably, but not mainly, the anonymous founder).The main resistance to this change would come from the developers themselves (who feel this limit is non-negotiable[30]) and long-term bitcoin holders. Businesses will be divided: those which cater to the latter (insurers, vaults) will be against the change, and those with high onchain volume (exchanges, wallet providers) will be for it.Although this crisis is entirely predictable from first principles, and laid in the bedrock of bitcoin, it may yield surprising results. And even if bitcoin\u2019s supply remains capped[31], the drama it can produce is limitless[32].Disclosure: the author holds bitcoin and works for Blockstream.", "responses": "17"}, {"title": "A Guide To Bitcoin\u2019s Technical Brilliance (For Non-Programmers)", "author_name": "Lucas Nuzzi", "link": "https://medium.com/digitalassetresearch/a-guide-to-bitcoins-technical-brilliance-for-non-programmers-e28211e797c0?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 15, 2018", "readtime": "18 min read", "upvotes": "6.6K", "content": "A Guide To Bitcoin\u2019s Technical Brilliance (For Non-Programmers)Lucas NuzziBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 15, 201818 minutes is all that it takes to understand Bitcoin better than most\u00a0people.In 18 minutes, you will have a good understanding of how hash functions, Public Key Cryptography and Merkle Trees are brilliantly used in\u00a0Bitcoin.The purpose of this post is to provide a semi-technical guide to key aspects of Bitcoin\u2019s technology. Over the years, I have found that the best way of achieving that is to dissect everything that happens under the hood when two entities transact.Of course, I\u2019m talking about Alice and Bob.But bear with me. It gets dark.Alice happens to live in country that is going through a massive economic downfall, widely regarded now as a humanitarian disaster. A country where hyperinflation, hunger, unemployment, and violent crime have prevented its citizens from the most basic human rights.Despite economic calamity, life goes on, and people still need to purchase goods and services on a daily basis. Alice desperately needs to fix the roof of her house, which has partially collapsed. But fixing a roof takes longer than a day, and pricing this service using a hyper-inflated national currency is nearly impossible.Historically, when a country\u2019s national currency collapses, citizens tend to adopt stable foreign currencies in order to hedge against inflation. Many South American countries that went through periods of hyperinflation informally adopted the US dollar when trying to price services.But Alice is having problems finding physical US dollar bills. The ongoing crisis, which has now reached its third year, has put a premium on foreign currencies. In order to hedge against hyperinflation, she proposes to pay Roberto (Bob), the roofer, in Bitcoin, which is surprisingly less volatile than her own country\u2019s currency.Bob requires 0.01 BTC to begin the repairs, but he does not have a bitcoin wallet. In addition to sending him the funds, Alice will also teach Bob how to create a wallet and use Bitcoin.1) Alice wants to send 0.01 BTC to Bob (I will use quotations to note all the steps in this transaction\u2019s life-cycle)To transact in the Bitcoin Network, every participant is required to download a specific software to interact with other network participants. This is what\u2019s referred to as a client, which sends requests for specific data to a server. Web browsers, for example, are a type of client that request and interpret data from a server. When a URL is accessed, the browser client sends a request to the server storing the website\u2019s content and, once served the data, it displays that content to the user.Bitcoin clients work similarly, but there is a key difference. Instead of accessing data from a centralized server, the Bitcoin client interacts with other members of the network to source and validate the integrity of the data, which can easily be determined since every participant of this network is essentially storing the same database. This is a key aspect of the Bitcoin Network, as its decentralization grants unique security properties to the integrity of the data that is exchanged between network participants, or nodes.Nodes, by definition, are the individual participants of a network. When we refer to the nodes of the Bitcoin Network, we are talking about the people that have downloaded and that are running a Bitcoin client. Collectively, Bitcoin nodes are essentially what the network is made of; a group of interconnected machines running a client and exchanging data.Nodes may interact with the network by running two types of client; a full client or a light client. Let\u2019s first look at the differences between them:FULL CLIENTS (ALSO CALLED FULL NODES, OR \u201cTHICK\u201d\u00a0CLIENTS)As many of us know, a blockchain is simply a structure that can be used to store data. In Bitcoin, transactions are added to block (a group) every 10 minutes, and then chained (connected) to the previous block. The purpose of this data structure is to determine a single, immutable, truth of what happened and when it happened.Full clients, also called full nodes, store a complete copy of the blockchain in their computers which consists of all blocks with all transactions that have ever occurred in the network; from the very first transaction in the Genesis Block, the first block to ever be mined, all the way to the most recent block the software is able to find. Full nodes are the backbone of the Bitcoin Network, and enforce the rules set forth by the software. These rules guarantee the security, formatting and consistency of all data that is stored on the blockchain, as well as the process by which new data is amended to the ledger.Since full nodes store a copy of all transactions that have occurred in the network, they are able verify the validity of transactions initiated by any other user. To do that, the software looks at all past transactions that a user has engaged in, thereby preventing malicious actors from sending more than what they possess. Because this is digital money, the only way of preventing a bitcoin from being used twice (Ctl+C, Ctl+V) is to be hyperaware of all transactions that have ever happened.Downloading an entire copy of the blockchain from other nodes may take some time as the size of the Bitcoin blockchain is currently 164GB. However, this process only needs to be done once. Upon downloading the chain, users only need to download a new block every 10 minutes. All of this is done in the background, automatically, by the client.LIGHT CLIENTS (ALSO CALLED \u201cTHIN\u201d\u00a0CLIENTS)Since running a full node has several requirements, such as having sufficient storage space and memory, light clients were designed to ease the interactions with the network and reduce the frictions of owning and using bitcoin. Light clients can, for example, run on a smartphone. Instead of storing a complete copy of the blockchain, light clients only store the header of each block, which is basically a summary of all transactions contained in it.Only storing the block header requires less disk space, but it limits what light clients can do. A light client is not able to entirely verify the validity of a transaction, but it can confirm by looking at the header if a transaction was included in a block. Its main purpose is to broadcast transactions to the network. Full nodes then receive transactions from light clients, verify them, and add them to a separate bucket with all other unprocessed transactions. Full nodes are only allowed to add these unprocessed transactions to their blockchain when the miners tell them to so. More on that later.2) Alice helps Bob download a Bitcoin light client, which will enable him to quickly create an account and receive funds.MULTIPLE CLIENTS AND SERVICE\u00a0UPTIMEToday, there are dozens of different Bitcoin clients available for download. This diversity is highly desirable, since it diminishes the risk that a bug in a single client will disrupt the entire network. If one client fails, as it has happened in the past, users can download other brands and transact.This is the reason why Bitcoin has been functional for 99.99% of the time. Not many internet services have comparable uptime, which is in itself remarkable for a 9-year-old open-source project that was launched by an obscure figure.WALLETSAlthough both full node clients and light clients can serve as a user\u2019s wallet, the definition of a Bitcoin wallet is not the same as a client. Technically, a wallet is the collection of data required to send and receive bitcoin. This data includes a public address and a private password.BITCOIN IDENTITIES &\u00a0KEYSSince Bitcoin was built for peer-to-peer payments, all users of the network need a public identity that enables them to identify the parties of every transaction. Like a bank account, this address needs to be unique and users must be able to share it publicly. Conversely, users also need to be able to authorize transactions with a unique private identifier that proves the ownership of funds.Bitcoin archives that through three unique identifiers:1) PRIVATE\u00a0KEYThe Private Key is a completely random combination of numbers and letters that can be used to spend the bitcoin associated with a specific Address. Private Keys, like the PIN number of a checking account, are used to authorize transactions. Below is an example of what a Private Key looks like.cxprv9xg3pXGrrmSQNqRCZRFmphUZpkzt8s43ESotbcPXk5fLXt6NT3fh2tTPyQ7tW2SWAS9uWjhDJzzex9m8qmAHsJvTN1hctsgiYFK9Moo9Nx1As you can see, it would be extremely difficult for a human to memorize a Private Key. I don\u2019t even recommend writing it down because you will lose your funds forever if you happen to miss a character. For this reason, you can represent the Private Key\u2019s blob in a human-readable format using something called a mnemonic key. Believe it or not, the twelve-word mnemonic key below represents the Private Key above.faith joke visa range turkey expose they bacon gentle hill cushion recipeMuch easier to remember, right? This is one of the most under-appreciated aspects of Bitcoin. For the first time in human history, you can store your wealth in your brain without a third party.This means that, if the situation in Alice\u2019s country turns into a Civil War, she can flee the country and transfer her wealth by only remembering twelve words. These twelve words can later be loaded into any Bitcoin wallet.2) PUBLIC\u00a0KEYThe Public Key is derived from the Private Key using fancy algebra, and acts as an intermediary between a user\u2019s private and public identities. Below is an example of what a Public Key looks like.xpub6E9pP9ny45P14SNMCzCBFCPwr2QHgWQqZggJg6sMjnGgPo8Hf9tzPwtzHYeKXn6GdACpoKRcvkb2w6pvcAj6kwdw5mKLyDErWXKX8Bhozed3) ADDRESSESAddresses are derived from the Public Key using a hash function. I will provide more details on hash functions in later sections, but for now it is important to note that Public Keys and Addresses are not the same.I often get asked \u201cwhat is the point of the Public Key if users transact using addresses?\u201d There are a couple of technical reasons behind this intermediation, but it all comes down to privacy and efficiency. Users derive their addresses from their Public Keys, which makes it difficult for someone to pin point a single identity in the network.Below is an example of what an address looks like. As you can see, the hash of the public key is smaller than the public key itself, which saves space on the chain.1LGpghBaX7AGbxA5dvpVwR7vMy53R8HcXXEASY TO VERIFY, PRATICALY IMPOSSIBLE TO\u00a0REVERTAs you can see in the Figure 1 below, there is a mathematical relationship between Private Keys, Public Keys and Addresses. This is achieved by using a principle called a Mathematical Trap Door; a one-way mathematical function that can easily be performed in one direction (i.e. deriving Public Keys from Private Keys), but nearly impossible to be performed in the opposite direction (i.e. deriving Private Keys from Public Keys).Fig 1. The Relationship of Private Keys, Public Keys and Addresses (Source: Digital Asset Research)Even though the math behind these operations is mind-blowing (in a good way), I will save its details for more a technical post on Elliptic Curve Cryptography and other technologies being currently researched. For now, keep in mind that, when Alice signs a transaction, she is essentially using her Private Key to create a signature. Through this signature, everyone can easily verify that Alice has a Private Key associated with an address without knowing what the Private Key actually is.Fun estimates that I have to share:Q: how many bitcoin addresses can users generate?A: 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976Q: how many grains of sand are there on earth?A: 9,223,372,036,854,775,807Have I mentioned that it would take the amount of energy in the entire sun to brute force a Private Key from a Public Key?Math is magical.4) Bob has created a wallet through his light client and sends Alice his Bitcoin address over email.THE TRANSACTIONSimply put, a bitcoin transaction is a signed message that authorizes the transfer of funds from one account to another. Each transaction includes the sender\u2019s address, the receiver\u2019s address, and a signature generated using the sender\u2019s Private Key.The Bitcoin blockchain has a native multiple-entry accounting system and each transaction has inputs (where the balance came from) and outputs (where it is going to), much like a system of debits and credits. A user\u2019s balance is basically the sum of all debits associated with the Addresses derived from his or her Public Key minus all credits that have been sent to other addresses. A balance is considered spent once it\u2019s used in a transaction.5) Alice now has Bob\u2019s address (1Few1623...), which is the only thing she needs to initiate a transaction.Fig. 2. Initiating a BTC Transaction using Electrum (Source: Digital Asset Research)When Alice initiates a transaction of 0.01 BTC, or 10 millibits (mBTC), to Bob, her Bitcoin client will look at all previous unspent outputs (debits) associated with her Public Key, and display her total balance. Alice then scans or copies Bob\u2019s address, adds the transaction amount and chooses how fast she wants the funds to reach Bob. The speed at which Bob will receive Alice\u2019s transaction is dependent upon how much network fees Alice is willing to pay.6) Alice decides how much she will pay in fees, which is proportionate to the speed at which Bob will receive the funds.Bitcoin relies on certain network participants to group unprocessed transactions into a block and add that block to the ledger, an activity called mining. Miners receive all transaction fees in a block and, therefore, have an economic incentive to prioritize transactions with higher fees. If Alice wants Bob to receive the funds in less than one hour, she will have to pay the miners higher fees.Since Bob won\u2019t need the funds immediately, Alice decides to pay a rate of 2.21 mBTC per kilobyte in transaction fees, which is enough to make sure Bob receives her transaction within the next 50 minutes, or 5 blocks. Alice previews the transaction to see how much she will pay in fees.Previewing a BTC Transaction using Electrum (Source: Digital Asset Research)At a transaction fee rate of 2.21 mBTC per kilobyte, and the size of her transaction being 336 bytes, the total amount paid in network fees is 0.743 mBTC, or $4.65 USD (2.21*336).Note: the screenshot on the left was taken when Bitcoin transactions were at an all-time-high. A similar transaction today would cost less than a dollar.In essence, a Bitcoin transaction is the exchange of ledger entries, which are represented as inputs and outputs. The specific transaction initiated by Alice contains only one input and two outputs. To send 10 mBTC to Bob, Alice\u2019s client uses a past transaction as an input to prove that she has a balance higher than the amount being sent. A day earlier, Alice deposited 98.525 mBTC to the address she will use to send the funds to Bob. Her client will use this transaction as an input since its value is higher than the amount she will send to Bob. Her client will also send the difference between yesterday\u2019s deposit and 10 mBTC (in other words, the change) back to Alice.Two outputs are created; the first output of 10 mBTC goes to Bob, as it represents what Alice is sending, and the second output of 87.78 mBTC goes back to Alice\u2019s address as change. Notice that the 87.78 mBTC output that Alice will receive as change is already accounting for the 0.74 mBTC that she will pay in network fees.The Inputs And Outputs Of Alice\u2019s Transaction (Source: Digital Asset Research)At times, inputs and outputs can be confusing. That\u2019s because the output of a previous transaction becomes the input of a new one. In the example above, Input 0 is the output of the deposit made a day earlier. Because that output has not been used in any other transaction (i.e. it\u2019s an unspent output), it can be used as input for a new transaction. Once used, it becomes a spent output that can\u2019t be noted as an input for a future transaction.Before this particular transaction can be broadcasted to the network, Alice needs to prove that she possesses the Private Key associated with this address by signing the transaction. Alice can sign transactions by loading the text file used to store it, or manually entering her 12-word mnemonic key. Alice\u2019s client will then combine all details from the transaction and convert it to hexadecimal format.After the conversion, Alice\u2019s entire transaction looks like this: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 above string is what\u2019s shared with other members of the network. Once broadcasted, the nodes around Alice verify the transaction\u2019s validity and disseminate it to other nodes until the transaction gets processed by the miners. As mentioned earlier, every node stores a bucket of unprocessed transactions. This is what\u2019s called the memory pool, or mempool. When the mempool is full and nodes in the network are storing a large number of unprocessed transactions, the network fee rate per kilobyte increases, since memory is scarce. As result, network mining fees also increase.Accordingly, the Bitcoin mempool is used as a proxy for network congestion and transaction costs, since a high number of unprocessed transactions = less space in the mempool = higher fees.I must emphasize that bitcoin network fees are priced only on the basis of transaction size (kilobytes), regardless of the amount being sent.THE VERIFICATION OF BLOCKS THROUGH\u00a0MININGThe term mining gained popularity because it described a parallel with a real-world activity that is probabilistic in nature, and that gives no guarantees of success.Gold miners know that, even if they spend significant amounts of resources in the process, there is no guarantee that a precious metal will be found. Although this can be a useful analogy to describe the probabilistic nature of the activity, the term mining does nothing to help understand the process itself, which is one Bitcoin\u2019s greatest accomplishments (so far) when it comes to both user adoption and network security.The actual activity miners perform is more analogous to the job of a real-world locksmith than that of a real-world miner.Imagine that, every ten minutes, the Bitcoin protocol gives the locksmiths in its network a closed lock with an unknown key. Only if one of them is able to open the lock and attach a new group of transactions to the chain, a reward is issued. To find the key, the successful locksmith must try millions of different combinations, which takes both time and effort. The locksmith must prove to the competing locksmiths that he went through the hassle of trying different combinations by showing them the real key, which they can then replicate and verify for themselves. Producing the key, which is the proof that work has been done, automatically grants the successful locksmith a reward that is, in practice, proportional to his efforts.Proof-of-Work, get it?!?Once a locksmith finds that the coordinates 5\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 opens the lock, this combination becomes the Proof-of-Work. (Source: mechanicalgifs.com)The protocol is always aware of how many locksmiths are trying to find the key coordinates to its lock so that it takes, on average, ten minutes until a locksmith can find a correct key that opens the lock. If there are only a dozen locksmiths in the network, the lock will be small and can easily be opened using a short key with very few grooves. Conversely, if there are hundreds of locksmiths competing in this challenge, the protocol will give them a large lock that requires a long key with many grooves. With regards to Bitcoin, millions of different combinations need to be tested before the correct key is found.Consider that when Bitcoin launched, only a simple metal file was required to produce a valid key. Now, this activity can only be done with an ASIC, a piece of hardware that is optimized to compute a specific algorithm. The rise of Bitcoin ASICs is analogous to selling these locksmiths electric metal grinders that exponentially increase their abilities to test different key combinations. As the economic incentives of this activity increased in value, the lock increased in size.This illustrative Bitcoin lock is now massive, which greatly contributes to the security of the network. Given the competitive and probabilistic nature of the activity itself, it is unlikely that the same locksmith will find the key for consecutive locks over a period of time. Unpredictability is an important feature because it diminishes the likelihood that a malicious actor will double spend funds by mining consecutive blocks. However, the increase in difficulty, when coupled with specialized hardware, creates barriers of entry for the average user, which ultimately translates into some centralization.Prominent members of the community are now discussing whether to embrace or scrutinize the use of ASICs. As I stated in this article, I see the confluence of ASIC manufacturer + miner as potentially dangerous. The caveat is it does increase network network security by orders of magnitude (at the expense of decentralization, of course).PROOF-OF-WORK AND HASH FUNCTIONSAs you may know, the mathematical puzzle referred above is based on a cryptographic hash function. Generally speaking, hash functions map every piece of data in a file, assign identifiers to it, and produce an output of fixed length. In other words, hash functions are used to compress data of any size to a standard output, and that output is called the hash. You can put the entire Library of Congress through a hash function and compare the output with the hash of the word it; both outputs will have the same size.To produce proof-of-work, Bitcoin miners use SHA-256; a hash function originally designed by the NSA for the compression of sensitive information. Before being able to add a block to the blockchain, miners must use the SHA-256 function to combine the data inside the block with a specific, unknown, number. This number is called the nonce. Miners need to find a nonce that, when combined with the data within a block, produces a hash that starts with the target number of leading zeroes.Hash functions, as shown in Figure 5, are highly sensitive to the slightest change. Therefore, miners must try millions of different nonces within that 10-minute period in order to find a nonce that, when combined with a block, begins with the target number of zeroes. If you read the previous section carefully, you will realize that nonce is the key the locksmiths are competing to find.Fig. 5. Example of a Hash Function (Source: Digital Asset Research)Changing a transaction that has already been added to a block requires changing the entire block. Bitcoin works because the data structure of its blockchain makes it immutable; once a block has been mined, nothing in it can be changed without affecting the entire block.This is achieved using a data structure called a Merkle Tree, which basically combines every piece of data within a block so that all data is interdependent. As you can see in Figure 6, Alice\u2019s transaction to Bob (Tx1) is hashed to produce Hash1, which is then hashed with Hash0 (the hash of another transaction that happened at the same time) to produce Hash01. The protocol does that to every single unconfirmed transaction that will be added to the block until a root hash is found.Fig. 6. Example of a Merkle Tree Structure (Source: Digital Asset Research)The root hash is the hash of all transactions within a block. If the slightest bit of data within any of these transactions is changed, the root hash will be completely different. This is the reason why the term blockchain has been highly popularized; the immutability of this data structure is highly desirable for many different applications.The block header referred in the section on light clients is the combination of the root hash with the block header of the previous block in the chain. This is what essentially links blocks together in a blockchain. The block header also includes other data pieces such as the nonce, the current time and how difficult it was to mine it.7) Finally, Alice\u2019s transaction is added to a block along with many other transactions. Once the block gets mined, Bob can download it and verify that the transaction has been confirmed.INCENTIVE STRUCTURE AND BLOCK\u00a0REWARDSThe Bitcoin protocol has a native incentive mechanism that rewards miners that are able to produce valid Proof-of-Work. This amount is divided by half every 4 years. At the time of writing, it is 12.5 BTC per block. As stated earlier, miners also receive network transaction fees from every transaction they choose to include in a block.When the Bitcoin Network launched in January 2009, block rewards were 50 BTC per block. As expected, block rewards halved to 25 BTC in November 2012, and to 12.5 BTC in July 2016. In the year 2140, the Bitcoin protocol will stop generating new coins and mining rewards will only be based on network fees. At that point, around 21 million bitcoins will be in circulation.Bitcoin\u2019s brilliant incentive layer has greatly contributed it its adoption since it provides a unique economic structure based on scarcity. Incentives are defined by an algorithm, which allows Bitcoin\u2019s inflation to be precisely modeled. This makes Bitcoin a good candidate for the coin of the future, since its monetary policy is determined by math in the form of software.FINAL REMARKSThe first time I played around with Bitcoin\u2019s codebase was in the Fall of 2012, when I was still in college. I remember being dismissive of it at first, which I now understand was because of ignorance. Bitcoin\u2019s simplicity can be very deceiving, and it is easy to overlook its elegance.Ignorance is the real reason why Bitcoin has been declared dead so many times. This shouldn\u2019t come out as a surprise, after all, understanding this mix of Cryptography, Computer Science and Economics requires both time and effort.But once you get it, its technical brilliance is undeniable.I want to send a huge thanks to Andreas M. Antonopoulos for writing \u201cMastering Bitcoin.\u201d It opened my mind to so many under-appreciated aspects of the Bitcoin protocol. If you don\u2019t have a technical background, I highly recommend his latest book, The Internet of Money.If you find this post useful, please share it on social media and join the battle against crypto-ignorance!

Recently, the Washington Post published a piece entitled \u201cBitcoin is still a disaster\u201d by economic affairs reporter Matt O\u2019Brien, which I feel relies on mistaken assumptions to paint a misleading picture of the world. Today, I\u2019d like to engage with some of the claims made in the piece, and show how O\u2019Brien\u200a\u2014\u200aamong many others\u200a\u2014\u200aget it wrong.Claim: Currencies are meant to be\u00a0stable\u201cThere\u2019s one thing a currency is supposed to do that bitcoin never has. That\u2019s maintain a stable value.\u201dThis assumes that bitcoin is a currency, and that the definition of currency is normative (\u201cx should do y\u201d) as opposed to descriptive (\u201cthings of type x have the qualities y and z\u201d). I\u2019d classify Bitcoin the protocol as a complete monetary system, and bitcoin the unit of value as a commodity money, which has the potential to become a gold-like reserve currency. Commodities fluctuate\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s what they do.Additionally, currency isn\u2019t meant to maintain a stable value. Monetary policy is used for a variety of macroeconomic objectives, including targeting GDP growth, unemployment rates, inflation, trade balances, and more. If stability was the objective, the Federal Reserve Board would target zero percent inflation rather than the two percent that it currently does. Am I moving the goalposts? It\u2019s matter of figuring out how bitcoin is used, and what it was intended for. I\u2019m not sure [bitcoin creator] Satoshi Nakamoto ever defined bitcoin as a currency. He defines it as a system for electronic transactions, a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash, and an electronic payment system. He envisions bitcoin as a protocol and a bearer digital unit of value.The interpretation of bitcoin as a currency is mostly inferred by outsiders imposing a particular view upon the protocol. Unburdened by priors, a neutral analyst would probably describe it as something similar to gold. In fact, Satoshi described PoW (proof-of-work) with a reference to gold mining, and later discussed bitcoin as analogous to a scarce, inert, infinitely portable metal which might develop a monetary premium. He clearly saw it as a gold-like commodity which would recapture those same properties in the digital realm, and I think this the most fitting interpretation of the system.Claim: Bitcoin was designed with volatility in\u00a0mind\u201cWhy has bitcoin\u2019s price been so up-and-down? Well, part of it is that it was designed that way.\u201dThis is an odd rewrite of history, or more charitably, a very strange interpretation of bitcoin\u2019s purpose. The impossible trinity tells that it\u2019s impossible to have free capital flow, sovereign monetary policy, and a fixed exchange rate all at the same time. Bitcoin was designed with sovereign monetary policy and a free flow of capital. No one underwrites or backs bitcoin, so it cannot be pegged to a real-world basket of goods. That\u2019s the same with gold. Both have emergent monetary premia. This can\u2019t be planned for\u200a\u2014\u200ait just so happened that way. Needless to say, Satoshi didn\u2019t design bitcoin to be unstable, he wanted to solve the problem of double spends with digital cash such that it didn\u2019t rely on a single validator. Its volatility is an emergent property, not a design objective.Claim: Validating transactions is the source of its computational overhead\u201c[\u2026] the problem [with a decentralized network] was that the only way to do that would be for every member of that network to keep a record of every bitcoin transaction there had ever been\u200a\u2014\u200athat way they knew who had bitcoin to spend\u200a\u2014\u200awhich would require a lot of computing power.\u201dThis is a common misconception. PoW and mining ensures that the network deterministically converges to a shared history, without any subjectivity or off-chain coordination. The fact that the minted units have value means that miners are incentivized to behave appropriately in the short and medium term. And the fact that those units are worth $x means that miners will pay anything up to $x to obtain them. This is the source of the large quantities of computing power allocated to the network\u200a\u2014\u200athe combination of efficient mining hardware and large amounts of value at stake.The validation and record-keeping is behavior conducted by full nodes, not miners. The cost of maintaining the bitcoin data store is an externality pushed onto full nodes through bandwidth and storage costs. This is NOT the job of miners. This is a basic distinction lost on many.Claim: Bitcoin\u2019s volatility is unnatural\u201cBut even this inbuilt volatility doesn\u2019t fully explain why bitcoin has been on such a roller-coaster ride. Something else must be going on, and that something is plain-old manipulation.\u201dVolatility isn\u2019t inbuilt, it\u2019s a feature of every non-pegged economic asset. The Post should keep its fragilista-thinking to itself.Does the Post have any proof that markets are not long-term efficient? If so, they have a Nobel prize in economics to\u00a0collect.Plain old manipulation? You really mean to tell me you think a $100 billion network was manipulated into existence? Is it so difficult to accept that bitcoin provides a differentiated, useful service to millions of people worldwide, and that\u2019s why it has value? Does the Post have any proof that markets are not long-term efficient? If so, they have a Nobel prize in economics to collect.\u201c[\u2026] what seems to still be happening in 2018 with various pump-and-dump schemes.\u201dDon\u2019t conflate bitcoin with random worthless altcoins. There is a lot of PND [pump-and-dump] in this industry, but it is infeasible in the extreme to PND bitcoin. If you\u2019re part of a PND group, you target alts in the $50\u2013$300 million range, not bitcoin.Claim: Bitcoin is only used as a currency due to the wealth\u00a0effect\u201cThe first is that what makes bitcoin work as a way to transfer things\u200a\u2014\u200athe expectation that its price will keep rising.\u201dThat\u2019s not what makes it work. It works as a way to transfer things because it\u2019s a pretty good distributed clearinghouse for value. If bitcoin were stagnant at $1000 for the next ten years, it would remain a good way to transfer things.During the 18-month bear market that began in January 2014, people still used bitcoin. In fact, usage grew consistently the entire time.Price (solid red line) and transaction count (shaded red area) during the 2014\u201316 bear market. Image: Coin\u00a0MetricsBitcoin offers transactors a rival benefit; something they cannot find anywhere else. It\u2019s unique among cryptocurrencies, as it boasts the best reliability, uptime, dedicated track record, and protocol developer community. It\u2019s unique among monetary assets because it offers properties not instantiated by gold or the USD. There\u2019s a reason people choose bitcoin.Claim: Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary characteristics mean that no one uses\u00a0it\u201cWhy spend $100 worth of bitcoin today if you think it\u2019s going to be worth $1,000 in a not-too-distant tomorrow? You wouldn\u2019t. And people aren\u2019t.\u201dShameless plug: I urge you to consult my website Coin Metrics, where we make this data free and available so anyone can use it. Conservatively, bitcoin saw $2.5 billion in on-chain transaction volume yesterday. That\u2019s omitting all the off-chain transactions that occur on Opendimes, on second-layer networks like Lightning, and internally at Xapo and at Coinbase.Image: Coin\u00a0MetricsIn the last year, bitcoin routinely hosted the transfer of $2B worth of bitcoin a day, up to a peak of about $16B of bitcoin a day. That\u2019s a lot of fake transactions. The anticipated response to this from the skeptic is that on-chain volumes are just a clearinghouse for the multitude of exchanges worldwide, or simply a way for individuals to access the altcoin casino. The former is probably true; we have good evidence that bitcoin is mostly an industrial network dominated by exchanges and power users rather than one that caters to end-users. Using the rough heuristic that industrial users tend to batch transactions, we can see that 30\u201340 percent of the network is industrialized in this manner.There\u2019s nothing wrong with this. It simply means that bitcoin acts as a decentralized global settlement network for a number of endpoints that connect it to everyday economic systems, with which users transact at the individual level. This is pretty radical! A decentralized, neutral, untamperable central bank that settles flows on a continuous basis between a global network of smaller banks (exchanges, merchants, and custodians). What a concept.As for the \u201cbitcoin as an on-ramp to the altcoin casino view,\u201d if this were true, then bitcoin would have cratered along with altcoins as they fell 80\u201390 percent over the last six months. However, bitcoin has shown great strength against altcoins during the bear market. If you look at any index, bitcoin has regained dominance. This pokes holes in the story that it is only used for access to altcoin pump and dumps.For context, here\u2019s the Bletchley total market index quoted in bitcoins since December. Ever since the contraction began in January, bitcoin has strengthened against the rest of the cryptoasset market.Image: Bletchley IndexesYou wouldn\u2019t expect this if bitcoin was only a vehicle for speculation on other cryptocurrencies. Clearly, there is demand for bitcoin in its own right.Claim: Bitcoin is illiquid and hence manipulated\u201cThis lack of liquidity makes it pretty easy for a few fraudsters to push the price up quite a bit.\u201dThis isn\u2019t the case, and relies on a flawed reading of the Tether situation. Fundamentally, bitcoin is quite liquid. It has huge volumes on listed exchanges, and probably the same amount again on over-the-counter providers like Cumberland, Circle, Genesis, and Octagon.Much illiquid. Very manipulation. Image: Coin\u00a0MetricsEven if you subtract all Tether volume, and all volume from synthetic exchanges like BitMEX, and all swaps and futures volume from the CME and CBOE, you have robust volumes. The market for BTC \u2192 fiat (on the right in the chart below) is also quite liquid.Image: NomicsIf you look at the market for fully-regulated futures exchanges, the picture is sunny.CME daily volumes (contracts are for 5 BTC). Image: CME\u00a0GroupYesterday, 7077 contracts were traded at the CME\u200a\u2014\u200aequivalent to $215 million. The liquidity picture is strong, and improving.Claim: Bearer assets are dangerous and\u00a0illegal\u201cThere\u2019s a reason, after all, why bitcoin has attracted so many scammers: All its transactions are irreversible.\u201dYou have to take the bad with the good. It\u2019s a digital bearer asset, which is completely new. Of course people want to scam with it\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s the best money ever invented. That USD is never used by scammers, right?\u201cAll of which is to say that if you steal a bitcoin, you get to keep a bitcoin.\u201dIf you earn a bitcoin, you get to keep a bitcoin. If you mine a bitcoin, you get to keep a bitcoin. Strong property rights are a hell of a thing. This is just an incentive to build more secure wallet and custody software. We\u2019re halfway there already.Claim: Bitcoin still relies on a trusted set of intermediaries\u201cBitcoiners think all of this is worth it. That it\u2019s better to have a financial system that is clunkier, costlier and more vulnerable to attacks than it is to have to trust someone\u200a\u2014\u200aor, more accurately, to admit that you have to trust someone.\u201dUsing bitcoin doesn\u2019t rely on trust in an individual. If you run a node, use a hardware wallet or a well-concealed paper wallet, and maintain good opsec, you are pretty much set. Of course, to obtain your bitcoin, you may have to use Gemini/GDAX/Square. But no one is forcing you to hold your bitcoin on an exchange. It\u2019s only long-term storage on an exchange which requires significant trust in the institution. And bitcoiners universally, vociferously, encourage people not to do that.Nothing backs bitcoin or pegs it to a basket of assets. That\u2019s the point. Bitcoin was designed specifically to avoid the influence of a single authority.More broadly, bitcoin doesn\u2019t remove trust entirely. That\u2019s a straw man frequently knocked down by critics. Bitcoin reduces the need for trust in a single institution. Instead, you just have to trust that the code is well-vetted in the typical FOSS [free and open-source software] manner, that the economics that underscore mining continue to hold, and that discrete log problem is still hard. We have plenty of evidence that these things all hold, and will continue to hold. And we have plenty of evidence that, conversely, a single institution in control of the money supply will always abuse its power. If you don\u2019t believe me, just check out what\u2019s happening in Turkey today. Seignorage is a drug\u200a\u2014\u200aand it\u2019s pretty much impossible to kick the habit.\u201cBitcoin exchanges require some measure of [trust] whether they realize it or not.\u201dCentralized exchanges do. There exist non-custodial peer-to-peer exchanges, like Hodl Hodl and Bisq, for bitcoin. LocalBitcoins is another peer-to-peer exchange that places reduced reliance on a single intermediary. Even centralized exchanges can conduct periodic proofs of solvency, if users demand it. And, as with the rest of finance, if the brokerages/exchanges/clearinghouses are regulated under functional regimes, they are strongly incentivized not to run fractional reserves or lose user funds.The broader point here is that relying on centralized exchanges is inevitable. Many people will trade off decentralization for convenience, and we can\u2019t stop that. We can demand that exchanges behave appropriately. There are many exchanges and custodians with long histories of robustness, resilience, and integrity. There is a market for exchanges, and the badly-run ones will fail.To sum\u00a0upThe problem with this article is that the pundit in question has settled on a narrative\u200a\u2014\u200abitcoin is a poor economic system\u200a\u2014\u200aand then searched for various datapoints that confirm his view. Bitcoin is volatile, yes. It is an emerging commodity-money that\u2019s becoming financialized and growing from a small tribe of enthusiasts to a global user base. Of course it\u2019s volatile. Growth is not linear. Only fragilistas demand it to be so.Nothing backs bitcoin or pegs it to a basket of assets. That\u2019s the point. Bitcoin was designed specifically to avoid the influence of a single authority. Bitcoin is priced exactly where it ought to be\u200a\u2014\u200athis is always true. Manipulation might work on a 15-minute time frame, but it\u2019s just implausible in the extreme that a $100 billion-plus asset class has been manipulated into existence.Yes, bitcoin relies on exchanges to provide exit ramps for individuals that want to reduce their reliance on sovereign currencies. Sometimes those exchanges get hacked and fail. That is entirely natural. Bitcoin continues to chug along unaffected. It\u2019s extremely popular; its strong assurances and settlement guarantees grant it daily volumes in the billions. It is a single order of magnitude behind Visa\u2019s economic throughput\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s right, just one 10x away. The gap will probably be closed in the next year. It has an unmatched record of reliability, resilience, and resistance to cooption. For a nine-year-old, this is a pretty good track record. If it were a human, it would be midway through the fourth grade.Pundits will continue to ignore this; not because they\u2019re incapable of reading the data, but because they don\u2019t want to. They are deeply afraid of the world that bitcoin threatens to bring about. They prefer a paternalistic, easy-money regime, where occupations like punditry are profitable. Bitcoin promises accountability and a hard money standard. It threatens the existence of bailouts, moral hazard, and fiat-inflationism. In Bitcoinland, the only way to acquire wealth is to work for it. Cronyism doesn\u2019t work, as the central bank of bitcoin is entirely indifferent to politics and lobbying. This offends the sensibilities of the partisans writing for the Post.Bottom line, the central premise of the article is wrong:\u201cThere\u2019s one thing a currency is supposed to do that bitcoin never has. That\u2019s maintain a stable value.\u201dBitcoin isn\u2019t designed to have a stable value. That just quite frankly isn\u2019t what Satoshi set out to build, and that\u2019s not the system we have today. Artificial stability\u200a\u2014\u200ashorting volatility\u200a\u2014\u200aleaves you destined for a blowup. That is the fate of any non-fully-backed stablecoin. Bitcoin is designed to solve the double spend problem for digital cash, and to provide a predictable monetary policy. It does that very well, it has done that for the last nine and a half years, and it will continue doing that for the foreseeable future. Demanding low volatility on top of that is farcical, and betrays deep ignorance about the tradeoffs inherent in monetary systems, and the way that financial markets work more generally.Bitcoin is still an emerging, youthful asset. It hasn\u2019t reached maturity. It has somewhere in the realm of 50\u2013100 million holders/users; that\u2019s global penetration of a percentage point or two. The base layer still hasn\u2019t been nailed down, let alone the next layers up on the stack. Development is deliberate and careful, because this is money we\u2019re talking about, not a consumer app. Governance is hard to organize; consensus is difficult to obtain. The internet wasn\u2019t built in a day, and neither will the protocols for transmitting value trustlessly.Since the market is constantly revising its expectations for bitcoin, amid a backdrop of growing, unsteady adoption, its exchange rate is volatile. No one is forcing you to hold it; it is totally opt-in. Bitcoin may not make sense for Westerners who live under somewhat credible monetary regimes, but it might be a good bet for an Iranian, a Venezuelan, a Turk, or anyone else who mistrusts their monetary authorities. Truthfully, mechanisms to bring bitcoin to these disempowered groups are still lacking or nonexistent. But they have the right to money that isn\u2019t controlled and minted by a hostile state. This is why bitcoiners work to make global access to this economic institution a reality.Bitcoin\u2019s complexity doesn\u2019t acquit these pundits for getting simple facts about bitcoin blatantly wrong. And ultimately, their ignorance hurts their bottom line. Being amateurishly wrong about basic details of a system that is widely-understood undermines their integrity and makes readers question their work.

I remember when Bitcoin first launched and the coding world was shocked by the anonymous blockchain whitepaper. Since then, I\u2019ve made\u200a\u2014\u200aand lost\u200a\u2014\u200aseveral thousand dollars in a single day gambling on cryptos.So, why\u2019d I\u00a0sell?To understand that, we\u2019ll have to look at the two reasons you\u2019d buy a cryptocurrency: as a currency, and as an investment.CryptoCURRNECYBlockchain / Bitcoin was invented as a new form of currency. One that\u2019s scalable, distributed and anonymous. Good currencies should also be generally accepted, stable and durable (among other things). So, whether or not it\u2019s a good investment, it should at least be a good currency\u2026 right?Is Bitcoin (or any major crypto, really) scalable? NO. Right now, Bitcoin can handle on the order of 3\u20137 transactions per second. VISA can handle 47,000. As bitcoins have become more popular, this scalability shortcoming has resulted in skyrocketing transaction fees (up to $50 per transaction!), resulting in many merchants (such as Steam) no longer accepting bitcoins.Is it distributed? Yes. But, this may not even be a good thing. While the creators and investors in cryptocurrencies talk about how terrible central banks are, they provide significant value in the form of economic stability through monetary policy. Without printing more money (aka inflation), economies enter \u201cdeflationary periods\u201d where currency itself becomes more and more valuable. Although this sounds great, many economists disagree and believe that deflation results in reduced spending and a vicious cycle of economic collapse.Is it anonymous? Mostly. But governments are cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges, making it harder and harder to move cryptos around anonymously\u200a\u2014\u200aand for good reason. As a society, it\u2019s generally not in our best interest to make illegal activities easier (although not all anonymous transactions are illegal, making anonymous transactions easier also makes illegal transactions easier). Plus, as individuals, using an anonymous currency poses significant risk: with identities hidden, fraud becomes rampant. Because it\u2019s behind-the-scenes, we as consumers rarely appreciate just how critical fraud prevention is. Without it, you would have no form of recourse if (sorry, when) a fake online merchant steals your money, or a thief gets hold of your bitcoin credit card and buys themselves a nice new $10,000 suit. With enough engineering, we might be able to build fraud prevention on top of cryptocurrencies by reducing some of their anonymity, but at what point are we just re-inventing the wheel?Is it generally accepted? After ten years and a lot of smart people working on it\u2026 still no. Scaling issues aside, this indicates that few consumers or businesses actually find value in bitcoins over existing currencies. As a business owner, I\u2019ve even tried to add support for bitcoin\u2026 but it\u2019s so slow that integration is a huge headache. Imagine having to wait 10 minutes before you can get your cup of coffee because the transaction is still \u201cclearing\u201d. Even if Bitcoin somehow supported 10,000x more transactions AND sped up the per-transaction speed 600x (down to one second), they\u2019d have just achieved what we already have. I suspect that many businesses would still opt not to deal with the extra complexity of supporting another currency.Is it stable? HAH. Nobody will trust a currency that swings 10%+ in value in a single day. And because it\u2019s unregulated (unlike the stock market, which at least has the SEC), wealthy, malicious agents can cause serious economic harm through market manipulations. Without stability, businesses can\u2019t trust a currency enough to set prices.Is it durable? Less so than a normal currency. All you have to do is watch the news for ongoing stories of people\u2019s bitcoins getting hacked / stolen / forgetting their password and watching millions of dollars disappear. At least with a bank account, there\u2019s a way to recover a forgotten password! (and the problem of humans forgetting / losing information will NEVER go away)The icing on top: Not only is Bitcoin 10,000 slower than existing solutions, it\u2019s also wayyyy less power efficient. Each bitcoin transaction consumes $35 in electricity (source). Bitcoin mining is only financially possible because the hype bubble keeps driving up prices (for now). In a time when governments and citizens around the world are working hard to reduce emissions, cryptocurrencies are socially irresponsible. Some cryptos are working on a new technology called Proof of Stake that should help with this, but it\u2019s still highly experimental. Until then, I\u2019m ethically not interested in supporting any currency using wasteful Proof of Work systems, even those ridiculous ones that claim to be \u201cgreen\u201d just because they\u2019re wasting solar energy (that could otherwise be used to replace coal power for reasonable uses).As you can see, even if a cryptocurrency solved all of these nearly-impossible technical challenges\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if they became 10,000x faster, 5,000x more power-efficient and hack-proof\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019ve still created a currency that is a worse currency, by definition, than our current financial systems (see above points). Maybe some new blockchain-based currency will crack the code\u2026 and at that point, I will happily use that as my daily currency. But nobody can know if (or when) that will ever happen, or which crypto will succeed.Most importantly, even if a blockchain-based currency could become a valid currency in the future, that doesn\u2019t make any specific crypto a good investment now.What about an investment?Which brings us to the second reason you might buy a cryptocurrency\u2026 as an investment. And, hey, there\u2019ll only ever be 21 million bitcoins! EVER! How could they not go up?But, as Mr. Money Mustache\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the savviest investors on the Internet puts it\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cyou could make the same argument about my fingernail clippings: they may have no intrinsic value, but at least they are in limited supply so let\u2019s use them as the new world currency!\u201dThe same argument could be made about cash\u200a\u2014\u200ait realistically only holds \u201cvalue\u201d because there\u2019s a limited amount of it. But, here\u2019s the thing: nobody invests in cash. People invest in things with value. Companies that produce revenues and dividends, or loans that offer you interest in return. Some people also \u201cinvest\u201d in things like fine art, beanie babies, lottery tickets and vintage baseball cards, but let\u2019s be clear: that\u2019s speculation.To really put the nail in the coffin, consider another one of MMM\u2019s excellent points: the core blockchain technology\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is the only reason to be excited about bitcoins and cryptos to begin with\u200a\u2014\u200ais open source. Which means bitcoins as a gamble on blockchain technology aren\u2019t unique, and aren\u2019t actually in \u201climited supply\u201d. There are now more than 1,300 currencies all using nearly identical blockchain technology, with more being created every day.While blockchain technology as a whole might still provide value in specific ways (such as Ripple speeding up international money transfers), cryptocurrencies as an investment are hype bubbles driven by founders and early investors trying to get rich quick and trick other people into buying their worthless tokens.In conclusionWe as a society have a terrible memory. A lot of people made a lot of money in the run-up to the Dotcom bubble\u200a\u2014\u200aand then lost all of it when their \u201cmillion dollar companies\u201d suddenly became worthless.I don\u2019t know exactly when the crash will happen, but I can tell you this: you can only sell snake oil for so long before people realize it\u2019s water. If you own cryptocurrencies, please sell them. You should have made a nice little profit after their most recent run-up, but if you don\u2019t sell them before they crash, you\u2019ll lose all of your money.P.S. For savvy investors looking where to put their money next: The entire crpyto market is worth over three-quarters of a trillion dollars as of writing. When these markets crash and all of that value disappears, there\u2019s going to be a recession. Recessions are categorized by a drop in available liquid assets, and thus a drop in spending, so $750,000,000,000 disappearing should just about do it. When all of that money disappears, lots of people are going to be defaulting on loans and cutting back spending, which will result in job losses and further spending cuts.When that happens, stocks (which are backed by tangible assets) will go on sale and you\u2019ll be able to make a killing by investing your now-liquid cash in cheap stocks.Like this?

Rather the purpose of this essay is to offer a more grounded take of what one can expect from a Bitcoin bull market post-2017, and why.\u2014First Mover ManiaNovelty in tandem with increasing price is a powerful catalyst.Nobody had heard of Bitcoin before, nobody can explain it to you, but its price was going up rapidly. Something something digital gold, sound money, and you\u2019re an idiot if you\u2019re not on board.Sound familiar?The bear market of 2014 (when Bitcoin was at an incomparable price, and retail speculators don\u2019t look at charts anyway) was, I would argue, a distant consideration for speculators in late 2017. Instead, Bitcoin was this new cool technology that was only known to be increasing in price.The reality now is quite different for two main reasons.I) Due to Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise and subsequent fall, the public at large (and certainly most people who follow markets) will have now heard of Bitcoin given the incessant news coverage on the way up, as well as on the way down. I submit that a very large portion of the novelty, which was a strong catalyst for buying, has since worn off.II) Previously, Bitcoin was only known for its increasing price. At this point, you may be understandably concerned with my fixation on the price. In response, I humbly submit that without the rapidly increasing price, Bitcoin would have enjoyed but a mere fraction of the coverage it received in 2017, if any at all. Price is an inextricably important factor when it comes to the public\u2019s perception and the media\u2019s coverage of Bitcoin. To return to the argument: in 2017 Bitcoin was known for its rapidly increasing price, and I would argue very few investors scrolled all the way back to 2014 for the last bear market. The present circumstances are different: 2018 has proven that Bitcoin can erase profits as quickly as it can create them, and this is something that current and future investors will be cognisant of.The argument can be summarised thus: much of the hype about the technology is gone, and more importantly, unlike in 2017, people have now witnessed firsthand how much money they can lose by investing in Bitcoin.\u2014Technical Resistance and Price DiscoverySupport that is broken turns to resistance.In 2017, barring a few regular corrections, Bitcoin faced no technical resistance.What was there to resist the price, aside from psychological barriers?No previous support levels acting as resistance, great news coverage (usually about price going up and setting new all-time highs), and exciting Bitcoin-related instruments in the making e.g. futures.Literally everybody was winning and there was nothing standing in the way: the market was in full price discovery, guided and influenced solely by the speculators at that specific period in time.2018 is different.We have more price history available, and all the areas where Bitcoin found support in the past that are above the current market price, can now reasonably be expected to act as resistance.Price has been \u2018discovered\u2019, so to speak, and now traders and investors alike have reference points for selling and something to measure the current price against, namely the all-time high.I submit that the existence of technical resistance levels, in tandem with the fact that there is a clear all-time high (and other highs) that can be used as reference points, will render a future bull market much more moderate and less manic than the totally blind everyone-is-winning price discovery mania of 2017.Broad-brush Bitcoin resistance levels\u2014Itching for BreakevenSome investors just want to get their money back, or at least see their investment in the green.The concept of breaking even could not even reasonably apply in 2017. Aside from the regular and short-lived corrections, it was virtually impossible to be losing money for any meaningful period of time when buying Bitcoin.That has changed.It is invariably true that plenty of speculators bought Bitcoin near the highs and have lost a lot of money doing so.As mentioned: on the way up, it was virtually impossible to be down on a Bitcoin investment and thus there was no material impetus to sell at a certain point. Today, especially if one invested in late 2017, the chances of being underwater are very high (assuming one didn\u2019t average in earlier in the year and instead caught the frenzy late, as many did).Thus, there appears an impetus to sell at a certain price level; an impetus which did not exist last year.While I agree that manic markets render humans manically greedy, after months upon months of drawdown many speculators uninterested in the technology and asset class as a whole i.e. those only interested in making a quick buck having seen the price skyrocket, just want to get their money back and nothing to do with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.I submit that the fact that lots of people lost money, which was virtually impossible to do in 2017, means that there will be more sellers in the next bull market.

When their charismatic CEO Arthur Hayes goes on CNBC to say nice things about Bitcoin, the recordings go viral on Twitter, and when the amazing BitMEX Research puts out a new blog post, everyone stops their day to read it.But a series of recent issues with the exchange leads me to believe that they have a hard time acting ethically once it gets in their way of making more money. That is a problem because BitMEX is based in the Seychelles and doesn\u2019t submit to any regulator.BitMEX is an opaque entity that wields disproportionate influence in the industry. In an attempt to understand the machinations of the exchange, I did two things:Interviewed everyone who was willing to talk to me about BitMEX, listening to their most frequent and reasonable concerns.Built a mental model of how I believe BitMEX operates and what their incentives are.That led me to identify three main concerns.\u201cBitMEX trades against their customers\u201d\u201cBitMEX weaponizes their server problems\u201d\u201cBitMEX monetizes customer liquidations through their insurance fund\u201dI will explore the validity of each concern and see if they fit the BitMEX incentive structure. Last, I will propose a set of solutions that should ameliorate the concerns going forward.This article is sourced from many in the industry, most of whom are customers of BitMEX to this day. All have chosen not to disclose their identities.1\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cBitMEX trades against their customers\u201dOn April 30, 2018, BitMEX released a blog post that announced an update to their Terms of Service. It says that \u201cBitMEX has a for-profit trading business that, among other things, transacts in products traded on the BitMEX platform. The trading business primarily trades as a market maker\u201d.Market makers continuously quote buy and sell orders to provide liquidity on exchanges. They are the ones filling the order books with orders that others can then match. The prices quoted by market makers are typically placed below and above the last price. This way, they profit from people who pay for the privilege to have their trade executed immediately (by taking instead of making a competitive order).Market makers post a quote to both the buy and sell side of the order book. If their sell order gets taken, they look to close out a buy order as well. This guarantees that the market maker stays as neutral as possible to the general price movements of the market. Instead of from up- or down movements of the price, he instead profits from the spread that his customers are willing to pay for the immediate liquidity he provides.If the desk only engaged in market making, that would be fine, as it would help the users of the exchange fill orders. But all of my interviewees have challenged this statement. Here is why they are skeptical:BitMEX hid the desk from their customers.If the desk engaged in market making and nothing else, many wonder why BitMEX was so bent on keeping its existence a secret. When BitMEX finally came clear about it in April of 2018, it had been a persistent rumor for a long time.BitMEX may have lost their legal counsel after announcing the desk and kept that a secret,\u00a0too.In their original blog post on April 30, BitMEX still lists the renowned international law firm Sullivan & Cromwell as their lead outside counsel.But somewhere between May 5 and May 22, they silently removed Sullivan & Cromwell from the post.Why did BitMEX and Sullivan & Cromwell separate? Is it possible that S&C had issues with the plans that BitMEX had with their desk? I reached out to S&C with a request for comment and will update my article when they get back to me.The desk makes a profit from\u00a0trading.While BitMEX admits the desk is a for-profit operation, they claim that its profit doesn\u2019t come from trading:According to them, the desks\u2019 goal is to be breakeven (PnL stands for profit and loss, or net income) and that the desk instead makes money from a service fee paid by the main business.This method would guarantee that the desk sticks to market making, a positive-sum activity that benefits the exchange (which gains volume), market makers (who capture spreads), and traders (who gain liquidity). Trading for profit, on the other hand, is strictly a zero-sum game that merely provides the illusory benefits of a well-operated exchange.Unfortunately, there is no way for the customers to verify the desk\u2019s business model, as BitMEX has never opened up to an external audit of their business structure. Customers have to take their word for it, and most don\u2019t believe them.The desk is not market-neutral.We established above that market making attempts to be market neutral and not benefit from the market moving up or down. The opposite of that would be to take a directional position, which can be short or long. If you go short, you benefit from the market moving down, and if you go long, you benefit from the market moving up. Doing this would be a prerequisite for the desk to make a profit from trading.The desk isn\u2019t held to the same rules as everyone\u00a0else.A BitMEX desk that is allowed to trade on their exchange freely is bad in theory but even worse in practice. Because it creates the incentives to go the extra mile and give it unfair advantages over the other customers. If the owner of an online casino was allowed to play in his own poker games, we have to ask: can he resist the urge to view everyone\u2019s hole cards?This brings us to the most important job of any peer-to-peer exchange: to guarantee fair competition between all customers. It comes down to two things: equal access to information, and equal priority of access.Equal information is important because just like in a poker game, it helps to know as much as possible about the cards everyone else is holding. Some information is available to everyone, like the composition of the order book or past price developments. Other information is private, like the degree of leverage that each position uses and at what price it runs out of margin, triggering its liquidation.Knowing the liquidation points of all other players would allow you to move the market by placing a large buy or sell order to and trigger this a so-called chain of liquidations (also known as a cascading margin call). When, for example, a lot of leveraged shorts get liquidated, they enter the market as forced buy orders, pushing the price even higher. At this point, you would sell into this \u201cbuy wall\u201d to close your trade with a handsome profit.Of course, BitMEX has explicitly denied granting privileged information to their trading desk. It has not commented on the second requirement, equal priority of access. This refers to the speed and reliability in communicating with the exchange and placing your orders. Access speed in trading is so important that a whole industry, called high-frequency trading or HFT, has been built on it. This led traditional exchanges to invest tons of resources to iron out even small perceived imbalances in their system, which would otherwise get exploited and make the exchange too unfair for regular customers.While access speed is hard to measure, there is a concrete reason why people suspect BitMEX gives unfair advantages to some customers, most of all their trading desk.2\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cBitMEX weaponizes their server problems\u201dBitMEX is long known for having frequent server problems, which BitMEX has historically blamed on using a very safe, but computationally expensive, trading engine.A high level of system integrity is important because of all the leveraged positions that BitMEX has open with their customers at any time. Any small bug in the system could lead to a user being allowed to lose more than he has, which would endanger the financial stability of the entire exchange.To prevent that, BitMEX has a risk management engine which activates on every tick. A tick is the smallest possible price movement, in the case of BitMEX\u2019s perpetual swaps, $0.50. Once the price moves, the risk management engine will perform an entire audit of the system and de-risk it by performing the necessary liquidations.While the risk management usually is very fast, sometimes it can bring the entire system to a halt. Then the exchange stops working, and everyone has to wait for service to return. BitMEX calls these events \u201cserver overloads\u201d, and they now regularly happen around 2\u20133 times a day.In theory, BitMEX allows open positions to be closed during server overloads with supposed priority. But in reality, it\u2019s impossible because users either get locked out of their accounts and are unable to sign back in, or they simply can\u2019t process any trades, including closes or cancellation of orders.These times when users lose their ability to trade are very problematic for a couple of reasons:Some people can trade through overload.While regular users can\u2019t get orders through or even access their accounts, orders will continue to get filled, and the market keeps moving. This led many users to the impression that some parties have priority access to submit their orders and are unaffected by the server problems.Naturally, the main target of suspicion for this preferred treatment is the BitMEX trading desk, but rumors say that they also grant it to certain high-frequency trading firms. One interviewee described it as follows: \u201cImagine you\u2019re in a fight, but you have your hands tied behind your back. That is how overloads work where some people can keep trading while you can\u2019t\u201d.There are two major ways that you could benefit from trading through overload:You can arbitrage during overload.Imagine the price of Bitcoin moving up 100$ on the other exchanges while everyone on BitMEX is frozen in time. If you could trade on BitMEX, you suddenly have access to a ton of liquidity a the old price level. You can buy it on BitMEX and at the same time sell for the new price on other exchanges to benefit from the spread.You can trigger a chain of liquidations during overload.We mentioned these earlier as a way to benefit for traders who have inside information about when other players get liquidated. But they also come into play here, because the majority is simply unable to close their positions in time. If you wanted to exploit this as a priority user, you would move the price with large orders while others aren\u2019t trading on BitMEX to move where you want it. This would result in stop-losses activating as well as liquidations occurring once other exchanges move towards the Bitmex price since Bitmex is the dominant exchange. These liquidations and stop-loss orders entering the market will move the price further and trigger further liquidations. This is when you sell and book a decent profit.", "responses": "32"}, {"title": "Collecting your free Bitcoin Gold ($BTG) coins with\u00a0Coinomi", "author_name": "Coinomi Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@coinomi/collecting-your-free-bitcoin-gold-btg-coins-da937d4255d1?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 21, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "4.4K", "content": "Collecting your free Bitcoin Gold ($BTG) coins with\u00a0CoinomiCoinomi BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 21, 2017Collecting your (free) Bitcoin Gold ($BTG) coins with Coinomi will be super easy.Important NoticePlease note that you won\u2019t be able to claim your $BTG or make any valid transactions with your $BTG wallet before the BitcoinGold network\u2019s launch at the start of November.

In this article, I\u2019m going to lay out what these forks are, where the software is published and how to claim them if you dare.A few caveats before we get started. I\u2019m only going to examine Hard Forks that are actually open source, have a running blockchain and are traded on at least a few exchanges. If there are more forks that you think I should consider that fill these criteria, please tweet at me and let me know.Bitcoin DiamondFirst up is Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) which probably gained the most support across exchanges before they launched. They have some code that\u2019s clearly based on Bitcoin Core. There apparently isn\u2019t much wallet support, though there\u2019s a wallet called BitPie that supports it. I can\u2019t vouch for that wallet, but they do support some different currencies and it\u2019s more or less the only game in town if you don\u2019t want to run a full BCD node.The main difference with Bitcoin Diamond is that they multiplied the supply by 10. If you had 1 BTC before block 495866, you now have 10 BCD. This is done by moving the decimal point rather than making the coin more divisible. That is, with Bitcoin, 100 million satoshi = 1 BTC. With Bitcoin Diamond, 10 million satoshi = 1 BCD. It\u2019s really just pure marketing.Nobody really knows who the developers are but the code is relatively similar to Bitcoin Core, so there\u2019s not too much to worry about. I would still run the code in a separate machine, physical or virtual.For the technical geeks out there, the main difference in the transaction is that version is now 12 instead of 1. Version 12 requires that you put a block hash as the field right after version, which takes care of replay protection. The block hash can be any block hash that has already occurred as far as I can tell. Unlike BCH and BTG which use the BIP143 standard for signing all transactions, BCD uses the legacy signing for non-segwit transactions (subject to quadratic hashing and difficulty assessing value of transaction for offline signing) and BIP143 for segwit transactions.This is an odd choice for replay protection as there is a perfectly good forking id standard pioneered by BCH and BTG, but alas, BCD decided to do its own thing. The hash type is the same as Bitcoin (usually SIGHASH_ALL) and unlike BTG or BCH, the SIGHASH_FORKID stuff is not used at all.Bitcoin Diamond is trading at around $20/BCD as of this writing, which ends up being about $200/BTC or 1.3%.Super BitcoinSuper Bitcoin (SBTC) forked on block 498888 and is a 1:1 fork, no special decimal point manipulation needed. The coin purportedly will have Lightning, zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts, none of which I saw in their code repository.Ambitions aside, the developers of this fork are at least known and on their website. Again, it\u2019s mostly Bitcoin Core code with a few modifications. There are several exchanges that already support this or are planning to support this, so it\u2019s at least got some potential for liquidity.Main technical difference is that transactions are version 2, though version 1 is still accepted. The signing does use SIGHASH_FORKID, but not an actual fork number. Instead, the entire Signature Hash has the string \u201csbtc\u201d appended at the end. This sounds easy, but after debugging this for about 12 hours, I discovered that there\u2019s actually the length of the string prepended to this string, so it\u2019s actually something like 0473627463 in hex, not 73627463 as you would expect. By the way, I\u2019m seeing something very similar in the United Bitcoin repo, so for all you wallet developers, keep in mind that you may need to put the length of the string that gets appended at the end.Again, this is an odd way of doing replay protection as a perfectly good way that BTG and BCH pioneered is available, but such is the way of forks. Much like BCD, SBTC uses legacy signing for non-segwit transactions (subject to quadratic hashing and difficulty assessing value of transaction for offline signing) and BIP143 signing for segwit transactions. Again a puzzling choice since using a single signing algorithm would make wallet code vastly simpler. Not everyone will make choices that are going to be convenient for wallet developers.The only SPV wallet I could find was BitPie and it\u2019s a toss up as to whether this wallet is safer or the SuperBitcoin core wallet is safer. SBTC is trading at around $155 as of this writing which gives you about 1%.BitCoreLastly is something that\u2019s between a hard fork and an airdrop. BitCore (BTX) basically took the UTXO set from Bitcoin, compressed the outputs for each address and distributed on their chain. In layman\u2019s terms, they cleaned up the ledger (blockchain) so that it\u2019s a lot smaller.This is the most clever of the hard forks in that it doesn\u2019t require the Bitcoin blockchain like other hard forks do (120GB+!) and at least innovates by cleaning things up a little. Unfortunately, distribution on this coin is a bit stingier as you only get 0.5 BTX per 1 Bitcoin you had as of block 492820. They have a continuing airdrop going on, so there\u2019s also that aspect which helps the coin.BTX is supported by Coinomi, which has a very convenient sweep feature which can help you get at cold wallets and a seed entry feature which can help you get at coins that use the same BIP39 standard. Unfortunately, this is also the coin that\u2019s worth the least as it trades at around $20 as of this writing which gives you only about $10/BTC or 0.1%.How to Get These\u00a0CoinsThere are a few ways to get these coins, but regardless of which method you choose, here are the common steps.Whatever Bitcoins you had at the forking block, move them. If you\u2019re using a Trezor, for example, you\u2019re going to need the seed, so move them to another Trezor with a different seed. And yes, it\u2019s every coin you own. This is for your protection. No software can take your bitcoins if you move them away from these private keys first.Keep the seed or private key for a while. You have no idea what other hard forks are coming and some may have some substantial payoffs.Take your time and double check everything. You don\u2019t want to mess up on this stuff.Be patient. You\u2019re not going to be able to insta-dump them just yet (please, somebody make this business already!)Casual OptionAt least for SBTC and BTX, you have the option of entering the private keys into an app called Bither for SBTC and Coinomi for BTX. You can scan the private key (WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE BTC IN IT) and store them in the BitPie or Coinomi wallets for safekeeping.This is probably the easiest, but also a bit risky as you may not trust these wallets. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t an option to do this with BCD on any wallets yet and be careful about any that claim to be able to do this as they\u2019ve been known to steal funds from you. (this is why step 1 above is so important!) As long as you moved your BTC out of these addresses first, the only real risk is that another hard fork coin you\u2019re entitled to may be taken away from you.Advanced OptionThe more advanced option is to create a separate physical or virtual machine and run the actual core software. You can download the source code from the coin\u2019s repository and compile it yourself. Fortunately, since most of them are forks of Bitcoin Core, the Bitcoin Core compilation instructions for mac, windows and linux work just fine.Once you\u2019ve compiled the source code and have their respective binaries, you can launch the binaries until the blockchains are synced (this will take roughly a day on a decent connection). You will want to disconnect the machine from the internet at this point.You\u2019ll want another physical/virtual machine to run the same code on that\u2019s connected to the internet. This is so that you can broadcast transactions you make on the first machine.Go back to the first machine, import the private keys of your coins into the core wallet that all these coins come with. Then send the coins to an address you want and use the \u201cgetrawtransaction\u201d command to get the raw hex. Copy that to a usb stick or sd card and transfer that to the second, internet-connected machine and broadcast it there.This should more or less do what you want, though there\u2019s some small risk that you might get some malware, but it\u2019s on a machine you\u2019re going to wipe anyway, so who cares?Paranoid OptionThe paranoid option is to make your own transactions and broadcast them connecting to a node on the network manually. The hard part is not the connecting to the network, but actually making the transaction. You\u2019ll need your own library to sign the transaction and getting the Signature Hash is often not trivial. That said, this is the absolute safest option as you do not need to trust any software and indeed I spent a good amount of time doing this very thing.ConclusionHard forks are a reality and doing this sort of thing is going to be all too common going forward. Thankfully, there\u2019s a reward to doing this and truth be told, it\u2019s not a bad thing to get familiar with handling private keys in a reasonably secure fashion. The process is stressful, but you also built up an intuition about what you can and can\u2019t do.Best of luck in getting your \u201cfree\u201d coins!Are you a developer that wants to get into Bitcoin and blockchain?

This still continues to be the case today, but my stance on \u201cBitcoin maximalism\u201d has changed in light of lessons I\u2019ve learned along the way.Important to note here, I do not favor any particular alternative to Bitcoin. I simply do not think that every other alternative to Bitcoin are scams, nor do I think that the founders and the communities of these competing projects are motivated only by greed or ill intentions. In addition, I think that the altcoins serve an important role today, as we will explore in this post.The case for Bitcoin MaximalismHere\u2019s a possible version of a future that Bitcoin speculators prophesize:As the governments around the world continue to steal wealth from citizens in the form of taxes, bailouts, and inflation and enforce more control, surveillance and rent-seeking on financial transactions, the citizens will seek a better alternative: a superior form of money free from government control. Bitcoin, with more sound Austrian monetary policy compared to Keynesian fiat currencies, enforced by code, governed by consensus among a decentralized network of peer-to-peer nodes, secured by miners distributed across the globe, is the superior alternative.As more people buy into Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin relative to fiat currencies appreciates, which has a positive feedback loop. More people mine Bitcoin. The network becomes more secure. More serious investors buy in. More end-users transact in it. More development happens. This cycle continues, ultimately leading to Bitcoin\u2019s total world domination.We, the early Bitcoin investors, get rich off this pyramid-like scheme. The new entrants enjoy a superior form of money. Everybody wins.HyperbitcoinizationIt\u2019s a great story, with a happy ending. But the story has a few plotholes:1) How things\u00a0scaleThe maximalist worldview fails to appreciate how things scale in real life.A grown-up person is not an overgrown child.Marriage is not the sum of two persons committed to the marriage.A family is not the sum total of individual family members.A tribe is not the sum of families that make up the tribe.A city is not the sum of tribes that make up the city.As a unit grows, it undergoes a transformation. With growth, eventually comes a point when it\u2019s no longer the same thing it used to be. Bitcoin was founded on certain core values, but as the user base continues to grow, Bitcoin is going to continue the transformation into something else. This is neither good nor bad, it just simply is.Things we take for granted in Bitcoin today will not be the value proposition of Bitcoin tomorrow. Bitcoin in 2018 is qualitatively different from Bitcoin in 2014, which was different from Bitcoin in 2010. With growth, this identity change will accelerate and we will likely end up in a world where Satoshi, if still alive, would be scratching their head.2) How complex systems adapt to\u00a0changeNothing in a complex system happens in a vacuum. With the rise of Bitcoin, much of the world as we know today will change, for the better or worse.Bitcoin brings back a sound monetary policy. The central bankers who have abused their power until now have to act carefully. With no way to shut down completely, Bitcoin is a proverbial gun to their head: Act more responsibly or die. What can the bankers do in response?Introduce more sound monetary policies to compete with Bitcoin\u2019s. There\u2019s nothing magical about Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy that can\u2019t be adopted by centralized entities in a more efficient, transparent and effective manner, using some of the same tools that Bitcoin is built upon.Improve customer service, the end-users of the currency being the customers. The bankers will have to compete to win over the people empowered by Bitcoin. The citizens will no longer be reliant only on the government mandated currency, so the services offered must be exceptionally better to stay relevant.Build new narratives. The governments may tap into ideologies citizens value beyond wealth accumulation. This may include human rights, environmental sustainability, philanthropy, social justice, patriotism and anything else that\u2019s trendy and popular among citizens. History has shown time and time again that we are motivated by higher purposes beyond meeting basic wealth accumulation goals. Our time on earth is limited, and our value system is the legacy we leave behind.Allocate resources to fight back Bitcoin. The core features of Bitcoin we take for granted today will be challenged. The P2P network, the social consensus, the market price, network security, the protocol development are all attack surfaces and game-able. Repeated successful attacks might not destroy Bitcoin entirely from a technical point of view but when combined with social engineering, will shake people\u2019s confidence enough that it may just make Bitcoin not suitable for mainstream use.Aside from the bankers, with the precedence established by Bitcoin, it is possible that people\u2019s attitude towards money will change. Competing money-projects will be launched by established and respected enterprises with large followings, and governments will eventually stop the futile pursuit of attacking these projects. \u201cMoney\u201d will be denationalized and the competition for the strongest money will lead to a never-ending battle for the best money in ways we have not seen before in human history. Technological innovation will make moving from one form of money to another frictionless and easier than moving from one social media platform to the next.Does this seem like fiction to you? It shouldn\u2019t; in 2018, we are much closer to this reality than the alternatives. If you value libertarianism, meritocracy, and free market competition, then rejoice; this may be bad news for Bitcoin maximalists, but this is good news for you as the end user.3) The new entrants don\u2019t owe us\u00a0anythingThe maximalists assume that new adopters of Bitcoin are perfectly content with buying into Bitcoin at higher and higher valuation with the full knowledge of how much cheaper the early adopters had bought in. Much like everything else with maximalism, this is a simplistic view of the world.\u201cThey thought we were going to buy their\u00a0gold!\u201dAs we saw with the Ethereum project, launched by Vitalik Buterin, or the EOS project, launched by Dan Larimer, the new entrants to cryptocurrency world prefer to take their chance with the issuance of a fresh new currency than enrich the Bitcoin holders. Like it or not, from a game theory perspective, the incentives exist, and so this is a trend that\u2019s unlikely to change anytime soon. After all, from the perspective of an outsider, Bitcoin looks much like a scheme to redistribute real income from new to earlier owners of Bitcoin.4) Security through redundancyRedundancy is ambiguous because it seems like a waste if nothing unusual happens. Except that something unusual happens\u200a\u2014\u200ausually.\u2015 Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Antifragile: Things That Gain from DisorderBitcoin nodes are run by software. Just like any software, critical bugs do get introduced over time despite intensive QA and code review. This is, unfortunately, the very nature of software development, and not a criticism of Bitcoin Core contributors. Bitcoin Core continues to attract brilliant developers, but no matter how smart they are, in a long enough timeline, there is bound to be critical errors in Bitcoin Core.More serious threats are possible attack-vectors that are expensive and time-consuming, but nonetheless worth it for the states if Bitcoin were to become the only serious threat to the government money.We are yet to see any serious attempt by the governments to attack\u00a0Bitcoin.One of the major reasons I believe we haven\u2019t seen a war on Bitcoin is the existence of altcoins. Altcoins are insurance against state-level attacks on Bitcoin.The thousands of altcoins that have come out following Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps ensure that any serious and expensive attack on Bitcoin is futile and therefore unlikely. After all, what is the point in spending resources to attack Bitcoin, which, if successful, will be guaranteed to be replaced by an alternative that is even more censorship resistant, more decentralized and more private? From a game theory perspective, state-wide attacks on Bitcoin is a dumb idea, as long as the threat of one or more altcoins to replace Bitcoin\u2019s role exists.5) The trade-offs of\u00a0BitcoinBitcoin was born in an environment where governments around the world had a hostile attitude towards private money projects. Only the nation states were allowed to create money. Out of this necessity, Bitcoin had to settle for significant trade-offs in a quest for resistance. Many of the core Bitcoin tech stack, such as proof-of-work, blockchains, P2P networks etc are highly inefficient and present major scaling and environmental problems. But the trade-offs were well worth it to guarantee the core value propositions Bitcoin had to offer: censorship-resistance, permissionless, and decentralization to remove the central points of failure.It\u2019s only been 10 years since Bitcoin came out, and already there are alternatives to Bitcoin that are offering the same value proposition as Bitcoin but are more private, more decentralized, more scalable, more sustainable. Our imagination and pursuit for innovation have no bounds, and therefore it\u2019s unlikely that we will never be able to come up with technology that is fundamentally much better and incompatible with Bitcoin. The maximalists would naturally dismiss the tech as an altcoin and so inherently a \u201cscam\u201d, and ignore it until it\u2019s too late. This has happened over and over in the history of money, and there is no reason to think that it won\u2019t happen again.Why Maximalism is dangerous for\u00a0BitcoinMaximalism started as a harmless meme but has gradually turned into an actual cult. The cult members have a few books they swear by, a short list of influencers they follow, regular conferences they attend, and recently, even a diet plan they adhere to. All this was fun at first, but now the comedy elements have gone stale and the cult members have become the dominant voice representing Bitcoin. Bitcoin has become a fetish. All alternative forms of monetary experiments are labeled as \u201cscams\u201d. This general direction is dangerous because not only does it alienate new-comers, make Bitcoin users look like a bunch of lunatics you want nothing to do with, but also this is completely in contradiction to the cypherpunk ethos that Bitcoin was born out of.Bitcoin conferences these\u00a0daysBitcoin, like all money, is ultimately a shared delusion; it\u2019s not real. Money only exists because we agree as a society that they have value and so we can exchange them for goods and services. This allows everyone in society to cooperate with one another. Today, everyone believes that Dollar has value; our hope is that tomorrow everyone would agree that Bitcoin has value, and is even a superior alternative to Dollar. But if we keep alienating the users by taking extreme and nonsensical positions, then the network effect of Bitcoin will stop growing, and other alternative currencies with a healthier ecosystem will eventually win.This is already happening. The market share of Bitcoin is continuing to plummet and new cryptocurrencies are continuing to step up their game.Frustrated by fellow Bitcoin activists, I recently took on Twitter to criticize the maximalism movement.What followed is a massive outcry of Bitcoin maximalist cult members hurling insults, blocking/muting me and overall being outraged. Not a single Tweet actually addressed the content of my tweet with integrity. The behavior of prominent Bitcoin maximalists in response to this tweet is a signal that we are witnessing the birth of a cult that may be the largest threat we Bitcoin proponents have endured so far.Bitcoin doesn\u2019t scale socially if we don\u2019t learn how to be more\u00a0civil.Currency CompetitionThe opposite of Bitcoin maximalism is currency competition. It\u2019s not a utopian future. Scams and abuse of power will always be possible and will leave many victims in despair. Despite that, a free-market that encourages experiments and innovations is the best tool we have found historically for societal progress. The upside of free-market competition is that it leaves it to the users of cryptocurrencies to self-govern, not to gatekeepers.Bitcoin is still the best candidate we have today as an alternative to government-issued money in terms of liquidity and adoption. I think of existing alternatives to Bitcoin as necessary test cases for permissionless innovation, as well as insurance against a state-wide attack on Bitcoin or Bitcoin users. The market and the passage of time will naturally punish currencies with poor fundamentals and reward those with strong fundamentals.I want to see Bitcoin win, and I will continue to build and support businesses that make Bitcoin better, stronger and more accessible. In this process, we must never lose sight of the goal. Bitcoin is not the end-goal; it\u2019s a means to our goal of censorship-resistant, permissionless, denationalized money that we can opt in and out voluntarily, not by coercion, social engineering or threats of violence.True decentralization is when there are many competing money projects, not just one.May the meritocracy win.", "responses": "44"}, {"title": "The Unmasking of Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u200a\u2014\u200aThe\u00a0Fallout.", "author_name": "Alexander Muse", "link": "https://medium.com/cryptomuse/the-unmasking-of-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-the-fallout-86102a3c60eb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 2, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "3.2K", "content": "The Unmasking of Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u200a\u2014\u200aThe\u00a0Fallout.Alexander MuseBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 2, 2018The NSA knows his real\u00a0name\u2026Last year I published a post explaining how the NSA had successfully identified Satoshi Nakamoto\u200a\u2014\u200athe creator of the world\u2019s most famous blockchain currency\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin. The story was viewed more than 400,000 times here on Medium and 62% of them actually read it! When I wrote the story I had no idea what sort of \u201cfallout\u201d that was in store for me. It all started when a friend on mine at the Department of Homeland Security told me that the NSA knew the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto\u200a\u2014\u200aa fascinating story that I decided to share here on Medium. I\u2019ll share the story first and then describe how my life changed as a result.The Original\u00a0Story:As you surely know by now, the \u2018creator\u2019 of Bitcoin is the world\u2019s most elusive billionaire. Very few people outside of the Department of Homeland Security know Satoshi\u2019s real name. In fact, DHS will not publicly confirm that even THEY know the billionaire\u2019s identity. Satoshi has taken great care to keep his identity secret employing the latest encryption and obfuscation methods in his communications. Despite these efforts (according to my source at the DHS) Satoshi Nakamoto gave investigators the only tool they needed to find him\u200a\u2014\u200ahis own words.Using stylometry one is able to compare texts to determine authorship of a particular work.Throughout the years Satoshi wrote thousands of posts and emails and most of which are publicly available. According to my source, the NSA was able to the use the \u2018writer invariant\u2019 method of stylometry to compare Satoshi\u2019s \u2018known\u2019 writings with trillions of writing samples from people across the globe. By taking Satoshi\u2019s texts and finding the 50 most common words, the NSA was able to break down his text into 5,000 word chunks and analyse each to find the frequency of those 50 words.This would result in a unique 50-number identifier for each chunk. The NSA then placed each of these numbers into a 50-dimensional space and flatten them into a plane using principal components analysis. The result is a \u2018fingerprint\u2019 for anything written by Satoshi that could easily be compared to any other writing.NSAThe NSA then took bulk emails and texts collected from their mass surveillance efforts. First through PRISM (a court-approved front-door access to Google and Yahoo user accounts) and then through MUSCULAR (where the NSA copies the data flows across fiber optic cables that carry information among the data centers of Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook) the NSA was able to place trillions of writings from more than a billion people in the same plane as Satoshi\u2019s writings to find his true identity. The effort took less than a month and resulted in positive match.This wasn\u2019t the first time efforts had been made to unearth the identity of Satoshi using stylometry. Various reporters and members of the Bitcoin community have used various open source stylometry tools to attempt to uncover the true identity of Bitcoin\u2019s creator. Their problem? They didn\u2019t have access to trillions of emails from a billion people and they weren\u2019t able to plug them into a supercomputer. The NSA\u2019s proprietary software, bulk email collection ability, and computing power made it possible for them to conclusively identify Satoshi.But why? Why go to so much trouble to identify Satoshi? My source tells me that the Obama administration was concerned that Satoshi was an agent of Russia or China\u200a\u2014\u200athat Bitcoin might be weaponized against us in the future.Knowing the source would help the administration understand their motives. As far as I can tell Satoshi hasn\u2019t violated any laws and I have no idea if the NSA determined he was an agent of Russia or China or just a Japanese crypto hacker.Your words are your fingerprintThe moral of the story? You can\u2019thide on the internet anymore.Your sentence structure and word use is MORE unique than your own fingerprint. If an organization, like the NSA, wants to find you they will.NSASources: Many readers have asked that I provide third party citations to \u2018prove\u2019 the NSA identified Satoshi using stylometry. Unfortunately, I cannot as I haven\u2019t read this anywhere else\u200a\u2014\u200ahence the reason I wrote this post. I\u2019m not trying to convince the reader of anything, instead my goal is to share the information I received and make the reader aware of the possibility that theNSA can easily determine the authorship of any email through the use of their various sources, methods, and resources.Identity: Many readers have asked who Satoshi is and I\u2019ve made it clear that information wasn\u2019t shared with me. Based on my conversation I got the impression (never confirmed) that he might have been more than one person. This made me think that perhaps the Obama administration was right that Bitcoin was created by a state actor. One person commented on this post that Satoshi was actually four people. Again, I have no idea.How to Protect Yourself: There is a project on Github you can join to help create a way to write without fingerprints:https://github.com/psal/anonymouthThe FalloutShortly after writing the story one of my friends who happens to work at the DHS began getting strange calls. Evidently readers began searching my LinkedIn profile assuming my \u201csource\u201d was connected to me on the networking site (fortunately they weren\u2019t). Regrettably my friend continues to be harassed by people who assume she was my source\u200a\u2014\u200ashe was not. She has since \u201cunconnected\u201d from me on LinkedIn in an effort to stop the harassment.Two or three weeks later I was visited by a third-party investigator contracted by the Department of Homeland Security. He left a card on my front door indicating he had a very important matter to discuss with me. After talking to my lawyer he suggested that I speak with him on the phone and not in person. While I\u2019m not legally prohibited from sharing our discussion, I have been advised that it might be smart not to share what we discussed. I haven\u2019t heard anything else from DHS and recently filed a FOIA request so I can learn more about their investigation.Late last year I began getting strange texts from someone who claimed they were Satoshi Nakamoto. He was talking to the editor of Nicholas Thompson the Editor in Chief of Wired Magazine. As I later learned from Nicholas this guy was the same guy who convinced (at least for a time) the SEC and Tim Draper that he was the REAL Satoshi Nakamoto. According to The Verge:\u201cWhen reached for comment for Friday\u2019s article, Draper said simply, \u201che is a fake.\u201d Draper later elaborated that he had cut ties with the supposed Satoshi when he came to believe the figure was not the real Satoshi Nakamoto. \u201cHe had me going for a bit, but his \u2018proof\u2019 didn\u2019t check out,\u201d Draper explained. \u201cSatoshi\u201d confirmed that they had parted ways, but says it was he who fired Draper from the project.\u201dUltimately, I too decided that I was too busy to determine whether or not Tim was right so I discontinued communication with \u201cSatoshi\u201d.Of course, not all of the \u201cfallout\u201d was negative. I\u2019ve been approached by a number of crypto-entreprneuers with great business ideas\u200a\u2014\u200aseveral of which might end up to be great investments. I also began exploring the launch of something I\u2019m calling the \u201cBlockfund\u201d and conducting a tour to meet Bitcoin/Ethereum owners with wallets worth more than a million dollars. My first stop was Mexico City where I was hosted by a billionaire who has the largest blockchain portfolio in Latin America. More recently I\u2019ve hosted events in Nashville and Atlanta\u200a\u2014\u200anext week I\u2019ll be in Washington DC.At the end of the day, I\u2019ve had to stop taking phone calls or accepting voice mail messages. My email is almost unusable with more than 10,000 unread messages at last count. The only way to contact me now is via text\u200a\u2014\u200aand it is likely I\u2019m going to have to change my number fairly soon. I still don\u2019t know who Satoshi Nakamoto really is\u200a\u2014\u200abut I believe the NSA does.About The\u00a0AuthorAlexander MuseAlexander Muse is a serial entrepreneur, author of the StartupMuse, contributor to Forbes and managing partner of Sumo.

The exchanges today are facing a certain number of issues. Bitcoinbing team had outlined all those issues and designed its own exchange in a way that it bypasses all those problems.AlmostAlmost all the existing exchanges are put together in a rush to make profits as soon as possible. This approach has caused basic shortcomings in their structure of operations. Bitcoinbing platform took a longer time for development, with the specific goal of ensuring that the user experience does not deteriorate as user volumes rise on the platform. Bitcoinbing team used years of experience in cryptocurrency and design, with this collective effort enabled us to build a platform which maintains a uniform standard for user experience, with the capacity to withstand heavy transaction loads and immense fluctuations. Consequently, we did face some issues in the initial phase of development which was slower, but this is what gives Bitcoinbing the crucial operational edge in practice.The Key Features are:Zero Fee StructureBing token is Bitcoinbing platform\u2019s native token which gives traders zero trading fee, when using it to pay fee for trades made on Bitcoinbing exchange. This mean that Bitcoinbing raised capital, launched with a functional product and instantly had a practical utility to benefit users. A utility token is a functional token that, through smart contract programming, can be utilizedin many different ways. In case of Bing, it can be used to pay for services within the platform as well as with zero trading fee2. Multiple Currency PairBitcoinBing platform offers multiple currency pairing which would enable them in executing multiple transactions simultaneously. Initially the tokens would be paired with BING, BTC, ETH, & USDT. During the 1st quater of 2019 Fiat would be Deployed in which Major currencies would be USD, GBP, & INR.3. Full Stack Trade DeskThis particular feature strengthens the traders to trade with all the assets and derivatives. It lets them make investments with calculated risks along with telling them the parameters and straightening the transactions. It tells them the total amount of the assets on the dashboard and lets them calculate the profits they gain. The in-built trade calculator includes all the parameters by which the trader makes transactions and it gives out accurate results. The full stack trade desk enables the traders to plan the business strategically, keeping all the risks at bay.4. SecuritySecurity is the utmost priority for any platform which offers payment and transaction services. Bitcoinbing, being an exchange could not leave a stone unturned to make the security foolproof. Engineered on blockchain, Bitcoinbing has evaluated ever aspect of security and made the platform stalwart to counteract any security threat. This platform has included processes such as KYC to make the information absolutely safe. Blockchain itself provides a seal of security, but to reassure that everything is secure, Bitcoinbing has added every other parameter which makes its security paramount.More in detailed there would be2FA Authentication (For Login and Withdraw)OTP VerificationE-mail Verification (For Login and Withdraw)All Funds Will be stored in secured cold walletEncrypted KeysDDOs PreotctionData Transmission5. Token BuybackOnce a quarter, Bitcoinbing will aggregate atleast 50% of the exchange trading fee and use them to buy and burn Bing exchange tokens. This will keep a balanced amount of tokens in the market and in the platform for users. This process will burn additional tokens getting collected in the market and keep the value of Bing token intact. It would also help in gaining more value on top of the existing value.6. SpeedIn order to relieve the crypto traders from the above mentioned issues, Bitcoinbing team has industriously worked on it architecture. The onsite Bitcoinbing matching engine has a phenomenal transaction processing capacity that can handle up to 1,000,000orders/secon7. Desktop & Mobile AppThe Bitcoinbing platform is developed for both desktop and mobile users. As the number of mobile users is increasing rapidly, Bitcoinbing doesn\u2019t want any of its users to lose a single transaction due to this limitation. The compatibility of the platform with different operating systems such as Windows, Android, iOS and Linux has been checked by industry experts at numerous stage.8. Trading competition and Airdrop distributionWith all the other advantages, Bitcoinbing platform will also have a day trading competition and airdrop distribution. This would keep the traders motivated to engage in trading, it would also help them recover their losses, if they face some. Airdrops have become an integral part of ICO marketing campaigns. They can add a significant amount of investors in any program.The concept of trading competition is introduced to keep users engaged in trading activities which would help them in their portfolio. This program increases the user participation and rewards them with many benefits.9. 24/7 Live ChatBitcoinbing will provide 24/7 live chat support to assist users with any query or issue. Although, the platform is built in such a way that it leaves no scope of issue, the Bitcoinbing team understands that it may take a while for the users to come to terms with the platform. Therefore, we will have live chat support that will help the users with queries and nuances of the platform. This support system will have experts who know the platform inside out. The team will be resolving all the queries as soon as possible and all the complaints will be handled with immediate effect.10. Instant Withdrawal & Deposits.There will be Automatic Deposits and Withdrawal in accounts once verified with the security. so the users will have not to wait for the either deposit or withdrawal.More info:www.bitcoinbing.io", "responses": "6"}, {"title": "Why the bitcoin price has\u00a0dropped?", "author_name": "Atomicwallet", "link": "https://medium.com/atomic-wallet/why-the-bitcoin-price-has-dropped-394332ad44?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 10", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "10.8K", "content": "Why the bitcoin price has\u00a0dropped?AtomicwalletBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 10PrefaceWith a frantic pace of growth in prices for the cryptocurrency, its users expected that Bitcoin would gain mass popularity in just a few years. These expectations turned out to be unrealistic, and after a staggering takeoff, Bitcoin is falling again. However, things are not that simple as it may seem. Let\u2019s try to figure out the reasons for Bitcoin being dumped.Understanding the rollercoasterSuch excessive rate swings are not new to Bitcoin.At the beginning of the Bitcoin\u2019s development, it once fell from $32 to $2, which is 94%. In 2013, it fell from $260 to $45, that is, by 83%. In 2015, it dropped from $755 to $150, near 87%. Then in 2017, Bitcoin soared up from $974 to the $19,783 mark, showing a tremendous 2000% growth, and then dropped down again by 83% of this price.After that, Bitcoin was more or less stable for quite a long time and kept its rate at the ~$6000. But by the end of 2018, Bitcoin suddenly began to fall again. As of writing, has dropped almost twice, to the price of about $3000. Let\u2019s try to figure out what had an effect on it?Bitcoin mass\u00a0adoptionToday there are still many obstacles on Bitcoin\u2019s way to mass adoption. Here are several ones:Technical (the problem with transaction scaling and block mining).Security (instability of the course, lack of user protection against fraud and hacks).Mining (Bitcoin mining requires lots of electricity and computing power which make the mining process difficult and non cost-effective).Overall complexity (Blockchain technologies seem too complicated for masses).These are basic things that don\u2019t allow society to get any more interested to Bitcoin than just as a way to get rich quickly.What pumped the price\u00a0up?Media and trading hype.Politics and government interest.Market speculations and hodlers.What dumped the price\u00a0down?Regulation and uncertainty towards the crypto industry.Switching to other nodes after hardfork.Overheated market.Since today all the cryptocurrencies are somehow interlinked with Bitcoin, the Bitcoin fall has led to the collapse of the cryptocurrency market. For example, in 2018 Ethereum went down from $1,400 to $103, Ripple fell from $3 to $0.3, and many cryptocurrencies have become completely worthless.Things are, however, not so bad. Leading crypto enthusiasts are optimistic.https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1075546286353498112Such drastic swings of the Bitcoin price seem to be attracting new attention and speculative interest for the currency.The community around the cryptocurrency is already able to support the survival of this technology and Blockchain will develop and scale faster and faster. Although today Bitcoin is the main crypto and many analysts see it\u2019s bright prospects of the industry. However the fate of Bitcoin remains unknown\u2026Where to store\u00a0Bitcoin?There are three main ways to manage Bitcoins:Centralized exchangesHardware wallets and full nodeLight wallets (custodial and non-custodial)On centralized exchanges your assets are not totally under your control, your private keys are stored on the exchange servers, they can restore access to your funds in case you lose your password, but centralized services may be unavailable or hacked.Hardware wallets download the full node, it is a long process and if it is be broken or stolen\u200a\u2014\u200amoney will be lost forever. Light custodial wallets it\u2019s almost the same as centralized exchanges, so the non-custodial wallets it\u2019s the best solution to store your assets in a decentralized way.Atomic is a non-custodial wallet, all private data are stored in an encrypted manner on the end-user device and never leave it, but if your device will be lost or broken you can restore access to your wallet on the new device with your mnemonic seed phrase, so your money is totally under your control.We are happy to provide you with the most convenient way to manage all of your cryptocurrency assets.

With this foundation we can now address some of the most commonly held misconceptions about Bitcoin.Bitcoin is a\u00a0bubbleBitcoin, like all market-based monetary goods, displays a monetary premium. The monetary premium is what gives rise to the common criticism that Bitcoin is a \u201cbubble\u201d. However, all monetary goods display a monetary premium. Indeed, it is this premium (the excess over the use-demand price) that is the defining characteristic of all monies. In other words, money is always and everywhere a bubble. Paradoxically, a monetary good is both a bubble and may be undervalued if it\u2019s in the early stages of its adoption for use as money.Bitcoin is too\u00a0volatileBitcoin\u2019s price volatility is a function of its nascency. In the first few years of its existence, Bitcoin behaved like a penny-stock, and any large buyer\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as the Winklevoss twins\u200a\u2014\u200acould cause a large spike in its price. As adoption and liquidity have increased over the years, Bitcoin\u2019s volatility has decreased commensurately. When Bitcoin achieves the market capitalization of gold, it will display a similar level of volatility. As Bitcoin surpasses the market capitalization of gold, its volatility will decrease to a level that will make it suitable as a widely used medium of exchange. As previously noted, the monetization of Bitcoin occurs in a series of Gartner hype cycles. Volatility is lowest during the plateau phase of the hype cycle, while it is highest during the peak and crash phases of the cycle. Each hype cycle has lower volatility than the previous ones because the liquidity of the market has increased.Transaction fees are too\u00a0highA recent criticism of the Bitcoin network is that the increase in fees to transmit bitcoins makes it unsuitable as a payment system. However, the growth in fees is healthy and expected. Transaction fees are the cost required to pay bitcoin miners to secure the network by validating transactions. Miners can either be paid by transaction fees or by block rewards, which are an inflationary subsidy borne by current bitcoin owners.Given Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply schedule\u200a\u2014\u200aa monetary policy which makes it ideally suited as a store of value\u200a\u2014\u200ablock rewards will eventually decline to zero and the network must ultimately be secured with transaction fees. A network with \u201clow\u201d fees is a network with little security and prone to external censorship. Those touting the low fees of Bitcoin alternatives are unknowingly describing the weakness of these so-called \u201calt-coins\u201d.The specious root of the criticism of Bitcoin\u2019s \u201chigh\u201d transaction fees is the belief that Bitcoin should be a payment system first and a store of value later.As we have seen with the origins of money, this belief puts the cart before the horse. Only when Bitcoin has become a deeply established store of value will it become suitable as a medium of exchange. Further, once the opportunity cost of trading bitcoins is at a level at which it is suitable as a medium of exchange, most trades will not occur on the Bitcoin network itself but on \u201csecond layer\u201d networks with much lower fees. Second layer networks, such as the Lightning network, provide the modern equivalent of the promissory notes that were used to transfer titles for gold in the 19th century. Promissory notes were used by banks because transferring the underlying bullion was far more costly than transferring the note that represented title to the gold. Unlike promissory notes, however, the Lightning network will allow the transfer of bitcoins at low cost while requiring little or no trust of third parties such as banks. The development of the Lightning network is a profoundly important technical innovation in Bitcoin\u2019s history and its value will become apparent as it is developed and adopted in the coming years.CompetitionAs an open-source software protocol, it has always been possible to copy Bitcoin\u2019s software and imitate its network. Over the years, many imitators have been created, ranging from ersatz facsimiles, such as Litecoin, to complex variants like Ethereum that promise to allow arbitrarily complex contractual arrangements using a distributed computational system. A common investment criticism of Bitcoin is that it cannot maintain its value when competitors can be easily created that are able to incorporate the latest innovations and software features.The fallacy in this argument is that the scores of Bitcoin competitors that have been created over the years lack the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d of the first and dominant technology in the space. A network effect\u200a\u2014\u200athe increased value of using Bitcoin simply because it is already the dominant network\u200a\u2014\u200ais a feature in and of itself. For any technology that possesses a network effect, it is by far the most important feature.The network effect for Bitcoin encompasses the liquidity of its market, the number of people who own it, and the community of developers maintaining and improving upon its software and its brand awareness. Large investors, including nation-states, will seek the most liquid market so that they can enter and exit the market quickly without affecting its price. Developers will flock to the dominant development community which has the highest-calibre talent, thereby reinforcing the strength of that community. And brand awareness is self-reinforcing, as would-be competitors to Bitcoin are always mentioned in the context of Bitcoin itself.A fork in the\u00a0roadA trend that became popular in 2017 was not only to imitate Bitcoin\u2019s software, but to copy the entire history of its past transactions (known as the blockchain). By copying Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain up to a certain point and then splitting off into a new network, in a process known as \u201cforking\u201d, competitors to Bitcoin were able to solve the problem of distributing their token to a large user base.The most significant fork of this kind occurred on August 1st, 2017 when a new network known as Bitcoin Cash (BCash) was created. An owner of N bitcoins before August 1st, 2017, would then own both N bitcoins and N BCash tokens. The small but vocal community of BCash proponents have tirelessly attempted to expropriate Bitcoin\u2019s brand recognition, both through the naming of their new network and a campaign to convince neophytes in the Bitcoin market that Bcash is the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin. These attempts have largely failed, and this failure is reflected in the market capitalizations of the two networks. However, for new investors, there remains an apparent risk that a competitor might clone Bitcoin and its blockchain and succeed in overtaking it in market capitalization, thus becoming the de facto Bitcoin.An important rule can be gleaned from the major forks that have happened to both the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. The majority of the market capitalization will settle on the network that retains the highest-calibre and most active developer community. For although Bitcoin can be viewed as a nascent money, it is also a computer network built on software that needs to be maintained and improved upon. Buying tokens on a network which has little or inexperienced developer support would be akin to buying a clone of Microsoft Windows that was not supported by Microsoft\u2019s best developers. It is clear from the history of the forks that occurred in 2017 that the best and most experienced computer scientists and cryptographers are committed to developing for the original Bitcoin and not any of the growing legion of imitators that have been created from it.Real risksAlthough the common criticisms of Bitcoin found in the media and economics profession are misplaced and based on a flawed understanding of money, there are real and significant risks to investing in Bitcoin. It would be prudent for a prospective Bitcoin investor to understand and weigh these risks before considering an investment in Bitcoin.Protocol riskThe Bitcoin protocol and the cryptographic primitives that it is built upon could be found to have a design flaw, or could be made insecure with the development of quantum computing. If a flaw is found in the protocol, or some new means of computation makes possible the breaking of the cryptography underpinning Bitcoin, the faith in Bitcoin may be severely compromised. The protocol risk was highest in the early years of Bitcoin\u2019s development, when it was still unclear, even to seasoned cryptographers, that Satoshi Nakamoto had actually found a solution to the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem. Concerns about serious flaws in the Bitcoin protocol have dissipated over the years, but given its technological nature, protocol risk will always remain for Bitcoin, if only as an outlier risk.Exchange shutdownsBeing decentralized in design, Bitcoin has shown a remarkable degree of resilience in the face of numerous attempts by various governments to regulate it or shut it down. However, the exchanges where bitcoins are traded for fiat currencies are highly centralized and susceptible to regulation and closure. Without these exchanges and the willingness of the banking system to do business with them, the process of monetization of Bitcoin would be severely stunted, if not halted completely. While there are alternative sources of liquidity for Bitcoin, such as over-the-counter brokers and decentralized markets for buying and selling Bitcoins (like localbitcoins.com), the critical process of price discovery happens on the most liquid exchanges, which are all centralized.Mitigating the risk of exchange shutdowns is jurisdictional arbitrage. Binance, a prominent exchange that started in China, moved to Japan after the Chinese government halted its operations in China. National governments are also wary of smothering a nascent industry that may prove as consequential as the Internet, thereby ceding a tremendous competitive advantage to other nations.Only with a coordinated global shutdown of Bitcoin exchanges would the process of monetization be halted completely. The race is on for Bitcoin to become so widely adopted that a complete shutdown becomes as politically infeasible as a complete shutdown of the Internet. The possibility of such a shutdown is still real, however, and must be factored into the risks of investing in Bitcoin. As was discussed in the prior section on the entrance of nation-states, national governments are finally awakening to the threat that a non-sovereign, censorship-resistant, digital currency poses to their monetary policies. It is an open question whether they will act on this threat before Bitcoin becomes so entrenched that political action against it proves ineffectual.FungibilityThe open and transparent nature of the Bitcoin blockchain makes it possible for states to mark certain bitcoins as being \u201ctainted\u201d by their use in proscribed activities. Although Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance at the protocol level allows these bitcoins to be transmitted, if regulations were to appear that banned the use of such tainted bitcoins by exchanges or merchants, they could become largely worthless. Bitcoin would then lose one of the critical properties of a monetary good: fungibility.To ameliorate Bitcoin\u2019s fungibility, improvements will need to be made at the protocol level to improve the privacy of transactions. While there are new developments in this regard, pioneered in digital currencies such as Monero and Zcash, there are major technological tradeoffs to be made between the efficiency and complexity of Bitcoin and its privacy. It remains an open question whether privacy-enhancing features can be added to Bitcoin in a way that doesn\u2019t compromise its usefulness as money in other ways.ConclusionBitcoin is an incipient money that is transitioning from the collectible stage of monetization to becoming a store of value. As a non-sovereign monetary good, it is possible that at some stage in the future Bitcoin will become a global money much like gold during the classical gold standard of the 19th century. The adoption of Bitcoin as global money is precisely the bullish case for Bitcoin, and was articulated by Satoshi Nakamoto as early as 2010 in an email exchange with Mike Hearn:If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there\u2019s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per\u00a0unit.This case was made even more trenchantly by the brilliant cryptographer Hal Finney, the recipient of the first bitcoins sent by Nakamoto, shortly after the announcement of the first working Bitcoin software:[I]magine that Bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world. Then the total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10\u00a0million.Even if Bitcoin were not to become a fully fledged global money and were simply to compete with gold as a non-sovereign store of value, it is currently massively undervalued. Mapping the market capitalization of the extant above-ground gold supply (approximately 8 trillion dollars) to a maximum Bitcoin supply of 21 million coins gives a value of approximately $380,000 per bitcoin. As we have seen in prior sections, for the attributes that make a monetary good suitable as a store of value, Bitcoin is superior to gold along every axis except for established history. As time passes and the Lindy effecttakes hold, established history will no longer be a competitive advantage for gold. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that Bitcoin will approach, and perhaps surpass, gold\u2019s market capitalization in the next decade. A caveat to this thesis is that a large fraction of gold\u2019s capitalization comes from central banks holding it as a store of value. For Bitcoin to achieve or surpass gold\u2019s capitalization, some participation by nation-states will be necessary. Whether the Western democracies will participate in the ownership of Bitcoin is unclear. It is more likely, and unfortunate, that tin-pot dictatorships and kleptocracies will be the first nations to enter the Bitcoin market.If no-nation states participate in the Bitcoin market, there still remains a bullish case for Bitcoin. As a non-sovereign store of value used only by retail and institutional investors, Bitcoin is still early in its adoption curve\u200a\u2014\u200athe so-called \u201cearly majority\u201d are now entering the market while the late majority and laggards are still years away from entering. With broader participation from retail and especially institutional investors, a price level between $100,000 and $200,000 is feasible.Owning bitcoins is one of the few asymmetric bets that people across the entire world can participate in. Much like a call option, an investor\u2019s downside is limited to 1x, while their potential upside is still 100x or more. Bitcoin is the first truly global bubble whose size and scope is limited only by the desire of the world\u2019s citizenry to protect their savings from the vagaries of government economic mismanagement. Indeed, Bitcoin rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the 2008 global financial catastrophe\u200a\u2014\u200aa catastrophe that was precipitated by the policies of central banks like the Federal Reserve.Beyond the financial case for Bitcoin, its rise as a non-sovereign store of value will have profound geopolitical consequences. A global, non-inflationary, reserve currency will force nation-states to alter their primary funding mechanism from inflation to direct taxation, which is far less politically palatable. States will shrink in size commensurate to the political pain of transitioning to taxation as their exclusive means of funding. Furthermore, global trade will be settled in a manner that satisfies Charles de Gaulle\u2019s aspiration that no nation should have privilege over any other:We consider it necessary that international trade be established, as it was the case, before the great misfortunes of the World, on an indisputable monetary base, and one that does not bear the mark of any particular country.50 years from now, that monetary base will be Bitcoin.AcknowledgementsI want to thank Alex Morcos, John Pfeffer, Pierre Rochard, Mat Balez, Ray Boyapati, Daniel Coleman, Koen Swinkels, Patri Friedman, Ardian Tola, Michael Flaxman and Michael Hartl for their valuable feedback on earlier drafts of this series of articles.

You can read more about what a digital currency fork is here.We operate by the principle that our customers should benefit to the greatest extent possible from hard forks or other unexpected events. This is essential in our mission to make Coinbase the most trusted, safe, and easy-to-use digital currency exchange.Bitcoin Segwit2xThe Bitcoin Segwit2x fork is projected to take place on November 16th and will temporarily result in two bitcoin blockchains. Following the fork, Coinbase will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC) and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X).Any customer with a BTC balance on Coinbase at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the B2X asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain. No action is required\u200a\u2014\u200awe will automatically credit your account. So, if you have 5 BTC stored on Coinbase before the fork; you will have 5 BTC and 5 B2X following the event.For more information about Bitcoin2x please see our FAQ page.Bitcoin2x TimelineApproximately 24 hours pre-fork. Coinbase will temporarily disable all bitcoin buy, sells, sends and receives. ETH and LTC will not be impacted. You will still be able to see your Bitcoin balances and monitor the price. If you plan on moving BTC into your Coinbase account, we highly recommend that you do so at least 24 hours before the fork to ensure your transfers are confirmed.Fork (block 494,784). Any Coinbase customer with a confirmed Bitcoin balance at this point will be credited an equal amount of Bitcoin2x.Within 24 hours post fork. Coinbase customers will be able to buy and sell both Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x. When you visit Coinbase.com or open your Coinbase app, you will see your new Bitcoin2x balance (in Accounts).Approximately 24\u201348 hours post fork. Once we have ensured that the blockchains are stable, Coinbase will re-enable Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x sends and receives. Please be careful when sending funds as certain wallets and bitcoin services may refer to the two blockchains differently.Bitcoin GoldThe Bitcoin Gold fork is projected to take place on October 23rd. Information about this fork has been limited and there are concerns about its security and stability. As a result, we do not believe it is safe to allow support for Bitcoin Gold at this time. If the blockchain proves to be secure and valuable, Coinbase may choose to support it. At that point, your account will be credited with an amount of Bitcoin Gold equal to your Bitcoin (BTC) balance at the time of the fork.You can read more about Bitcoin Gold at our FAQ page.Over the coming weeks, we will keep you updated on this event through our blog, status page and twitter.", "responses": "54"}, {"title": "WazirX\u200a\u2014\u200aBuilding India\u2019s most trusted Bitcoin & cryptocurrency exchange", "author_name": "Nischal Shetty", "link": "https://medium.com/wazirx/wazirx-building-indias-most-trusted-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-exchange-3488070a83c0?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 1, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "2.4K", "content": "WazirX\u200a\u2014\u200aBuilding India\u2019s most trusted Bitcoin & cryptocurrency exchangeNischal ShettyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 1, 2018Namaste Everyone! I\u2019m Nischal and I\u2019m the founder of WazirX. I\u2019ve been building products for the last 10 years. I\u2019ve been on and off the blockchain right from the beginning. It started with mining in 2009 and then trying out new international bitcoin wallets that popped up in 2012\u20132013. But 2017 was the year when I was completely sucked in to the Blockchain rabbit hole and I decided to build a cryptocurrency exchange for India.Building a cryptocurrency exchange wasn\u2019t the first thought that hit my head though. I had tons of ideas and even started executing on a completely different plan. However, the more I used the existing crypto exchanges in India, the more frustrating it was.If the frustrating experience of sub standard product wasn\u2019t enough, I was surprised to see how opaque most of the exchanges were in terms of communicating with their users.When dealing with other people\u2019s money, transparency is the best way forward. People trust us with their money, we need to provide them with clear information on what\u2019s happening behind the scenes, why something\u2019s not working right, what features we\u2019re building, what fees we charge them etc. It\u2019s also our responsibility to inform users prior to making changes that affect them.This frustration due to a string of bad experiences led me to take up the challenge of building a crypto exchange for India. My team and I know this isn\u2019t a trivial problem to solve but we\u2019ve always loved challenges. The challenge of building a global product from India and scaling it to 19 Million users was something we\u2019ve been successfully solving all this while with Crowdfire.WazirX is the start of a brand new journey for us. Wazir is the queen piece in chess. It\u2019s the strongest piece and can play any move. With WazirX, we want to provide you with the most powerful piece of cryptocurrency trading software you deserve! We want to provide every Indian with a product that surpasses every other global product in terms of quality. We want to make sure we involve the community while building this product so that we build it in the right way.Two Big AnnouncementsTo stay true on my commitment to all our users and the cryptocurrency community in India, I\u2019m making two big announcements today.India\u2019s first coin backed by a cryptocurrency exchangeWe\u2019re launching WRX, a brand new coin which will be an integral part of our trading platform in the future. We have great plans for WRX and we\u2019ll reveal them to you over time.2. The Great 150 Million WRX GiveawayWe believe users make or break a product. This is the reason why we\u2019ve decided to reward our early adopters with WRX. We\u2019ve reserved a huge chunk of the coins (15% of the total supply) exclusively for you, our community members. If everyone from the community trades actively on WazirX then we\u2019ll be able to take WRX to the moonWith these two initiatives I want to give every Indian an opportunity to be part of our success by earning WRX coins for Free. When you pre signup to WazirX you\u2019ll get 500 WRX coins. You will also have your own way of spreading the news further and making your family and friends part of the give away through the referral program.That\u2019s the ethos of crypto and blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aTo share the wealth instead of hoarding it.Blockchain is a technological innovation that does not come around often. Once in a lifetime does a generation get to be part of something that brings about a paradigm shift in the world. While India has been a follower of trends, I believe we can be the frontrunners in the crypto adoption. If we adopt the blockchain in the right way then we have a chance at being a super power in the near future. Every Indian right now is learning how this works and we envision WazirX as the gateway for their entry into the Blockchain world.Expect us to be very vocal about what\u2019s happening in the Blockchain space in India. We\u2019re just getting started and we need your help in getting every Indian on to the Blockchain. If you\u2019re involved with spreading the word about crypto in India, then feel free to get in touch with me on Twitter.

Why were they so wrong? I think they\u2019re all smart guys and I applaud their work and the important contribution they\u2019re making to the ecosystem. I think there are two main reasons why they\u2019re so bad1. Accurately Predicting The Future Values of Assets is Not A\u00a0ThingI know that everyday on CNBC, you\u2019ll see stock market strategists giving forecasts of where the market is going to be in 3, 6, or 12 months. Yet, we don\u2019t get 3, 6, or 12 month forecasts for the weather on on the Weather Channel? The weather channel forecast out that long, because that\u2019s not a thing that has any predictive value. While meteorologists can forecast one day out pretty well, by 10 days out, the variance is pretty significant:Source: MinitabThe weather in a month can\u2019t accurately be predicted because that forecast has to take into account a number of large-scale phenomena, each of which is governed by multiple variables and factors. To start, the sun does not emit a constant amount of heat. Once the sun\u2019s variable level of heat hits the Earth, it\u2019s impacted by air pressure differences causing winds as well as how water-changing phases (from ice to water or water to vapor) which affects the flow of energy. The weather is even impacted by the planet\u2019s rotation in space, which moves the Earth\u2019s surface beneath the atmosphere. Small changes in any one variable profoundly affects the weather. An MIT meteorologist, Edward Lorenz, came up with a great description of this phenomena in 1960. Lorenz called it the butterfly effectThe butterfly effect refers to Lorenz\u2019s belief that a butterfly flapping its wings in Shanghai can dramatically alter the weather in New York City. Lorenz eventually fathered a new branch of mathematics called Chaos Theory \u201cwhich focuses on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. \u201cChaos\u201d is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, self-organization, and reliance on programming at the initial point known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions\u2026\u201d.The stock market is the same as weather. While the weather channel never trots out weather experts to tell is where the weather is going to be in three months, CNBC fills its day with analysts projecting out three months or longer. Below is a chart with 19 predictions (as of September 5th, when the S&P was at 2,886) for where the S&P was going to finish the year:Source: CNBC Market Strategist SurveyWith the S&P currently at 2,633, the average prediction above is off by 12.6%, and the closest of the 19 is off by a woeful 6.3%.And by the way, it\u2019s not just the experts that are way off. It\u2019s the layman as well:When Bitcoin Was Trading At\u00a0$7,4362. Bitcoin Is A Store Of Value, And, Over the Long Run, It Should Provide Returns In Line With Other Stores of Value (i.e.\u00a0Gold)The simple idea of a store of value is that it maintains \u201cbuying power\u201d even as a currency inflates. Since 1971 (when Nixon ended the gold standard), inflation has averaged about 4%, meaning your buying power got cut in half about every 17 years (per the Rule of 72):So what cost $1 in 1971 costs $6.51 today. It turns out the dollar is a terrible store of value. Gold on the other hand, has held it\u2019s value well since 1971 when we went off the gold standard and gold began it\u2019s transition to being a store of value:But if you look more granularly at the data, you would see that gold rocketed in price the first four years, as the world adjusted to the fact that gold had become a store of value:Interestingly, if you take out the gold\u2019s price increase in these first four (transition) years, you get an average price increase in gold that is less then 1% above the inflation rate during that period. That\u2019s a GREAT store of value:So, undoubtedly, Bitcoin is still in that early phase of transitioning to a store of value. And like gold in it\u2019s early days as a store of value, Bitcoin has seen a dramatic rise in value (112% IRR over the last two years) in its early years.So just like the stock market forecasters who ALL expected the S&P to go up, ALL the Bitcoin forecasters expected it to go up in 2018 (it finished 2017 at $13,791). But trees don\u2019t grow to the sky, and nothing always goes up, regardless of what the forecasters forecast.Where Is Bitcoin Price\u00a0Going?I don\u2019t know where the Bitcoin price is going. The truth is, no one knows where Bitcoins price is going. But I think there are three possible outcomes for BitcoinBitcoin fails as a store of value\u200a\u2014\u200aIn this case, I think Bitcoin is toastIt surpasses gold as a store of value\u200a\u2014\u200aIn this case, with the total amount of gold bullion currently at about 2.5B ounces, and gold bullion market cap at $3.1 trillion, each Bitcoin will be worth north of $145,000Bitcoin takes second place as a store of value\u200a\u2014\u200aSilver is broadly considered to be #2 player in terms of stored value. There is currently about 4.0 billion ounces of silver bullion, for a total market cap of $58 billion, which would result in a price for Bitcoin today of $3,346. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of $62 billion.So take each scenario, and estimate a likelihood of happening, total the values derived, and you can get your own forecast for where Bitcoin is going to be valued down the road.But that\u2019s using my framework. One of the most interesting things about Bitcoin is, if it can evolve, that it can be anything. So everyone can have a different framework for what it can be and what that would be worth. And maybe it can be all those things?But I won\u2019t be making a prediction of where Bitcoin is going to be in a year, because I believe in the butterfly effect and as such, I don\u2019t think predicting asset values is a thing. But even at low likelihood of Bitcoin surpassing gold, it still looks like a VERY compelling investment from a risk/reward stand point, (using my framework).I would clap 50 times for that post.

JeftovicBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 12, 2017\u201cTo me and many others, bitcoin is not a technical revolution as much as it is a triumph of political and economic incentives.\u201d\u2014 Two Bit Idiot\u201cSystems like Ethereum (and Bitcoin and NXT, and Bitshares, etc) are a fundamentally new class of cryptoeconomic organisms\u200a\u2014\u200adecentralized, jurisdictionless entities that exist entirely in cyberspace, maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics and social consensus\u201d\u2014 Vitalik ButerinIn Part I we took a look at \u201cWhat Bitcoin Isn\u2019t\u201d, where all the usual comparisons and analogies around Bitcoin were shown to be poor fits in explaining what the phenomenon really is, ending on the obvious next question:What is Bitcoin\u00a0then?Money is one of those \u201caquarium characteristics\u201d of life. Aside from worrying about our bills or investments, the general structure of \u201cmoney\u201d is a background medium that underpins everything and for the most part we don\u2019t really pay attention to it. Other examples are the base utilities like electricity and running water.As we live our lives in these \u201caquariums\u201d, we don\u2019t really question the nature or the delivery mechanisms of these structural/cultural mediums we\u2019re immersed in, unless they stop working or until they undergo a radical change.A brief history of monetary innovationWhat we are experiencing today is a technological innovation that is moving the nature of money itself from one form to the next and that is something that has only happened a few times throughout recorded history. It is because we are talking about a fundamental restructuring of the nature of money, and not an asset bubble occurring within the confines of the prevailing monetary system, that we can apply the \u201cThis time is different\u201d label to Bitcoin.Centralized, opaque, debt-based, money is being disrupted by decentralized, open source, competitive crypto-currencies.This disruption has occurred out of necessity, given the irreparable harm central bank policies have inflicted on the citizenry over the last century, reaching what can only be considered a crack-up crescendo of targeted inflation, QEternity, ZIRP and NIRP, the war on cash and capital controls over the last 10 years. The most fitting label for all this is Chris Martenson\u2019s \u201cfinancial repression\u201d.During the era of debt-based money/fiat currency whenever an asset bubble occurred, \u201cthis time is different\u201d was never actually different. Galbraith\u2019s observation from the Part 1 bears repeating and it holds up:The world of finance hails the invention of the wheel over and over again, often in a slightly more unstable version. All financial innovation involves in one form or another, the creation of debt secured in greater or lesser adequacy by real assets.\u201d\u00a0(emphasis added)But as mentioned in Part 1: Bitcoin is not a debt based bubble. Leverage doesn\u2019t account for the majority of the price action, at least not yet. As I write this, CBOE futures went live this week. Also, most exchanges are offering margin and a lot of traders are dumb enough to try using it, but that is not the driving factor pushing Bitcoin adoption. These emerging stories of people mortgaging their homes to buy bitcoin are \u201cnewsworthy\u201d, and thus still sporadic. Debt would be a driving force of the bubble when it\u2019s systemic.Looking at Bitcoin as a technology shift, there have only been a handful of really big shifts in money throughout history: We had barter, then either money then debt, or debt and then money.Anthropologist David Graeber (Debt: The First 5,000 Years) makes a case that contrary to conventional theory, barter did not beget money, but rather debt in the form of obligations came first. This was the first true abstraction of deferring present consumption into future value. Owing somebody something, whether it was returning a favour, or later, some symbolic representation of that favour, and that was the progression toward \u201cmoney\u201d.Graeber\u2019s larger point is that debt, the first big monetary innovation after barter, has been used ever since by a small minority of people to enslave the rest of the populace.It\u2019s a compelling argument. In either case, aside from subsequent innovations such as the creation of the banknote, which facilitated transmission of value at a distance, and double entry accounting, nothing much has happened in the structural shape of money since the last big innovation, which was the rise of fractional reserve banking.Everything since then, from various fiat currencies, to credit cards to the magnetic strip or PIN chips have been variations on a theme, the theme being debt is money. As long as the various modern welfare states continue to spend more than they receive, they have to keep creating and monetizing more debt in order to keep the wheels on the system as a whole.Crypto-currency is not\u00a0debtCrypto-currency is built on mathematics, open source, consensus and decentralization. These attributes combine to give us a monetary system with defining characteristics which set it apart from the current, fiat based model:InelasticIt\u2019s Inelastic because as we all know there are only a set amount of coins that will ever be created. This is in stark contrast to the supply of money in fiat terms. As somebody jokingly tweeted the chart I included from Part 1 \u201cWow look at that bitcoin price! Oh wait, that\u2019s the chart of the money supply\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200amore on this below.Source: St Louis FedThis inelasticity makes Bitcoin and any other similarly constructed crypto-currency\u2026.DeflationaryA deflationary currency is closey related to being inelastic, but we need to look specifically at the deflationary aspects of Bitcoin because conventional economic thought is that \u201cdeflation is bad\u201d, and it is\u200a\u2014\u200aif you\u2019re using debt for money.The reason why is because debt-based money, enabled by fractional reserve banking allows monetary units to \u201cexist in two places at once\u201d, so to speak. When I first started thinking about and researching all this economics and history stuff, it was in the immediate aftermath of the crashing of the dot com bubble. It was then when I realized that I had no understanding of economics, or finance and ultimately, money. So I began a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into these matters which continues to this day.One of the first books I read about it was Ferdinand Lips \u201cGold Wars\u201d. Lips, Swiss banker, and expert on the Classical Gold Standard was reputed to have been the cryptic and anonymous \u201cFriend of Another (FOA)\u201d financial and gold markets commentator of the late 90\u2019s (foreshadowing of Satoshi Nakamoto?).When I pulled out my copy of the book recently I found I had scribbled the following into the back cover after I had finished reading it:\u201cGold, like every other \u2018normal\u2019 thing cannot be in two places at once. Fiat money, however, is credit, redeemable into nothing, that is simultaneously counted as \u2018money\u2019 by multiple parties\u200a\u2014\u200athis works as long as the bubble is growing\u200a\u2014\u200abut can\u2019t work if it starts to contract. If N parties hold the same \u2018fiat\u2019 and one suddenly uses it to retire debt, N-1 parties have the carpet pulled from underneath them. Because under a paper fiat money system, reducing debt (either by paying it off or defaulting) reduces the money supply\u201dMy understanding of this today, is that Bitcoin is inelastic and thus deflationary. It has no counter-party risk (but there is consensus risk, but fiat has it as well), and it solves \u201cthe double-spend problem\u201d. Fiat money, by contrast is one big double spend problem. The defining characteristic of inflationary debt-based money is mathematically and cryptographically eliminated under crypto-currency.Under an inelastic or hard-backed monetary regime, such as the era the Classical Gold Standard (when there was no income tax and mild deflation) or the one emerging today, deflation is virtuous, not the other way around.By contrast, debt-based inflationary money creates a treadmill economy, which perniciously pushes assets up the wealth inequality ladder, as the Plutocrats on top spend their compounding wealth on buying up assets, while the lower tiers (the non-super rich) must continually and incrementally spend more of their purchasing power on staying alive.Many conventional economists say deflationary currencies wouldn\u2019t work because:1) There wouldn\u2019t be enough \u201cmonetary units\u201d to go around to purchase all the good and services available within the economy, and2) It leads to HODLING, or hoarding. The theory states that people wouldn\u2019t spend any money today, because doing so would forgo the increased value the money would have tomorrow.Detlev S. Schlichter\u2019s \u201cPaper Money Collapse\u201d is a dispassionate, objective look at why fiat money always goes to zero, every time, throughout all history, no exceptions and what would happen in an environment with a deflationary currency instead:\u201cA monetary system with a money commodity of essentially fixed supply will experience secular deflation. A growing economy, with an entirely inflexible money supply will exhibit a tendency for prices to decline on trend, and for money\u2019s purchasing [power] to steadily increase. But the key question now, is why should this be a problem? We have already seen that historically secular deflation was rather minor and that it certainly never appeared to present any economic difficulties. [ What economists today fear in a \u2018deflationary death spiral\u2019 scenario is debt collapse and accompanying contraction of the money supply, not deflation itself\u200a\u2014\u200amarkjr] No correlation between deflation or recession or stagnation is evident under commodity money systems. We will now show that there are no reasons on conceptual grounds to consider deflation to be a problem\u201dWhich he then spends the rest of the book doing exactly that. From personal experience, as a merchant who has been accepting bitcoin payments since 2013 I know that the increasing price of bitcoin has not slowed down transaction volume or aggregate payments received (in dollar terms):A deflationary currency sees prices drop over time as purchasing power increases.easyDNS Bitcoin sales and transaction trend lines 2013\u200a\u2014\u200apresent (2017)The chart above depicts the trendlines of transactions in Bitcoin on easyDNS from 2013 to present. I haven\u2019t put the Bitcoin price trend line in there but we all know what it looks like, if it were in the graph it would be a hockey stick with the inflection point starting around Jan 2016. We clearly see the pricing in BTC dropping as the price rises, yet the transaction volume and sales in CAD remain steady, with a moderate uptrend.Bitcoin is TransparentIt\u2019s Transparent in two ways, first is the blockchain, where we can see the flow of bitcoin and all the transactions; and second the underlying code is open source.Anybody can look at any block in the blockchain, and anybody can pull down the source code that actually runs all this and read it for themselves.Contrast this radical transparency with, say, The Federal Reserve, which has an exclusive monopoly on the creation of money, creates it out of nothing and then lends it to the State and charges interest on it. Further, it is owned by a cartel of private banks and operates with no oversight. This is the crux of the current monetary era. For the longest time it was possible to dismiss criticisms of this system as \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d, but given that the damage Fed policies have caused to the economy, especially since the GFC is felt by all but a few, it is increasingly difficult to ignore this reality.Anybody who actually analyzes this system going beyond the mainstream narrative of what The Fed is supposed to be doing would come up with the same conclusion I did some time ago:\u201cif smart, scholarly people happen to believe that government fiat money is both feasible and beneficial to society, and they put serious thought into devising such a system, what they will not come up with is one run by private central banks issuing debt-based money. They just won\u2019t. Any critical analysis would grasp that such an architecture would become a parasitic cancer on the entire society. When you realize this, it\u2019s hard not to posit a far-reaching conspiracy to institutionalize inequality. While I am a big believer in the maxim \u201cnever ascribe to conspiracy what can be explained by stupidy\u201d it to me falls short in this case. When we look at the structure of the entire monetary system and realize that it\u2019s the worst way possible to design a such a system if you have the best interests of the wider society in mind then you can\u2019t help but ask \u2018in whose interests was it designed and implemented?\u2019\u201dAntifragileNassim Taleb, in his seminal work by the same title, invented the term \u201cantifragile\u201d, describing any phenomenon that gets stronger when it encounters volatility. The \u201cimminent death of Bitcoin\u201d is probably the one thing that has been predicted even more than the \u201cimminent death of the Internet\u201d, which was a popular recurring theme back in the late 90\u2019s or so.Both technologies\u200a\u2014\u200athe Internet and then crypto-currency are decentralized, largely open source protocol stacks that have transformed our civilization.These qualities make crypto currency something that is anathema to the previous paradigm\u2019s debt-based fiat. As such, it poses an existential threat to existing incumbents, be they technocrats, banksters, career politicians, or complicit corporate cartels, whose position depends on their proximity to and relationships with the money centre apparatus that creates money and preferentially distributes it out amongst this network.What does it all\u00a0mean?When we ask ourselves this question we\u2019re back to Graeber\u2019s assertion that the entire monetary system is a control mechanism that uses debt to keep the wider populace in line.This was largely tolerated by a general population that was largely ignorant of the working dynamic of the money system and how it enslaves them. Keynes himself observed that\u201cBy a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.\u201dFor a long time Keynes was right. Then, as the century-long debt super-cycle started to crescendo a couple of key events happened.The first was the Global Financial Crisis 2007\u20132009 and the purported \u201cnear-death experience\u201d of the modern economy. Wall Street was bailed out, who used the money to give themselves bonuses, while the middle-class was decimated and continues to be ground into poverty to this day. There was incongruence in this picture, on one hand incompetence and financial recklessness was rewarded while the rule-following middle class were penalized.Twitter financial commentator and humorist @RudyHavenstein nails it\u2026The 95 White\u00a0PapersIt was at this moment, that the Satoshi White Paper appeared on the scene, and proposed a different way to structure the monetary system.Nobody really noticed. But it set off a chain of events as sure as Martin Luther\u2019s \u201c95 Theses\u201d set in motion the secular decline of another hitherto undisputed hegemonic central power: The Catholic Church. In that time the result was The Reformation and the Catholic Church never regained its central power position.One document galvanized an entire movement, and the harder the Papacy pushed back on Luther to try to contain it, the faster Protestantism spread\u200a\u2014\u200athere\u2019s that antifragility again.Protestantism presented enough benefits to enough royal houses throughout Europe that when weighed against the authoritarian and decadent papacy, the upside to the new paradigm looked better than the old system\u200a\u2014\u200aand that is precisely what it is happening, again, today, in the monetary sphere.For the first few years after Satoshi\u2019s paper, Bitcoin didn\u2019t really break into the public consciousness but the wheels were certainly in motion and those people who had a lot at stake and were coming to gain a visceral understanding of the hypocrisy and capriciousness, not to mention the destructiveness of the current monetary regime were paying close attention.It wasn\u2019t until another event, years later, that people would begin to see the efficacy of crypto-currency in protecting wealth and savings. That event was the Cyprus bail-in. The framework for \u201ccontaining\u201d that event was quickly adapted by other nations, slipped into the \u201cback pocket\u201d to be used down the road. It became law here in Canada:\u201cIn the unlikely event that a systemically important bank depletes its capital, the bank can be recapitalized and returned to viability through the very rapid conversion of certain bank liabilities into regulatory capital.\u201dThis provision, originally from the Harper government has been reiterated under Trudeau the 2nd.Of course, the language here is telling, belying the assumption on the part of the political elites that the rabble is ignorant and easily fooled. Similar to how barely \u201cone man in a million\u201d can diagnose inflation, they assumed even fewer would know that \u201ccertain bank liabilities\u201d are the depositors\u2019 savings.But people do know what that means. Now it was clear\u200a\u2014\u200aunless we owned a bank we were all pretty much on our own, and even worse, whenever those banks went off and painted themselves into a corner of insolvency, we were the ones who were going to have to make them whole. Banks are \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d, everybody else is expendable.Bitcoin is a hole\u00a0\u2026in a burning\u00a0building\u201cI had the thought that Bitcoin is like a hole in the wall of a burning building. The burning building is the petrodollar. The Bitcoin hole in the wall doesn\u2019t meet any standard definition of a door. It wouldn\u2019t pass a building inspection and it may not last long. It will most certainly be replaced by something else in the long run. But in the short term, no one inside that burning building really cares about any of that and the ones that first smelled smoke are already pouring through it. Many more will follow and some, sadly, will die in the fire. There are other exits from the building too, some may be safer than others, but the most important thing is getting out of the burning building as quickly as possible.\u2014 from the comment thread on Zerohedge for Part 1 of this article (the only thing I would add to this is that the other exits lead to other burning buildings\u200a\u2014\u200amarkjr)And this finally brings us to what I think Bitcoin really is. It\u2019s a type of capital / currency flight. In a way, (and I didn\u2019t coin this analogy but I can\u2019t find who did\u200a\u2014\u200aupdate: it was Stefan Molyneux) all fiat currencies are experiencing a hyper-inflationary collapse against Bitcoin. It makes a certain amount of sense, the logical outcome for the vast monetary printing of the last century is an inflationary blowout. But that conjures up images of Weimar Germany and wheelbarrows full of cash, the recent Zimbabwe collapse or perhaps Brazil\u200a\u2014\u200awhere banks installed a second clock to display the value of your money eroding while you waiting in line, it all seems so unthinkable here.And yet, here we are with Bitcoin in a bubble, stocks in a bubble, bonds in a bubble, real estate\u200a\u2014\u200ain a bubble, is everything in a bubble? Or are we experiencing a slow motion breakdown in the underlying fiat regime in a typically cavalier and nonchalant Western way? Not some James Rawles \u201cend of civilization\u201d novel but rather a mass exodus into anything perceived as \u201can asset\u201d whilst Bitcoin surpasses them all because of a combination of inertia and the fact that\u2019s it\u2019s effectively an antidote to a global parasitic economic blight?Having said this, even if this were true, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthe price of bitcoin will go up\u2026forever\u201d. Even true hyper-inflationary episodes themselves usually last about 12 to 18 months, after which a new currency regime comes in to replace it.What we could be seeing here are the early innings that usher in the end of USD as the world reserve currency and the beginning of \u201cwhat comes next\u201d. The fact that USD hegemony will eventually end is no surprise to anybody, even mainstream economists. However \u201ceventually\u201d has this vexing habit of showing up sooner than most people expected.So while there have only been a handful of monetary innovations throughout history, there have been many currency regimes, rising, overshooting, collapsing and giving way to the next.What may be unique about this one is that we\u2019re rare witness to a double faceted shift: the technology shift from a debt based fiat money system to a decentralized crypto currency regime; along with the demise of the prevailing currency regime.To follow my work on Guerrilla Capitalism, sign up for the mailing list here.", "responses": "20"}, {"title": "The Bullish Case for Bitcoin (part 3 of\u00a04)", "author_name": "Vijay Boyapati", "link": "https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-part-3-of-4-2e2c002593f1?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 28, 2018", "readtime": "17 min read", "upvotes": "5.2K", "content": "The Bullish Case for Bitcoin (part 3 of\u00a04)The Evolution of\u00a0MoneyVijay BoyapatiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 28, 2018There is an obsession in modern monetary economics with the medium of exchange role of money. In the 20th century, states have monopolized the issuance of money and continually undermined its use as a store of value, creating a false belief that money is primarily defined as a medium of exchange. Many have criticized Bitcoin as being an unsuitable money because its price has been too volatile to be suitable as a medium of exchange. This puts the cart before the horse, however. Money has always evolved in stages, with the store of value role preceding the medium of exchange role. One of the fathers of marginalist economics, Stanley Jevons, explained that:Historically speaking\u00a0\u2026 gold seems to have served, firstly, as a commodity valuable for ornamental purposes; secondly, as stored wealth; thirdly, as a medium of exchange; and, lastly, as a measure of\u00a0value.Using modern terminology, money always evolves in the following four stages:Collectible. In the very first stage of its evolution, money will be demanded solely based on its peculiar properties, usually becoming a whimsy of its possessor. Shells, beads and gold were all collectibles before later transitioning to the more familiar roles of money.Store of value: Once it is demanded by enough people for its peculiarities, money will be recognized as a means of keeping and storing value over time. As a good becomes more widely recognized as a suitable store of value, its purchasing power will rise as more people demand it for this purpose. The purchasing power of a store of value will eventually plateau when it is widely held and the influx of new people desiring it as a store of value dwindles.Medium of exchange: When money is fully established as a store of value, its purchasing power will stabilize. Having stabilized in purchasing power, the opportunity cost of using money to complete trades will diminish to a level where it is suitable for use as a medium of exchange. In the earliest days of Bitcoin, many people did not appreciate the huge opportunity cost of using bitcoins as a medium of exchange, rather than as an incipient store of value. The famous story of a man trading 10,000 bitcoins (worth approximately $94 million at the time of this article\u2019s writing) for two pizzas illustrates this confusion.Unit of account. When money is widely used as a medium of exchange, goods will be priced in terms of it. I.e., the exchange ratio against money will be available for most goods. It is a common misconception that bitcoin prices are available for many goods today. For example, while a cup of coffee might be available for purchase using bitcoins, the price listed is not a true bitcoin price; rather it is the dollar price desired by the merchant translated into bitcoin terms at the current USD/BTC market exchange rate. If the price of bitcoin were to drop in dollar terms, the number of bitcoins requested by the merchant would increase commensurately. Only when merchants are willing to accept bitcoins for payment without regard to the bitcoin exchange rate against fiat currencies can we truly think of Bitcoin as having become a unit of account.Monetary goods that are not yet a unit of account may be thought of as being \u201cpartly monetized\u201d. Today gold fills such a role, being a store of value but having been stripped of its medium of exchange and unit of account roles by government intervention. It is also possible that one good fills the medium of exchange role of money while another good fills the other roles. This is typically true in countries with dysfunctional states, such as Argentina or Zimbabwe. In his book Digital Gold, Nathaniel Popper writes:In America, the dollar seamlessly serves the three functions of money: providing a medium of exchange, a unit for measuring the cost of goods, and an asset where value can be stored. In Argentina, on the other hand, while the peso was used as a medium of exchange\u200a\u2014\u200afor daily purchases\u200a\u2014\u200ano one used it as a store of value. Keeping savings in the peso was equivalent to throwing away money. So people exchanged any pesos they wanted to save for dollars, which kept their value better than the peso. Because the peso was so volatile, people usually remembered prices in dollars, which provided a more reliable unit of measure over\u00a0time.Bitcoin is currently transitioning from the first stage of monetization to the second stage. It will likely be several years before Bitcoin transitions from being an incipient store of value to being a true medium of exchange, and the path it takes to get there is still fraught with risk and uncertainty. It is striking to note that the same transition took many centuries for gold. No one alive has seen the real-time monetization of a good (as is taking place with Bitcoin), so there is precious little experience regarding the path this monetization will take.Path dependenceIn the process of being monetized, a monetary good will soar in purchasing power. Many have commented that the increase in purchasing power of Bitcoin creates the appearance of a \u201cbubble\u201d. While this term is often using disparagingly to suggest that Bitcoin is grossly overvalued, it is unintentionally apt. A characteristic that is common to all monetary goods is that their purchasing power is higher than can be justified by their use-value alone. Indeed, many historical monies had no use-value at all. The difference between the purchasing power of a monetary good and the exchange-value it could command for its inherent usefulness can be thought of as a \u201cmonetary premium\u201d. As a monetary good transitions through the stages of monetization (listed in the section above), the monetary premium will increase. The premium does not, however, move in a straight, predictable line. A good X that was in the process of being monetized may be outcompeted by another good Y that is more suitable as money, and the monetary premium of X may drop or vanish entirely. The monetary premium of silver disappeared almost entirely in the late 19th century when governments across the world largely abandoned it as money in favor of gold.Even in the absence of exogenous factors such as government intervention or competition from other monetary goods, the monetary premium for a new money will not follow a predictable path. Economist Larry White observed that:the trouble with [the] bubble story, of course, is that is consistent with any price path, and thus gives no explanation for a particular price\u00a0pathThe process of monetization is game-theoretic; every market participant attempts to anticipate the aggregate demand of other participants and thereby the future monetary premium. Because the monetary premium is unanchored to any inherent usefulness, market participants tend to default to past prices when determining whether a monetary good is cheap or expensive and whether to buy or sell it. The connection of current demand to past prices is known as \u201cpath dependence\u201d and is perhaps the greatest source of confusion in understanding the price movements of monetary goods.When the purchasing power of a monetary good increases with increasing adoption, market expectations of what constitutes \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cexpensive\u201dshift accordingly. Similarly, when the price of a monetary good crashes, expectations can switch to a general belief that prior prices were \u201cirrational\u201d or overly inflated. The path dependence of money is illustrated by the words of well-known Wall Street fund manager Josh Brown:I bought [bitcoins] at like $2300 and had an immediate double on my hands. Then I started saying \u201cI can\u2019t buy more of it,\u201d as it rose, even though that\u2019s an anchored opinion based on nothing other than the price where I originally got it. Then, as it fell over the last week because of a Chinese crackdown on the exchanges, I started saying to myself, \u201cOh good, I hope it gets killed so I can buy\u00a0more.\u201dThe truth is that the notions of \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cexpensive\u201d are essentially meaningless in reference to monetary goods. The price of a monetary good is not a reflection of its cash flow or how useful it is but, rather, is a measure of how widely adopted is has become for the various roles of money.Further complicating the path-dependent nature of money is the fact that market participants do not merely act as dispassionate observers, trying to buy or sell in anticipation of future movements of the monetary premium, but also act as active evangelizers. Since there is no objectively correct monetary premium, proselytizing the superior attributes of a monetary good is more effective than for regular goods, whose value is ultimately anchored to cash flow or use-demand. The religious fervor of participants in the Bitcoin market can be observed in various online forums where owners actively promote the benefits of Bitcoin and the wealth that can be made by investing in it. In observing the Bitcoin market, Leigh Drogen comments:You recognize this as a religion\u200a\u2014\u200aa story we all tell each other and agree upon. Religion is the adoption curve we ought to be thinking about. It\u2019s almost perfect\u200a\u2014\u200aas soon as someone gets in, they tell everyone and go out evangelizing. Then their friends get in and they start evangelizing.While the comparison to religion may give Bitcoin an aura of irrational faith,it is entirely rational for the individual owner to evangelize for a superior monetary good and for society as a whole to standardize on it. Money acts as the foundation for all trade and savings, so the adoption of a superior form of money has tremendous multiplicative benefits to wealth creation for all members of a society.The shape of monetizationWhile there are no a priori rules about the path a monetary good will take as it is monetized, a curious pattern has emerged during the relatively brief history of Bitcoin\u2019s monetization. Bitcoin\u2019s price appears to follow a fractal pattern of increasing magnitude, where each iteration of the fractal matches the classic shape of a Gartner hype cycle.In his article on the Speculative Bitcoin Adoption/Price Theory, Michael Casey posits that the expanding Gartner hype cycles represent phases of a standard S-curve of adoption that was followed by many transformative technologies as they become commonly used in society.Each Gartner hype cycle begins with a burst of enthusiasm for the new technology, and the price is bid up by the market participants who are \u201creachable\u201d in that iteration. The earliest buyers in a Gartner hype cycle typically have a strong conviction about the transformative nature of the technology they are investing in. Eventually the market reaches a crescendo of enthusiasm as the supply of new participants who can be reached in the cycle is exhausted and the buying becomes dominated by speculators more interested in quick profits than the underlying technology.Following the peak of the hype cycle, prices rapidly drop and the speculative fervor is replaced by despair, public derision and a sense that the technology was not transformative at all. Eventually the price bottoms and forms a plateau where the original investors who had strong conviction are joined by a new cohort who were able to withstand the pain of the crash and who appreciated the importance of the technology.The plateau persists for a prolonged period of time and forms, as Casey calls it, a \u201cstable, boring low\u201d. During the plateau, public interest in the technology will dwindle but it will continue to be developed and the collection of strong believers will slowly grow. A new base is then set for the next iteration of the hype cycle as external observers recognize the technology is not going away and that investing in it may not be as risky as it seemed during the crash phase of the cycle. The next iteration of the hype cycle will bring in a much larger set of adopters and be far greater in magnitude.Very few people participating in an iteration of a Gartner hype cycle will correctly anticipate how high prices will go in that cycle. Prices usually reach levels that would seem absurd to most investors at the earliest stages of the cycle. When the cycle ends, a popular cause it typically attributed to the crash by the media. While the stated cause (such as an exchange failure) may be a precipitating event, it is not the fundamental reason for the cycle to end.Gartner hype cycles end because of an exhaustion of market participants reachable in the cycle.It is telling that gold followed the classic pattern of a Gartner hype cycle from the late 1970s to the early 2000s. One might speculate that the hype cycle is an inherent social dynamic to the process of monetization.Gartner cohortsSince the inception of the first exchange traded price in 2010, the Bitcoin market has witnessed four major Gartner hype cycles. With hindsight we can precisely identify the price ranges of previous hype cycles in the Bitcoin market. We can also qualitatively identify the cohort of investors that were associated with each iteration of prior cycles.$0\u2013$1 (2009\u2013March 2011): The first hype cycle in the Bitcoin market was dominated by cryptographers, computer scientists and cypherpunks who were already primed to understand the importance of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s groundbreaking invention and who were pioneers in establishing that the Bitcoin protocol was free of technical flaws.$1\u2013$30 (2009\u2013July 2011): The second cycle attracted both early adopters of new technology and a steady stream of ideologically motivated investors who were dazzled by the potential of a stateless money. Libertarians such as Roger Ver were attracted to Bitcoin for the anti-establishment activities that would become possible if the nascent technology became widely adopted. Wences Casares, a brilliant and well-connected serial entrepreneur, was also part of the second Bitcoin hype cycle and is known to have evangelized Bitcoin to some of the most prominent technologists and investors in Silicon Valley.$250\u2013$1100 (April 2013\u2013December 2013): The third hype cycle saw the entrance of early retail and institutional investors who were willing to brave the horrendously complicated and risky liquidity channels from which bitcoins could be bought. The primary source of liquidity in the market during this period was the Japan-based MtGox exchange that was run by the notoriously incompetent and malfeasant Mark Karpeles, who later saw prison time for his role in the collapse of the exchange.It is worth observing that the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price during the aforementioned hype cycles was largely correlated with an increase in liquidity and the ease with which investors could purchase bitcoins. In the first hype cycle, there were no exchanges available, and acquisition of bitcoins was primarily through mining or by direct exchange with someone who had already mined bitcoins. In the second hype cycle, rudimentary exchanges became available, but obtaining and securing bitcoins from these exchanges remained too complex for all but the most technologically savvy investors. Even in the third hype cycle, significant hurdles remained for investors transferring money to MtGox to acquire bitcoins. Banks were reluctant to deal with the exchange, and third party vendors who facilitated transfers were often incompetent, criminal, or both. Further, many who did manage to transfer money to MtGox ultimately faced loss of funds when the exchange was hacked and later closed.It was only after the collapse of the MtGox exchange and a two-year lull in the market price of Bitcoin that mature and deep sources of liquidity were developed; examples include regulated exchanges such as GDAX and OTC brokers such as Cumberland mining. By the time the fourth hype cycle began in 2016 it was relatively easy for retail investors to buy bitcoins and secure them.$1100\u2013$19600? (2014\u2013?):At the time of writing, the Bitcoin market is undergoing its fourth major hype cycle. Participation in the current hype cycle has been dominated by what Michael Casey described as the \u201cearly majority\u201d of retail and institutional investors.As sources of liquidity have deepened and matured, major institutional investors now have the opportunity to participate through regulated futures markets. The availability of a regulated futures market paves the way for the creation of a Bitcoin ETF, which will then usher in the \u201clate majority\u201d and \u201claggards\u201d in subsequent hype cycles.Although it is impossible to predict the exact magnitude of the current hype cycle, it would be reasonable to conjecture that the cycle reaches its zenith in the range of $20,000 to $50,000. Much higher than this range and Bitcoin would command a significant fraction of gold\u2019s entire market capitalization (gold and Bitcoin would have equivalent market capitalizations at a bitcoin price of approximately $380,000 at the time of writing). A significant fraction of gold\u2019s market capitalization comes from central bank demand and it\u2019s unlikely that central banks or nation states will participate in this particular hype cycle.The entrance of nation\u00a0statesBitcoin\u2019s final Gartner hype cycle will begin when nation-states start accumulating it as a part of their foreign currency reserves. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is currently too small for it to be considered a viable addition to reserves for most countries. However, as private sector interest increases and the capitalization of Bitcoin approaches 1 trillion dollars it will become liquid enough for most states to enter the market. The entrance of the first state to officially add bitcoins to their reserves will likely trigger a stampede for others to do so. The states that are the earliest in adopting Bitcoin would see the largest benefit to their balance sheets if Bitcoin ultimately became a global reserve currency. Unfortunately, it will probably be the states with the strongest executive powers\u200a\u2014\u200adictatorships such as North Korea\u200a\u2014\u200athat will move the fastest in accumulating bitcoins. The unwillingness to see such states improve their financial position and the inherently weak executive branches of the Western democracies will cause them to dither and be laggards in accumulating bitcoins for their reserves.There is a great irony that the US is currently one of the nations most open in its regulatory position toward Bitcoin, while China and Russia are the most hostile. The US risks the greatest downside to its geopolitical position if Bitcoin were to supplant the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency. In the 1960s, Charle de Gaulle criticized the \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d the US enjoyed from the international monetary order it crafted with the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944. The Russian and Chinese governments have not yet awoken to the geo-strategic benefits of Bitcoin as a reserve currency and are currently preoccupied with the effects it may have on their internal markets.Like de Gaulle in the 1960s, who threatened to reestablish the classical gold standard in response to the US\u2019s exorbitant privilege, the Chinese and Russians will, in time, come to see the benefits of a large reserve position in a non-sovereign store of value. With the largest concentration of Bitcoin mining power residing in China, the Chinese state already has a distinct advantage in its potential to add bitcoins to its reserves.The US prides itself as a nation of innovators, with Silicon Valley being a crown jewel of the US economy. Thus far, Silicon Valley has largely dominated the conversation toward regulators on the position they should take vis-\u00e0-vis Bitcoin. However, the banking industry and the US Federal Reserve are finally having their first inkling of the existential threat Bitcoin poses to US monetary policy if it were to become a global reserve currency. The Wall Street Journal, known to be a mouth-piece for the Federal Reserve, published a commentary on the threat Bitcoin poses to US monetary policy:There is another danger, perhaps even more serious from the point of view of the central banks and regulators: bitcoin might not crash. If the speculative fervor in the cryptocurrency is merely the precursor to it being widely used as an alternative to the dollar, it will threaten the central banks\u2019 monopoly on\u00a0money.In the coming years there will be a great struggle between entrepreneurs and innovators in Silicon Valley, who will attempt to keep Bitcoin free of state control, and the banking industry and central banks who will do everything in their power to regulate Bitcoin to prevent their industry and money-issuing powers from being disrupted.The transition to a medium of\u00a0exchangeA monetary good cannot transition to being a generally accepted medium of exchange (the standard economic definition of \u201cmoney\u201d) before it is widely valued, for the tautological reason that a good that is not valued will not be accepted in exchange. In the process of becoming widely valued, and hence a store of value, a monetary good will soar in purchasing power, creating anopportunity cost to relinquishing it for use in exchange. Only when the opportunity cost of relinquishing a store of value drops to a suitably low level can it transition to becoming a generally accepted medium of exchange.More precisely, a monetary good will only be suitable as a medium of exchange when the sum of the opportunity cost and the transactional cost of using it in exchange drops below the cost of completing a trade without it.In a barter-based society, the transition of a store of value to a medium of exchange can occur even when the monetary good is increasing in purchasing power because the transactional costs of barter trade are extremely high. In a developed economy, where transactional costs are low, it is possible for a nascent and rapidly appreciating store of value, such as Bitcoin, to be used as a medium of exchange, albeit in a very limited scope. An example is the illicit drug market where buyers are willing to sacrifice the opportunity of holding bitcoins to minimize the substantial risk of purchasing the drugs using fiat currency.There are, however, major institutional barriers to a nascent store of value becoming a generally accepted medium of exchange in a developed society.States use taxation as a powerful means to protect their sovereign money from being displaced by competing monetary goods. Not only does a sovereign money enjoy the advantage of a constant source of demand, by way of taxes being remittable only in it, but competing monetary goods are taxed whenever they are exchanged at an appreciated value. This latter kind of taxation creates significant friction to using a store of value as a medium of exchange.The handicapping of market-based monetary goods is not an insurmountable barrier to their adoption as a generally accepted medium of exchange, however. If faith is lost in a sovereign money, its value can collapse in a process known as hyperinflation. When a sovereign money hyperinflates, its value first collapses against the most liquid goods in the society, such as gold or a foreign money like the US dollar, if they are available. When no liquid goods are available or their supply is limited, a hyperinflating money collapses against real goods, such as real estate and commodities. The archetypal image of a hyperinflation is a grocery store emptied of all its produce as consumers flee the rapidly diminishing value of their nation\u2019s money.Eventually, when faith is completely lost during a hyperinflation, a sovereign money will no longer be accepted by anyone, and the society will either devolve to barter or the monetary unit will be completely replaced as a medium of exchange. An example of this process was the replacement of the Zimbabwe dollar with the US dollar. The replacement of a sovereign money with a foreign one is made more difficult by the scarcity of the foreign money and the absence of foreign banking institutions to provide liquidity.The ability to easily transmit bitcoins across borders and absence of a need for a banking system make Bitcoin an ideal monetary good to acquire for those afflicted by hyperinflation. In the coming years, as fiat monies continue to follow their historical trend toward eventual worthlessness, Bitcoin will become an increasingly popular choice for global savings to flee to. When a nation\u2019s money is abandoned and replaced by Bitcoin, Bitcoin will have transitioned from being a store of value in that society to a generally accepted medium of exchange. Daniel Krawisz coined the term \u201chyperbitcoinization\u201d to describe this process.Part 4\u2026Part 4 of this article will be published tomorrow and linked from Twitter (follow me).

New money is entering the market at a staggering rate - to the degree that many exchanges have had problems on-boarding and verifying their new customers to keep up with demand.These new investors are coming in droves after hearing about sky-high returns from a friend or friend\u2019s friend or a friend of a friend\u2019s friend.Once they\u2019ve gotten through the verification process on Coinbase or Gemini or Kraken, they execute their first market order and the rush of the cryptocraze washes over them. To the MOON!Then price drops by 10%, our new investor freaks out, convinces themselves that they\u2019re hardly ever right, that ETH or BTC is going to $0 and that they should just cut their losses. They panic sell, adding fuel to the micro-bear run and the price continues to drop. Whew, that was close. Got out just in time.A short time later, they see that the price is not only retracing back toward their entry price, soon they\u2019ll realize that it will exceed it. They just bought high and sold low. They leave the market.Recent moments of FOMO in BTC & ETH\u00a0tradingWe\u2019ve seen this play out a number of times this year, and as an investor myself, I too get concerned when I see the price of ETH & BTC begin a FOMO trend. I\u2019ve seen the value of my portfolio drop by 20\u201350% in hours.However, in order to counteract FOMO and any knee-jerk panic selling reaction I might have, I\u2019ve done two things:First, I\u2019ve taken my coins off of the exchanges. This prevents me from having my finger on the trigger and selling in any sell-off or panic. I suggest you do the same, even if only for the security of storing your coins in a wallet to which you alone own the private key.Second, I\u2019ve quantified what I think Ether and Bitcoin will be worth in 2020. This personal thesis keeps me confident of the longer term state of crypto and in my investment. I\u2019m not here to day trade, I\u2019m here for the long term\u200a\u2014\u200aand this helps me weather the storms. I\u2019m not even saying I\u2019m right, but it changes my long term perspective and makes be a more patient investor.I think Bitcoin and Ethereum will share a $4.5 trillion market cap by\u00a02020.Uh ok, whoa partner, how did you arrive there? Here\u2019s my simple explanation:Sizing the world economyThe nominal GDP of the world economy (as of 2016) is $78 trillion. By 2020 the IMF estimates the nGDP will be $91 trillion:http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLDAsk yourself, in three years, do you think that 5% of the world\u2019s GDP could be stored and exchanged using blockchain technology?Me too\u200a\u2014\u200afor many reasons: The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance; the massive investment that world banks are making in blockchain technology; the interest in digitizing the currencies of countries like Russia, China and others; the leveling of global political power; because it\u2019s cheap, faster and more secure than current financial technologies.Ok, assumption granted. Now some math. If 5% of the world\u2019s GDP in 2020 is housed on the prevailing blockchains, then the value of crypto will be ~$4.55 trillion.If ETH/BTC are the anointed blockchains, what are the value of those networks?For simplicity and bi-partisanship, let\u2019s assume that BTC & ETH are equally dominant, each with 25% of the total market size of crypto, with the remaining 50% distributed across hundreds of other coins, perhaps private bank and treasury networks.This means that BTC and ETH would each represent 25% of that $4.55 trillion, or $1.1375T each.How much could one Bitcoin be worth?In 2020, there will be ~18,375,000 BTC in circulation. $1,137,500,000,000 divided by 18,375,000 = $61,900 per coin, ~+2,200% from today.How much could one Ether be worth?This is a little harder to calculate due to the somewhat unknown supply of Ether in the future, how Proof-of-Stake might change new Ether issuance, and the impact that the Ice Age will have on time between new ETH issuance.The original 2014 issuance model, stated a projection of ~162M ETH in circulation in 2020, however /u/manly_ pointed out that Vitalik has said it would be closer to 100M, so for our rough math we\u2019ll use 100M ETH.$1,137,500,000,000 divided by 100,000,000 = $11,375 per coin, ~+4,000% from today.Ok, what if BTC and ETH are much more dominant than a combined 50% of crypto?If BTC and ETH represent 33% of the total market opportunity each, then each would have a total value of $1.502 trillion.BTC would be worth $81,742 ~+2,900% from today.ETH would be worth $15,020 ~+5,300% from today.Again, this is just an apples to apples comparison, it doesn\u2019t take into account market speculations, dividends from Proof-of-Stake or incentives from new BIPs or EIPs, or other external forces that could factor in.So, if 5% of nGDP by 2020 is achieved, the question becomes which could be the dominant\u00a0coin?I don\u2019t know the answer to that. However, I do believe that there is room in the sandbox for not only BTC and ETH, but others as well. If I had to choose, I think ETH is not only at parity to BTC in it\u2019s ability to store and transmit value, but is also the underpinning for additional value-add networks to be built on top of it, in any industry. This might tip the scales in ETH\u2019s favor, but I do not believe this is a winner take all, zero sum game. What\u2019s good for BTC is good for ETH, what\u2019s good for ETH is good for BTC.What\u2019s good? Adoption.In conclusionDon\u2019t FOMO your coins, the long term implications of blockchain technology are bigger than any one company, bigger than any one market segment. Keep your eye on the long term and hold your investment through short-term dips.I\u2019m not saying my projections are correct either, I simply want to put into world how I foresee the value of ETH/BTC, where I get my justification for holding long-term, and how I am at peace during FOMO or any other market volatility.Edit: some readers pointed out a mistake in my math. I actually did the calculations based on 5% of the current GDP and not 2020\u2019s.

However, due to the simple fact that I was hands deep into the\u00a0.com bubble, every time someone writes about how low adoption still is and (implies) how much higher markets will still go, I get reminded that basically every Uber driver in London tells me about bitcoin or another token these days and how similar that is to how things unfolded in the\u00a0.com bubble. So I get suspicious\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially if that person presumably has an interest in prices going higher. I wrote an earlier article about the bubble comparison if you care to have a look here. Note that the same suspicion I mention here applies to myself also. I do have an interest in prices going up further - at least subconsciously.So I decided I wanted to know for myself how likely it really is that 1994 is the correct analogy in regards to the internet comparison or rather I wanted to use a similar method to arrive at my own conclusion as to how long this current bubble will still be getting larger.I decided to look at the following indicators:Cryptocurrency adoption as compared to the Internet (similar but slightly different methodology to the article on Forbes)Size of the current bubble relative to the\u00a0.com bubbleFurther ways to value bitcoin (relative to gold, future introduction timing)The following addresses each of these points.Cryptocurrency adoption vs. Internet adoptionAs I said above, I think looking at cryptocurrencies this way is very smart and I am not looking to take away any of the credit from Ari here.However I disagree with using the number of bitcoin users as the best indicator. I think that there is a good case to be made that many people who entered the world of cryptocurrencies after December 2016 may have directly gone into Ethereum and from there onwards into ICOs and utility token. I am not saying they never touched bitcoin, but they might easily be lost in the statistic.Furthermore, given cryptocurrencies have started to become an expensive hobby and are really much closer to an actual investment decision these days, I do think it is fair to say that a large percentage of households will only have one cryptocurrency user and that their investment will be done in joint accounts (whether this is couples or entire families). This might also happen simply due to the age difference and the likelihood the older generations ask their children to do it for them.So I tried to focus (1) on households and not users and (2) on cryptocurrency households and not just bitcoin holders. My results are below:Basically I start with Alistair Milne\u2019s Coinbase user number which he has been tracking nicely (check out his Twitter; thanks Alistair). Then I used coinmarketcap.com\u2019s trading share (volume based) of Coinbase exchanges in total bitcoin trade as an indicator of Coinbase accounts as a % of the total Cryptoaccounts.Lastly, I assumed that every household has on average 4 accounts (ie some people will have 10 accounts on multiple exchanges on their own and some people will have just 1).The resulting number brings me slightly ahead of Ari\u2019s estimation in terms of where we are regarding crypto adoption. I believe that 3.5% of households are currently crypto households, which compares to about 1998/1999 in terms of internet adoption.The reason I believe that is more accurate is actually that it also ties in better with the other indicators I looked at.Cryptobubble vs.\u00a0.com bubbleI can draw on two earlier posts to properly do this comparison. One is linked at the start, the other can be found here.In order to understand the numbers I am using, you will need to know that I disagree with the general view of \u201cTotal Market Capitalization\u201d in the cryptosphere. The article I mentioned just above goes into detail as to what is wrong with it, but in summary the problem is that the current way to measure market cap in crypto disregards the supply of token/coins still held by the companies or users that gave birth to these coins.Arriving at the right number is a difficult exercise as it is clear (at least to me) that the total supply of all coins need to be taken into account for ICO token (ie the founder holdings are part of supply), while for most utility token and for bitcoin considering the supply not yet mined would not be appropriate. However, cases like Ripple make it difficult as I think every bit of the pre-mined supply here should count towards market capitalization as it can be sold any time. Any ways, when you see my numbers below, just note that I am counting total supply for token and a mix of total and circulating supply for utility token and currencies like bitcoin.Again, several assumptions are necessary. I start with saying that the proportion of value attributable to the\u00a0.com bubble is 50%, which I derive from the level that the Nasdaq Composite traded at for the next few years after the bubble burst. That yields a size of 4 trillion US Dollar for the total bubble. However, to make it comparable, I believe we need to deduct the amount due to Institutional holders, as these have not yet been a major factor in crypto due to unclear regulations (even just asset custody is a night mare; good article on this by TwoBitIdiot here). So that brings it down to 10% of the total value, yielding $400bn.If we assume the same proportion of value attributable to the bubble in Crypto (ie 50%) and allow for 10% of Institutionals in the space, the current bubble in Crypto is c. $180bn, which is about 45% of the\u00a0.com bubble.This would suggest there is quite some room left, though for reasons outlined in my earlier article I would probably say this is slightly overoptimistic.Further valuation methodsNext to looking at bitcoin transactions as a % of fiat transactions which I find a bit too much too assume (given this basically presumes any scaling issues or electricity issues are solved and governments let it happen), there are two things that come to mind that could be important:bitcoin market cap as a % of global Gold valueBitcoin has undoubtedly shown a capability to store (and grow) value, so this is an interesting comparison. I find it hard to assume bitcoin will ever replace Gold given the latter\u2019s much much longer track record, but it is absolutely not out of the question that bitcoin value could approach 10% of global Gold reserves.1% of Gold value translates to approximately $3,500 per ultimately mined bitcoin. So we currently stand at about 2.5% of total Gold value. This suggests bitcoin could be worth $35,000 one day.Institutional mass market adoption (CME Futures)There was recently an article by the FT that claimed the introduction of Futures would hail the end of the bitcoin run. I thought the idea to look at previous instances such as opening of the Japanese markets and mortgage bond indexation is a smart one. However I disagree with the author\u2019s conclusion.As a matter of fact, as I argue here, these instances seemed to mark the start of the accelerated part of all these bubbles and while that used to be the last stretch of the bubble it typically took values a good deal higher yet for quite some time.How does it all tie togetherIf you look at what I stipulate here, it is interesting to see that all three parts fit together relatively nicely.All of my indicators would say that in terms of value creation we are about at the start of 1999. The\u00a0.com bubble had ways to go from that point (about 130% upside was left to the March 2000 high) and internet adoption more than doubled in about two years. This does not yet say anything about the maturity of the underlying technology of course, but that taken together with the timing of CME future launching still this year leads me to believe that we are in the last leg of the current bubble in crypto.This last leg is typically the strongest one and surpasses everyone\u2019s expectations on price, leading to a fully fledged euphoria. I have no idea where this leg will take current crypto prices, but I continue to think that the introduction of ICO regulations along with lawsuits brought against some of them by the SEC and founders potentially ending up in jail could be the catalyst for the bursting of the bubble.

From 2010 when Satoshi Nakamoto begged Wikileaks to not use Bitcoin for donations to the debate over whether bitcoin use in darknet markets was good or not to the scaling debate that lasted from 2014\u20132017, debates about the utility of Bitcoin never seem to end.Is Bitcoin Digital Gold? Is Bitcoin PayPal 2.0? Is Bitcoin the one money to rule them all? Who are you to talk about this stuff anyway? And who cares, isn\u2019t the market going to reveal people\u2019s preferences over time?In this article, I seek to answer these questions and more by looking at how Bitcoin is currently used and project out a bit as to how Bitcoin will evolve in the future.Why do people want\u00a0Bitcoin?Like anything in a market economy, the price of Bitcoin is entirely dependent on supply and demand. This may seem strange since money is used to price everything else, but there is a supply and demand for money.A money that\u2019s abundant will tend to have less demand and a money that\u2019s scarce will tend to have larger demand. We call a money that\u2019s abundant easy money because it\u2019s easy to add to the supply. We call a money that\u2019s scarce hard money because it\u2019s hard to add to the supply.The main reason why people value Bitcoin is because it is hard money. There\u2019s an inborn instinct for humans to want scarce things and Bitcoin is limited in its supply by the 21 million cap. The 21 million cap has already lasted 9 years without changing and that makes Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity easier to trust. The people that value Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity are using Bitcoin as a store of value. That is, they are foregoing goods now for goods later. They are saving.Furthermore, Bitcoin is also hard to confiscate and is unique among assets in this regard. There really aren\u2019t that many options that are provably scarce and are resistant to confiscation. Real estate stores value pretty well (as they say, land is scarce: they\u2019re not making any more), but is easily confiscatable. Stocks and bonds are also good stores of value, but are also easily seized by governments. Bitcoin is really the only asset that has both proven scarcity and confiscation-resistance.That\u2019s not to say that scarcity and the store of value uses are the only reasons that people want Bitcoin. There are people that want Bitcoin so they could buy something on the darknet markets or because they want to transfer some money to their relatives abroad. These are what I call method of payment use cases for Bitcoin.Store of Value >> Method of\u00a0PaymentThe method of payment use cases have one thing in common. The people involved want the convenience that Bitcoin provides them, but don\u2019t care to hold the Bitcoin itself. People that use Bitcoin as a method of payment are concerned not about price, but about slippage, fees and volatility during the short window when they hold Bitcoin.For example, if someone wants to buy some LSD on the darknet markets, they first go and buy Bitcoin with their native currency (USD, say). Then they buy the product. The Bitcoin goes to the merchant, who then converts to their native currency (for simplicity, let\u2019s say USD).Neither party holds Bitcoin for very long and neither cares about the Bitcoin price as long as the total fees (USD \u2192BTC, BTC transfer, BTC \u2192USD) are reasonable. Bitcoin could be $100 or $100,000, for the method of payment use case, the price doesn\u2019t matter. Convenience is what matters. Conversely, method-of-payment demand does not actually increase demand much for Bitcoin as the amount bought is sold soon after.The only real benefits of having more method-of-payment utility are that Bitcoin can increase convenience in very special cases (foreign remittances, darknet) and Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity can increase slightly as there are effectively more places to \u201csell\u201d your Bitcoin, not for another currency, but for a good or service.For people that use Bitcoin for its scarcity, that is, as a store of value, price matters quite a bit. Talk to anyone who owns Bitcoin and price is something they keep track of obsessively. This is prima facie evidence that most people don\u2019t use Bitcoin as a method of payment, but as a store of value.Competing on Method of\u00a0PaymentWhy is it that people value Bitcoin as a store of value so much more than as a method of payment?Looking at the payment landscape, the answer should be clear. Consumers have many choices for method of payment already. Cash, Credit Cards, Debit Cards, Paypal, Venmo, Square Cash, Google Wallet, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and even the good old bank check are among the many choices in the US for method of payment. WeChat in China, M-Pesa in Kenya and the Octapus Card in Hong Kong are even more convenient.All these payment methods are much more convenient than Bitcoin for nearly every type of transaction (restaurants, brick and mortar stores, e-commerce, etc). For method of payment, convenience is paramount and that means merchant acceptance.Merchants don\u2019t want to keep Bitcoin (that is, use it as a store of value) which hinders its use as a method of payment. There are people that argue that a merchant can save on the 2\u20133% vs a credit card, but fail to realize the same merchant now has to convert these Bitcoins to USD and probably will have to pay in exchange fees and slippage in order to do so. At least the credit card fees are certain. The uncertainty around how much in fees that they\u2019ll pay due to exchanging to USD is then passed onto the customer in the form of higher prices and/or worse rates for BTC/USD than spot. In other words, using Bitcoin as a method of payment is not a very good deal for the customer to use Bitcoin and so they don\u2019t.Accepting Bitcoin doesn\u2019t generally boost merchants\u2019 bottom lines very much. This is because merchants don\u2019t really want Bitcoin. Merchants view Bitcoin as a way to increase sales and thus convert any Bitcoin received immediately to their native currency. At best, this causes selling pressure for Bitcoin as there\u2019s more supply to be sold.Even if the spender of Bitcoin buys back that Bitcoin on the market, what they\u2019ve actually done is use Bitcoin as a crappy credit card. There\u2019s multiple transactions, more conversion fees and less consumer protections. In other words, it\u2019s much less convenient and thus an inferior method of payment.Holders Don\u2019t Like\u00a0SpendingTrying to artificially create method-of-payment demand is putting the cart before the horse.First, the vast majority of people that hold Bitcoin aren\u2019t looking to use it as a method of payment. Holding cash in a bank and using a credit card is much more convenient for that. The people that value Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity do so because they believe Bitcoin will go up long-term, so spending it now wouldn\u2019t make much sense.Second, the merchants don\u2019t want to keep the Bitcoin they receive and accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment is not magically going to make them want to. Much like giving a treadmill to an overweight relative isn\u2019t magically going to get them to want to be fit, adding a Bitcoin payment option for a merchant that doesn\u2019t value Bitcoin isn\u2019t going to make them want it as a store of value.Artificial market intervention actually causes the reverse effect as merchants rightfully ask, \u201cif this stuff is really valuable, why are you trying to dump it on me?\u201dHow Bitcoin Will Become a Method of\u00a0PaymentSo how will Bitcoin evolve into a method of payment if ever? Or will it \u201cjust\u201d be Digital Gold?This question is ironic since it\u2019s posed by method-of-payment advocates to denigrate Bitcoin, but ignorant historically. People have used gold as a method of payment for thousands of years and not just as a store of value. From a monetary evolution standpoint, a few conditions have to be met before people start using a hard money as a method of payment in earnest.First, the merchant has to want the particular monetary medium as a store of value. Many, for marketing purposes say that they like Bitcoin, but few truly want to keep it. You can tell they don\u2019t really want Bitcoin because they still accept other payment methods. Take for example black market merchants in Venezuela. Do they take Bolivars for their goods? Absolutely not. The Bolivar depreciates too fast so those merchants demand harder currency as a store of value.Second, the consumer has to desire the good or service so much that they\u2019re willing to part with their precious Bitcoin. Savers have a low time preference and are thus good at resisting sales tactics. The actual good or service must be truly worthwhile for holders to part with their money.In other words, the merchant has to want Bitcoin as a store of value and produce higher quality goods to entice Bitcoin holders.At this point, merchants aren\u2019t desperate enough for Bitcoin; they don\u2019t even want to keep it when they get it. Furthermore, Bitcoin holders aren\u2019t tempted by what merchants are selling and use fiat instead. Until this gap closes, there won\u2019t be much Bitcoin flowing from holders to merchants, which is another way of saying that there won\u2019t be much usage as a method of payment.The Futility of InterventionEveryone in the Bitcoin community would like merchants to desire Bitcoin as a store of value. Increasing method of payment adoption, however, doesn\u2019t change their desires. At best, this results in selling pressure on Bitcoin, lowering price. At worst, this results in misalignment of incentives, misallocation of resources and centralization.This is indeed what\u2019s happened to BCH as they\u2019ve tried to artificially create demand in the method of payment use case. Despite the millions spent on marketing, the billions spent on defending the peg against BTC and the time spent on centralized efforts to push the market toward the method of payment use case, BCH still has less transactions per day than DOGE.When paternalistic interventionists act on wishful thinking instead of letting the market play out, disaster looms. As of this writing BCH has fallen 80% from its all time high against BTC. The market continues to punish their centralized malinvestment and if they don\u2019t learn their lessons soon, they\u2019ll be relegated to the dustbins of monetary history.ConclusionMost people value Bitcoin for its scarcity. Ergo, anything else is a nice-to-have, not a must have. Lots of options exist for method of payment, but very few for store of value and none that are as confiscation-resistant as Bitcoin is.As Bitcoin adoption grows, merchants will start demanding Bitcoin as a store of value in lieu of any other currency. This is already happening to a degree in places like Turkey, Iran and Venezuela. When a large part of society wants Bitcoin as a store of value, only then will the method of payment use case emerge en masse.", "responses": "40"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "felix salmon", "link": "https://medium.com/@felixsalmon/the-bitcoin-bubble-and-the-future-of-currency-2b5ef79482cb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 3, 2013", "readtime": "20 min read", "upvotes": "812", "content": "Bitcoin market cap, from http://blockchain.info/charts/market-capThe Bitcoin Bubble and the Future of\u00a0Currencyfelix salmonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 3, 2013A few days ago, the value of all the bitcoins in the world blew past $1 billion for the first time ever. That\u2019s an impressive achievement, for a purely virtual currency backed by no central bank or other authority. It\u2019s also temporary: we\u2019re in the middle of a bitcoin bubble right now, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the bubble bursts.There are a couple of reasons why the bubble is sure to burst. The first is just that it\u2019s a bubble, and any chart which looks like the one at the top of this post is bound to end in tears at some point. But there\u2019s a deeper reason, too\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is that bitcoins are an uncomfortable combination of commodity and currency. The commodity value of bitcoins is rooted in their currency value, but the more of a commodity they become, the less useful they are as a currency.Still, it\u2019s worth taking a look behind the bitcoin bubble, because there are fascinating implications for anybody who cares about payments, or currencies, or trust.First, though, let\u2019s go back to the night of Sunday June 12, 2011. That was the date of the first big bitcoin heist: a theft of such simplicity and audacity that it might well be considered the perfect crime. A man\u200a\u2014\u200awe know him only as \u201cAll In Vain\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awent to bed that night with his Windows computer turned on and connected to the internet. On that computer was a wallet containing 25,000 electronic coins. When he woke up on Monday morning, the wallet was still there. But the money was gone.Those 25,000 coins were, at the time, worth some $500,000; today, they are worth about $3.5 million. If All in Vain had noticed the theft within a couple of minutes of it happening, it\u2019s conceivable that he could have got his money back. But he was asleep\u200a\u2014\u200aand ten minutes after the theft occurred, it was utterly permanent and irrevocable. The only way All in Vain could get his money back would be if the thief were to simply transfer it back into his wallet.No one will ever find the person who stole All in Vain\u2019s coins. That\u2019s because the coins were designed, by another pseudonymous internet denizen known only as Satoshi Nakamoto, to be the perfectly anonymous payment mechanism for a digital world. That\u2019s one of the things about bitcoins: once you send them, they\u2019re sent. Similarly, if someone sends you bitcoins, you know for sure that you own them. You don\u2019t need to know or trust the sender\u200a\u2014\u200aall you need to know is that the coins have arrived in your virtual wallet, ready for saving or spending.Bitcoins were designed to be \u2013 and, in many ways, are \u2013 the perfect digital currency: they\u2019re frictionless, anonymous, and cryptographically astonishingly secure. For anybody who\u2019s ever suffered the incompetence of a bank, or bristled at the fees involved in just spending money, either domestically or abroad \u2013 that is to say, for all of us \u2013 the promise of bitcoin is the holy grail of payments. Especially since, to all intents and purposes, bitcoins are invisible to law enforcement and the taxman.Those strengths are also weaknesses. No one wants to risk losing millions of dollars worth of currency overnight, just because they were outsmarted by some computer hacker.Still, for the time being, bitcoin is in many ways the best and cleanest payments mechanism the world has ever seen. So if we\u2019re ever going to create something better, we\u2019re going to have to learn from what bitcoin does right \u2013 as well as what it does wrong.The source code for bitcoin is free and public, which means that just about every hacker and cryptographer in the world has had a crack at it. And they\u2019ve all come to the same conclusion: it really works. There are question marks over just how anonymous it is and just how scalable it is, but when bitcoins first arrived in early 2009 \u2013 right at the height of a massive global crisis of capitalism \u2013 they had immediate and magnetic appeal to the anarcho-utopian crowd of techno-libertarians who drive an enormous amount of innovation online.Such people, including Satoshi Nakamoto, are far from unique in their mistrust of all existing financial institutions. What sets Nakamoto apart is that he turned that mistrust into a philosophy, the most important driving force behind the bitcoin project. When he introduced bitcoin to the world in February 2009, Nakamoto boasted that his new currency was \u201ccompletely decentralized, with no trusted parties\u201d. And he explained in some detail what he saw as the problem in need of a solution:The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.Nakamoto\u2019s no paranoiac crazy: what he\u2019s saying here is not all that different from what Warren Buffett wrote in his 2012 letter to shareholders.Investments that are denominated in a given currency include money-market funds, bonds, mortgages, bank deposits, and other instruments. Most of these currency-based investments are thought of as \"safe.\" In truth they are among the most dangerous of assets.Over the past century these instruments have destroyed the purchasing power of investors in many countries, even as these holders continued to receive timely payments of interest and principal. This ugly result, moreover, will forever recur. Governments determine the ultimate value of money, and systemic forces will sometimes cause them to gravitate to policies that produce inflation. From time to time such policies spin out of control.Even in the U.S., where the wish for a stable currency is strong, the dollar has fallen a staggering 86% in value since 1965, when I took over management of Berkshire. It takes no less than $7 today to buy what $1 did at that time.If you hold dollars, you\u2019re trusting the US government not to destroy your wealth. Bitcoin, by contrast, is based on mistrust\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s specifically designed so that it\u2019s every man for himself. All in Vain was blamed by many in the bitcoin community for his stupidity: what was he thinking, keeping his wallet on a Windows computer attached to the open internet?But even with bitcoin, people nearly always end up trusting someone \u2013 and the entity they\u2019re trusting often turns out to be unreliable. MyBitcoin, turned out to be a fraud; Mt Gox was hacked. The latest hot new bitcoin company is Coinlab, but given how much money can be made by hacking into these companies, and given that law enforcement authorities are unlikely to make any attempt to go after the perpetrators, there will always be a pretty substantial risk that clients will lose their money.The level of mistrust built into bitcoin is both feature and bug \u2013 most of us actually like being able to outsource our wealth-hoarding to some large trusted institution, rather than burying $1,000 under a black volcanic rock in a dry stone wall next to an old oak tree, or wrapping $90,000 in hundred-dollar bills in aluminum foil and hiding it in the freezer. Looking after your own coins is dangerous, and requires a pretty substantial level of tech-savviness. But trusting someone else to look after your coins requires the very trust that bitcoin was designed to circumvent.Bitcoin\u2019s built-in mistrust of institutions doesn\u2019t just set it apart from fiat currency, it also sets it apart from other virtual currencies, such as Facebook credits in the US, QQ coins in China, or Linden dollars in Second Life. All those currencies are closely controlled and guarded by the companies that invented them \u2013 and have very little value outside that particular ecosystem. (That said, credits in World of Warcraft are valuable enough that Chinese prison guards reportedly force convicts to perform monotonous tasks within the game for 12-hour stretches at a time, building up credits which can then be sold for many times the guards\u2019 official salary.)Some of these virtual currencies are roughly the same order of magnitude as Bitcoin in size, although it\u2019s hard to make apples-to-apples comparisons. Revenues from Facebook credits are running at a rate of about $1 billion a year, for instance, and the market in QQ coins was so big in 2007 that the Chinese central bank, fearing that it was losing control of the money supply, cracked down on their use, calling on companies to stop trading in them. In this latest bubble, bitcoin transaction volume has managed to exceed $30 million in one day, and most days are seeing volumes of more than $5 million. That works out to about $2 billion in volume per year, so long as the bubble doesn\u2019t burst.But the biggest difference between bitcoin and other virtual currencies is that bitcoins are the only one which have speculative value. What\u2019s more, because they\u2019re not tied to a corporate parent, bitcoins appeal to the web\u2019s anarcho-libertarians in the way that no other virtual currency can. Bitcoins hold exactly the same gleaming promise for techno-utopians as gold does for Glenn Beck. They\u2019re a scarce resource, and there\u2019s no government or corporation which can control that resource.Bitcoins, like gold, are beholden to no government; they can\u2019t be printed by any central bank, and they certainly won\u2019t be subject to hyperinflation, since the global supply of bitcoins will never exceed 21 million. Like gold, bitcoins are mined; but unlike gold, no one can stumble over some large seam and make a fortune. Mining for bitcoins involves an enormous amount of computer power, and very little luck, and the global rate at which new bitcoins will be mined is both predetermined and slowing down. There were about 3 million coins outstanding at the beginning of 2010, there are about 11 million coins outstanding today, and we\u2019ll get to 14 million in early 2014. Come 2021 or so, assuming bitcoins are still used then, the rate of growth of bitcoins will be so low that to a first approximation the money supply will be constant. This carries with it its own problems, as we\u2019ll see. But there\u2019s no risk that some central bank will print millions of new bitcoins, thereby diluting or inflating away the value of existing ones.As the reverberations from the financial crisis continue to echo, people betting on a decline of trust in government have been stocking up on gold and bitcoins. (Or rather, gold or bitcoins: although they can be equally zealous and vehement about their respective asset classes, there\u2019s surprisingly little overlap between goldbugs, on the one hand, and the bitcoin community, on the other.) These are the perfect assets for rugged individualists, who trust their guns or their ultra-secure passwords more than they do their country. And in times of global turmoil, as we\u2019re seeing today, such assets can perform very well.The immediate impetus for the current spike in bitcoin prices, of course, is the events in Cyprus. There, the government, under extreme pressure from the European Union, first proposed taking all bank accounts \u2013 even the insured ones \u2013 by at least 6.75%. That didn\u2019t work, but now uninsured account holders at Cyprus\u2019s two largest banks stand to lose most of their money. It\u2019s a stark reminder of the dangers associated with depositing money in a bank.Bitcoin has become suddenly popular in Cyprus for obvious reasons: no government can confiscate your bitcoins, or prevent you from transporting them out of the country. (On the other hand, if your bank account is frozen, it\u2019s hard to find the money needed to buy coins.)More generally, bitcoins could be emerging as a very useful currency in police states, or anywhere that monetary policy could fail catastrophically. At the end of 2011, for instance, there was a significant uptick of bitcoin activity in Belarus and Ukraine, two countries at severe risk of hyperinflation. If you want to protect your wealth from the policies of your national government, or from the inflationary policies of a heterodox central bank, then bitcoins can be a very good way of doing so in a largely undetectable manner.Of course, acquiring bitcoins in such countries can be non-trivial: there\u2019s not a lot of liquidity on the major internet exchanges from people looking to sell bitcoins and buy the Ukrainian hryvnia. And even if there were, your local Ukrainian bank might frown on sending lots of hryvnia to Mt Gox. But it\u2019s conceivable that people in Ukraine and Cyprus, especially information workers, might start working for bitcoins, spending them on goods and services, and introducing them into the local economy that way. At which point one can envisage the coins getting the same kind of status, at least among the information elite, that dollars had in the Soviet era.Bitcoins, then, are like cash\u200a\u2014\u200abut they take the idea a step further than has ever been possible. If you give me a $100 bill, the transaction is anonymous and untraceable, but we both need to be in the same place at the same time. And it helps if we both live in a country where the US dollar is an accepted unit of currency.With bitcoins, transfers can take place across continents and timezones with no problems, no timelags, and only minuscule transaction fees. No banks are involved; no central bank controls the money supply; no taxes ever need to be paid. Once you\u2019ve obtained a stash of bitcoins, they\u2019re yours to do with as you like.And there\u2019s lots that you can do with bitcoins. You can convert them into any of a dozen currencies, on various online exchanges. (Although at that point you\u2019re going to start needing a bank account.) You can gamble with them in online casinos. Or you can just go out and spend them. The list of things which have been bought with bitcoins is very long, and is by no means confined to laptop computers and computer-programming services. Hotels take them, a sock manufacturer in Massachusetts is famous for accepting bitcoins, and the more enthusiastic members of the bitcoin community regularly do things like split checks at a restaurant \u2013 even one which doesn\u2019t take bitcoin itself \u2013 by transferring coins to the person paying in dollars.And then, more notoriously, there\u2019s Silk Road \u2013 a site which is not only a hub of bitcoin activity, but also played an important role in the first bitcoin bubble, the vertiginous rise in market value of bitcoins in 2011 which made the rest of the world sit up and pay attention to what was going on.Silk Road\u200a\u2014\u200aand bitcoins\u200a\u2014\u200ahit the public consciousness on June 1, 2011, a couple of weeks before the All in Vain heist. That\u2019s when Gawker\u2019s Adrian Chen published an article headlined \u201cThe Underground Website Where You Can Buy Any Drug Imaginable\u201d. His post was viewed more than 1.5 million times, and caused a sensation, with Senators Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, and Chuck Schumer, of New York, writing an outraged (and entirely ineffective) letter to the Attorney General and the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, demanding Silk Road be taken down.Bitcoins were \u2013 and still are \u2013 the only currency accepted on Silk Road, and overnight they became a speculative bet on the online future of illegal trading. The price of bitcoins, which had never before traded in the double digits, soared in just one week to as much as $33 apiece.The value of bitcoins, it turns out, is highly sensitive to media coverage: a year earlier, in July 2010, the influential technology site Slashdot posted a short item about bitcoin which sent the price soaring tenfold\u200a\u2014\u200afrom less than a cent to about 7 cents per bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200aalso in a few days. And a single post on Time.com in April was enough to double the price of Bitcoins in a week, from 80 cents to $1.60. Even the article you\u2019re reading now is appearing now because of the current bubble, and will, at the margin, help to continue to inflate it.For speculators, the math is incredibly compelling. If you spent $100 on bitcoins the day after the Slashdot article came out, those coins would have been worth $72,500 when the Gawker article came out just under a year later. And they would have been worth $250,000 a week after that. Today, they would be worth more than $1 million. There aren\u2019t many perfectly legal investments which offer that kind of return.All of which helps explain the current bitcoin bubble as well. Each time the value of a bitcoin hits a new high or a new milestone, there\u2019s more press coverage of the phenomenon, drawing new people in, and sending the value of bitcoins even higher. Indeed, if you chart the value of bitcoins against the number of times that they\u2019re being talked about on Twitter, you\u2019ll see a very strong correlation. And because of the Cyprus connection, mainstream publications have a handy real-world news hook, now, with which to explain the bitcoin phenomenon.This is actually a serious problem, if you\u2019re trying to put together a currency, rather than a vehicle for financial speculation. If the currency of a country ever fluctuated as much as bitcoins did, it would never be taken seriously as a medium of exchange: how are you meant to do business in a place where an item costing one unit of currency is worth $10 one day and $20 the next? Currencies need a modicum of stability; indeed, one of the main selling points of bitcoin was that it couldn\u2019t be destabilized by government institutions. But that comes as scant comfort to people watching the value of a bitcoin behave like some kind of demented internet stock during the dot-com bubble.And just like demented internet stocks, bitcoins have seen busts as well as bubbles: in the second half of 2011, for instance, the value of bitcoins retreated from their peak around $30 each to a low point closer to $3. (Today, they\u2019re trading above $140.)In reality, then, bitcoin doesn\u2019t really behave like a currency at all. In terms of its market value, it looks much more like a highly-volatile commodity. That\u2019s by design: bitcoins were created to be the most fungible commodity the world had ever seen \u2013 to the point at which they would effectively erase the distinction between a commodity and a currency.But is that a good idea?Dollars are a universally accepted unit of account: if something in the world has a price, it has a price in dollars. Dollars are not, on the other hand, physical commodities. The overwhelming majority of dollars in the world are deposited safely and electronically in banks: there\u2019s something weird and self-defeating about the kind of people who keep their savings stuffed under the mattress. In Hollywood, if you show someone counting out huge sums of cash, that\u2019s an easy way for the director to say that he\u2019s a criminal.Bitcoin was constructed to behave like a currency: it\u2019s very easy to use bitcoins to pay for goods and services, especially if what you\u2019re buying is in a different country. Right now, there\u2019s literally no way to build a website selling some kind of service, and have a meaningful fraction of the world\u2019s online population be able to pay you for that service. Bitcoin was designed to solve that problem; to be, in effect, the lingua franca of online commerce.But it\u2019s very hard to be a currency when you\u2019re also a commodity, governed by rules of scarcity and subject to speculative attack. And it\u2019s also very hard to be a currency \u2013 or even a commodity, for that matter \u2013 when you\u2019re as small as bitcoin is. Even now, at the top of a huge bubble, the total value of all the bitcoins in existence is the equivalent of about 2,000 standard gold bars -- not remotely enough to revolutionize the global payments and currency systems as we know them. Given the choice between something old and solid, on the one hand, and something new and virtual, on the other, the market is still voting for the asset class which has proved its worth over millennia.On a good day, at the top of the bubble, the trading volume in bitcoins can be more than $20 million. But by the standards of global currency markets, those kind of figures aren\u2019t even a rounding error. The foreign exchange markets see volume of $4 trillion per day. That\u2019s 200,000 times greater than what we\u2019re seeing in the bitcoin market, and it happens on a regular, day-in and day-out basis.On top of that, there are really no traders in bitcoins, since for the time being it\u2019s (almost) impossible to bet that the price of bitcoins will go down. As a result, there\u2019s no reliable source of liquidity in the bitcoin market: there\u2019s no bank or trading house which you can be sure will be there if and when you want to sell your coins.And just to make bitcoins even less attractive, it\u2019s far from clear that bitcoins are even legal. The FBI is on the record as saying that \u201cit is a violation of federal law for individuals\u2026 to create private coin or currency systems to compete with the official coinage and currency of the United States\u201d. And laws against operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business have been used against electronic currencies in the past, and would seem to apply equally to bitcoin.The biggest problem with bitcoins, however, is conceptual: if they succeed, they fail.If millions of people started using bitcoins on a regular basis, the soaring value of bitcoins would actually be disastrous. You\u2019ve heard of hyperinflation: this would be hyperdeflation. Take a gold bar valued at $600,000. At $60 per bitcoin, the value of that bar is 10,000 BTC. But then assume that bitcoins rise in value to $600 apiece, and then to $6,000, and then to $60,000\u200a\u2014\u200aas would have to happen if the fixed number of bitcoins was being used to store hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Then the value of the gold bar would plunge, in bitcoin terms\u200a\u2014\u200ato 1,000 BTC and then 100 BTC and finally just 10 BTC. The same thing would happen to all other goods and services in the world, including your own salary. Everything would be constantly going down in price, if you thought in bitcoin terms.Inflation is bad, but deflation is worse. The reason is that in a deflationary environment, no one spends money\u200a\u2014\u200abecause whatever you want to buy is sure to become cheaper in a few days or weeks. People hoard their cash, and spend it only begrudgingly, on absolute necessities. And they certainly don\u2019t spend it on hiring people\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter how productive their employees might be, they\u2019d still be better off just holding on to that money and not paying anybody anything.The result is an economy which would simply grind to a halt, with massive unemployment and almost no economic activity. In a word, it would be a Depression. In order to have economic growth, you need monetary growth as well\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s something which is impossible to achieve in a bitcoin-based system. Currencies such as the dollar, with a central bank which can print money at will, have succeeded for a reason. As economies grow, the money supply has to be able to grow with them. And that\u2019s why bitcoin can never really succeed over the long term.Rick Falvinge, then, the founder of the Swedish Pirate Party who has invested his entire net worth in bitcoins, might be a multi-millionaire right now, but he is doomed to end up a poor and disappointed man unless he changes his mind. His coins will, at some point, become worthless, rather than turning him into some kind of visionary cyberbillionaire.But that doesn\u2019t mean Falvinge isn\u2019t onto something. There\u2019s a lot to be said for a fast, efficient, peer-to-peer payments system which bypasses centers of authority and which has negligible transaction costs. It just doesn\u2019t need to be its own currency.Historically, the government has subsidized the most common forms of payment \u2013 coins (which are often worth less than they cost to mint), notes, and checks. But it stopped doing that when credit and debit cards came along: Visa and Amex and Mastercard, as well as their web-savvy successors like PayPal and Square, are all run on a for-profit basis by companies looking to make billions of dollars by skimming off a small slice of every transaction.A peer-to-peer payments system, allowing anybody on the internet to pay anybody else on the internet without having to sign up with some financial-services behemoth first, could revolutionize global commerce. It would have to be able to work with any currency, including bitcoin; it wouldn\u2019t need its own unit of account. It would have to be flexible, too: some transactions would be cashlike and irreversible, while others would allow some kind of chargeback.And, most importantly, it would work with, rather than against, today\u2019s established monetary institutions. Yes, it would be disruptive, and could cost them quite a lot of money in terms of lost interchange fees from plastic cards and ATMs. But it wouldn\u2019t aspire to delegitimize them \u2013 quite the opposite. Because it turns out that financial-services companies are a very important part of any democracy.It\u2019s because we place so much trust in banks, after all, that they are forced to take on a great deal of responsibility. Banks and central banks are given an important job to do, are regulated and scrutinized, and can be held responsible for their actions. The population of the entire country, as represented by the government, stands behind bank deposits and promises to honor them even if the bank goes bust. Money, in other words, is a key ingredient in the glue which keeps the social compact together. (What we\u2019re seeing in Cyprus is in large part a demonstration of what happens when that compact starts becoming unglued.)Bitcoin, in that sense, is anti democratic. It\u2019s based on mistrust rather than trust, it refuses to take any responsibility onto itself \u2013 indeed, it doesn\u2019t even have a self to take responsibility onto. It\u2019s nihilistic, and an attractive alternative only to things which are downright bad.And in any event, bitcoin is never going to work as a global payments system. Not only does it suffer from having a slow-growing money supply and a metastasizing transactions file which has to live on every user\u2019s computer, it also encourages destructive computer hacking. The way that the money supply grows, in the bitcoin system, is by people harnessing the power of hundreds or thousands of computers to solve very complicated mathematical tasks, earning bitcoins for doing so along the way. And the easiest and cheapest way of doing that is to do so illegally, by stealth: set up a \u201cbotnet\u201d of hacked computers to do your bidding for you. The incentives, here, are very bad indeed.I do have hope that in the future, someone, somewhere, is going to learn from bitcoin\u2019s mistakes, and build a better system. One which needs less technological expertise to use; one which can grow organically, instead of only at a predetermined rate; one which is designed to be used primarily as a payments mechanism, rather than as a store of value and a unit of speculation.When that happens, cash will start looking decidedly anachronistic, as will wallets. We\u2019ll have everything we need on our phones and in our web browsers, which we\u2019ll be able to use for everything from paying for on-street parking to sending flowers to a friend in New Zealand to buying and selling shares of Google and Apple on the New York Stock Exchange. If we want to keep our money in a bank, we can; if we don\u2019t, that\u2019s fine too. And of course we can keep it in any mix of currencies we want as well.In the very early days of the world wide web, there were attempts to build a payments tag deep into the very architecture of HTML web pages. Those attempts failed, killed by a financial-services industry very suspicious of anything new. And as a result, the web has evolved along an advertising model, where instead of users paying for content, we have advertisers paying for users. But a universal payments system with no friction or interchange costs could change that model dramatically. And it would certainly help to level the playing field \u2013 for good and for bad \u2013 between skilled service-sector workers in countries like India and Russia and China, on the one hand, and their counterparts in countries like Germany, Japan, and the US, on the other.Payments walls, these days, are extremely effective barriers to trade, and if they come down, then we\u2019ll get much more trade, with transactions getting orders of magnitude smaller than what we\u2019re seeing now. The disruption \u2013 and the global wealth creation \u2013 could be truly enormous.It\u2019s impossible to know when \u2013 or even whether \u2013 this is going to happen. Bankers in general, and central bankers in particular, tend to be extremely conservative, and anything which could facilitate money laundering or other illegal transactions is going to have a lot of difficulty getting traction. Bitcoin took off quickly because it never asked for permission; its successor is going to have to be a lot more diplomatic.But whatever it looks like, in the end, we can be sure of one thing: it will owe a very large debt to Satoshi Nakamoto and his audacious attempt to invent a whole new currency. Bitcoin isn\u2019t the future. But it has helped to light the way ahead.", "responses": "9"}, {"title": "Extortion, Police Raids and Secrecy: Inside The Venezuelan Bitcoin Mining\u00a0World", "author_name": "Pirate Beachbum", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/extortion-police-raids-and-secrecy-inside-the-venezuelan-bitcoin-mining-world-6e97a25e7402?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 23, 2018", "readtime": "14 min read", "upvotes": "4.4K", "content": "Extortion, Police Raids and Secrecy: Inside The Venezuelan Bitcoin Mining\u00a0WorldPirate BeachbumBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 23, 2018The Simon Bolivar Hydroelectric Power Station, also known as \u201cEl Guri,\u201d is one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in the\u00a0world.I have never feared for the safety of anyone I have collaborated with on an interview. Many people put their lives and families at risk for what I am about to tell you. This is one of those stories I never expected to write, but I feel compelled to tell it as honestly as possible.I recently published, \u201cGround Zero In the Venezuelan Bitcoin Scene\u201d and randomly received a message from an anonymous Twitter account complimenting the article. They also told me that I missed the real story. Of course I asked, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d They responded alluding to the Venezuelan Government\u2019s involvement in Bitcoin mining. I thought to myself, now there is a story.I sent a message back asking if they would be interested in doing an anonymous interview about this. They got back to me with, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to provide proof of how mining is being abused by the government, but I\u2019ve seen it and know people who have helped set it up.\u201d Of course I was intrigued, but also skeptical. I fired off another message trying to nail down an interview and provided an encrypted email address. I got no response. I saw the account active on Twitter over the next few weeks and assumed they were not interested.Four Weeks Later Enter Mr.\u00a0XI, for the most part, had written the story off. I asked my previous sources in Venezuela if they would be interested in helping me connect with a Venezuelan Bitcoin miner and was met with resistance and shut down on all fronts. I was told, \u201cIt is way too dangerous. Miners are very secretive. No one is willing to talk.\u201dFour weeks later, I randomly received an email from a person claiming to be a Venezuelan Bitcoin miner willing to do an interview. I let them know that I would not ask questions about who they were and assured them I would keep their identity secret. I told them I would refer to them as Mr. X. As we communicated back and forth, the trust factor grew. Despite the language gap, we started piecing together this interview through emails.Venezuelan Police task forces are intimidating and miners are beholden to their\u00a0power.Oftentimes weeks would pass between Mr. X\u2019s emails. Just when I assumed the story was dead, once again my Venezuelan friend\u2019s email would show up in my inbox. I felt selfish responding with more questions and clarifications to his questions. As I read and re-read his emails describing Bitcoin miners being hunted, raided, extorted and arrested by local police and confirmation of the rumors of state level Bitcoin mining going on, I realized the magnitude of risk Mr. X was taking.The back and forth between Mr. X and I went on for almost three months. I feared every day for his safety and still do, as well as the many Venezuelan people putting their lives at risk mining Bitcoin. Who would have ever thought that Bitcoin mining would be a cat and mouse game of trying to outwit and deceive government and police task forces? Then again who would\u2019ve thought that Bitcoin mining would be so lucrative to where families are living off the Bitcoin ecosystem.Twists and\u00a0TurnsDuring our back and forth many new twists and turns within the Venezuelan government unfolded regarding Cryptocurrency. The first was the announcement of a Government Bitcoin mining registry where, yes imagine that, anyone mining Bitcoin is now required to register with the government. Adding to this, the President Maduro is also starting the new Venezuelan Crytpocurrency, the Petro. The coin is claimed to be backed by Venezuelan oil.Interesting background article on the Petro published on\u00a0CCN.comWith so much going on in Venezuela, it was hard to keep this interview completely about Bitcoin mining. Mr. X and I did our best to give the world a real-life perspective on how people are living and surviving off Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining in Venezuela. Due to the delicate nature of the subject matter, I allowed Mr. X the freedom to answer or not answer whatever he wanted. There was no way for me to confirm the facts on his story, but I have every reason to believe the things he says are true.Important Note:One last thing to clarify. Not every Venezuelan can afford Bitcoin mining equipment or Bitcoin for that matter. In no way do we want to paint the picture that everyone in Venezuela is living off Bitcoin mining or Bitcoin. Usually, the Bitcoin miners consist of middle to upper class Venezuelans who have the money to purchase the equipment needed to mine. This puts the impoverished Venezuelans even more at a disadvantage to the rest of their countrymen in this struggling economy.An original photo sent to me during this interview of an S9 Antminer currently used by Mr. X in Venezuela. To put it into perspective, one S9 can feed a\u00a0family.Name:Mr. XWhere are you based out\u00a0of?CaracasWhy do you have to remain anonymous to do this interview?Because mining isn\u2019t regulated yet and many miners in Venezuela have gotten in trouble.Give us a real-life perspective of what Bitcoin mining in Venezuela means to\u00a0you?Right now it means everything because through such activity you can defeat the economic catastrophe that we are facing by bypassing the currency exchange control. My whole attention is on this business.Grocery shopping in Venezuela is a frustrating all day affair with long lines and limited selection.What does it mean for the people of Venezuela? What economic opportunity does it\u00a0bring?You get to feed your family and to be able to save some money for the future among other benefits that comes with a surplus balance.What do people do with the BTC after they mine\u00a0it?If you need local cash right away, then you\u2019ll probably end up selling some btc at localbitcoins.com to deal with your living expenses. If not, then it is stored mainly on coinbase and exchanges. Cold storage is not the culture yet.How do they exchange it and what do they exchange it\u00a0for?Like I said, for local expenses, you will need to drop btc in exchange for Bolivars since there isn\u2019t almost any shop that will take your btc in a regular way. If you are buying more mining gear to increase or keep your business, then you\u2019ll have to exchange btc for bch (only when doing so directly at bitmain\u2019s).Here is an example of a Trezor hard\u00a0wallet.Where do most people store their BTC in Venezuela? (i.e. hard wallet, hot\u00a0wallet)From what I\u2019ve heard and seen, the most popular wallet around here is Coinbase sadly. I always tell people to get a cold storage device such as Nano Ledger or Trezor. People also love Uphold, because it lets them convert BTC to USD fiat that goes directly to their USD bank account.How many people are mining in Venezuela. Guestimate?It usually only happens in the medium-to-high-class range given that people in poverty cannot afford the equipment. In that range, it could be something like one out of five. However, you should note that some Venezuelans are running to set up very big farms in the United States given that they won\u2019t face any extortion up there, and it is only three hours away by air.How many people do you think are doing\u00a0this?Thousands.How do people get the equipment?That is interesting. It seems like the whole equipment supply chain from manufacturer to buyer appeared out of nowhere. That is partly because some people decided not to mine but to buy and sell the equipment. There is enough equipment to where friends are usually talking about deals from other people on mining gear.Mr. X says there is no short supply of Bitcoin mining equipment making its way into Venezuela.Does the government monitor the import of equipment?Supposedly they do, but then I don\u2019t get how all the equipment gets here. I heard that when it comes directly from China in containers they seize it.Describe the black market for Bitcoin mining equipment?First of all you don\u2019t talk about it with anyone. You only talk about it with the people you trust. You can join the market pretty fast if you want to.How are people learning to mine Bitcoin and able to set themselves up to make\u00a0money?An example of a BTC mining farm in China (We couldn\u2019t get a photo of a VZ\u00a0farm).Interesting too. There is always someone smart enough to learn how to connect the equipment and most of the time he ends up being \u201cthe guy.\u201d \u201cI know a guy who did all that for me and charged me $X\u201d The thing is you don\u2019t want strangers in your mining facility because anything could lead you to the extortion party. Even the guy who sets you up with the cooling system could betray you later that night when drinking a beer with his felonious neighbor at their suburb hometown.How many underground mining farms do you think there\u00a0are?There\u2019s no way to tell but easily in the thousands and possibly over one hundred thousand. The word on the street is that basically any physical space with an electric service is a hosting space.How much money are they making from these small, medium and large operations?They are making a lot of money, and the big farms are making even more money given that the electricity cost is ridiculously cheap.Powering up Caracas at night is no easy task. 74% of Venezuelan electricity comes from renewable energy like hydro electric power which is cheap to\u00a0produce.Describe the electricity cost. Make it so people can understand it to\u00a0USD?0.0000125$ per kW/h (no those are not Satoshis, those are dollars rated at black market)How much can one computer mining provide for a family in terms of food and necessities?In terms of food you will gain weight. In terms of necessities you could afford almost anything you need to live according to your life status. Insurance, food, tuition, utilities and almost any regular expense becomes affordable. Even for those whose income is in Bolivars utilities are meaningless.What are your thoughts on the new law that requires miners to register with the government?It is interesting enacting such law, but we must wait to see how it goes. I mean until the humanitarian problems that we live in are solved, the corruptive behavior isn\u2019t going anywhere. People are not allowed to mine gold or diamonds from the surface, so why would it be any different with digital treasures?Interesting article on the miner registration program pubished on bitcoinist.comWhat do you think the governments real goal\u00a0is?To find out who is mining and how much you are making.Do you think they will use this info to extort or take equipment?I hope not.How many people are going to follow this\u00a0rule?I guess the bravest will jump in first while the rest of the audience waits to see how it goes.What are the consequences for getting caught\u00a0mining?Not nice. Extortion, beating, detention.Interesting story of VZ Bitcoin miners arrested for \u201cElectricity Theft.\u201dThere are stories of the government confiscating computers and mining equipment from people. Tell us about\u00a0this.Yes, sometimes the police squad that visits your place decides to seize your mining equipment, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.What do they do with the equipment?Rumor has it they install them on government facilities.It is not a secret the Venezuelan government is rumored to be using the confiscated mining equipment to run their own farms and making the people who they took it from to set it up. Tell us about these secret operations?This is the worst case scenario, but I\u2019ve heard multiple stories like this. If for some reason they don\u2019t like you at all during the raid, they would confiscate your equipment and have you install it for them. They even \u201chire\u201d you as an infiltrator and they make you rat out other miners.How does the government and police find\u00a0miners?There is an intelligence police division exclusively for mining hunting. They accomplish so by monitoring electric power consumption looking for irregular situations.Venezuelan police shooting tear gas into crowds of protesters last year in\u00a0Caracas.What kind of money do miners get extorted for by the\u00a0police?I\u2019ve heard $1,000 per machine but again, it depends. I guess the more Bitcoin\u2019s value grows, the more they will ask.Where does this money\u00a0go?I can\u2019t tell you for sure, but my guess is every squad member will take a piece including big bosses.What if they resist and say,\u00a0NO?I wouldn\u2019t advise so. Probably you\u2019ll get both arrested and beaten up.President Maduro in full regalia making a speech with his top\u00a0brass.Comment on the state level mining going on. No one wants to talk about it, but the fact is we all know this is going\u00a0onRumor has it the capital city military\u2019s headquarters is full of Antminers.How is the internet connection in Venezuela and how does this affect\u00a0mining?Besides having to deal with one of the slowest internet speeds in the world, we have to live with the fact that it isn\u2019t even stable.Do people have to conceal their IP\u2019s or online activity if they are\u00a0mining?They better.At what lengths do people go to conceal and hide their mining activity?Every length of mining activity must be concealed.How did you learn to\u00a0mine?Same way you learn to do anything in this lifetime: google, YouTube, etc.One of Mr. X\u2019s S9 Antminers.What equipment do you\u00a0run?I only do Bitcoin mining. I personally don\u2019t care about any other cryptocurrency. For me a couple of S9s are enough.What kind of $$ would you say something like this might\u00a0produce?The more you invest, the more you will earn, but only one gear\u2019s production is enough to live from.Where can you point others to learn or get equipment?Bitcointalk.org and bitmain.comHow much do you have invested?Around $7,000How much do the real big operations have invested?More than $100,000 and some more than that.Explain how the electricity works down there and how much people\u00a0pay?When it comes to utilities, Venezuelans are gifted in terms of price. Electric power is cheaper than water, if I tell you how much a full house\u2019s bill is, you wouldn\u2019t believe me.localbitcoins.comHow does LocalBitcoins.com come into play with all of\u00a0this?For miners it\u2019s a great tool because you can drop some of your btc earnings in exchange of local currency.What tips can you give fellow miners in Venezuela to stay under cover and evade detection?Don\u2019t do more than two workers per location.You mentioned the big miners live like royalty. Explain what you mean by this so others can understandTheir income in BTC or any other cryptocurrency is huge in terms of Bolivars meaning that immediately you become a high class citizen.How do they stay under the\u00a0radar?By not squandering it on the streets.What is the BTC ecosystem like down there now that people are accumulating more and more\u00a0BTC?Almost everyone middle class and up are talking about BTC. Even military officers are using Coinbase to buy in with fiat and to store their BTC.A basket full of stacks of Bolivars like this will barely buy you\u00a0lunch.Describe the black market exchanging of\u00a0BTC.You don\u2019t see that much btc offering for sell in black market. I guess people are just HODLing but once in awhile you hear about a big sell offer e.g. 30 btc to be paid in usd cash. That is usually the police looking for liquidity.What do you think about the new government Petro CryptoCurrency?Maybe they are trying to bypass the dollar mafia by selling oil in a different currency, but we all know what happens to every country who has attempted so. Ask the middle east.Interesting background article on the Petro published on\u00a0CCN.comFrom what I understand it is a commodity-tether since its value is pegged to an oil\u2019s barrel. So even if it gets listed on the main exchanges, how do you freeze the price? Tethers works as a market base so in any case bitcoin must be traded against Petro. So 1 BTC ~ 300 Petros\u00a0?Explain who is behind\u00a0it?Maybe Russia and China are doing a crypto experiment with Venezuela which they didn\u2019t dare to do with their own nations.Will the Venezuelan people support\u00a0this?It comes from the same government that destroyed the former currency so it doesn\u2019t start well but at the same time people is looking desperately for a local alternative currency.Why do you think it will fail like the\u00a0bolivar?Another background article on the Petro published by Cointelegraph.comBecause our nation\u2019s wealth is mostly use for geo-political purposes and any country can\u2019t afford both challenging the United States hegemony and enjoying inside welfare.What other ways are Venezuelans investing in BTC besides\u00a0mining?They are buying through localbitcoins.com and some other exchanges. They are a few local one\u2019s where you can buy in with Bolivars.What kind of tips or warnings can you give these\u00a0people?Read and learn everything you need to know about this technology so no one can scam you.What risk did you put yourself into doing this interview?Not as much as if I join a political opposition party.What do you want the world to know about Venezuela?We are great and we are going to prove it. Geography has given us everything. We are at the north of the south and one of the richest countries at the same time (in natural resources).How can we help people in Venezuela?By getting a good quality bitcoin content in spanish and allowing us to join outside exchanges.How do you feel about the future if things remain the same down\u00a0there?What is Cuba? What is Syria?Venezuela faces many tougher challenges than Bitcoin mining. Government protests like this are\u00a0common.ConclusionAfter finishing this interview, I let it simmer for a few weeks. There was a part of me that did not want to publish it. As I edited the text, I felt like I was reading a fiction novel. Most importantly I did not want to create any problems for anyone involved. I sent Mr. X one last email with the entire transcript of this interview. I told him the only way for us to tell this story is to TELL THE STORY! I asked him to read through it and think long and hard about everything we had written. I gave him one last chance to make any final edits and the option to shit-can the story all together if he pleased.A few days later, Mr. X got back to me. He made a few small tweaks and said everything looked good. I will never know Mr. X\u2019s identity nor do I care. I do not believe he is the same anonymous Twitter profile that originally contacted me. Mr. X\u2019s english and typing skills were a lot better. This is the part of the story that will always remain a mystery to me. My only hope is that I did him and the Venezuelan Bitcoin miners justice in writing this story. Viva la resistance!Special thanks to Mr. X and all the people who helped make this story happen.

It\u2019s Going After the\u00a0DollarTed LivingstonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 20Disclosure: I have no inside knowledge of Facebook\u2019s plans. This post is based on 10 years of experience in messaging and crypto. We think Facebook could be on a path to replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency. This post outlines how that might happen. We hope this post leads to a broader discussion on the impact Facebook and crypto could have on society, and what we might do about itMark Zuckerberg recently wrote a long post outlining Facebook\u2019s shift from open sharing to private communications. It makes sense. People are waking up to the anxiety and depression caused by open sharing and are moving to smaller and more intimate online spaces instead. Facebook has no choice but to change course.But this shift begs one important question: how will Facebook make money?Making Money with Private CommunicationsSocial apps have historically made money by adding public broadcasting, putting those broadcasts into a feed, and then putting ads into that feed. Facebook has the news feed, Snapchat has stories, and Twitter has the timeline.We never added broadcasting to our chat app Kik. We worried it would encourage people to focus on putting on their best show, instead of just being their true self. Today Kik is used by millions of people who spend more time in Kik than Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram. People love hanging out in a world free of broadcasts, feeds, and likes. But without a feed to put ads in we\u2019ve had to think of other ways to make money.After ten years of searching the only good way we\u2019ve found is with a cryptocurrency. By creating a cryptocurrency that is used as a medium of exchange in our app we can create something valuable like Bitcoin or Ether. This allows both us and our users to make money by selling pieces of the currency as the economy grows and the currency becomes more valuable.In 2017 we launched Kin, a cryptocurrency for the digital world. We created 10 trillion Kin tokens. We sold 1 trillion tokens for $100 million, we allocated 3 trillion tokens for Kik, and we allocated 6 trillion tokens for other app developers who wanted to use Kin as a new way to make money too. Last month 80,000 people spent Kin across 40 different apps. Kin is one of the most used cryptocurrencies in the world.We now know that Facebook is going to launch their own cryptocurrency too. But instead of creating a currency for the digital world, it looks like Facebook is going after something much bigger. It looks like they are going to create a currency for the physical world. And they have a proven playbook to get people to use it.The WeChat\u00a0PlaybookIn 2014 I published a post The Race to Become the WeChat of the West. Nine months later WeChat invested 50 million dollars into Kik at a billion dollar valuation. The WeChat playbook is clear:1. Make it compelling for people to bring their money into the messenger2. Make it easy for them to move their money around3. Create more and more reasons for them to keep their money inside the messengerIn 2014 WeChat used the cultural phenomenon of red envelopes to get people to bring their money into WeChat. Instead of waiting to hand out envelopes of cash at special occasions, people could send virtual envelopes right inside their chats. Soon millions of people were bringing their money into WeChat, putting them into virtual red envelopes, and sending them all over the country.WeChat allowed people to take their money out at any time, but they also added more and more reasons for people to keep their money inside: paying hydro bills, buying food, booking vacations, and more. Soon no one was taking their money out.Today 900 million people use WeChat for daily transactions, totaling nearly $10 trillion of payments per year. In China WeChat replaced cash.Executing the\u00a0PlaybookFacebook is about to have all the pieces needed to execute the three step WeChat playbook.First, the compelling need: remittances.Every year people working in foreign countries send hundreds of billions of dollars home to family and friends. Today this process is slow, expensive, and complicated, with an average fee of $14 to send just $200. If Facebook could offer people a way to send money home for free it would be a game changer for tens of millions of people.Second, moving money: the blockchain.One of the key breakthroughs of the blockchain is that people can move money digitally without needing to trust a third party. This was impossible before the blockchain. This allows Facebook to enable payment functionality in their apps without needing to become a bank. So instead of working with regulators like WeChat did in China, Facebook will be able to roll out a global financial system without needing to go through the time intensive process of working with banking regulators country by country.Third, keeping money inside the system: the platform.By adding the ability to remit money inside their apps, and by using the blockchain to power those remittances, Facebook can quickly roll out a ten times cheaper solution to a problem experienced by tens of millions of people. But what will people do when they receive those remittances?Initially they will cash them out for life\u2019s daily expenses. But just like what WeChat did in China, Facebook will add more and more ways to spend money directly inside their apps: paying utility bills, getting food at restaurants, topping up phone minutes, and more. New ways of spending money through the app will become simpler and more powerful than the previous alternatives. Soon enough there will be no reason for anyone to take their money out.How It Could Play\u00a0OutRight now we already know quite a few things about Facebook\u2019s plans. We know they plan to offer stablecoin powered remittances. We know they plan to start with Whatsapp. We know they plan to start in India.This makes perfect sense. India receives more remittances each year than any other country in the world. Whatsapp is the most popular app in India. And a stablecoin allows money to move on the blockchain without the risk of it becoming more or less valuable than the local fiat currency.So what could come next?Let\u2019s call Facebook\u2019s stablecoin \u201cFacecoin\u201d. Facebook could allow people to buy Facecoins right inside of Whatsapp and send them home to family and friends in India for free. People in India could convert their Facecoins into cash, but Facebook could create more and more reasons to just spend Facecoins using Whatsapp. Just as WeChat replaced cash in China, Facebook could soon replace cash in India.As India gains momentum Facebook could look to expand. First into other countries where remittances are popular. Perhaps the Philippines and Egypt, followed by Mexico and Vietnam. To get adoption in more developed countries Facebook could combine Whatsapp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger together, allowing Facecoins to move across all three services. Facecoins could start to replace cash in each of those countries, becoming the primary currency for billions of people.The End of the\u00a0DollarPeople who understand crypto might argue that this doesn\u2019t matter. That because the value of a Facecoin is pegged to the value of a dollar, they are essentially just dollars that run on a blockchain. To me this is the most important part. Not that long ago the world\u2019s reserve currency was gold, where the value of a dollar was pegged to the value of gold. But then one day the US decided to unpeg the dollar from gold, paving the way for the dollar to replace gold as the world\u2019s reserve currency. So here is my question: what will stop Facebook from doing the same?", "responses": "44"}, {"title": "The Bullish Case for Bitcoin (part 2 of\u00a04)", "author_name": "Vijay Boyapati", "link": "https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-part-2-of-4-c918977c40f6?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 27, 2018", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "4.3K", "content": "The Bullish Case for Bitcoin (part 2 of\u00a04)The attributes of a good store of\u00a0valueVijay BoyapatiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 27, 2018When stores of value compete against each other, it is the specific attributes that make a good store of value that allows one to out-compete another at the margin and increase demand for it over time. While many goods have been used as stores of value or \u201cproto-money\u201d, certain attributes emerged that were particularly demanded and allowed goods with these attributes to out-compete others. An ideal store of value will be:Durable: the good must not be perishable or easily destroyed. Thus wheat is not an ideal store of valuePortable: the good must be easy to transport and store, making it possible to secure it against loss or theft and allowing it to facilitate long-distance trade. A cow is thus less ideal than a gold bracelet.Fungible: one specimen of the good should be interchangeable with another of equal quantity. Without fungibility, the coincidence of wants problem remains unsolved. Thus gold is better than diamonds, which are irregular in shape and quality.Verifiable: the good must be easy to quickly identify and verify as authentic. Easy verification increases the confidence of its recipient in trade and increases the likelihood a trade will be consummated.Divisible: the good must be easy to subdivide. While this attribute was less important in early societies where trade was infrequent, it became more important as trade flourished and the quantities exchanged became smaller and more precise.Scarce: As Nick Szabo termed it, a monetary good must have \u201cunforgeable costliness\u201d. In other words, the good must not be abundant or easy to either obtain or produce in quantity. Scarcity is perhaps the most important attribute of a store of value as it taps into the innate human desire to collect that which is rare. It is the source of the original value of the store of value.Established history: the longer the good is perceived to have been valuable by society, the greater its appeal as a store of value. A long-established store of value will be hard to displace by a new upstart except by force of conquest or if the arriviste is endowed with a significant advantage among the other attributes listed above.Censorship-resistant: a new attribute, which has become increasingly important in our modern, digital society with pervasive surveillance, is censorship-resistance. That is, how difficult is it for an external party such as a corporation or state to prevent the owner of the good from keeping and using it. Goods that are censorship-resistant are ideal to those living under regimes that are trying to enforce capital controls or to outlaw various forms of peaceful trade.The table below grades Bitcoin, gold and fiat money (such as dollars) against the attributes listed above and is followed by an explanation of each grade:Durability:Gold is the undisputed King of durability. The vast majority of gold that has ever been mined or minted, including the gold of the Pharaohs, remains extant today and will likely be available a thousand years hence. Gold coins that were used as money in antiquity still maintain significant value today. Fiat currency and bitcoins are fundamentally digital records that may take physical form (such as paper bills). Thus it is not their physical manifestation whose durability should be considered (since a tattered dollar bill may be exchanged for a new one), but the durability of the institution that issues them. In the case of fiat currencies, many governments have come and gone over the centuries, and their currencies disappeared with them. The Papiermark, Rentenmark and Reichsmark of the Weimar Republic no longer have value because the institution that issued them no longer exists. If history is a guide, it would be folly to consider fiat currencies durable in the long term\u200a\u2014\u200athe US dollar and British Pound are relative anomalies in this regard. Bitcoins, having no issuing authority, may be considered durable so long as the network that secures them remains in place. Given that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, it is too early to draw strong conclusions about its durability. However, there are encouraging signs that, despite prominent instances of nation-states attempting to regulate Bitcoin and years of attacks by hackers, the network has continued to function, displaying a remarkable degree of \u201canti-fragility\u201d.Portability:Bitcoins are the most portable store of value ever used by man. Private keys representing hundreds of millions of dollars can be stored on a tiny USB drive and easily carried anywhere. Furthermore, equally valuable sums can be transmitted between people on opposite ends of the earth near instantly. Fiat currencies, being fundamentally digital are also highly portable. However, government regulations and capital controls mean that large transfers of value usually take days or may not be possible at all. Cash can be used to avoid capital controls, but then the risk of storage and cost of transportation become significant. Gold, being physical in form and incredibly dense, is by far the least portable. It is no wonder that the majority of bullion is never transported. When bullion is transferred between a buyer and a seller it is typically only the title to the gold that is transferred, not the physical bullion itself. Transmitting physical gold across large distances is costly, risky and time-consuming.Fungibility:Gold provides the standard for fungibility. When melted down, an ounce of gold is essentially indistinguishable from any other ounce, and gold has always traded this way on the market. Fiat currencies, on the other hand, are only as fungible as the issuing institutions allow them to be. While it may be the case that a fiat banknote is usually treated like any other by merchants accepting them, there are instances where large-denomination notes have been treated differently to small ones. For instance, India\u2019s government, in an attempt to stamp out India\u2019s untaxed gray market, completely demonetized their 500 and 1000 rupee banknotes. The demonetization caused 500 and 1000 rupee notes to trade at a discount to their face value, making them no longer truly fungible with their lower denomination sibling notes. Bitcoins are fungible at the network level, meaning that every bitcoin, when transmitted, is treated the same on the Bitcoin network. However, because bitcoins are traceable on the blockchain, a particular bitcoin may become tainted by its use in illicit trade and merchants or exchanges may be compelled not to accept such tainted bitcoins. Without improvements to the privacy and anonymity of Bitcoin\u2019s network protocol, bitcoins cannot be considered as fungible as gold.Verifiability:For most intents and purposes, both fiat currencies and gold are fairly easy to verify for authenticity. However, despite providing features on their banknotes to prevent counterfeiting, nation-states and their citizens still face the potential to be duped by counterfeit bills. Gold is also not immune from being counterfeited. Sophisticated criminals have used gold-plated tungsten as a way of fooling gold investors into paying for false gold. Bitcoins, on the other hand, can be verified with mathematical certainty. Using cryptographic signatures, the owner of a bitcoin can publicly prove she owns the bitcoins she says she does.Divisibility:Bitcoins can be divided down to a hundred millionth of a bitcoin and transmitted at such infinitesimal amounts (network fees can, however, make transmission of tiny amounts uneconomic). Fiat currencies are typically divisible down to pocket change, which has little purchasing power, making fiat divisible enough in practice. Gold, while physically divisible, becomes difficult to use when divided into small enough quantities that it could be useful for lower-value day-to-day trade.Scarcity:The attribute that most clearly distinguishes Bitcoin from fiat currencies and gold is its predetermined scarcity. By design, at most 21 million bitcoins can ever be created. This gives the owner of bitcoins a known percentage of the total possible supply. For instance, an owner of 10 bitcoins would know that at most 2.1 million people on earth (less than 0.03% of the world\u2019s population) could ever have as many bitcoins as they had. Gold, while remaining quite scarce through history, is not immune to increases in supply. If it were ever the case that a new method of mining or acquiring gold became economic, the supply of gold could rise dramatically (examples include sea-floor or asteroid mining). Finally, fiat currencies, while only a relatively recent invention of history, have proven to be prone to constant increases in supply. Nations-states have shown a persistent proclivity to inflate their money supply to solve short-term political problems. The inflationary tendencies of governments across the world leave the owner of a fiat currency with the likelihood that their savings will diminish in value over time.Established history:No monetary good has a history as long and storied as gold, which has been valued for as long as human civilization has existed. Coins minted in the distant days of antiquity still maintain significant value today. The same cannot be said of fiat currencies, which are a relatively recent anomaly of history. From their inception, fiat currencies have had a near-universal tendency toward eventual worthlessness. The use of inflation as an insidious means of invisibly taxing a citizenry has been a temptation that few states in history have been able to resist. If the 20th century, in which fiat monies came to dominate the global monetary order, established any economic truth, it is that fiat money cannot be trusted to maintain its value over the long or even medium term. Bitcoin, despite its short existence, has weathered enough trials in the market that there is a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon. Furthermore, the Lindy effect suggests that the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society\u2019s confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. In other words, the societal trust of a new monetary good is asymptotic in nature, as is illustrated in the graph below:If Bitcoin exists for 20 years, there will be near-universal confidence that it will be available forever, much as people believe the Internet is a permanent feature of the modern world.Censorship resistance:One of the most significant sources of early demand for bitcoins was their use in the illicit drug trade. Many subsequently surmised, mistakenly, that the primary demand for bitcoins was due to their ostensible anonymity. Bitcoin, however, is far from an anonymous currency; every transaction transmitted on the Bitcoin network is forever recorded on a public blockchain. The historical record of transactions allows for later forensic analysis to identify the source of a flow of funds. It was such an analysis that led to the apprehending of a perpetrator of the infamous MtGox heist. While it is true that a sufficiently careful and diligent person can conceal their identity when using Bitcoin, this is not why Bitcoin was so popular for trading drugs. The key attribute that makes Bitcoin valuable for proscribed activities is that it is \u201cpermissionless\u201d at the network level. When bitcoins are transmitted on the Bitcoin network, there is no human intervention deciding whether the transaction should be allowed. As a distributed peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin is, by its very nature, designed to be censorship-resistant. This is in stark contrast to the fiat banking system, where states regulate banks and the other gatekeepers of money transmission to report and prevent outlawed uses of monetary goods. A classic example of regulated money transmission is capital controls. A wealthy millionaire, for instance, may find it very hard to transfer their wealth to a new domicile if they wish to flee an oppressive regime. Although gold is not issued by states, its physical nature makes it difficult to transmit at distance, making it far more susceptible to state regulation than Bitcoin. India\u2019s Gold Control Act is an example of such regulation.Bitcoin excels across the majority of attributes listed above, allowing it to outcompete modern and ancient monetary goods at the margin and providing a strong incentive for its increasing adoption. In particular, the potent combination of censorship resistance and absolute scarcity has been a powerful motivator for wealthy investors to allocate a portion of their wealth to the nascent asset class.Part 3\u2026Part 3 of this article will be published tomorrow and linked from Twitter (follow me). In part 3, I will cover the evolution of money, how a monetary good transitions from a store of value to a medium of exchange and where Bitcoin is in its evolution to a fully fledged global money.Go back to part 1.TranslationsThis article has been translated into:Korean by Hyungmok joh.Traditional Chinese by Flora Sun.Simplified Chinese by Flora Sun.Espa\u00f1ol by Carlos Beltr\u00e1n with editing by I\u00f1igo.Nederlandse by Wim.Fran\u00e7aise by Greg Guittard.Portugu\u00eas by Allex Fer.\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439/Russian by CoinSpot.Bulgarian by Bo Mirchev.", "responses": "15"}, {"title": "What is Bitcoin Mining\u00a0Pool?", "author_name": "Bitxoxo", "link": "https://medium.com/@bitxoxobitcoin/what-is-bitcoin-mining-pool-d1e9f2865344?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 11, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "1.4K", "content": "What is Bitcoin Mining\u00a0Pool?BitxoxoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 11, 2018The recent rate of people increasing interest in cryptocurrency has gone very high within a year.

It is so different from our existing institutions that we should be skeptical and ask as many hard, pressing questions as we can before trusting it with any economic value. Some answers will only reveal themselves with time (or Lindy, as the cool kids say), but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t come up with theories or frameworks. One such framework that has helped me a lot in understanding bitcoin is social contract theory.First, fiat money is the result of a social contract: The people give the state control over the supply and other vital functions of money. The state, in turn, uses that power to manage the economy, redistribute wealth, and fight crime. But many don\u2019t realize that bitcoin works through a social contract as well.The social layer and its rules are the heart of\u00a0bitcoin.And that social contract framework can be used to answer some essential questions: Why did bitcoin come into existence? Who decided its properties? Who controls it today? Can a critical bug kill bitcoin?Social Contract\u00a0TheorySocial contract theory starts with a thought experiment: It assumes a hypothetical state of nature full of violence, that is unbearable for people to live in. Driven by a desire to improve their situation, they come together and collectively agree to empower Leviathan, the sovereign government, to protect them. Each gives up some of their freedom (to, you know, steal, and murder and stuff) while the Leviathan is granted the power to create laws, enforce them, and protect the people from violence.But the theory is not constrained to the relationship between the people and the state. We can apply the same thought experiment to economics. If enough people are unhappy with the barter economy, they can collectively agree to use money, credit, or something else to improve the quality of their trading.The process of money or credit happens implicitly. Every person asks the question of what outcomes they prefer and how they can achieve them. If many people in a society want the same outcome, we can call the result a \u201cSchelling point\u201d or social contract.Money as a Social\u00a0ContractThroughout history, governments that controlled money have abused their power in all kinds of ways: They confiscated accounts, blocked certain people or groups from transacting, and printed more money and inflated the supply\u2014sometimes to the point of hyperinflation.Whenever governments crossed a line in abusing their power, the people lost trust in the social contract that granted the government this power. They returned to an agreement that preserved most of the benefits (having a common medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account) without the worst of problems (government abuse): a commodity money.Money presents an important lesson: The larger and more valuable a social institution gets, the more it attracts others to seek control over\u00a0it.The problem with the new commodity money contract, however, was that it turned out equally unstable. Let\u2019s take, for example, the gold standard. Physical gold was too inconvenient to divide, move, and store. So people quickly invented another layer on top of it and traded with representative paper money, while the physical gold no longer moved. Because paper money is easy to produce, there had to be a trusted central party to watch over the supply. From there it was a small step for governments to decouple the value of the paper money from the underlying commodity to establish fiat money once again.Herein lies a valuable lesson: You can agree you\u2019re in a terrible situation and you can agree you want to change it, but the resulting social contract is only as strong as it is credible. Without a stable institution to enforce it, a contract loses the trust of the people and falls apart.The Rules of\u00a0BitcoinWhen Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin, he did not invent a new social contract. Satoshi did something else\u2014he leveraged technology to solve many problems of past implementations and implemented the old contract in a new and better way. He settled on the following rules:Only the owner of a coin can produce the signature to spend it (confiscation resistance)Anyone can transact and store value in bitcoin without permission (censorship resistance)There will only be 21 million bitcoins, issued on a predictable schedule (inflation resistance)All users should be able to verify the rules of bitcoin (counterfeit resistance)Bitcoin as a New Form of Social InstitutionMoney presents an important lesson: The larger and more valuable a social institution gets, the more it attracts others to seek control over it. So the institution needs protection, which it can only get from that other powerful entity: the state. Over time, protection turns into control and then into abuse. When the social institution loses its benefit for the people, it is replaced by a new institution, and the cycle starts over again.Satoshi attempted to break this vicious cycle in two ways: First, instead of getting its security from a powerful central party (like a government), bitcoin creates a hypercompetitive market for its own protection. It turns security into a commodity and the security providers (miners) into toothless commodity producers. And, second, Satoshi found a way for these competing security providers to come to consensus over who owns what at any given time.The bitcoin protocol automates the contract agreed upon on the social layer, while the social layer determines the rules of bitcoin, based on the consensus of its users. They are symbiotic: Neither of them would be sufficient without the other. The social layer and its rules are the heart of bitcoin. But the protocol layer makes them enforceable for the first time, while simultaneously making the social contract more credible to outsiders.Seeing bitcoin as a social contract, enabled and automated by a technical layer, has many benefits. And it can help us answer the philosophical questions about bitcoin.Who Can Change the Rules of\u00a0Bitcoin?The rules of the contract are decided and renegotiated continuously on the social layer. The bitcoin protocol implementation only automates them. Bitcoin, as a computer network, comes into existence when many people run bitcoin implementations on their computers that follow the same set of rules (think of them as speaking the same language).You stay in the network as long as you follow the same set of rules as everyone else. If I were to change the rules of bitcoin unilaterally on my local computer, it would not affect the rest of the network\u2014it only gets me evicted because we no longer understand each other (I now speak a different language).The only way to change the rules of bitcoin is to propose a change to the social contract. Every such proposal has to be voluntarily accepted by other people in the network because it only becomes a rule if enough people actively include it in their local ruleset. Convincing millions of people is an incredible amount of (grassroots) work and practically rules out any contentious changes, which could never get broad social consensus. This is why the bitcoin network can be upgraded in ways that reflect the wish of its members but is at the same time incredibly resilient to changes from bad actors.Can a Software Bug Kill\u00a0Bitcoin?In September 2018, a software bug arose in the most popular implementation (local ruleset) of bitcoin. The bug had two potential attack vectors: It allowed an attacker to shut down other people\u2019s bitcoin clients (making it so they could no longer verify the rules, breaking the counterfeit resistance) and to potentially spend the same bitcoin twice (breaking the rule of inflation resistance).Bitcoin developers quickly fixed the bug by providing the network an updated ruleset that closed these possible attack angles. While the bug was found in time and was never exploited by an attacker, it left some people asking: How much damage could it have done? Would the bitcoin network have to live with the inflation once it happened, effectively breaking the trust in that rule?Social contract theory can answer that with a resounding \u201cno.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s rules are made on the social layer, and the software only automates it. Where the social contract and the protocol layer diverge, the protocol layer is wrong\u2014always. A failure of the protocol layer to temporarily enforce the rules of the contract has no permanent bearing on the validity of the contract itself.The bitcoin token itself has no value. The value exists purely on the social\u00a0layer.Instead, here is what would have happened: The potential bug exploit would have been mended by reorganizing the blockchain in a way that undoes the damage done by the attacker. That would have split the bitcoin network into two networks, each having their own token: one with the bug and one without it. Every bitcoin owner would have an equal number of tokens in each network, but the value of these tokens would be exclusively determined by the market, i.e., how much the next person was willing to pay for them.At this point, it\u2019s important to understand that the bitcoin token itself has no value; it\u2019s nothing more than a number in a ledger. The value exists purely on the social layer. Hence, it is also social consensus that decides which of the two tokens, going forward, would receive economic support. It\u2019s likely that all economic value would migrate to the new, mended network.When the bitcoin software successfully automates the rules of the social contract, the two layers are synchronized. And when the software temporarily goes out of sync, it always has the social contract as a guiding beacon of light to return to. This most recent bug will not have been the last. Social contract theory gives us assurance that bugs can happen and don\u2019t threaten the social institution of bitcoin.Do Bitcoin Forks Endanger the No-Inflation Rule?Another famous philosophical question centers around the concept of \u201cforks.\u201d Since bitcoin\u2019s software is open-source (allowing users to verify that their ruleset does what it says), anyone can copy it and make changes. That is called \u201cforking.\u201d But, as established earlier, these changes are only made to the protocol layer, not the social layer. Without changing rules on the social layer first, the only result from forking bitcoin is that you evict yourself from the network.If you wanted to fork bitcoin\u2014and not have the new network die immediately\u2014you would have to fork the social contract first. You would need to convince as many people as possible that your ruleset is better for them, so they update their rules together with yours. These kinds of forks are scarce and hard to pull off because they require the buy-in of thousands of people. Using this process to create value is akin to running a presidential campaign as a financial investment.Again, the key is in understanding that all value for tokens is purely a social construct. The tokens do not have any value; they receive their value from social consensus. Forking the protocol doesn\u2019t equal forking the social contract, so the new token is worthless by default. In the rare case that the social contract itself splits (like when bitcoin cash split off from bitcoin), you end up with two weaker social contracts\u2014each agreed to by fewer people than the old one.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Completing our transition to becoming a digital currency company (not just a Bitcoin\u00a0company)", "author_name": "Brian Armstrong", "link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/completing-our-transition-to-becoming-a-digital-currency-company-not-just-a-bitcoin-company-6bcc44ca40ee?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 2, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "1K", "content": "Completing our transition to becoming a digital currency company (not just a Bitcoin\u00a0company)Brian ArmstrongBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 2, 2017As we kick off 2017, I think it\u2019s important for Coinbase and GDAX to continue supporting more crypto currencies. We are no longer just a Bitcoin company. We are a digital currency company.This past year, we started the process by adding support for Ethereum. This was a major step. In 2017, you\u2019ll see us continue that trend.To be clear, I love Bitcoin and it is not going anywhere. It appears to be the reserve currency of the digital currency space\u200a\u2014\u200aa sort of digital gold if you will. It is an asset class that people flee to in times of trouble, most suitable for large, slow transfers, with a more conservative roadmap to evolve the protocol. What it has not become is a scalable payment network (with lower fees, faster confirmation times, and higher throughput). I\u2019m skeptical that it will be able to make this leap (even with new developments in the pipeline). Federated protocols seem to evolve slowly. This initially saddened me because I think an open payment network is where the greatest potential lies for digital currency to improve the world (hence our mission at Coinbase: to create an open financial system for the world). But I\u2019ve come to accept that Bitcoin may not fill this role, and that is ok. It is still a very valuable technology in the world as an asset class, and that is perfectly fine.Bitcoin may surprise me and scale (I hope it does). As we wait to see, an opportunity has emerged for other protocols to fill the payment network gap. Ethereum seems the most likely candidate for this at the moment (although things change rapidly in digital currency space). It continues to attract a number of good engineers to work on the protocol and build applications (an important leading indicator) and if proof-of-stake is successful this year, it will be a major computer science breakthrough providing a sustainable advantage. ICOs (people raising money on the blockchain) show no signs of slowing down, and Ethereum makes it very easy to issue new tokens. I think new tokens built on top of Ethereum will find all sorts of use cases, from virtual worlds to prediction markets.Bitcoin\u2019s guaranteed scarcity is an attractive property from an investment point of view (another gold like characteristic). Ethereum has yet to determine its inflation policy, but it seems to be leaning toward some moderate inflation policy (2\u20133% a year). This is another indicator to me that you\u2019ll see Bitcoin continue to flourish as an asset class (and hold its value) while Ethereum may emerge as the preferred option for payment networks and custom tokens.It\u2019s incredibly difficult to predict the future and the digital currency industry is no exception (take the above for what it is, pure speculation). Rapid change seems to be the only certainty. For this reason, you\u2019ll see Coinbase and GDAX continue to support more crypto-currencies in 2017. As the most popular retail exchange (Coinbase) and institutional exchange in the U.S. (GDAX), we want to make it easy for people to use all types of digital currencies. Our goal going forward is to not play favorites, or support one digital currency more than any other, but simply to make it easy for customers to buy and sell whatever digital currencies they want. In this way, we can help support growth of the entire digital currency industry.Look for more digital currency options to be added in\u00a02017.I think the world is still largely unaware that digital currency has been growing ~2.5x every year. If this trend continues (and I see no reason to believe otherwise) the future is very bright indeed. I\u2019m looking forward to an exciting and productive 2017.", "responses": "33"}, {"title": "The Bitcoin vs Visa Electricity Consumption Fallacy", "author_name": "Carlos Domingo", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/the-bitcoin-vs-visa-electricity-consumption-fallacy-8cf194987a50?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 30, 2017", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "2.1K", "content": "The Bitcoin vs Visa Electricity Consumption FallacyCarlos DomingoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 30, 2017Last week, I got a Twitter alert about the following amusing reply of Andreas M. Antonopoulos to a yet another tweet complaining about the energy consumption of the Bitcoin network.Lately, with the major crypto rally that we are seeing, articles about this topic have become extremely common and it seems that the only difference among them is to which country Bitcoin energy consumption is being compared with, whether is Nigeria\u00a0, Iceland\u00a0, Denmark or Ecuador.While no one can argue that Bitcoin (and other altcoins) mining consumes a lot of electricity (in absolute numbers) given that you need to run a network of few hundreds or thousands of very powerful computers all the time, the right way to look at this problem is not about the total consumption but to compare how efficient is Bitcoin relative to the alternative traditional centralized systems that we are predominantly using today and that one day crypto might replace.However, the only comparison that seems to always pop up everywhere is against VISA transaction costs which was included in the article that trigger the above tweet and in other articles as well. As expected, VISA looks way more efficient which adds to the rhetoric that Bitcoin is a very inefficient system and it is just a Ponzi scheme that is polluting the world. In my view, this comparison is flawed and it is not comparing apples to apples. Besides the fact that Bitcoin is not simply a piece of a payment network like VISA but a full currency system, VISA itself requires the banking system for its payment system to work so you need to actually include some of those costs there to make a meaningful comparison. So let\u2019s look first at how VISA works.How VISA actually works and who else is\u00a0involvedLet\u2019s take a close look at how a VISA transaction works when your cashier swipes your card (or these days, you wave your iPhone with Apple Pay). First, the data in your magnetic strip or phone is sent to something called a font-end processor that handles payment information on behalf of the merchant you used to pay and the bank where the merchant\u2019s sales receipts are deposited. There are hundreds of front-end processors in the world. The bank where the merchant sales receipts are deposit is referred to as the acquiring bank. The front-end processors forward the information in the credit card to the relevant card association (VISA or others like MasterCard or American Express primarily) which then figures out which bank your card came from, the so-called issuing bank. Now, your payment information will be sent to a payment processor representing the issuing bank to validate that the information is correct and you have credit or balance. Finally, it is time for the transaction to flow back from the bank to the processor to the credit card association to the front-end processor to the merchant and to the acquiring bank for the transaction to actually occur. By now, your credit card information has crossed over several databases and servers out of which VISA is just one piece in the entire transaction chain.So as we have seen above, just comparing VISA transaction costs with Bitcoin costs is not a fair comparison, we need to include the entire banking system electricity consumption since the foundation for VISA to work are the acquiring and issuing banks that participate in the transaction. And pretty much every single bank in the world is either an issuer or an acquiring bank or most of them in fact both. VISA is just one piece of a transaction while Bitcoin is the entire infrastructure needed to run a currency and a payment system.Estimating banks electricity consumptionSo let\u2019s now estimate how much electricity the traditional banking system consumes. This is not an easy thing to do so the calculation below is just a rough estimate that tries to provide a lower bound by using only few sources of electricity for banks and using as conservative as possible numbers.First let\u2019s look at how many banks are out there. After doing a bit of research, it seems that no one knows exactly how many banks are in the world and you can get different estimates ranging from around 14,600 here to 25,000 here and even more than 60,000 quasi banks associations that are almost as rigorously regulated as banks. So for the purpose of this calculation we will just take the 30,000 number.Now we need to estimate how much electricity banks consume. For the purpose of this comparison I will just include three values: server costs, branches costs and ATM costs. Of course, banks (and its employees), consume a lot more electricity from other sources but to make my point here this will be enough.The next number we need to add to the mix are how many servers each bank is using to run their banking infrastructure. Pick a very conservative number of an average of 100 servers per bank (keep in mind banks need servers not just for the banking infrastructure but for the bank internal operations as well like ERPs, CRMs, accounting systems, Website, etc.). If a server in average consumes 400Wh and since it always on, this means that banks consume in total 800 Mwh.Let\u2019s add to the mix the electricity consumption of the branches. According to the World Bank there are 12.5 branches per 100,000 adults in the world so if the world population is 7.6 billion people and we have around 70% adults, this means a total of 665,000 branches. Only in the US they appear to be close to 100,000 branches and assuming US is around 15% or less of the entire banking system worldwide you get to around the same number.Calculating branch consumption is more tricky since there are lots of things to take into account like size of the branch or number of employees as well as several things consuming electricity like lights, cooling, computers, monitors, etc. And they are not open 24 x 365 so after looking at a couple of articles, I have decided to settle for a conservative number 10 kwh per branch assuming an average branch has 10 light bulbs, two air conditioning units that are only use 20% of the time and 12 desktop computers running an average of 12 hours a day, 20 days a month through the year.And finally, we need to include the ATMs networks that all banks use (that will also not needed in case bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies become the dominant currency and payment mechanism). According to the ATM Industry Association we were on the path to get 3MM ATMs by 2015 so given that we are in 2017 already I will just use that number as a lower bound for the total number. For small bank ATM machines, the average daily power consumption comes around 5Wh.So total consumption for banks during a year only on those three metrics is around (I am rounding) 26Twh on servers, 58Twh on branches and 13Twh on ATMs for a total of close to a 100 Twh a year.According to the article that trigger this discussion, Bitcoin annual Twh consumption is 28.67\u00a0, so currently more than 3 times more efficient than a very conservative calculation of the cost of the global banking system. Of course you will argue that the banking systems does more than handling a currency which is true but the difference is large enough that I do not think is that relevant. Even if only 30% of banks electricity consumption was the comparable part to Bitcoin, that will still make Bitcoin more efficient.As a final comment, I believe that bitcoin will become more efficient in terms of electricity consumption moving forward (although it might continue growing its electricity consumption as an absolute value but so is energy consumption growing worldwide). The reasons are two fold.First, as most of the miners move to the latest ASIC hardware like Bitmain\u2019s Antminer S9, the cost per Th will become much more efficient. The S9 is 2.5 times from efficient in energy consumption than its predecesor the S7 and you can run a 14TH/s machine with only 1400 wats of energy. At the time of writing, the computers on the bitcoin network were doing 550,000 Terahashes per second. So if all of that compute was done with the most efficient hardware, you will need roughly 40K computers consuming 1400 wats each. Given that mining hardware is on all the time, you need to multiply this by 24 hours and 365 days given a total of around 500 Gigawats a year or as opposed of current estimates of 10,23 TWh to close to 30Twh yearly consumption, so 60 times more efficient. (note: this calculations are only taking into account the electricity costs of running the hardware and do not include the cost of the cooling but given how newer models like the S9 are also much more efficient in terms of heat dissipation and also reduce the amount of servers needed, adding this will only reinforce my point).Second, the Bitcoin protocol itself is upgrading to improve its efficiency. We saw recently the SegWit activation and within the next few months we will see the adoption of the Lightning Network which effectively moves micropayments off the blockchain. Once this is done, Bitcoin will start to resemble more a clearing network with reduced fees and the electricity consumption per transaction will be decreased by several orders of magnitude.So stop complaining about Bitcoin and start complaining about Xmas lights.", "responses": "34"}, {"title": "Why Ethereum 1.0 failed and Bitcoin succeeded", "author_name": "Noah Ruderman", "link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-ethereum-1-0-failed-and-bitcoin-succeeded-72e9594b9789?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 22", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "3.3K", "content": "Why Ethereum 1.0 failed and Bitcoin succeededNoah RudermanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 22IntroductionEthereum 1.0 wouldn\u2019t be undergoing a complete redesign unless it had major flaws. So how did we get here? And why did Bitcoin seem to fare much better? Two important factors are user experience and economics. At a minimum, for a product to succeed it needs to be a compelling alternative to an existing problem, and the transaction fee must not exceed the economic value of the actual transactions. Together these point to an upwards trajectory for Bitcoin and a downwards trajectory for Ethereum 1.0.Competing on User ExperienceThere\u2019s a saying that for one product to replace another with network effects, it needs to be ten times better. Specifically it must be good enough to justify the painful switching costs. Here we examine that first competitor and if those improvements could arguably be called a 10x better experience.Bitcoin was 10x\u00a0betterWho was Bitcoin\u2019s first competitor? Gold comes to mind, but Bitcoin\u2019s inflation in the early years was very large, far exceeding that of physical gold mining. There was little Bitcoin had to offer gold bugs in terms of longevity, inflation, decentralization, at least for now. It was not yet a competitive product.Rather, Bitcoin\u2019s first competitor was the wire / ACH transfer. In the developed world it\u2019s hard to think of someone without a bank account, and the base of people with experience using these workflows is about as high as the number of people who have ever filed taxes. Moving money could cost $30 for a wire, and take one business day which could mean three total days given that banks often don\u2019t operate on the weekend. ACH transfers are cheaper but much slower, taking 3\u20135 business days to process.Bitcoin was an obvious 10x improvement on the wire / ACH\u00a0transferBitcoin was an obvious improvement with 10 minute block times and fees that were for a very long time under a penny. Unlike banks, Bitcoin didn\u2019t shut down after 5 PM or on weekends. It was an obvious 10x improvement, so much so that years later many continued to think of Bitcoin as a consumer payments network rather than a settlement layer.That Bitcoin is today thought of as an alternative to gold rather than the wire transfer is irrelevant. During its most formative years it was able to onboard users by providing a clear alternative to bank transfers.Ethereum turned out to be 10x\u00a0worseWho was Ethereum\u2019s first competitor? Many think it was Bitcoin, but it was hardly better equipped to offer a substantial improvement with respect to payments. Rather, than being engineered for payments, it was a general purpose platform and originally branded a \u201cworld computer\u201d.This world computer where anybody could write their own decentralized applications was often referred to as ushering in Web 3.0, where Ethereum would presumably be the backbone of a secure and decentralized internet. Since the contemporary web is referred to as Web 2.0, I think it\u2019s a fair thing to say it was Ethereum\u2019s first competitor. Both the internet and Ethereum share the common trait of being permissionless platforms that anyone can build on.Ethereum was unfortunately 10x worse than the web 2.0 it sought to\u00a0replaceThe contemporary web is built out using the client-server model and is extremely scalable thanks to horizontal scaling (analogous to sharding). This ability to scale is its superpower: there are billions of internet connected users, tens of billions of internet connected devices, and room for more. Latency is often so small it\u2019s often not neurologically perceivable. Bandwidth is good enough to stream video and costs are largely free, subsidized by advertising.Ethereum is not exactly a platform ready in any sense to offer improvements on the contemporary web. Its bandwidth isn\u2019t enough to upload small images (the most data that can be uploaded per block is about 13 KB). At 15 transactions per second only about 1 million daily active users can be supported. Latency is far longer than the 2 second limit that will frustrate users on the web. Every state change is approximately $0.06, which bodes poorly given how much interactivity is part of the normal web browsing experience.Ethereum is unfortunately not the 10x improvement anyone is looking for. If we\u2019re polite, it\u2019s a 10x worse experience. And if we\u2019re honest, it\u2019s several orders of magnitude worse still. Ethereum was picking a battle that couldn\u2019t be won here. Web 2.0\u2019s superpower was scalability and that was Ethereum\u2019s weakness.Economics of transactionsIt\u2019s an economic reality that the value of the transactions must at a minimum exceed the transaction fees paid. Without this, we can\u2019t realistically expect to onboard users. Nobody is interested in leaving money on the table. Single fee markets behave like you might expect, but multiple competing fee markets can crowd out applications with low economic value.Bitcoin\u2019s single-application platform was smooth\u00a0sailingTransactions on Bitcoin were intended for wealth transfer. Although there were secondary uses of Bitcoin such as gambling and storing data, the primary function had the highest economic value. This meant that using the platform as intended was not impeded by secondary uses.Ethereum\u2019s multi-application platform had unexpected interactionsTransactions on Ethereum were meant to power dapps. Wealth transfer was meant to be a secondary use that unfortunately could not be designed out of Ethereum. So what happens when a low-value application is on the same platform as a high-value application? Unless they both offer comparable economic value, the low-value application may be entirely priced out. Picture dapp A\u2019s bottom 1st percentile of transactions justifying a fee of above $0.06 and dapp B\u2019s top 99th percentile of transactions justifying a fee of below $0.06.Wealth transfer out-priced dapps on\u00a0EthereumIn Ethereum\u2019s case, despite its intended use case being for decentralized applications, the most popular use of Ethereum is still just transferring wealth without the assistance of dapps. Ironically, what was surely considered to be a secondary use of Ethereum is now setting a transaction fee baseline that\u2019s putting dapps out of business.Interacting with the web, unlike transferring wealth, is not a high-risk workflow. If you try to authenticate to a website or update your Facebook status and there is some interruption or error, you can try again. There is no real risk of catastrophic loss and consequently little need for security, legal systems, or insurance like with wealth transfer. This is largely the reason that software engineering doesn\u2019t require licenses to work in, in contrast with other fields like medicine or other engineering fields.Web 3.0 applications have been crowded out by wealth transfer. This has been the fate of most dapps, failing to deliver economic value on a per transaction basis greater than the current median fee of $0.06.The Ethereum 1.0 dapps that survived lacked\u00a0tractionWith that said, there have been a few categories of dapps which have provided enough economic value to survive. Most notably they are gambling, decentralized exchanges for on-chain tokens, prediction markets, ICOs, and collateral-backed loans. What they share is that people are willing to pay on par with baseline transaction fee for these workflows. (It is not a coincidence that they involve moving potentially large sums of money at once.) The problem, however, is that these are niche applications whose values are way out of line.0x, one of the most popular dex protocols, has collected only $2000 in lifetime transaction fees despite having a market cap of $160M. The token is also not necessary for the protocol to function and will likely be forked out by major relayers. Augur, the most popular prediction market, has only $40k staked in predictions yet has a $170M market cap. No dapp has more than 1000 daily active users on a regular basis and only a couple dozen have more than 100 daily active users. Something is not right with these numbers.ConclusionsSo why did Bitcoin do so well and Ethereum always seemed to struggle?Bitcoin was a 10x improvement over the wire / ACH transfer. Bitcoin only had one use case which also had high economic value, so the fee market adjusted to what users were willing to pay.Ethereum 1.0 was 10x worse compared to contemporary web architecture. It was an unherently unscalable system (monolithic blockchain) competing with an extremely scalable system (modern web). The situation is so bad that they need a complete rearchitecture. Wealth transfer on Ethereum (not intended to be the primary use-case) created a baseline transaction fee which drowned out all applications with low economic value (i.e. most dapps). The dapps that did survive were less numerous and successful than what was expected.", "responses": "30"}, {"title": "Modeling Bitcoin's Value with\u00a0Scarcity", "author_name": "PlanB", "link": "https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 22", "readtime": "10 min read", "upvotes": "5.8K", "content": "Modeling Bitcoin's Value with\u00a0ScarcityPlanBBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 22IntroductionSatoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin white paper 31/Oct 2008 [1], created the bitcoin genesis block 03/Jan 2009, and released the bitcoin code 08/Jan 2009. So begins a journey that leads to a $70bn bitcoin (BTC) market today.Bitcoin is the first scarce digital object the world has ever seen. It is scarce like silver & gold, and can be sent over the internet, radio, satellite etc.\" As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: boring grey in colour, not a good conductor of electricity, not particularly strong [..], not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose\u00a0.. and one special, magical property: can be transported over a communications channel\"\u200a\u2014\u200aNakamoto [2]Surely this digital scarcity has value. But how much? In this article I quantify scarcity using stock-to-flow, and use stock-to-flow to model bitcoin\u2019s value.Scarcity and Stock-to-FlowDictionaries usually define scarcity as 'a situation in which something is not easy to find or get', and 'a lack of something'.Nick Szabo has a more useful definition of scarcity: 'unforgeable costliness'.\"What do antiques, time, and gold have in common? They are costly, due either to their original cost or the improbability of their history, and it is difficult to spoof this costliness. [..] There are some problems involved with implementing unforgeable costliness on a computer. If such problems can be overcome, we can achieve bit gold.\"\u200a\u2014\u200aSzabo [3]\"Precious metals and collectibles have an unforgeable scarcity due to the costliness of their creation. This once provided money the value of which was largely independent of any trusted third party. [..][but] you can\u2019t pay online with metal. Thus, it would be very nice if there were a protocol whereby unforgeably costly bits could be created online with minimal dependence on trusted third parties, and then securely stored, transferred, and assayed with similar minimal trust. Bit gold.\"\u200a\u2014\u200aSzabo [4]Bitcoin has unforgeable costliness, because it costs a lot of electricity to produce new bitcoins. Producing bitcoins cannot be easily faked. Note that this is different for fiat money and also for altcoins that have no supply cap, have no proof-of-work (PoW), have low hashrate, or have a small group of people or companies that can easily influence supply etc.Saifedean Ammous talks about scarcity in terms of stock-to-flow (SF) ratio. He explains why gold and bitcoin are different from consumable commodities like copper, zinc, nickel, brass, because they have high SF.\"For any consumable commodity [..] doubling of output will dwarf any existing stockpiles, bringing the price crashing down and hurting the holders. For gold, a price spike that causes a doubling of annual production will be insignificant, increasing stockpiles by 3% rather than 1.5%.\"\"It is this consistently low rate of supply of gold that is the fundamental reason it has maintained its monetary role throughout human history.\"\"The high stock-to-flow ratio of gold makes it the commodity with the lowest price elasticity of supply.\"\"The existing stockpiles of Bitcoin in 2017 were around 25 times larger than the new coins produced in 2017. This is still less than half of the ratio for gold, but around the year 2022, Bitcoin's stock-to-flow ratio will overtake that of gold\"\u200a\u2014\u200aAmmous[5]So, scarcity can be quantified by SF.SF = stock / flowStock is the size of the existing stockpiles or reserves. Flow is the yearly production. Instead of SF, people also use supply growth rate (flow/stock). Note that SF = 1 / supply growth rate.Let\u2019s look at some SF numbers.Gold has the highest SF 62, it takes 62 years of production to get current gold stock. Silver is second with SF 22. This high SF makes them monetary goods.Palladium, platinum and all other commodities have SF barely higher than 1. Existing stock is usually equal or lower than yearly production, making production a very important factor. It is almost impossible for commodities to get a higher SF, because as soon as somebody hoards them, price rises, production rises, and price falls again. It is very hard to escape this trap.Bitcoin currently has a stock of 17.5m coins and supply of 0.7m/yr = SF 25. This places bitcoin in the monetary goods category like silver and gold. Bitcoin's market value at current prices is $70bn.Supply of bitcoin is fixed. New bitcoins are created in every new block. Blocks are created every 10 minutes (on average), when a miner finds the hash that satisfies the PoW required for a valid block. The first transaction in each block, called the coinbase, contains the block reward for the miner that found the block. The block reward consists of the fees that people pay for transactions in that block and the newly created coins (called subsidy). The subsidy started at 50 bitcoins, and is halved every 210,000 blocks (about 4 years). That's why 'halvings' are very important for bitcoins money supply and SF. Halvings also cause the supply growth rate (in bitcoin context usually called 'monetary inflation') to be stepped and not smooth.source: https://plot.ly/~BashCo/5.embedStock-to-Flow and\u00a0ValueThe hypothesis in this study is that scarcity, as measured by SF, directly drives value. A look at the table above confirms that market values tend to be higher when SF is higher. Next step is to collect data and make a statistical model.DataI calculated bitcoin's monthly SF and value from Dec 2009 to Feb 2019 (111 data points in total). Number of blocks per month can be directly queried from the bitcoin blockchain with Python/RPC/bitcoind. Actual number of blocks differs quite a bit from the theoretical number, because blocks are not produced exactly every 10 minutes (e.g. in the first year 2009 there were significantly less blocks). With the number of blocks per month and known block subsidy, you can calculate flow and stock. I corrected for lost coins by arbitrarily disregarding the first million coins (7 months) in the SF calculation. More accurate adjusting for lost coins will be a subject for future research.Bitcoin price data is available from different sources but starts at Jul 2010. I added the first known bitcoin prices (1$ for 1309 BTC Oct 2009, first quote of $0.003 on BitcoinMarket Mar 2010, 2 pizza's worth $41 for 10,000 BTC May 2010) and interpolated. Data archeology will be a subject for future research.We already have the data points for gold (SF 62, market value $8.5trn) and silver (SF 22, market value $308bn), which I use as a benchmark.ModelA first scatter plot of SF vs market value shows that it is better to use logarithmic values or axis for market value, because it spans 8 orders of magnitude (from $10,000 to $100bn). Using logarithmic values or axis for SF as well reveals a nice linear relationship between ln(SF) and ln(market value). Note that I use natural logarithm (ln with base e) and not common logarithm (log with base 10), which would yield similar results.Charts made with gnuplot and gnumericsFitting a linear regression to the data confirms what can be seen with the naked eye: a statistically significant relationship between SF and market value (95% R2, significance of F 2.3E-17, p-Value of slope 2.3E-17). The likelihood that the relationship between SF and market value is caused by chance is close to zero. Of course other factors also impact price, regulation, hacks and other news, that is why R2 is not 100% (and not all dots are on the straight black line). However, the dominant driving factor seems to be scarcity / SF.What is very interesting is that gold and silver, which are totally different markets, are in line with the bitcoin model values for SF. This gives extra confidence in the model. Note that at the peak of the bull market in Dec 2017 bitcoin SF was 22 and bitcoin market value was $230bn, very close to silver.Because halvings have such a big impact on SF, I put months until the next halving as a color overlay in the chart. Dark blue is the halving month, and red is just after the halving. Next halving is May 2020. Current SF of 25 will double to 50, very close to gold (SF 62).The predicted market value for bitcoin after May 2020 halving is $1trn, which translates in a bitcoin price of $55,000. That is quite spectacular. I guess time will tell and we will probably know one or two years after the halving, in 2020 or 2021. A great out of sample test of this hypothesis and model.People ask me where all the money needed for $1trn bitcoin market value would come from? My answer: silver, gold, countries with negative interest rate (Europe, Japan, US soon), countries with predatory governments (Venezuela, China, Iran, Turkey etc), billionaires and millionaires hedging against quantitative easing (QE), and institutional investors discovering the best performing asset of last 10 yrs.We can also model bitcoin price directly with SF. The formula of course has different parameters, but the result is the same, 95% R2 and a predicted bitcoin price of $55,000 with SF 50 after May 2020 halving.I plotted bitcoin model price based on SF (black) and actual bitcoin price over time, with the number of blocks as color overlay.Charts made with gnuplot and gnumericsNote the goodness of fit, especially the almost immediate price adjustment after Nov 2012 halving. Adjustment after Jun 2016 halving was much slower, possibly due to Ethereum competition and the DAO hack. Also, you see less blocks per month (blue) in the first year 2009 and during downward difficulty adjustments end2011, mid2015 and end2018. Introduction of GPU miners in 2010-2011 and ASIC miners in 2013 resulted in more blocks per month (red).Power Laws and\u00a0FractalsAlso very interesting is that there is indication of a power law relationship.The linear regression function: ln(market value) = 3.3 * ln(SF)+14.6.. can be written as a power law function: market value = exp(14.6) * SF ^ 3.3Power laws are scarce, you don\u2019t find them very often. The possibility of a power law with 95% R2 over 8 orders of magnitude, adds confidence that the main driver of bitcoin value is correctly captured with SF.A power law is a relationship in which a relative change in one quantity gives rise to a proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities. [6]. Every halving, bitcoin SF doubles and market value increases 10x, this is a constant factor. See appendix for some famous power law examples.Power laws are interesting because they reveal an underlying regularity in the properties of seemingly random complex systems. Complex systems usually have properties where changes between phenomena at different scales are independent of the scales we are looking at. The picture we take at one scale is therefore similar in some way to the picture we take at another scale. This self-similar property underlies power law relationships\u00a0. We see this in Bitcoin too: 2011, 2014 and 2018 crashes look very similar (all have -80% dips) but on totally different scales (resp. $10, $1000, $10,000), if you don't use log scales, you will not see it. Scale in-variance and self-similarity has a link with fractals. In fact, parameter 3.3 in the power law function above is the 'fractal dimension'. For more information on fractals see the famous length of coastlines study [7]. Power laws and fractals in bitcoin will be a subject for future research.ConclusionBitcoin is the first scarce digital object the world has ever seen, it is scarce like silver & gold, and can be sent over the internet, radio, satellite etc.Surely this digital scarcity has value. But how much? In this article I quantify scarcity using stock-to-flow, and use stock-to-flow to model bitcoin\u2019s value.A statistically significant relationship between stock-to-flow and market value exists. The likelihood that the relationship between stock-to-flow and market value is caused by chance is close to zero.Adding confidence in the model:Gold and silver, which are totally different markets, are in line with the bitcoin model values for SF.There is indication of a power law relationship.The model predicts a bitcoin market value of $1trn after next halving in May 2020, which translates in a bitcoin price of $55,000.References[1] https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\u200a\u2014\u200aSatoshi Nakamoto, 2008[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583.msg11405#msg11405\u200a\u2014\u200aSatoshi Nakamoto, 2010[3] https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/10/antiques-time-gold-and-bit-gold.html\u200a\u2014\u200aNick Szabo, 2008[4] https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html\u200a\u2014\u200aNick Szabo, 2008[5] The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking\u200a\u2014\u200aSaifedean Ammous, 2018[6] https://necsi.edu/power-law[7] http://fractalfoundation.org/OFC/OFC-10-4.htmlAppendix \u2014Power Law\u00a0ExamplesKepler (planets)Richter (earthquakes)Kleiber (animals)", "responses": "25"}, {"title": "Updated: What to Expect During the Bitcoin Cash Hard\u00a0Fork", "author_name": "Coinbase", "link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/what-to-expect-during-the-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-f15fd03687db?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 13, 2018", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "2.8K", "content": "Updated: What to Expect During the Bitcoin Cash Hard\u00a0ForkCoinbaseBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 13, 2018Update as of Thursday, February 14, 2019We have now begun reaching out to customers that held Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at the time of the hard fork.In mid-November, Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork, resulting in two chains. On November 20th, we announced the \u201cABC\u201d chain would retain the designation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on Coinbase.The competing chain, known as Bitcoin SV, resulted in a forked coin now commonly referred to as BSV. When the hard fork occurred, the BSV blockchain used the amount of BCH associated with an address at the time of the fork to determine the amount of BSV that would be allocated to the parallel address on the BSV blockchain. As such, the amount of BSV now available in respective customers\u2019 Coinbase.com accounts is the same as the amount of BCH that was in their Coinbase (Coinbase.com and Coinbase Pro) account at the time of the hard fork.Coinbase does not support purchases or sales of BSV, so customers cannot sell their BSV for fiat currency on Coinbase. They may send their BSV balance to an external wallet, following instructions here.Update as of Monday, November 26, 2018Coinbase has now re-enabled sends and receives of BCH on Coinbase Pro, Prime, Coinbase.com and the iOS and Android apps. We expect to enable full BCH trading and functionality, including buys and sells on Coinbase.com and the mobile apps, in the next 2 days.Following the BCH hard fork and conclusion of the hash war, Bitcoin SV has confirmed the creation of a new coin, BSV. Coinbase intends to allow customers to withdraw BSV at a future date, though we do not currently intend to support trading, buys or sells.We will provide additional updates as they are available. We anticipate development work for BSV withdrawals will take at least a few weeks, but may take longer.Update as of Tuesday, November 20, 2018Since the Bitcoin Cash fork on November 15, 2018, Coinbase has been closely monitoring the BCH network. We have observed consensus in the community that the BCH ABC chain will retain the designation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Coinbase will also adopt this designation for BCH. Coinbase has made this decision based on a number of factors including the fact that ABC has a higher hashrate and a longer proof-of-work chain.Coinbase is now prepared to resume limited trading in BCH. For Coinbase Pro and Prime, we will turn on trading of BCH in the next 2 hours. Sends and receives will remain offline until we can confirm that they are safe to re-enable, including a prolonged absence of chain reorganizations. We expect that to occur within the next week.For Coinbase.com and the iOS and Android apps, we will continue to evaluate the safety of the network before re-enabling buys, sells, sends, and receives. We expect that to occur within the next week. We will resume all BCH services when it is safe for our customers.We will continue to evaluate the safety of the BCH SV chain. Our current intention is to support withdrawal services for the BCH SV chain so that our customers may withdraw funds at a future date. We anticipate this development work will take at least a few weeks, but may take longer. We will communicate directly with customers that hold BCH and notify them when we complete this work and they can withdraw funds from the BCH SV chain.If network conditions significantly change or become unsafe at any point, Coinbase may revise these plans.", "responses": "44"}, {"title": "What is bitcoin and the blockchain?", "author_name": "Brian Forde", "link": "https://medium.com/mit-media-lab-digital-currency-initiative/what-is-bitcoin-and-the-blockchain-2a61b1bd6427?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 30, 2016", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "729", "content": "\u201cExplain to me how Bitcoin works.\u201d @JackGaviganWhat is bitcoin and the blockchain?A list of articles, blog posts, videos, books and courses to help get you\u00a0started.Brian FordeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 30, 2016As bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have become more popular, we\u2019ve gotten more and more requests from people seeking suggestions for how to learn about the technology.In pulling together this list of starter articles, blog posts, books and courses, we\u2019ve found that most people are initially willing to invest about 30\u201345 minutes to learn about cryptocurrencies.

So what. The dotcom bubble for sure was a bubble. The world economy is a bubble. The Universe is a bubble.The question is not \u201care we in a bubble\u201d the question is where in the lifecycle of the bitcoin bubble are we?Where Are We by Eyeball?look ma, hockey stick\u00a0growth!After every single growth curve that looks like this, we have seen a dump.By that logic, we should dump bitcoin.look at the insane parabolic growth on this\u00a0chart!After all, look at the insane parabolic growth on that chart. It can\u2019t continue like this, the line is almost vertical!Except you have to look closer. The chart above is bitcoin November 30th, 2013.So if you dumped in November 2013, you missed the 1600% runup.Timing the MarketThis is why timing the market is hard, because a hockey stick is an invariant shape, but the scale varies. So we can\u2019t actually get much of a trading signal by asking what the shape of this phenomenon is. the better question is\u200a\u2014\u200awhat is the scale of this phenomenon.The analyst below summarizes this in an engaging, funny and correct way.Comparing Bitcoin to GoldHere\u2019s an astute analyst saying Bitcoin is worth almost as much as gold in November 2013. What he is actually saying is that one bitcoin is worth almost as much as one ounce of gold. This is a completely useless and insane marker.Bitcoin worth almost as much as goldThe price of one bitcoin rose as high as $1,242 early Friday, just two days after crossing $1,000 for the first time\u2026money.cnn.comA better comparison might be this, which shows that as of this writing, Bitcoin is 228B total, which is still ridiculously less valuable than the 8.2T that gold is worth. Why do they publish stupid analysis like the above?Is Bitcoin Gold?If you did compare Bitcoin to gold, we would still have about 28x more run up to complete.But it\u2019s safe to say that Bitcoin is not gold. That much is obvious. Bitcoin is Bitcoin.Is Bitcoin the Internet?The next logical comparison is the Internet bubble.The Dotcom bubble was 9.6T, interestingly exceeding the value of gold, but within the same order of magnitude. This chart is out of date because it pegs the cryptomarket as 120B, it\u2019s now Market Cap: $424,246,502,429/ 24h Vol: $30,364,734,775 / BTC Dominance: 63.8%That\u2019s the entire crypto market\u200a\u2014\u200aand Bitcoin dominance is the amount of value bitcoin has compared to all other cryptocurrencies. To me, this undervalues the rest of all cryptocurrencies like Ether. I would prefer to see Bitcoin dominance at around 50%.Cryptocurrency Market Capitalizations | CoinMarketCapCryptocurrency market cap rankings, charts, and morecoinmarketcap.comThe short version is that the entire cryptoball including Bitcoin is smaller than the dotcom bubble by 22x, similar to the comparison to gold.Is Bitcoin Even Bitcoin?One thing I hear people saying is \u201cit\u2019s not Bitcoin it\u2019s Blockchain.\u201dThis saying has two facets. One facet is to understand that yes, Bitcoin is an expression of blockchain and there are many cryptocurrencies that also use blockchain. So we absolutely should value other cryptoassets, and my statement above about bitcoin dominance speaks to the value of the rest of these cryptoassets. I believe natural Bitcoin dominance should be 50% based on the power law distribution. However, I don\u2019t ascribe any magic properties to the word Bitcoin. In fact, the word Bitcoin is not trademarked, which means that a flood of things called Bitcoin are coming including many Bitcoin forks.The big thing that the \u201cIt\u2019s not Bitcoin it\u2019s Blockchain\u201d people are missing is that a subset of those people are anti-cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is the killer app of blockchain. Anyone who tells you that Cryptocurrency is not doesn\u2019t understand either cryptocurrencies or blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain in particular is a grossly slow and thermodynamically and ecologically perverse database that you only use because you don\u2019t trust anyone.The value of Bitcoin is that today it occupies the \u201cIron Throne\u201d of cryptocurrency. Being the dominant cryptocurrency today is hugely valuable and it is indeed the oldest of this particular lineage of blockchain based cryptocurrencies (yes, hashcash and earlier forms existed, but none with the complete set of design innovations within Bitcoin).So Then What is the Value of Cryptocurrency?I assert that the value of cryptocurrency as a whole is tied to two things. One of them is the total amount of trust available in the financial system. The Federal Reserve bought a Trillion dollars worth of toxic assets during the bank collapse of 2008. I understand why they did this. The collapse of Lehman brothers created a terrible impact to the economy, and the alternative was to allow Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and others to collapse, taking all of their non FDIC insured holders with them\u200a\u2014\u200aand of course also forcing the FDIC to pay out all of the insured holders. A completely apocalyptic scenario for our world economy. So to be fair, they had no good option. But if you can imagine the loss of trust in centralized bankingThe value of BankingList of largest banks - WikipediaThe list is based on the S&P Global Market Intelligence report 2017 of the 100 largest banks in the world. Accounting\u2026en.wikipedia.orgAs you know, Bitcoin\u2019s design aesthetic is to eliminates the dependence on trusting *any* third party. If you consult the list of the world\u2019s largest banks, you can conclude that the top 50 banks of the world are in aggregate worth about 70 Trillion USD.One way of thinking about the value of the entire cryptoball at around $400B is that you could see it as a conversion of 0.57% of the trust in banks. So by buying 1T dollars of toxic assets, the banking system lost 0.57% of their trust which was transferred into cryptocurrency.The Internet of ValueMy friend Ann Greenberg saidDot com was about moving information. BitCoin is about moving information securely. Its a upgrade to the old web. Blockchain is inevitable. Bitcoin or not.I agree with Ann 100%, and want to explain the depth of her words. If you properly understand her phrase \u201cmoving information securely\u201d we arrive at \u201ctransfer wealth\u201d. There are approximately $1.59 trillion USD in circulation as of November 15, 2017, of which $1.55 trillion is in Federal Reserve notes.The Internet is without a doubt the largest transfer of information (bits) we have ever seen in our lifetimes, whereas the internet of value will be largest transfer of wealth in our lifetimes. Netflix wants $10 of your bank account every month. Amazon maybe wants $100 of your bank account every month. Bitcoin wants your entire bank account for the rest of time.Based on this thesis, I believe that the Internet of value backed by cryptocurrencies has the potential to be 100x larger than the consumerization of the Internet. If you think about the value of Facebook, this is many orders of magnitude higher.Don\u2019t put in more than you can lose. If you put all your net worth into bitcoin or similar cryptocurrencies, you are a fool. If you put none of your net worth into bitcoin or similar cryptocurrencies, you are also a fool.This is not investment advice.Click the Buttons, Get\u00a0Evercoin", "responses": "16"}, {"title": "Why isn\u2019t Bitcoin banned everywhere?", "author_name": "Haseeb Qureshi", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/why-isnt-bitcoin-banned-everywhere-32a2caec90?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 16, 2018", "readtime": "11 min read", "upvotes": "3.5K", "content": "Why isn\u2019t Bitcoin banned everywhere?Haseeb QureshiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 16, 2018When I first heard of Bitcoin, it sounded like something out of a dystopian sci-fi novel. Digital, cryptographic, uncensorable money? It seemed such a radical idea, it couldn\u2019t possibly belong in this decade.But if it did\u200a\u2014\u200aif Bitcoin were to go mainstream\u200a\u2014\u200aI was convinced it would lead to a massive geopolitical disruption, shifting the power relations between governments and their citizens. It would mean investing into Bitcoin would be like funding a revolutionary army. It would be so subversive, only a few crazy people would be willing to do it.Of course, I was wrong about every part of that.Grandmothers now own Bitcoin. And with a few notable exceptions (namely China and India), world governments have been surprisingly welcoming toward cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is legal almost everywhere.There\u2019s been a lot of tumult on the regulatory front lately. But amidst the frenetic crypto news cycle, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of how weird it is that Bitcoin is legal at all. Obviously it\u2019s good that it is\u200a\u2014\u200abut we should be surprised this happened!Bitcoin was supposed to be the enemy of governments. It was supposed to destroy the state\u2019s monopoly on monetary policy, it was supposed to be a battering ram against the banks and financial surveillance. Indeed, Bitcoin was supposed to erect nothing less than an uncensorable shadow financial system.So why have governments ushered Bitcoin through the front door?Three explanationsI\u2019ve been thinking about this question a lot lately, because I feel it demands answering. I\u2019ve come up with three potential explanations.The first is that \u201call innovation is good innovation.\u201dPerhaps governments recognize the inevitable growth of blockchain technology and don\u2019t want to stem innovation too early via overregulation. This is plausible: you still hear the echoes of \u201cblockchain not Bitcoin\u201d within the halls of industry, and blockchain idealism has become safe cocktail party conversation.But this explanation falls short. First of all, we already have blockchains. Further Bitcoin development isn\u2019t likely to contribute to enterprise blockchain deployments. If the purpose of letting Bitcoin flourish was to usher in the age of enterprise blockchains, its job is already done.Perhaps governments are pattern-matching blockchains with the Internet. A wait-and-see approach to internet regulation was clearly instrumental to its flourishing, and perhaps governments intend to do the same here. But governments have also fought tooth and nail against end-to-end encryption, P2P filesharing, privacy technologies like Tor, and financial networks that enable tax evasion (see e-gold and global financial surveillance policies like FATCA). If Bitcoin threatens the power of financial surveillance, then it would be considered far more dangerous than any of these prior technologies.In light of these examples, \u201call innovation is good innovation\u201d doesn\u2019t adequately explain the lax attitudes of governments.The second possibility is that governments are too dumb to recognize Bitcoin as the snake that will eventually bite them.Governments can certainly sometimes be reactive and short-sighted. But I don\u2019t think this one is correct. By and large, the strongest world governments are thorough and ruthless at identifying and neutralizing threats to their power.Furthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s proponents have historically had very little political influence. Bitcoin\u2019s past has been marred by associations with criminality, dark markets, and digital anarchy. This is precisely the kind of thing that governments would put in the \u201cillegal internet shenanigans\u201d bucket.Neither of these explanations are satisfying. So that leads me to the third and perhaps most radical possibility:Bitcoin is not actually a threat to sovereigns.I\u2019ve become increasingly convinced of this. In fact, Bitcoin might just be the most sovereign-friendly cryptocurrency.Hear me out. I think there are three main reasons why this is true.Bitcoin doesn\u2019t offer true anonymityBitcoin is often described as an anonymous cryptocurrency, but this is incorrect. Bitcoin is actually pseudonymous. The distinction is crucial: under a cryptographic pseudonym, your behavior can still be tracked.How is this done? It starts with the fiat onramps, where an exchange collects information on you through their KYC process. This information that is often shared with other exchanges when investigating suspicious activity. Even once take your Bitcoin onto the mainnet, your activity can still be tracked. Heuristics and clustering analysis are often used to identify exchanges, mixers, and other common blockchain services you use. Supernodes connect to large swathes of the Bitcoin network and correlate transactions with their originating IPs. Even with meticulous opsec and address rotation (which most people don\u2019t do), if you ever want to turn your Bitcoin back into fiat, that offramp is just as highly regulated. Often you will be turned away if your Bitcoin appears tainted by signs of illegal activity.This is more than hypothetical. Exchanges have significant insight into the flows of Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200aenough to successfully deter hacks, stolen funds, and regularly file suspicious activity reports (as all US exchanges are required to). We saw this with the Mueller Probe and with analysis of the Mt. Gox hack. Companies like Chainalysis provide surveillance services to law enforcement and various three-letter agencies, reportedly earning more than $5.7M in 2018 via government contracts.For the average person, this is probably not a big deal. Most cryptocurrency users aren\u2019t doing anything illegal and needn\u2019t worry they\u2019re being targeted for surveillance. But consider: how is this any different from other systems we use? Most people feel their cell phone conversations are private. But in the back of their heads, they know that their phones could be tapped or their phone provider subpoenaed. We take solace that this surveillance is unlikely and usually requires a significant legal threshold. And yet, we know not to be surprised if someday our phone calls are replayed before a jury of our peers. Bitcoin falls into the same security model.One could even argue that Bitcoin is less private than using an overseas banking system. The U.S. has limited insight into what happens in unfriendly banking jurisdictions. But everything on the blockchain is visible all the time. What a gift it would be to the US if every foreign financial institution made their transactions public on a blockchain!To the uncritical eye, Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymity looks like a radical step forward in economic privacy. But a facade of privacy is more dangerous than no privacy at all. The more safe and empowered citizens are convinced they are, the more the state is free to accrue real power over them. This is the first reason Bitcoin is sovereign-friendly.A store of value is not threateningI once believed that if Bitcoin truly succeeded, it would become a global currency. Every economy in the world would be united by their usage of Bitcoin as a new global cryptographic money.It\u2019s become increasingly clear how unlikely this is. This is both because Bitcoin cannot be a worldwide currency, and because Bitcoin can succeed without becoming that worldwide currency. Classically, a currency must act as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.Bitcoin is unlikely to become a global currency for several reasons, each of which could be an essay on their own. But in short: Bitcoin has too high latency, too low throughput, and its divisibility is too low due to the rising dust limit (currently about 3c USD for non-Segwit transactions). Furthermore, even if second-layer scaling technologies like the Lightning Network prove successful, Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary monetary policy makes it a poor medium of exchange.If it came down to it, and central banks felt a digital currency posed enough of a threat, they would happily incentivize (or mandate) usage of their own currency in order to maintain sovereign monetary policy.It\u2019s worth remembering: money is the ultimate network effect, and it\u2019s incredibly sticky. This is especially true in the first world. Our financial system may be built on rusty old cogs, but it has been retrofitted with so many layers of abstraction and usability that for most people most of the time, it\u2019s good enough. Putting the two side-by-side, our current financial system is far ahead of the UX of cryptocurrencies (though I eagerly await the day that changes).So Bitcoin is not suited to be a global currency. But Bitcoin can still succeed! As Nic Carter (no affiliation with the Backstreet Boys) documents, Bitcoin has iterated its way into a vision of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Turns out, sovereigns are pretty okay with this.Note, Bitcoin becoming a form of digital gold is still a long ways away. To say nothing of their relative volatility, the market cap of gold is in the trillions of dollars. Bitcoin is still dwarfed by gold\u2019s dominance as the global store of value.But sovereigns are not principally concerned with protecting the status of gold (except insofar as they hold some amount of gold in reserves). A disruption in the worldwide store of value would not be a significant threat to their power.But I\u2019ll tell you what would be: if Bitcoin were to become a medium of exchange. Then it could support a rich on-chain economy, and its users might be able to conduct their financial lives on a parallel, uncensorable economy. But Bitcoin has proven to be a poor medium of exchange, and there are few substantial businesses built entirely on Bitcoin.As a store of value, the story is much simpler. The flow of Bitcoin usage must begin and end with fiat currencies, bottlenecked at off-chain exchanges like Coinbase or Bitfinex. These exchanges serve as chokepoints where the government\u2019s hand can regulate on-chain activity. Any criminal activity ultimately needs access to fiat liquidity\u200a\u2014\u200aa store of value cannot be used to finance a real-world operation.(Bitcoin is also unable to support DEXes or easily interoperate with other blockchains. This forces markets to consolidate around these off-chain exchanges.)This is provides a neat explanation for why India and China have been the two major countries to ban crypto. Both have strict capital controls and burgeoning middle classes, itching to escape the local currency. Their primary concerns are around economic protectionism and preventing capital flight. Both India and China also have strong restrictions on gold imports. To countries unafraid of capital flight, a store of value poses less of a threat.But a medium of exchange is scary to governments. Liberty Reserve is the canonical example of such a medium of exchange that attempts to circumvent the government\u2019s monopoly on financial regulation. But a pure store of value whose onramps and offramps can be easily regulated, and which cannot steer clear from the financial-industrial complex\u200a\u2014\u200awell, it\u2019s less of a threat to sovereigns. They might even call it innovation.This is the second reason why sovereigns are open to Bitcoin.Bitcoin belongs to no\u00a0oneIt might sound like this article is ragging on Bitcoin. But I\u2019m actually very bullish on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is by far the most decentralized cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s the only currency that can plausibly be said to be politically stateless. This is an enormous advantage in becoming a store of value. No other cryptocurrency can claim this, and it\u2019s possible that no other currency ever will.You see, almost every other cryptocurrency that exists today can be pinpointed on a map. It was concocted by a single mind or a few minds. We know where they come from, where they live, and where they are evangelizing the project.Bitcoin is the only exception. Its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, is now an apparition. Bitcoin belongs to no one, and it relies on no one. If all of its developers were rounded up and thrown into secret prisons, its development would continue under another set of names. This also implies that if a government were to throw its support behind Bitcoin, it would not cede power to any other country. This fact is under-appreciated.Bitcoin\u2019s statelessness makes it the only cryptocurrency that has a chance of being purchased by a central bank\u200a\u2014\u200aultimately, the only buyer that could make Bitcoin into a trillion dollar asset. This legitimization would consolidate it as a true digital gold.Could a central bank ever buy Ether or IOTA? I suspect not. These are companies, earthly organizations with headquarters and identifiable leaders.As much as I love Ethereum, it was created by a Russian-Canadian, with a mostly American and European developer team. The founders walk around. They have plans, they change their minds. They have passports and allegiances. Ethereum is strictly of this world.Bitcoin, on the other hand, is from nowhere and everywhere: all countries can see their own reflections in Bitcoin. Americans see the Bitcoin Foundation and many Core developers as American. Japanese see Satoshi Nakamoto as one of their own, and thus Bitcoin as one of their inventions. The British claim that Satoshi was likely of British origin. The Chinese claim they control the mining industry and hardware that secures Bitcoin.I\u2019m not criticizing Ethereum on this point! Ethereum is a fantastically innovative project, and to innovate rapidly on anything requires coordination and centralization. But Ethereum is not analogous to Bitcoin on this point, and given that it\u2019s only a few years old, we should not expect it to be. Perhaps a decade from now things will look different, but for now Bitcoin is in a category of its own.Bitcoin is the only digital currency that resembles a global commons. These factors will make governments more likely to embrace Bitcoin as a store of value.An uneasy compromiseRemember, if governments truly believed Bitcoin were a threat, they would outlaw it and shut down cryptocurrency exchanges. This would crater prices and liquidity. It would not be the end of Bitcoin of course, but it would be the end of Bitcoin\u2019s dream of displacing gold.In a way, perhaps Bitcoin\u2019s technological inertia and weak privacy guarantees are more adaptive than we think. Perhaps if Bitcoin were innovating as aggressively as Ethereum or Zcash, we would not be in the situation we are in today.So the question remains open: even if Bitcoin has been relegated to be a store of value, could some other cryptocurrency become a global medium of exchange? Right now I believe governments don\u2019t see any possibility of this happening soon, which must be why they\u2019re allowing the experiment to continue. And to be honest, the sober among us don\u2019t either\u200a\u2014\u200aright now the only killer app for cryptocurrencies is speculation.But as the technology matures and these systems begin to scale, this will change. Indeed, when that happens, we should expect the next phase of crypto to be messier. It won\u2019t necessarily come with the uncritical blessings of governments.Ultimately, I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions. To tell you the truth, I\u2019m unsure even about these conclusions\u200a\u2014\u200aI am not an expert on regulations nor on international politics. And in reality, governments are not animated by a single intention, but rather are complex, emergent processes composed of many factions. The last decade has lucidly taught us: governments are difficult to predict from first principles.Either way, I want to see this experiment play out. There is no doubt in my mind that the way money works 50 years from now will look nothing like it does today. The only question is what path it takes to get there.Disclaimer: These are my personal views\u200a\u2014\u200athey do not represent MetaStable Capital, and they should not be construed as investment advice.

The model produced a 29% return over 90 days for a $28,839 profit.To what degree can Bitcoin (BTC) price be predicted? What if publicly available data from Google Trends can help forecast price fluctuations?In other words can we reliably build a formula that can outperform the market? These are the questions which I sought answers to. My goal was to try to make sense of a highly volatile, scary and seemingly unpredictable cryptocurrency market.There are many traders that swear by technical analysis and others that go more the fundamental analysis route. The truth is that there is no magic trading strategy that always out-beats the market. There are far too many variables that even the best AI-based trading algorithms cannot consistently profit from.The formula today is very basic and my intention is to present in its raw form and solicit feedback on how to make it better. This is a work-in-progress and by no means fool-proof so please use at your own risk.The truth is that there is no magic trading strategy that always out-beats the\u00a0market.The FormulaI have been testing formula of what I believe to be a relatively consistent indicator of BTC price performance. Specifically I was able to model a 29% profit over a 90-day period using $100,000 as the initial investment. Note that this does not take into account exchange trading fees which I hope solutions such as decentralized exchanges will one day eliminate.My model was inspired by the initial work of Willy Woo who originally experimented with Google Trend data as a proxy of active Bitcoin price checking.Here is the process that I used:I searched Google Trends for \u201cBTC USD\u201d and \u201cBuy Bitcoin\u201d over the most recent 90-day period:2. I noticed that when the \u201cBTC USD\u201d to \u201cBuy Bitcoin\u201d ratio is less than ~3:1 (specifically <35%) at the BTC price \u201cclose\u201d for the day, the following day\u2019s close price increases. If more than a ~3:1 ratio (specifically >35%) (i.e. 4:1 or 5:1) then its a signal to sell because the subsequent day\u2019s price decreases.3. Next I tested when the BTC price difference closes more than $80 above the prior day\u2019s close price, this makes the pattern more consistent. $80 is an arbitrary value that performs well in this dataset. Here\u2019s a screenshot of what this looks like:BTC USD: Daily indicator directly from Google Trends.Buy Bitcoin: Daily indicator directly from Google Trends.Price: Current day\u2019s close price from Coin Market Cap.Column E: \u201cBuy Bitcoin\u201d/\u201dBTC USD\u201d ratioColumn F: The Buy/Sell decision formula. For example here is the formula for cell F20:=if(AND(E20>35%,G20>80),\u201dBUY\u201d,\u201dSELL\u201d)\u00a0. Note that \u201c35%\u201d is the threshold to Buy along with the price being greater than \u201c$80\u201d.Column G: Bitcoin price difference from prior day\u2019s close.Column H: Running total based on an initial $100,000 investment on 7/7/2018 (the first Buy).Results of the Model and Next\u00a0StepsSo over a 90-day period a $100K investment becomes $128,839 in my model\u200a\u2014\u200aalmost a 29% return. But this is far from an optimized model and there are several things that I\u2019d like to optimize.The \u201c>35%\u201d and \u201c>$80\u201d are rather arbitrary based on what seems to work in this limited 90-day dataset. Is there a better formula that will yield a better Buy/Sell signal?These variables seem to work at the given $6k\u20138k BTC price level. I would like to test more historical data over the past year or two. The model would compare the total earnings from Buy/Sell signals using an array of (~3:1\u2013~5:1) and the \u201c$80\u201d would instead be a fixed percentage of the daily BTC price so that it could account for major price spikes. For example perhaps the optimal model ends up being a 3.23\u20131 ratio at 0.014543229 of the daily price fluctuation.The variable input matrix would look something like this:If You Are a Data Guru Let\u2019s\u00a0TalkIn other words I want to setup a test to find the optimal variables to plug-in that maximizes profit for the given dataset. This would involve regression testing against past price and sentiment data. My hypothesis is that there are optimal variables at different price levels.I\u2019m currently testing a \u201cv2\u201d of this algorithm and would love to collaborate with any data gurus with the R or Python chops to run a full regression and goal seeking script to optimize the algorithm.

Numerous scenarios were discussed that include a coordinated attack on the Bitcoin network, the short-term bubble bursting, and/or the outright governmental ban of bitcoins.

I know all your hearts are in the right place. It\u2019s your group that\u2019s messed up, not you personally. Remember, you have choice. You can get out. I actually would like for you to read my post, step back, and think about why you are here. I would love to be on the same team as you, collaborating. What we have created so far with Bitcoin Cash is too precious to throw away. And this is why I speak.From November 15 to 26 the Bitcoin Cash network went through its most important experiment since the inception of Bitcoin itself.The so-called \u201cBitcoin Hash War\u201d lasted about two weeks and moved in a direction that many people didn\u2019t expect\u200a\u2014\u200aMany people expected Bitcoin SV to make an aggressive re-org attack but that never happened. However what came out of the other side is the problem I will discuss in this post.Bitcoin ABC was so afraid of an imaginary attack from SV that they made all kinds of mistakes, writing permanent code in rapid fire releases to the point where what they stand for is no longer recognizable.And THIS\u200a\u2014\u200aABC\u2019s self-inflicted scars that will forever exist immutably on the blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200ahas led to a blockchain I can no longer build on.I normally dislike writing because I would rather spend time building, and I prefer showing by doing, but at this time I realize I am in a very unique position of being the ONLY developer in the entire Bitcoin Cash ecosystem who has deliberately stayed politically unbiased, so I decided to contribute to the next phase.Who is _unwriter?First some background, here\u2019s who I am:I work on two useful infrastructure projects in Bitcoin Cash ecosystem:BitDB: Decentralized Database for Bitcoin https://bitdb.networkBitSocket: Realtime Message Bus for Bitcoin https://bitsocket.orgThey power bitcoin applications such as craft.cash, oyo.cash, trends.cash, matter, simple ledger protocol, memopay.xyz, and many more you probably have heard of at least once if you\u2019re a Bitcoin Cash user.Next, about my identity. I proudly have exactly zero moral hazard. I have exactly zero conflict of interest. I am unaffiliated with ANY of the actors in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. There is exactly 0 person who knows who I am. Nobody has met me, nobody knows my voice, nobody funded me, I took donations from nobody, I have zero debts from anyone in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem, both figuratively and literally.I have only created what Bitcoin needed, and will continue to do so. There are some very exciting projects on the way I will soon release. And you will learn that BitDB, Bitquery, and Bitsocket have just been preludes to what I\u2019m actually trying to build.Lastly, I am expressing myself here NOT as a follower, but as a chooser. I am \u201cchoosing\u201d the blockchain I choose. I only pick the most superior blockchain because my projects deserve better.Is this enough credibility for you? Or are you going to call me a shill and close this page? If you are a rational person, at least try to read till the end, because all I want is to collaborate with all of you and move forward in the right direction instead of fighting. And no matter which situation you\u2019re in, it\u2019s not too late. You decide.The Importance of Capitalists in\u00a0BitcoinI posted a public message to Bitcoin application developers last week:The application developers are the \u201ccapitalists\u201d of the \u201cnation\u201d of Bitcoin.

They notice opportunities and act on them.I have been saying this\u200a\u2014\u200athat Bitcoin needs to attract application developers and the only way to do so is by signaling dedication to scalability, stability and openness instead of adding some new feature\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the beginning.

A person who is searching for \u201cblockchain education\u201d may have several motivations that are reflected in the search query. That person\u2019s search query connotes a strong desire to learn more about blockchain technology. Google would then show these results on the SERPs (Search Engine Results Page) where Extracredit would be placed in a prominent position. Studies conducted on heat maps will reflect this positioning on the page and with a properly run campaign could generate higher click through rates.The same thing applies in video campaigns. YouTube and other Google partner sites with niche specific content would be exposed to a targeted campaign. Sites running Google\u2019s Adsense program would benefit greatly through an ad revenue sharing paradigm which would mean revenue generated through the content. At the same time, ExtraCredit could gain more exposure as well as offer allied services and opportunities that maximize the context of the content.A good example for these are bitcoin and blockchain related YouTube channels. As Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies elicit the interest of the general public, they go on YouTube to educate themselves. Blockchain and cryptocurrency specific YouTube channels often discuss niche specific topics that are related to ExtraCredit\u2019s target demographics.

Yet already, there are more than a thousand cryptocurrencies in the market and an initial coin offering (ICO) almost daily.As we embrace this new, proliferous market, it\u2019s important that we try to understand what\u2019s going on. There are many risks to observe at both the micro-level (e.g., personal investments) and macro-level (e.g., prevention of market crashes and major loss of capital). That\u2019s where we come in.We\u2019re data people. Specifically, we\u2019re the developers of TimescaleDB, a new open source time-series database built up from PostgreSQL. And we thought it would be insightful (and fun) to analyze the cryptocurrency market using PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB (plus R for data visualization).For this analysis*, we looked at historical OHLCV price data on over 1200 cryptocurrencies (as of 6/26/2017; courtesy of CryptoCompare). While our current dataset represents only a daily record of rates, TimescaleDB scales easily to much finer-grained historical data. With the constant influx of new coins and exchanges, TimescaleDB can provide a reliable foundation for time-series data in the cryptocurrency market.Here\u2019s what you should take away from this post:Several high-level insights into the cryptocurrency marketA better understanding of how TimescaleDB + PostgreSQL make time-series data analysis easierInstructions on how to load this dataset yourself and draw your own insights (and perhaps find your own arbitrage opportunities!)*Please note that nothing in this analysis should be construed as financial advice. If you\u2019d like to draw your own conclusions, here are instructions to install TimescaleDB and download this cryptocurrency dataset.So if you had invested $100 in Bitcoin 7 years ago, it would be\u00a0worth\u2026Let\u2019s start with some good old-fashioned FOMO. If you know anything about cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ve probably heard of Bitcoin, the \u201cgranddaddy\u201d of all cryptocurrencies. Turns out that if you had invested $100 in Bitcoin in July 2010, it would be worth over $5,000,000 today.Bitcoin has had a pretty nice run since then (although taking a small dip recently):BTC closing price in USD over the last seven\u00a0yearsUsing PostgreSQL, we\u2019ve queried BTC\u2019s prices at 2-week intervals, analyzing the rates for USD exchanges. (Note that \u201ctime_bucket\u201d and \u201clast\u201d in this query are special TimescaleDB time-series data analysis functions not in PostgreSQL.)But hopefully you didn\u2019t buy in February\u00a02014\u2026It hasn\u2019t exactly been a smooth ride for BTC. Let\u2019s hone in on the day-by-day volatility of BTC. Here we calculate daily returns using the power of PostgreSQL window functions:BTC daily return (as a factor of the previous day\u2019s rate) over the last seven\u00a0yearsAs a relatively new market, bitcoin prices are notably subject to volatile fluctuations. While a steady increase in price marks the success of BTC, the highest spike occurred in early 2014. If we zoom in on 2014, we notice that the jump occurred specifically between February and March of 2014. For those who invested at the peak of this market, the price soon stabilized, forcing investors who bought then to hold for a long time to see returns.BTC daily return (as a factor of the previous day\u2019s rate) over\u00a02014Goodbye China, hello\u00a0JapanThe cryptocurrency market is global. When looking at trade volumes by currency, we noticed something interesting:Volume of BTC in different fiat currencies over the last seven years (in 14 day intervals, stacked)The year 2014 saw a minor jump for Bitcoin rates in China, presumably caused by the devaluation of the yuan and weakening domestic stock market. This was followed by a subsequent boom in 2016 and early 2017, as Chinese volume dominated Bitcoin trades.Volume of BTC in CNY over the last year (in 14 day intervals)Within a few months, the volumes dropped dramatically.Why? This is where we had to step out of the numbers and do some old-fashioned research. (And what we found shows how you can\u2019t just rely on quantitative data when trying to understand this market.)In early 2017 the People\u2019s Bank of China began reinforcing regulations and legal liabilities for risky cryptocurrency exchanges. By February, two of the largest Chinese exchanges (OKCoin and Huobi.com) had suspended withdrawals and by mid-2017, Chinese transactions had dried up. From there, Japan became the leader in bitcoin transactions by volume, even going so far as to recognizing bitcoin as legal currency in April 2017.Volume of BTC in all currencies after BTC/CNY dropped in 2017. BTC/JPY is now volume leader. (In 14 day intervals, stacked).Now, if you had invested $100 in ETH in January\u00a02017\u2026.Don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t hop onto the Bitcoin train in 2010. As volatile as Bitcoin has been, some would argue that Ethereum has been a crazier ride (and the recent \u201ccorrection\u201d shows it). Let\u2019s look at the Ethereum price over time in Bitcoin (as it\u2019s normally quoted):Last closing price of ETH in BTC over the last three\u00a0yearsBut as we know, Bitcoin itself has been fairly volatile, which renders the above chart less useful. So let\u2019s look at ETH prices in fiat currencies, using each day\u2019s BTC to fiat exchange rates. (Taking advantage of Postgres JOINs and some fancy filters):Last closing price of ETH in three different fiat currencies over the last three\u00a0yearsIn its first year, ETH surpassed any yearly BTC growth rate in all of BTC history\u200a\u2014\u200aa hefty 530% surge in average closing price from the previous year marked a good start. Cumulatively, the growth has since fallen to 200% going from 2016 to 2017, though still an impressively high rate for any other asset. And within the last half year, ETH prices have increased by 3000%. So, if you had invested $100 in ETH in January 2017 (less than 7 months ago), it would be worth over $3,000 today.Projecting the price of ETH in these stable currencies (USD, EUR, CNY), it appears that the trend lines remain consistent between the three fiat monies. A clear progression is apparent in the steep uprise within the last six months and trends reflect a massive growth for the coin when quoted in all currencies, except BTC. Relative to the fiat charts, the ETH/BTC chart is quite unstable due to the fluctuating price of BTC over the years. As a result, the representation of ETH by BTC price inflates the variability of ETH. Clearly BTC is still too immature to be considered a base currency.What about the 1200 other cryptocurrencies??With that brief examination of BTC and ETH trends, hopefully you have more context into the hectic world of cryptocurrencies. So what do we do with the other 1200 cryptocurrencies?Well first, let\u2019s use our dataset to trace the lineage of these cryptocurrencies:(Disclaimer: our dataset represents when we first have recorded data, which may not necessarily correspond to the ICO.)Date of first record for each cryptocurrency (listed by descending date)It\u2019s an evolving market. And one with no clear ceiling, as we can see when we query the number of new cryptocurrencies by day. Above are just the most recent 20 records, showing how many new currencies amass each week.Here\u2019s a look at that same day, but counting the number of new currencies with data each day:Number of new cryptocurrencies in the dataset, by day, over the last four\u00a0yearsNumber of new cryptocurrencies in the dataset, by day, in\u00a02017Number of new cryptocurrencies in the dataset, by day (listed by descending date)When we query each of the currencies by their first set of data (to track its \u201cage\u201d), it\u2019s clear that the market is not simply for investors, but also for creators of these digital assets. Most recently, a flood of new coins entered our dataset during May 25\u201328, amounting to over 300 new cryptocurrency records in less than a week. (Of course, these dates reflect when our data source first had price data for the currencies, which may not correspond to the ICO.)Who\u2019s at the head of the cryptocurrency long\u00a0tail?There are so many cryptocurrencies that it becomes hard to separate the good ones from the noise. How do we identify which ones worth focusing on? Here\u2019s one metric: total trade volume over the past week.Total transaction volume in USD for top 10 currencies over the past week (ranked by volume)Total transaction volume in USD for top 10 currencies over the past week (ranked by\u00a0volume)Quick note on what this query is doing: The BTC and crypto-currency data lives in separate tables. So we have to UNION the two queries. Also, as we established earlier, we want to quote volumes in a fiat currency (e.g., USD) and not BTC. So the second half of the query joins with the BTC table to convert BTC to USD.Top cryptocurrencies (measuring by transaction volume) are (not surprisingly) Bitcoin and Ethereum. But after that, seems like Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum Classic (ETC) are not far off. As a five-year old coin, Litecoin is almost identical to Bitcoin and is often considered a key player in the market. Meanwhile, Ripple targets a more specific audience as a banking coin in the global commerce arena, also showing promise as a progressively dominant coin. Interestingly in the top 5 for our query, both ETH and ETC make appearances, suggesting a major shift towards Ethereum in the market.What are the most profitable cryptocurrencies?Another way to sift through the long tail of cryptocurrencies is by profitability (e.g., as measured by total daily return). Our data contains a set of prices for over 1200 cryptocurrencies. If we hone in on the highest increase in rate by day, we can see which cryptocurrencies lead the daily market.Highest daily return and corresponding cryptocurrency (listed by descending date)Here we identify the cryptocurrency with the highest total daily return, by day, going backwards in time. (To do that, we again use a window function to calculate daily returns, and then use the TimescaleDB last function to find the cryptocurrency with the highest return for that day.)Our output for the last three months shows a numeric lead by AMIS (168x on 6/15), which appears as the cryptocurrency with the top increase for 15 distinct days. However, if we look more closely at AMIS\u2019 rates, we realize that this high increase is also due to high fluctuation rates: AMIS tends to drop back to a closing price of zero after each increase.Closing price of AMIS over the last\u00a0yearLikewise, the cryptocurrency YOVI appears 3 times in our list of daily leads but has a similarly unreliable trend like AMIS:Closing price of YOVI over the last\u00a0yearWhile both trends are rather unstable, they show more promise than ETH\u2019s down-sloping first year (2015):Closing price of ETH in\u00a02015(Repeat Disclaimer: TimescaleDB does not endorse any of these cryptocurrencies and is not liable for investments that you make / losses you may incur.)So money grows on\u2026 Merkle\u00a0Trees?Here we drew some conclusions from public cryptocurrency datasets, highlighting the power of both PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB. Yet we should remember that the cryptocurrency market will inevitably be different next month, week, even day.But if you\u2019d like to explore this dataset and draw your own conclusions, here are the instructions for downloading it (and installing TimescaleDB).If you\u2019d like to learn more about TimescaleDB, and how it makes PostgreSQL scalable for time-series data, we\u2019d recommend this technical post.", "responses": "48"}, {"title": "Ivy for Bitcoin: a smart contract language that compiles to Bitcoin\u00a0Script", "author_name": "Chain", "link": "https://blog.chain.com/ivy-for-bitcoin-a-smart-contract-language-that-compiles-to-bitcoin-script-bec06377141a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 18, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "2.7K", "content": "Ivy for Bitcoin: a smart contract language that compiles to Bitcoin\u00a0ScriptChainBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 18, 2017Peter Todd\u2019s SHA1 collision bounty, written in\u00a0IvyToday, we\u2019re delighted to release an open-source compiler and developer environment for writing Bitcoin smart contracts using Ivy, a smart contract language developed at Chain. Ivy helps you write custom, SegWit-compatible Bitcoin addresses that enforce arbitrary combinations of conditions supported by the Bitcoin protocol, including signature checks, hash commitments, and timelocks.Ivy is designed to make it easy to manipulate value the way other programming languages let you manipulate data. You can try out Ivy using the Ivy Playground for Bitcoin, and read more about it in the docs. (Please note that Ivy is relatively untested prototype software and should be used for educational and research purposes only.)How Bitcoin smart contracts workIf you\u2019re interested in blockchain networks, you\u2019ve probably heard of \u201csmart contracts\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aprograms that can control on-chain resources using custom logic executed as part of blockchain validation. This concept is usually associated with Ethereum, which supports stateful, Turing-complete smart contracts. But did you know that you can also write smart contracts for the Bitcoin network?Bitcoin allows you to write such contracts using a low-level programming language, Bitcoin Script. Every Bitcoin address corresponds to a Bitcoin Script program.When you send bitcoins to an address, you are essentially locking them in a safety deposit box on the blockchain. These boxes are typically referred to as \u201cunspent transaction outputs,\u201d but we\u2019ll refer to them as \u201ccontracts.\u201d Each contract has an address, which corresponds to a program that must be satisfied in order to unlock and spend the bitcoins.Bitcoin Script is the low-level \u201cassembly language\u201d used to write custom addresses in the Bitcoin protocol. Programs in Bitcoin Script look like this:A Bitcoin Script program from BIP 112, by BtcDrak, Mark Friedenbach, and Eric\u00a0LombrozoBitcoin\u2019s \u201cvirtual machine\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe piece of the protocol responsible for executing Bitcoin Script programs\u200a\u2014\u200ais far more limited than the virtual machines used in other smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum or the Chain Protocol, and its instruction set is not even Turing-complete. But Bitcoin Script does provide a set of useful primitives\u200a\u2014\u200asignature checks, hash computations, and absolute and relative timelocks\u200a\u2014\u200aand the freedom to combine those primitives.Right now, Bitcoin Script is used by relatively few people. Bitcoin wallets, exchanges, and payment platforms sometimes use Bitcoin Script to create security solutions, like multisignature wallets. Protocol developers have used Bitcoin Script to design interesting solutions for scaling, privacy, and interoperability, such as Interledger and the Lightning Network. But Bitcoin Script development is considered somewhat esoteric.One reason for this is the limitations of the underlying virtual machine, but another is the relative difficulty of reading and writing Bitcoin Script programs, and of creating and using addresses from those programs.Introducing IvyIvy is a higher-level language that supports compilation to Bitcoin Script. Ivy programs look like this (explained here):The same Bitcoin Script program as above, written as a contract template in\u00a0IvyIvy is a language for writing contract templates. Each contract template, when instantiated with specific parameters, can compile to a Bitcoin address (specifically, a Segregated Witness-compatible address).To try out Ivy, you can use the Ivy Playground for Bitcoin, which allows you to design, create, and spend simulated Bitcoin contracts. The playground includes preloaded templates demonstrating a small fraction of possible contracts. The docs explain those examples and describe how you can use the playground to write and test your own contracts.We hope that Ivy makes it easier to learn about Bitcoin, smart contracts, and programmable value. We can\u2019t wait to see what you do with it.AcknowledgementsWe\u2019d like to thank Boyma Fahnbulleh, Andrew Miller, Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, Patrick McCorry, Jeremy Rubin, Steven McKie, Olaoluwa Osuntokun, Kathleen Breitman, and Nick Szabo for their feedback on Ivy.

Tyler Jenks and Leah WaldOur PremiseWe contend that the world financial system has journeyed down an unsustainable path where unconstrained debt growth has become uncontrollable. We believe that this condition will be resolved in one of five ways. In general, each of these five solutions eliminates the other four. These five solutions are 1) a bitcoin standard, 2) a gold standard, 3) a new commodity/currency basket, 4) economic growth, and 5) default on sovereign debt. In this series of five articles, we will examine each of these five solutions. In this first article, we will examine Bitcoin as a solution to the world debt problem.According to The Institute of International Finance (IIF), the total world debt is roughly estimated to be $247 trillion. By the 2018 year end, the total world wealth was estimated to be $317 trillion. But most significantly, total world debt increased 394% over the past 20 years, from $50 trillion to $247 trillion, while total world wealth increased 133% over the same period.To understand the nature and extent of the problem, it\u2019s necessary to conceptualize the probable assets that are available to offset the debt. Simply put, a budgetary deficit is when you spend more than you receive during the year and a surplus is when you spend less than you receive during the year. Debt occurs when deficits exceed surpluses. Debt is increased by further running deficits; however, debt can be reduced by running surpluses.Another way of reducing debt is to reduce wealth by using the proceeds of that reduction to pay down debt. When wealth becomes zero, it is no longer possible to use this method.An additional way of reducing debt is increasing income, sufficiently, to use the additional income to pay down debt. You can also reduce expenditures, sufficiently, so that existing income can reduce debt.The problem occurs when any and all combinations of these strategies is/are insufficient to pay down debt, which subsequently keeps growing.The Relevant NumbersIt is necessary to examine the available assets at the world\u2019s disposal that are \u201cavailable\u201d, i.e. can be sold or traded for debt reduction. Only major pockets of wealth will be considered during this examination.The following are important data points. These are difficult numbers to come by and even more difficult to assess. After examining numerous sources, the following numbers seem to be most statistically reliable. Even so, these numbers can vary as much as +/\u200a\u2014\u200a20% from source to source.-World Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to be $80 trillion, with the 10 biggest contributors being:The United States $19.4 trillionChina $12.2 trillionJapan $ 4.9 trillionGermany $ 3.7 trillionThe United Kingdom $ 2.6 trillionIndia $ 2.6 trillionFrance $ 2.6 trillionBrazil $ 2.1 trillionItaly $ 1.9 trillionCanada $ 1.7 trillionTotal $53.6 trillion (52% of total GDP)-According to the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, the total world wealth is $317 trillion:National Net Wealth:The United States $98 trillionChina $51 trillionJapan $23 trillionGermany $14.5 trillionThe United Kingdom $14.2 trillionFrance $13.8 trillionItaly $10.6 trillionCanada $8.3 trillionAustralia $7.6 trillion-According to Savills World Research the total value of world real estate is estimated to be $228 trillion:Residential $168.5 trillionCommercial $ 32.3 trillionAgricultural/Forestry $ 27.2 trillion-According to The CIA World Factbook the Total World Money is estimated to be $80 trillion:China $25 trillionThe United States $14 trillionJapan $8.9 trillionEuropean Union $8,1 trillionGermany $3.2 trillionThe United Kingdom $3.1 trillionFrance $2.3 trillionSouth Korea $2.1 trillionIndia $2.1 trillionHong Kong $1.8 trillionBrazil $1.7 trillionItaly $1.7 trillionAustralia $1.6 trillionCanada $1.5 trillionTaiwan $1.4 trillionSpain $1.3 trillionSwitzerland $1.3 trillion-The total world stock market capitalization is approximately $73 trillion.

This assumes a total gold supply of 187,200 metric tons. Only a small percentage of this is held by individual countries. The following are the 20 largest sovereign holders:US 8.1 thousand metric tonsGermany 3.3 thousand metric tonsIMF 2.8 thousand metric tonsItaly 2.5 thousand metric tonsFrance 2.4 thousand metric tonsRussia 2.1 thousand metric tonsChina 1.8 thousand metric tonsSwitzerland 1.0 thousand metric tonsJapan\u00a0.7 thousand metric tonsNetherlands\u00a0.6 thousand metric tonsIndia\u00a0.6 thousand metric tonsEuropean Union\u00a0.5 thousand metric tonsTaiwan\u00a0.4 thousand metric tonsPortugal\u00a0.4 thousand metric tonsKazakhstan\u00a0.3 thousand metric tonsSaudi Arabia\u00a0.3 thousand metric tonsThe United Kingdom\u00a0.3 thousand metric tonsLebanon\u00a0.3 thousand metric tonsSpain\u00a0.3 thousand metric tonsAustria\u00a0.3 thousand metric tonsBelgium\u00a0.2 thousand metric tonsPhilippines\u00a0.2 thousand metric tonsObservationsThese numbers are not inclusive but we believe they are adequate. We welcome additions, deletions, and corrections. Many of the categories include other categories, in whole or in part. For example, pension funds are generally composed of stocks, bonds real estate and other categories. Mutual funds include stocks, bonds, cash, currencies, and even real estate. We are assuming most readers can make similar observations. Sovereign wealth funds are often commodity based but also hold stocks, bonds, currencies, and real estate. As mentioned above, there are considerable differences in estimates of the numbers presented, +/- 20% should be assumed.Even so, these numbers and categories are to us conclusive. They paint a picture of a grotesque imbalance with an ever-growing total debt dwarfing wealth. They also demonstrate the growing inequality of distributed wealth within regions of the world, countries, and families. We have concluded that these trends are no longer viable and will soon force, through one of five alternatives, a solution. In this, and the following four articles, we will examine each of these solutions.Bitcoin As A Solution To The Debt ProblemIf Bitcoin climbs to $10 million per Bitcoin, it could provide the world community with a stable currency, replace sovereign currencies, and act as the reserve currency of the world incapable of inflation or deflation. It would represent the ultimate \u201cStore of Value\u201d.Is this feasible? Probably not. But we believe it is possible and we believe it offers the greatest benefits with the least collateral damage to the least number of individuals, corporations, institutions, and countries. Most importantly, it would provide a permanent fix, a quality that none of the other solutions provide.This article is titled \u201cThe Long and Winding Road to $10 million Bitcoin\u201d. We can picture that road. It looks something like this:Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency space is in total disarray. However, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.The first step was taken in The White Paper by Satoshi Nakamoto.The second step was taken by those people who believed in the fundamentals of the concept.The next several steps were stumbles and fall with the introduction of centralized projects introduced as \u201cimprovements\u201d to the original. To date, Bitcoin is the only completely decentralized concept, which is distinguished by its absolute limit on supply. Bitcoin has no legal structure, no copyrights, no trademarks, no executives, no board of governors, no board of trustees, no executive committees, and no budgets. No one to change the rules; no one to inflate the supply. Bitcoin is open source and available to all.Bitcoin will never die as long as we can buy it from you or you from us. This is its great strength and Achilles Tendon. It allows anyone to steal its genius without recourse. Over 4,000 projects have done just that. All of these projects have crippled the entire space. None of them provide what Bitcoin promises, nor can they.Bitcoin stands alone, but almost no one understands this, not participants, not investors, not institutions, not regulators, not sovereign entities. Tiny progress has been made with the S.E.C. drawing a distinction between Bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency.Too little, too late.The damage has been done and the tremendous promise has diminished. Just as the markets have responded to the confusion by gutting the appreciation of market cap and price of all participants, we believe the market will recognize and embrace the uniqueness of Bitcoin. But, not yet.The next big step in this journey will be the utter decimation of altcoins, ICOs and the realization of the important attributes of Bitcoin. That process has begun, but the regulators must regulate. We believe they will. During this time, Bitcoin will continue to lose value, but at a much slower rate than its competitors.At some point, this process will find a conclusion; maybe this year, possibly next year, probably the following year. To us, this is all very clear. What is not clear is what steps will then be taken. The rest of this article will lay out what the road ahead might look like for Bitcoin to take its necessary role in this macroeconomic landscape.The Road AheadBitcoin is a market-driven asset; the most democratic market-driven asset in history. Its price movement is based on pure supply-demand economics. The supply is fixed a known quantity. The only variable in this price equation is demand. When demand rises, so does the price. When it falls, so does the price.Why did the price increase from pennies to $20,000 over 7 years? Demand.Why has it fallen from $20,000 to $3,200? Lack of demand.This is the quintessence of market forces at work.This corrosive consumer confusion is due to the plethora of competing stories, projects, alternative coins, ICOs, regulatory indecision, and regulatory jurisdictions. This has become so intense that there are very few incremental buyers. The price will continue to deteriorate until this condition changes until the opaque again becomes transparent.Let\u2019s stipulate that Bitcoin survives and the vast majority of competing projects do not. This antidote dissipates confusion.Adoption will quickly increase, individual by individual, as the fog of confusion clears. As a democratic market driven asset, Bitcoin increases in price with each individual decision to purchase Bitcoin with fiat money.The list of the pockets of wealth that we have included in the statistics above will one by one begin buying Bitcoin. This will occur immediately after this bear market ends. We will attempt to identify where the significant potholes lie in the road ahead and which pockets of wealth will help to pave over those potholes.What will the road ahead look like?Here is our roadmap:When the final bottom is in, which we believe will be below $1,000, the road will be clear up to $6,000. Above $6,000, there will be minor bumps at $7,500 and also at $8,500. The range between $10,100 to $11,100 will be the second major challenge. Above that, resistance will fall quickly. However, additional resistance appears at $13,750, and $17,500, which will be tested and overcome. New highs above $19,666 remain the final barrier.At this point the media is frenzied. Price, price, price. Full speed ahead.Now, the road is smooth, the steps quicken. The pockets of wealth come into play. Hedge funds, family offices, and additional individual investors, those who missed the previous three bull markets, flood the market at a quickening pace. Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization dominance rises to over 90% speeding the deterioration of remaining altcoins. Investor psychology quickly shifts from caution to certainty. $50,000 and $100,000 are temporary but significant hurdles. Momentum players of all stripes increase their holdings, further forcing latecomers to act.Pause here for a moment to consider Bitcoin at $100,000. At this price, the market capitalization of Bitcoin is $1.7 trillion. Where did the money come from? It came from the worldwide stock market of $73 trillion. It came from hedge funds with assets of $3.1 trillion.Gold assets, $7.5 trillion, represent an important potential demand for Bitcoin. We believe that the single most important barrier to Bitcoin\u2019s price is overtaking the value of the gold supply. At $100,000, Bitcoin begins to challenge gold as a store of value. We believe that gold investors will not be reluctant to make this switch. Assets begin to move from gold to Bitcoin, slowly at first, and then rapidly.If gold investors are reluctant to sell gold for Bitcoin, its price will have to rise to $400,000 to equal the gold stock. If we are correct and gold is sold for Bitcoin, this equilibrium will be reached at lower prices.In a future article, we will examine how a gold standard is a solution to the world debt problem. A gold standard is a more probable choice for world governments and thus the necessity of Bitcoin challenging gold cannot be overstated.If we have to wait for $400,000 to be reached then the demand has come from the Cowboys, those investors with free-hand in asset selection. Now the road becomes narrower, bumpier with many twists, turns, and switchbacks. Much more difficult to navigate. The pace will slow.Three things must occur at this price level to continue the run up to $1 million. First, the core developers must have delivered on the promise of speed, transparency, and cost. Already much has been accomplished. We assume that developers, worldwide, will begin abandoning non-Bitcoin projects and return to the fold. The non-tech world must have confidence in the integrity of Bitcoin. Second, institutions must begin to embrace Bitcoin, but Bitcoin, not in words but in action. Fidelity will play an enormous role in institutional adoption. It is one of the institutional giants. It has pioneered enormous foresight, innovation, and reliability to the financial framework we today enjoy. It has over 26 million accounts, 27 million investors, and almost $7 trillion AUM. Fidelity has taken great interest in Bitcoin. Thirdly, regulators, not only in the U.S. but worldwide, must make absolutely clear the distinction between Bitcoin and all others.This accomplished, the road to $1 million will smooth and straighten. The hurdles will be $1 million both psychologically and financially. At $1 million, Bitcoin will have a market cap of $18 trillion. It will be in the major league of asset classes and pockets of wealth. It will be a contender. As the fastest growing asset class in world history, it will no longer be ignored by pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, institutional money managers, endowments, financial institutions, and even governments. These will fuel the trip, at high speed to $10 million.Is that a big jump? Absolutely! Is it possible? Yes.Why $10 million? At that level, Bitcoin would provide a sufficient reserve to alleviate the world debt burden. Bitcoin would be worth between $180 trillion and $210 trillion (depending on when that price was reached). Assuming world debt had reached $500 trillion at that time, remember it has grown by 394% over the past 20 years, Bitcoin would represent a 40% reserve against the debt.What would a Bitcoin Standard look like? The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous provides a detailed framework of previous reserves against sovereign fiat. The subtitle, \u201cThe Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking\u201d, indicates his major objective in writing this book.Ask yourself, who then would own Bitcoin? The answer, if we assume a $10 million Bitcoin, is central banks, the banking system, large institutions, and sovereign wealth funds.How did they get them? They bought them from you.Why did you sell them? At what point were satisfied with your gains? Each of us will be incented at very different levels to take our profits.Each pocket of wealth that we have described has its own objective. The objective, at this point for central banks, is to save the system and keep their power intact. They have only five choices and none of them are good. This is their best choice. We will explore the other four in our next articles to examine why we believe Bitcoin is the best alternative of the five.Do we believe Bitcoin will be chosen? That is the wrong question.The right question is: will there be a choice?Alternatively, will the economic disequilibrium force resolution, probably default?", "responses": "27"}, {"title": "Let\u2019s talk about this Bitcoin\u00a0Bubble", "author_name": "Ouriel Ohayon", "link": "https://startupsventurecapital.com/lets-talk-about-this-bitcoin-bubble-8aa8db926d42?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 19, 2017", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "2.7K", "content": "Let\u2019s talk about this Bitcoin\u00a0BubbleOuriel OhayonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 19, 2017The next most popular word in any crypto conversation next to \u201cBitcoin\u201d is certainly \u201cBubble\u201d. There is no way to avoid any sort of reference to it. For some reason people are absolutely convinced there is a Bubble.While it may be the case, i would argue the the vast majority of people who declare that don\u2019t understand why this is one, hiding behind the hyper growth this space is going through.Their main argument can be summarized like this \u201cBitcoin has zero value, certainly not any sort of currency since you can\u2019t buy anything with it, it ruins the world electricity and is mostly speculation\u201d. So the logical next conclusion: it will crash. Some go further and will call it a fraud.Headlines like those are \u201cBubbling\u201dLet\u2019s unpack this.Bitcoin has zero\u00a0valueValue is a relative concept. It\u2019s nothing more than a story than a group of people want to believe. If at a certain age, stones were considered as being valuable to enable an \u201ceconomy\u201d, they had value because enough people agreed that was the case. Do stone have any sort of value in themselves? zero. A common belief in an organized society is the founding principle of this relative concept. Of course stones did not last long as a value reference. Other assets came laterGold in itself had zero value at first. It\u2019s a shiny stone. It has one particularity. It is rare. The first people who found gold had no idea it was going to be valuable. Soon enough governments and banks adopted it a reference to define and guarantee value to money. The reason Gold has value is because a group of people believed based on the scarcity of this asset (and other properties like durability) that this was good enough as a story.The money we currently use is not any different. Paper has zero value in itself but the story this is issued by a government we trust (most of the time) and that has reserves in a commonly agreed value (gold for eg) is a story everyone wants to believe. Until they don\u2019t (see hyper deflationary economies like Venezuela or Zimbabwe)Saying Bitcoin has zero value is ignoring profoundly the way it is produced, stored, secured and governed. Curiously though, the notion of digital scarcity is nothing new: we know it already in many fields. 3 letter domain names are an example, video games digital rewards are another example (have you ever played pokemon go or candy crush?). Focusing on Bitcoin as a piece of software with some bits without understanding the fundamentals behind it and the network effect that has enabled the fact that close to 16 million out of 21 million bitcoins have been distributed, is like trying to give value to an empty database.You have enough people that *today* believe or want to believe this digital, decentralized, hard to produce, hard to store and highly secure scarce digital asset has value.What this value is really worth, is nothing more than subject to the power of law and demand. But let me ask you: Is privatejet.com really worths tens of millions of dollars? Enough people including those who bought it believe so. And it does not matter you agree or not. So is that a Bubble? more on that later.It\u2019s not a\u00a0currencyWhat can you buy with Bitcoin today? nada.\u201cYou see, i told ya?\u201d will tell you the detractors.Let\u2019s put aside the fact that Bitcoin has become a de facto currency in countries where economies, banking and trust models have crashed (like Venezuela). And let\u2019s put aside countries like Japan where tens of thousands of physical retailers accept bitcoin for payment or that companies start to pay their employees in Bitcoin. Can you pay anything in Bitcoin today? And is this how Bitcoin should be judged?Japan: ahead of the world in Bitcoin\u00a0paymentMy understanding is the following: It does not have to be a currency yet. At least not today. It does not matter either than the layers for fast and cheap payment be already there, although this is the initial vision of Satoshi Nakomoto in his famous white paper. If you\u2019re trying to find in Bitcoin an alternative currency you\u2019re going the wrong path.Bitcoin has been around for 10 years in search for a path to adoption. It finally found it and now millions of people are jumping in. But the story that is driving this adoption is not the story of an immediate alternative or even better currency. It\u2019s the story of store of value. The main \u201cfunction\u201d of Bitcoin today is about owning it, not spending it. In other words buying and owning bitcoin IS using bitcoin. It is a perfectly valid story and one that can lead of a bigger story in a second step: Bitcoin as a currency.What do you think will happen when 100+ million people will hold some bitcoin? The world will have to pay attention and build around it. Even our dear central banks will have to pay attention\u2026Now here is where most people i believe get it wrong. When a new paradigm arrive, it is a mistake to try to apply the old rules to a new world. No one is saying Bitcoin is going to replace your dear FIAT money. What is more likely to happen is that a new breed of services and economy will be built around it and that will be native to that industry.When Http / ftp /smtp were invented: whoever tried to think how this could improved the printed news industry got it wrong. The idea was more to try to imagine businesses that would not have been possible otherwise and when enough machines got in the hands of consumers, suddenly we ended up with domain names being worth millions of dollars and native-to-the-web services like eBay and Yahoo and Google.What business will be born out of that massive adoption of Bitcoin? Patience. We \u2018re witnessing a massive adoption of a new store of Value that will give birth to a new sort of economy. When enough people start to own something that they believe is worth something, then a new economy start to grow and then the \u201ccurrency\u201d model or better said the \u201cvalue exchange\u201d models start to appear.Don\u2019t try to apply a model where you day to day coffee will taste better because you pay in Bitcoin.It ruins the world electricityYes cryptos are GPU and electricity massive black holes. They consume lot of powers. But should they be stopped because they do that? I can think of two or three industries that are ruining the world in order of magnitude and produce nothing good in exchange (yes i am looking at you Guns and Toys and Cigarettes).Assuming the production of bitcoin will remain as little \u201cenvironmental friendly\u201d forever is a typical mistake of analysis you see in many paradigm shifts. It\u2019s like trying to say the internet will never be any good because it runs on AOL modems, or that printers should be terminated because it used to take them 1 day and a gazillion ink to print half a page of paper. Hardware is getting better, software is getting better and energy production is getting better ALL THE TIME.So let\u2019s stop the sensationalism right here and look forward, never forgetting the industry is in flux.It\u2019s a Bubble. It will\u00a0crash.Breaking news#1: Crashing is what crytpos are doing best. This is nothing new. Bitcoin should have died 10 times and has crashed many times.Breaking news #2: Yes but it will crash again. Big time. Of course it will. So what? Those markets live and die by continuous massive corrections. This is how they develop and penetrate our lives step by step. Ignoring that fundamental quality is a major mistake. Crypto protocols (the best one) have a form of resiliency that is specific to them and which is precisely make them incredibly valuable.I would also argue that Bubbles are a good thing. Bubbles is what gave birth to the radio industry, the TV industry and the internet as we know it today. They are painful when they happen and cause lot of damages, but those damages are collaterals in comparison to the outstanding outcome.Now i would refrain to compare Crypto Bubbles to The great internet Bubble we had 20 years ago. Indeed when the internet bubble popped there was a MAJOR difference: no one had a computers. Today everyone is connected and potentially at 2 taps from owning cryptos. The world has never been more apt and mature to adopt a new paradigm shift. And that\u2019s precisely why the adoption curve happens now at an unprecedented speed.And for those really wanting to compare the internet bubble to the \u201ccrypto Bubble\u201d remember this: when the internet Bubble exploded it was worth 1.7 trillion dollars. Something like 3x the total market of the crypto industry today. So before you call it the \u201cbiggest bubble of all time\u201d (see above) \u2192 get informedBut should we dismiss Bitcoin because it\u2019s a Bubble? There is a lot of good reasons to be really skeptical about the future of Bitcoin: is the protocol safe and secure enough? Will an upcoming fork break it? Can governments create 51% attack to crash it (maybe via quantum computing, or by nationalizing mining)? Will another protocol take over because more efficient and better designed? And i can go on and on.Get informed, please.But i would argue the Bubble pattern is actually a necessary and good thing to its development. It\u2019s not the reason it should be dismissedWhat worries me seriously right now is that most people who came to own lately Bitcoin have very little or no understanding of it\u200a\u2014\u200aand that is a major change compare to a year ago. And those who cover Bitcoin in the media are only interested in spectacular headlines (showing at the same time poor understanding and misguiding their readers). Actually, if any, that could be the first major cause of Market Crash, because those people are not \u201cequipped\u201d to digest what will inevitably happen: a strong market correction.This is the unfortunate level of information we have to deal\u00a0withGet ready for the \u201ci told you so\u201d, \u201cband of fools\u201d,\u2026The world is in dire need for better education about what crypto is, how it works and how security works. We need more information, more responsible coverage, less sensationalismPeople not liking or not believing in cryptos is absolutely fine. That\u2019s everyone\u2019s right. I do have problem with people who come with superficial arguments and are lazy about their analysis. We had people (including very smart) dismissing the internet in the early days, dismissing social networks (i still have the scars on me for being an early supporter of Twitter), dismissing the iPhone (Right Steve Ballmer?), dismissing Mobile apps and their business potential. And we do have now people dismissing cryptos. That\u2019s what happens in innovation Cycles. They all share a common pattern: the inability to look beyond the immediacy of the current paradigm and a resistance to change.And don\u2019t get me wrong: i don\u2019t want Bitcoin to succeed at all cost (and not any other crypto for that matter). I am very bullish about the future but also have many reserves, but it s important to shed some lights and dismiss the easy critics that have weak basis and focus instead on real issues the industry have.If there is any Bubble we should be worried about is that of the Information Bubble", "responses": "41"}, {"title": "A bitcoin miner in every device and in every\u00a0hand", "author_name": "Earn.com", "link": "https://medium.com/@earndotcom/a-bitcoin-miner-in-every-device-and-in-every-hand-e315b40f2821?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 18, 2015", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "610", "content": "A bitcoin miner in every device and in every\u00a0handEarn.comBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 18, 2015By Balaji S. Srinivasan (@balajis)21 is now officially open for business\u200a\u2014\u200aand business development. After much hard work, we\u2019ve created an embeddable mining chip which we call the BitShare that comes in a variety of form factors. The 21 BitShare can be embedded into an internet-connected device as a standalone chip or integrated into an existing chipset as a block of IP to generate a continuous stream of digital currency for use in a wide variety of applications. You can request a dev kit by signing up on our website to get started.Some might ask why a device engineer would desire such a thing. Isn\u2019t the purpose of bitcoin mining simply to get rich\u200a\u2014\u200aor not, as the case may be? Well, at 21 we are less concerned with bitcoin as a financial instrument and more interested in bitcoin as a protocol\u200a\u2014\u200aand particularly in the industrial uses of bitcoin enabled by embedded mining. These uses include:A new approach to micropayments. Historically, it has been difficult to get people to dig out their credit cards in order to purchase things online, particularly on mobile devices. The fixed cost of signup alone exceeds the benefit for the vast majority of sites. A continuously replenished stream of digital currency on your device generated by default from a 21 BitShare chip can change all that.Silicon-as-a-service. Because bitcoin mining is embarrassingly parallel, mining can scale down to one core or up to hundreds. We\u2019ve used this observation to develop a single core version of our technology that can be integrated into an existing chip. This means any vendor can take a chip performing a normal function (say video decoding or networking), add 21\u2019s BitShare technology, and thereby enable the chip to continuously generate revenue simply by being connected to power and internet. Because this technique can replace or augment traditional methods for silicon monetization (namely chip sales and IP licensing), it has the potential to revolutionize the way chips are built and sold.Decentralized device authentication. Many applications of bitcoin are not strictly monetary. Embedded mining means that any device can authenticate itself to the network by sending one Satoshi to a specified address. When used in combination with multisig, a 21 BitShare offers new paradigms for device authentication.Machine Twitter. The constant stream of Satoshis provided by a 21 embedded mining chip means that any device with an internet connection can now write to a globally readable, always accessible database\u200a\u2014\u200awith obvious benefits for device coordination, ad-hoc networks, and the like. While the bitcoin blockchain itself is not designed for this particular use case, future sidechains that accept bitcoin may be.Devices that can pay for associated services. A wide variety of new internet-connected devices require an associated SAAS subscription to work. Rather than paying a number of different subscription bills, by including the right-sized 21 BitShare with the device one can under many scenarios wholly or partially defray the expense of the cloud service.Devices that can pay your channel partners. At the manufacturer\u2019s discretion, the 21 BitShare chip can be configured to support a variety of different revenue shares for the mined bitcoin. For example, one could build an internet-connected device that shared some portion of mined bitcoin between the user, the retailer, the handset maker, and the carrier\u200a\u2014\u200athereby reducing costs and/or increasing margins throughout the entire supply chain. And because of the nature of mining as an embarrassingly parallel problem, embedded mining can scale up or down to fit within the power and thermal envelope of virtually any device.Bitcoin-subsidized devices for the developing world. 21 was built by immigrants, and using our technology to get more people around the world online is important to us. We believe the most significant long-term application of bitcoin may be reducing the upfront cost of internet-connected devices to make them more accessible for the developing world. The success of the iPhone was in nontrivial part due to the carrier subsidy; with embedded bitcoin mining we can in theory extend that model to any internet-enabled device, turning a lump sum upfront cost into a potentially more manageable cost of power over time.Conceptually, we believe that embedded mining will ultimately establish bitcoin as a fundamental system resource on par with CPU, bandwidth, hard drive space, and RAM. That is, one can imagine the ultimate thin client in which a system designer consciously chooses a relatively slow CPU but a relatively strong 21 mining chip, using the bitcoin generated therein to purchase computation in the cloud.Crucial to this is the idea that bitcoin generated by embedded mining is more convenient\u200a\u2014\u200aand hence more valuable\u200a\u2014\u200athan bitcoin bought at market price and manually moved over to the site of utility. As evidence for this, when a user writes a byte to their local hard drive, the spot price of external storage is not typically top-of-mind relative to the convenience of simply having a local hard drive. A more technical example is the L2 cache; it\u2019s not just the price-per-byte of the cache that matters, but its speed and availability. We believe a similar calculus will obtain for the convenience of having a local source of constantly replenished bitcoin from a 21 BitShare, a kind of \u201c/dev/bitcoin\u201d for use in routine micropayments and device authentication applications.Ultimately, though, it is the community of electrical engineers and computer scientists that will judge whether embedded mining technology solves their problems. Towards that end, our team of PhDs in EE from MIT, Stanford, and CMU has built not just a chip, but a full technology stack around the chip\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding reference devices, datasheets, a cloud backend, and software protocols. And we have already engaged with a wide variety of early access partners across the industry, from small startups to multibillion dollar hardware companies.In the weeks and months to come, we will be talking to many more. As part of this launch, I will be taking the role of CEO of 21 while Matthew Pauker will trade places and become Chairman. Alongside my co-founders Veerbhan Kheterpal, Daniel Firu, and Nigel Drego we will be focused on putting a bitcoin miner in every device and in every hand.To aid us in this effort we are fortunate to have some very influential investors. In addition to Qualcomm Incorporated, through its venture investment group, Qualcomm Ventures and Khosla Ventures, we are pleased to announce that both Cisco and former ARM CSO Mark Templeton have also now become investors in 21.

If they used the correct language and excluded all analogies, the only possible conclusion would be that America cannot regulate Bitcoin under its current legal system. The Constitution guarantees the inalienable rights of American citizens, and therefore Bitcoin is a protected form of publishing. The only way Bitcoin can be made regulable is if the Constitution is changed; and that does not mean adding a new Amendment, it means removing the First Amendment entirely. Inevitably the anti-Bitcoin protagonists will face a robust and ultimately successful legal challenge that will remove the possibility of any sort of \u201cBitLicense\u201d or interference from the CTFC, FinCEN or any other agency. It will also remove any possibility of interference at the State level. The consequence of adhering to the basic law of the United States will cause America to become the centre of all Bitcoin business for the entire world.Let me explain why this is the case.Some say that Bitcoin is money. Others say that it is not money. It doesn\u2019t matter. What does matter are three things; that Bitcoin is, that the Bitcoin network does what it is meant to do completely reliably, and what the true nature of the Bitcoin network and the messages in it are.Bitcoin is a distributed ledger system, maintained by a network of peers that monitors and regulates which entries are allocated to what Bitcoin addresses. This is done entirely by transmitting messages that are text, between the computers in the network (known as \u201cnodes\u201d), where cryptographic procedures are executed on these messages in text to verify their authenticity and the identity of the sender and recipient of the message and their position in the public ledger. The messages sent between nodes in the Bitcoin network are human readable, and printable. There is no point in any Bitcoin transaction that Bitcoin ceases to be text. It is all text, all the time.Bitcoin can be printed out onto sheets of paper. This output can take different forms, like machine readable QR Codes, or it can be printed out in the letters A to Z, a to z and 0 to 9. This means they can be read by a human being, just like \u201cHuckleberry Finn\u201d.At the time of the creation of the United States of America, the Founding Fathers of that new country in their deep wisdom and distaste for tyranny, haunted by the memory of the absence of a free press in the countries from which they escaped, wrote into the basic law of that then young federation of free states, an explicit and unambiguous freedom, the \u201cFreedom of the Press\u201d. This amendment was first because of its central importance to a free society. The First Amendment guarantees that all Americans have the power to exercise their right to publish and distribute anything they like, without restriction or prior restraint.Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.This single line, forever precludes any law that restricts Bitcoin in any way.In 1995, the US Government had on the statute books, laws that restrict the export of encryption software products from America without a license. These goods are classified as \u201cmunitions\u201d. The first versions of the breakthrough Public Key Encryption software \u201cPretty Good Privacy\u201d or \u201cPGP\u201d, written by Philip Zimmerman had already escaped the USA via Bulletin Board Systems from the moment it was first distributed, but all copies of PGP outside of the United States were \u201cillegal\u201d. In order to fix the problem of all copies of PGP outside of America being encumbered by this perception, an ingenious plan was put into motion, using the first Amendment as the means of making it happen legally.The source code for PGP was printed out.", "responses": "29"}, {"title": "Bitcoin price follow up & some \u201cbold\u201d predictions", "author_name": "DK", "link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/bitcoin-price-follow-up-after-dec-30th-scenario-played-out-perfectly-where-do-we-go-2bdd4472dfc5?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 7, 2018", "readtime": "13 min read", "upvotes": "3.4K", "content": "Bitcoin price follow up & some \u201cbold\u201d predictionsDKBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 7, 2018I need to start this by clearly stating that this is my personal opinion. It is neither my professional opinion nor is it to be construed as financial advice. Any asset can rise parabolically in value or crash to zero and my guess is as good as the next person\u2019s guess as to what happens.I have been asked numerous times to update my bitcoin chart scenario, but it took a public holiday in the UK for me to finally find the time to sit down and put a few thoughts online. I will talk about price as well as more recent developments.Chart outlookI am by no means a sophisticated chartist (and I happen to believe that once there is any kind of fundamental value that people can agree on, like in almost all asset classes except for crypto, charts cease working well), but I do believe that people behave in a similar manner when faced with similar tug wars between fear and greed over time. Despite the many critics (at least in crypto), I have found that Elliot Waves, mixed with a bit of trading experience tend to describe this behaviour reasonably well. Just like any chart method the predictive powers are limited in my view, but at least it helps with possible scenarios.Let\u2019s start with the past. In my previous articles (the last one linked below), I said that bitcoin would first rise to above $15,000 (Nov 29th article) and then correct to \u201cas low as $5,500 to $7,500\u201d. I have to admit that I did not expect these predictions to turn out so accurate myself. If you flick through the Twitter thread also liked below, you can see that the same exact chart helped guide the entire move down over three+ months.Observations on the Cryptobubble, Ripple and bitcoin price prediction updateWith the year 2017 drawing to a close and seemingly the entire world going mad about blockchains, it is time to revisit\u2026medium.coThread on Bitcoin Price Charts Over timeIn my view we find ourselves at a very interesting point in time currently. If you look at the chart below, you can easily spot the first \u201cA-B-C\u201d correction (small a, b, c letters in red). In Elliot Waves (or the way I like to think about it personally: whenever people trade solely on fear and greed), a correction of the dominant trade direction (in this case up) takes place in three waves (down\u200a\u2014\u200aup\u200a\u2014\u200adown) that themselves are made up of three sub waves.I rationalize this pattern by thinking of myself when I am trading with all my savings (which I never do anymore) and have been caught by some sort of mania. When the first move down (a) happens, I might still have the staying power to not touch my positions, though I will certainly get scared. When the recovery happens (b) I get slightly euphporic again and believe I did everything right. However, I now have the memory of a painful way down (a) earlier and once the upmove falters without reaching new tops (or much more importantly: my entry price), I get so scared that I say \u201coh well, if it fell to x before it can fall there again and maybe even lower, I better get out\u201d, ending in smaller and larger capitulations over time (c). This microcosm repeats itself across numerous classes of investors (categorized by their experience and especially their entry prices). The lower their entry price, the later they will panic (NB: this explains all your permabullish early investors on twitter; no they are not stronger than you mentally and can \u201chodl\u201d better, they just have lower entry prices so it is easy for them to be aloof and scold you for selling out). Only once the cycle has truly bottomed, a new uptrend can establish itself.Looking at the current situation, capital red A was completed picture-perfect with a capitulation. Capital B was a strong, fruitless recovery that mirrors small b as described above. Then things get difficult. I am not alone with having wanted to see a strong capitulation to end the bear market\u200a\u2014\u200amany people much more \u201cfamous\u201d for their charting than myself have echoed that sentiment time and again. My experience as a trader (I started trading equities just before the\u00a0.com bubble burst and have not left trading till today) as well as historical examples of other bear markets all say the same thing: if you do not get a large sell off that provides true capitulation then you have not likely seen the end of the bear market.If I combine this experience with the Elliot Wave scenario that has played out so accurately from November to today that it is almost scary, then I can only conclude that what we have seen now is merely the small red \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d of the capital \u201cC\u201d wave that ends this bear market.In the chart above I have tried to denote what I mean. It appears that the capital C wave is extended and takes longer to unfold than wave A. If that holds true then we will yet witness the true capitulation in bitcoin that takes us to $5,000 and likely even lower. Granted, my confidence in this scenario is lower than it was when I saw the \u201cbubble roof\u201d building (when bitcoin exited its uptrend channel on the upside and started to go parabolic). Back then I was reasonably confident that we would rise more than 100% and then crash hard. Right now this is just my best idea based on my experience and the way I understand Elliot Waves to work (or rather how they have worked well for me in the past). I will say that if bitcoin were to actually keep going up from here (which I would not finally conclude unless it rises above $15,000 again), it is the easiest way I have ever seen a bubble burst or a market correct. Given who is currently invested in this (namely private individuals who for the most part invested a big part of their savings on the promise of getting rich quick and have never traded any other assets actively), I highly doubt that is the case. But I have been wrong before and would not mind to be wrong this time. I just don\u2019t think so really. The positioning of all the moving averages kind of add to my scepticism.So to conclude the chart section, my best guess is that the current wave runs out of steem some time sooner rather than later and the price then (first slowly, then in a very steep fashion) falls to $5,000 or possibly as low as $2,000 before it finds a true bottom. I\u2019d give that a 60/40 chance of happening. In my experience, by the way, chart formations don\u2019t have much higher odds to work in general, so one should never invest purely on charts.Fundamental outlookI want to add a few thoughts on more fundamental developments in the bitcoin and crypto space that I believe are important to consider when looking at the asset class.The \u201cSecurity Token\u201d debateI believe that commentators are much too focused on this whole issue. There is not a doubt in my mind that all (yes, all) token that were ICOed or even airdropped by start ups and that are directly related to the success of that start up are securities. The important question to ask yourself is: do people buy the token at inception or in the early months because they view the possibility to use it in a future product as the main value proposition or because they want to either bet on the success of said start up or benefit from price appreciation. It is quite obvious that the only reason people buy or trade these token is because they want to profit financially. That makes them securities. I am not going to quote the SEC chairman again, but let\u2019s just say that cat is out of the bag.Regarding the current \u201cis Ether a security\u201d question, by the way, I actually believe that the SEC will conclude that it was not, at the time of its ICO, a security. I don\u2019t even think that is a big hallmark decision that has any influence whatsoever on the current generation of token. Back when ethereum ICOed, I would claim that the vast majority of people who took part in the ICO actually believed in a vision, were technically adept and wanted to build a smart contract platform that would enable a new technological leap forward. I do not think most people had in mind to get rich quickly by trading ethereum, nor do I think the participants in the ICO had much in common with today\u2019s generation of investors. Of course, I could be wrong, but what must be obvious to the most innocent of bystanders is that the ethereum value proposition was strongly different from 99% of current ICOs who all try to portray a way of getting rich.The debate itself is not very relevant in my view because I think regulators have demonstrated that they want crypto innovation to flourish and won\u2019t just bring down the entire industry. So despite all these being securities, the regulatory action is unlikely to be so stark that it would actually threaten the market. What is much more likely now is that, over time, more and more equity and debt will be traded on a blockchain (note that this is very likely going to be a centralized blockchain owned by banks that enables them to get rid of one of the largest systemic risks there is\u200a\u2014\u200aclearing houses) and therefore people will wake up to the fact that the current set of \u201caltcoins\u201d is mostly just hot air being traded for inflated prices. I have made this comparison frequently\u200a\u2014\u200aif you have the choice to either buy equity in amazon (or even real equity in the \u201cnext\u201d amazon if you must think that way) on the blockchain or buy some token that has no current use, no rights and provides absolutely no ownership in the underlying company, which will you buy? So the security token debate will solve itself. By the way, the \u201chuge wave of institutional money waiting on the sidelines, just aching to enter crypto\u201d will be buying the real equity, not the fancy logos of the current generation (unless they add equity-like rights).The never-ending bullishness of early investorsI truly apologize if I repeat myself here, but I think it is simply not being said enough: everyone who has written books on crypto assets, invested really early in it or was part of the first wave of crypto businesses and therefore has a lot of crypto in his or her portfolio shares the following traits:a) they have a strong (sub-conscious?), non-evil incentive to always talk up bitcoin and other cryptos. Their bank account (in fiat, which is funnily what they do look at mostly, which itself should give you pause) swings hugely with the prices of cryptob) they entered crypto at prices so low that it is extremely easy for them to sit out any large correction UNLESS that correction goes lower than $1,000. I find that unlikely, but if it ever happens, the pain will be real and a lot of these 20,000+ follower accounts will be interesting to watch as that will be when the regret of not selling higher will stingI am just putting those two points out there. No judgement intended from my side, also no hypothesis regarding any kind of bad intenttions. Just stating two facts. You can derive the conclusion yourself as to how good these accounts are in terms of taking trading direction from them. You decide. I have actually started taking screen shots of some of the more outrageous claims on twitter and will be publishing a \u201ctwitter cemetary\u201d of them IF the day ever comes that this space really tanks. The future will tell\u00a0;-).Crypto\u2019s perceived aversion to regulation and celebration of criminal individualsIt continues to be mind boggling to me, how the tone in the cryptosphere in regards to regulation can be this negative. Regulators are not out there to take away your toys, their mission is to protect you.As you can see with the very, very measured approach that Western governments have taken vis a vis crypto so far, they too do not want to stifle innovation. They are on your side. All they want is to make sure that scammers do not have such an easy time to take people\u2019s money. I know that many in the cryptosphere identify as \u201clibertarian\u201d politically, meaning there is no social network to help each other and everyone forges their own fortunes. That is a view that for better or worse most people do not share. Without going into the political debate (which I do not care to pick up), society has established some rules and not all are simply made by the evil banks that don\u2019t want you to profit. Insider trading, wash trading and pyramid schemes are outlawed for a reason and across different types of political systems. If autocrats, communists, socialists and democratic societies all agree on some forms of poor market behaviour\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe there is a point to it? Just saying.Crypto should embrace regulation, especially of the thoughtful and measured kind that the SEC has demonstrated. We should all work with them to identify frauds and prevent the parts of society that are still crypto-illiterate from celebrating said frauds (which is currently happening in part). It would help if crypto society also stopped calling for the release of people who actually enabled drug trafficing, people trafficing and illegal sale of weapons via the dark net without stating any names here. The call for freedom of these people is a sad part of crypto. They aren\u2019t martyrs, they broke the law. Also, perhaps some of you should watch the doc \u201cGringo\u201d on Netflix or similar. Might change your opinion on some people.Crypto valuationI have previously tried to value crypto in an article here using old school methods. While my own try may not be the best, it certainly shows that whichever parallel you use, the value for all of crypto and bitcoin is much, much lower than where we currently are. The only exception is if bitcoin replaces gold in its entirety. But even in regards to that parallel, I believe that at roughly 5% of the price of all gold in the world, bitcoin is currently appropriately valued. As regards the rest of crypto, I don\u2019t think it helps that blockchains can be forked (copied) and provide the same exact functionality in perpetuity.The point I really want to make is that (even ignoring the fact that coinmarketcap disregards large parts of market cap that is held by insiders; you can see an earlier article here) when the crypo market that (I repeat) provides no equity-like rights whatsoever is valued at close to $500bn, you have to start asking yourself if you would rather own 70% of Google or Apple, giving you access to c $20\u201330bn in profits each quarter or all of crypto. The proportion is just not right. I do not even think that if TCP/IP were a publically traded asset it would be worth this much currently. Especially if it can be copied easily.On a side note: when CNBC has a daily bitcoin price ticker and a crypto show, while literally everyone and their dog talk about blockchain and bitcoin at dinner, you are no longer an early investor.

Distributed blockchain technology, as pioneered by bitcoin, is important. The future of money really is cryptocurrencies, possibly led by bitcoin.I\u2019ve been getting into a lot of discussions with supporters and promoters of bitcoin, who tell me that the price of bitcoin is going up so fast because there is a limited supply and an increasing demand. Their argument is that only a small percentage of the world currently has bitcoin, and that everyone will eventually need to use bitcoin.It\u2019s true that prices reflect the difference between supply and demand. There is a limited number of bitcoins, and there is a great demand for them, so the price is shooting up. However, what these proponents of bitcoin seem to be missing is the reason for the demand.It\u2019s clear that the most significant reason, by far, for the massively increasing demand for bitcoin is that people want to own it because they think that it will go up in price. They think it will go up in price because increasing numbers of people are going to want to buy it. The reason that they think that more people will want to buy it is that those people are going to believe that it will go up in price. This is a self-fulfilling prophesy.This is also a demonstration of the standard operation of a bubble. It looks like a Ponzi scheme or a pyramid scheme. If I buy bitcoin today, it will be more valuable tomorrow because others have bought it at a higher price. As an existing \u201cinvestor,\u201d I am benefitting from others getting in. Meanwhile, what I\u2019m actually owning is a bitcoin. Don\u2019t get me wrong, bitcoin is valuable, but it\u2019s not worth $10,000 per coin, or even $1,000 per coin. It\u2019s a currency. It\u2019s not Amazon or Apple stock.If you bought Apple or Amazon stock early on, then you bought something that had a massive hidden future value, and as that value was revealed, you benefitted by investing in it very early, before the value was apparent. Apple and Amazon are companies which generate revenue and profits, and a share in these companies represents ownership in something that is growing.I have friends messaging me asking, \u201cWhat do you think about bitcoin? It\u2019s so expensive right now, but I feel like if I don\u2019t get in now then I will regret it later.\u201d Notice this emotional state, this panic. Everyone is behaving like this is an emergency. Everyone and his dog is buying bitcoin. This is a form of mania. And the price is reflecting that. The number one rule of investing is don\u2019t follow the crowd. When everyone else is buying, it\u2019s time to sell. When everyone else is selling, it\u2019s time to buy.I\u2019m probably a little bit older than many of the readers of this article. I remember the dot com bubble. Everyone was buying dot com stocks. The prices of those stocks shot up, and when many companies went bankrupt, people lost all of their money. There were also stories in Silicon Valley about receptionists and other admin staff at start-ups whose exercised stock options were being valued so highly at tax time that they ended up owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal tax through the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) mechanism. After the prices of the stocks crashed, before they were able to sell them, those employees still owed all that money to Uncle Sam. Many regular folks ended up bankrupt.You might argue that people who invested in companies like Amazon during the dot com bubble didn\u2019t lose all their money, and actually probably made money. Well that\u2019s not necessarily true. I trusted some stock brokers at that time who persuaded me to cash-in my NVIDIA stock options and buy stocks that they \u201cliked\u201d such as Avaya and EMC. Even though their brokerage firm was a market-maker in NVDA, they didn\u2019t know what NVIDIA was. Those dot com stocks also rose with the dot com bubble, but they didn\u2019t become worthless after it popped; they did, however, halve in value. I did lose hundreds of thousands of dollars on those stock purchases, and I had cashed-in NVIDIA stock to buy them, stock that would now be worth tens of millions of dollars.I believe that bitcoin will be around in the future, and that it will not go to a zero price. I believe that other cryptocurrencies will come to the fore which are more able to handle the transactional needs of a larger number of people than bitcoin can.I think it\u2019s important to realize and remember that this is a bubble. Your coins are going up because the sucker after you is buying coins. And they\u2019re only buying them because they think that the price will go up.Another sign that this is a bubble is the way that those who own bitcoins are trying to persuade everyone who doesn\u2019t own them to buy them. These people might persuade themselves that they are motivated to help others, but I believe that the true reason is that they know that the more people are buying bitcoin, the more the price will go up. So they\u2019re trying to keep the bubble growing. When you buy bitcoin, you\u2019re potentially going to make some gains if you can get out again before it crashes. However, once you\u2019re a convert, and you get into the swing of this, you\u2019re going to stay in and work on persuading others to buy. It looks just like a pyramid scheme from this standpoint.With true investments, such as a stock in a solid company with great leadership, a company that will grow and succeed massively in the long run, we want to keep it secret. We want to be able to keep buying the stock at the lower price. We don\u2019t go around recommending to everyone that they buy the stock, because that would only lead to the price being driven up, making it harder for us to buy in at the low price.It\u2019s like going to a casino. If you can go in and put down a bet, win, and then take the winnings and walk out of the casino, then you can do well with bitcoin. The problem is that when most people get a big win, they plough it back into the system. Just as with a casino, bitcoin (at these elevated prices) is a system that is designed to extract your wealth from you. If you get in and get out, you can extract some wealth from the suckers down the line from you. However, the more you get in, and stay in, the more likely it is that you will be one of the suckers holding the bag when this thing crashes.How will it crash? This bullish mania will suddenly flip. When all these regular people who have their life savings in bitcoin notice that the price is dropping, they will sell, probably at a loss. This will make the price go down further, triggering more panic, and the negative spiral will begin. The same mechanism that has led to this run-up, a form of mass hysteria, will also potentiate a massive sell-off and crash. This is because the bubble mania is a two-sided coin (pun intended).My advice is to pay as much attention to your internal state as possible. Notice the fear of missing out. Notice the panic, the excitement, and the drive to promote bitcoin. This is a great opportunity for self-awareness. You might want to convert some of your dollars into this currency for fun, but make sure you only convert as much as you would be happy to lose, which for most people is nothing.Before you post a response trying to persuade me that there is not a bitcoin bubble, remember that by doing so you will actually be reinforcing my hypothesis. If you think bitcoin really is a great investment, then you will want everyone to believe what I have written, and to steer clear of it.Please give this article some claps, and follow me on Medium.", "responses": "32"}, {"title": "How Bitcoin Futures will Affect BTC\u2019s\u00a0Price", "author_name": "Jon Creasy", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/how-bitcoin-futures-will-affect-btcs-price-bcf296887d89?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 9, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "2.7K", "content": "How Bitcoin Futures will Affect BTC\u2019s\u00a0PriceJon CreasyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 9, 2017Image courtesy of\u00a0PexelsObligatory Disclaimer: To modify a quote from Tim Ferris, \u201cI am NOT a financial advisor, and none of this advice should be taken without speaking to a qualified professional first. Also, my results [are most likely] due to pure luck and zero skill.\u201dTomorrow evening, Bitcoin futures will be available for investment on Cboe, and the crypto world as we know will never be the same again.It is no secret to long-time hodlers in the crypto space that Bitcoin\u2019s final boss is Wall Street and the legacy banking system. This is a battle that has been a long time coming, and the investment space is both terrified and incredibly excited to see how things will shake out. Some people believe Wall Street\u2019s only goal is to short Bitcoin and watch their rival go up in flames. But I believe differently.I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard all the analogies comparing Bitcoin to a bubble like the Dot Com Crash, or the Tulip scandal. Most people don\u2019t realize how absurd these comparisons are.Further, most people have little to no understanding of the implied economics of Bitcoin. There is a limited supply, an exponentially increasing demand (a recent Cambridge study suggests 200 million users by 2024), and more value and security than in the US Dollar\u2019s wildest dreams.Yes, the media has characterized Wall Street personalities as braggarts who plan to short Bitcoin and watch the crypto world crumble. While those traders will probably make some decent profits from shorting in the very near term, it is more probable that they will be the ones getting burned.The very announcement that Bitcoin futures were going to be available correlated to a massive growth in the BTC price, as illustrated in a recent Bloomberg article:To see the full article: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-09/bitcoin-futures-trading-brings-crypto-into-mainstream-financeBut what if these announcements weren\u2019t actually the cause of the spike, like the media tends to believe? What if Bitcoin is actually becoming mainstream enough to survive on its own? If that\u2019s the case, Wall Street and its legacy bankers are going to realize rather quickly that they\u2019d be fools to short Bitcoin. They\u2019ll realize there is incredible profit to made by supporting Bitcoin.I believe we will see things unfold like this:Wall Street starts shorting Bitcoin on Sunday nightUncle Joe and Aunt Martha move their old stocks into Bitcoin futures, because nephew Timmy is richer than they are from his early Bitcoin investments. They make an insane profit in a few days, leading them to evangelize Bitcoin to their friends and neighbors#2 repeats on a national level, causing BTC to raise to absurd levels (some people are predicting a steady $20k by the end of the year; others even higher)Wall Street gets massive FOMO and starts investing in BTC instead of shortingI believe it is much more likely that we will see an explosion of interest in Bitcoin in the next week or two\u200a\u2014\u200aunlike anything the financial industry has experienced before.

Inexperienced traders especially tend to externalise the causes of their losses in an attempt not to hit their ego, ending to identify major events like SEC, futures market, Spoofy etc. as the main reasons behind the general wreckage of their unmanaged portfolio.Inevitably, these arguments get traction on social media, going viral. Newbies are prone to get stricken by those kinds of statements: their lack of specific knowledge related to the financial markets, in fact, makes them particularly vulnerable, ending to develop pessimistic behaviours that inhibit every kind of learning effort, because -in their minds- it would be useless anyway in a \u201chighly manipulated market\u201d.The direct result is the prevalence of pessimism, declined conventionally in the following way: The trader has a pessimistic feeling; therefore, trading practice becomes emotionally driven; external reasons justify the losses, suppressing that kind of positive self-critique which puts the basis for refining trading and risk management practices; money gets lost, and anger rises.While things in the market get worse, social media, as a direct result, becomes crowded with angry and noisy people. Coalitions arise, feeding each other moods in the attempt to preserve their egos: if the perceived reality is that some kind of external event has fooled everybody, then even if in practice your capital could have been protected with proper risk management, nobody will think about that, therefore you will not appear as \u201cstupid\u201d. That\u2019s the norm after all.Here are some tips that may be useful to prevent to approach these hard market phases as those subjects that I have presented to you in the first part of the article:Books will always be better than Twitter. Static knowledge is emotionless and fear-poof. Some of my favourites:There is no need to trade every single day or week. Overtrading will generate losses. You will make 80% of your gains during bull runs. During the rest of the time, the focus should shift to capital preservation.Be humble; not as a way of life (there is no need to go on with the slave-moral heritage). Be humble with yourself, instead. Discover your limitations and design a strategy accordingly.You don\u2019t need always to be up with every tiny detail of the price action. There is nothing wrong with reading charts. Just make sure to remain \ufb02exible so you can respond promptly to any scenario. Many people are obsessed with being updated with the price action in every candle of every single timeframe. But sometimes the scene is uncertain, and that\u2019s it. There is no need to risk your capital on a weak trade.Don\u2019t invest more than you are willing to lose. It\u2019s a very well known mistake, still hitting a good chunk of people anyway. Trades must be opened and closed when the right times come, not just when you need money. The market isn\u2019t tailored to your needs.Trying to apply risk management after every asset dumped hard is like being late at the party. Risk management and diversification in USDT or BTC must be planned when the market is going up with the aim to build a cushion for the future dumps. There is no endless bull-run (unless you are a central bank).When it\u2019s not the right time to enter into any trade, spend your time wisely by studying TA and FA, research good projects, getting a grasp on how mining works etc. Create connections and share your ideas with friends. If the right people surround you, it\u2019s possible to improve yourself significantly by backtesting your strategies and receiving feedback from other traders.Develop patience and endure your nerves. Emotions always lead to radical decisions. It\u2019s better to consider the scale of greys rather than look at everything with an absolutistic \u201cblack vs white\u201d approach. Even if your opinion is clear, keep your mind open and accept the eventuality to be wrong.Travel, meet new people, cultures, taste new foods and enjoy new landscapes. All these experience will contribute to keeping your mind open to new possibilities.To wrap-up:Be sceptical of every info that you gather on social networks and media;Practice patience and trade only when needed, because the market isn\u2019t aware of your necessities;Take your time to analyse all the potential scenarios and use a flexible approach.If you are accumulating Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, you don\u2019t need to wait for the perfect moment to buy. For example, if you\u2019re looking to buy Bitcoin, grab positions on the way down while continually trying to re-evaluate the scenario, gauging the weight of each portion instead of placing all your bets on a single specific price. This way you won\u2019t get trapped, and, even if you failed to spot the bottom, you\u2019ll have the chance to average down. As commented previously, there is no need for a \u201cblack vs white\u201d approach when the reality shows uncertainty. Having an open-minded and rational approach will add value to your portfolio over time.

The ostensible reason was that there was a Denial of Service (DoS) vector found in 0.14-0.16.2 that needed patching. Later on, we found out that there was the possibility of inflation due to the same bug in 0.15-0.16.2.In this article, I seek to clarify what happened, what the danger was, how it was exploitable and what could have happened.Two Ways to Double-SpendBefore we get to the actual bug, some explanation is necessary. We need to define double-spending first as the bug was with double-spending.Double spending is the case where someone, say Alice, spends coins to Bob and the same coins to Charlie. Alice is essentially trying to write two checks, one of which she knows will bounce. Of course, when we\u2019re thinking in checks, there\u2019s some account that Alice has that\u2019s getting overdrawn by writing these two checks. That\u2019s close, but not quite exact in how Bitcoin works.Bitcoin doesn\u2019t work on accounts but with UTXOs, or unspent transaction outputs. The outputs of a transaction have essentially an address and an amount. Once that output has been spent, it cannot be spent again. Think of a UTXO as a single coin that\u2019s been sent to you that can be any amount, say, a 0.413 BTC coin.Double spending means that a single coin (UTXO) is being spent twice. Usually, this means Alice is sending her 0.413 BTC to Bob in one transaction and to Charlie in another transaction. The way this is resolved in Bitcoin is that one of those transactions makes it into a block and that determines who actually gets paid. If both transactions somehow come through in a multiple blocks, the latter block is rejected by the software. If both transactions come through in a single block, that block is also rejected by the software. Essentially, the software detects double-spending and if there is double-spending a block should be rejected.Sending the same UTXO in two different transactions is not the only way to double-spend, however. There\u2019s a more pathological case of the same UTXO being spent twice in the same transaction. In this case, Alice is sending a single coin twice to Bob. So Alice is spending 0.413 BTC coin twice to send 0.826 BTC to Bob. This is clearly not a valid transaction as there\u2019s only 1 UTXO worth 0.413 BTC being sent. This would be the equivalent of Alice paying Bob the same $10 bill twice and Bob thinking that he received $20.Defining the\u00a0BugSo to sum up what we\u2019ve defined so far, there are two types of double-spending attempts:Using two or more transactions to spend the same UTXO.Using one transaction to spend the same UTXO multiple times.It turns out that (1) is handled correctly by the Bitcoin Core software. It is (2) that\u2019s of concern to us here. Anyone can construct a transaction that double-spends like this, but getting nodes to accept this kind of transaction is another matter. There are two ways to get a transaction into a block.A. Broadcast the transaction onto the network with sufficient fees to get a miner to include the transaction in a block.B. Include the transaction in a block as a miner.(A) doesn\u2019t require much other than creating the transaction and broadcasting it to a node on the network. (B) requires that you find a sufficient proof-of-work. It turns out that for the bug, (A) is not a possible attack vector as those transactions are immediately marked as invalid and rejected by nodes on the network. There\u2019s no way for the transaction to get into the mempool of miners without miners\u2019 cooperation as they won\u2019t get propagated. (B) is the only case in which the bug manifests. In other words, to exploit this bug, you need proof-of-work, or sufficient mining equipment and electricity.To be clear, there are 4 cases that need to be handled for double-spending:1A\u200a\u2014\u200aMultiple mempool transactions spending the same UTXO1B\u200a\u2014\u200aMultiple block transactions spending the same UTXO2A\u200a\u2014\u200aSingle mempool transaction spending the same UTXO multiple times2B\u200a\u2014\u200aSingle block transaction spending the same UTXO multiple timesThe bug has two manifestations. In 0.14.x, there\u2019s a Denial of Service vulnerability and in 0.15.x to 0.16.2, there\u2019s an inflation bug. We turn to those next.Denial of Service VulnerabilityThe story starts in 2009 with Bitcoin 0.1, where this bit of code enforces consensus by rejecting cases 1B and 2B (checking that blocks don\u2019t double-spend):I\u2019ve deleted a lot of in-between code for\u00a0clarityYou can see the comment \u201cCheck for conflicts\u201d which checks to see that every input is not spent yet. The code below the comment \u201cMark outpoints as spent\u201d marks the UTXO as spent. If any UTXO is spent more than once, this causes an error.In 2011, PR 443 was merged. This change was meant to take care of case the case where a single-tx double spend was being transmitted via the mempool (Case 2A above). This Pull Request comment makes the purpose clear (emphasis mine):Also, no transactions with duplicate inputs get put in blocks\u2026someone tried it a couple weeks ago, but the txes never ended up in blocks. Im assuming there is a check somewhere later on that prevented them from getting added to a block, though I haven\u2019t done any digging on the matter. This is really to prevent such obviously invalid transactions from getting relayed.The actual code change more or less does the same thing as the code under the comments \u201cCheck for conflicts\u201d in ConnectInputs above, but in a different place. The code change is in CheckTransaction, which is run for all 4 cases above (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B). As a result, we now have some redundancy in the block double-spending consensus code as Cases 1B and 2B are checked twice, once in CheckTransaction and once in ConnectInputs.In 2013, PR 2224 was merged. The goal of this change was to distinguish between consensus errors (like double spending) and system errors (like running out of disk space) as this PR comment makes clear: (emphasis mine)It introduces CValidationState, which stores metadata about a block or transaction validation being performed. It is used to distinguish validation errors (failure to meet network rules, for example) with runtime errors (like out of disk space), as formerly these could be confused, leading to blocks being marked invalid because the disk space ran out. Additionally, CValidationState also takes over the role of tracking DoS levels (so it doesn\u2019t need to be stored inside transactions or blocks\u2026).The actual relevant code change is here:By this time, ConnectInputs had been modularized into multiple methods and this function became the one checking for double-spending. The key change here is that what was once an error was changed to anassert.What does an assert do in C++? It halts the program entirely. Why would a programmer want to halt the program here? Well, this is where the purpose of the Pull Request comes in. Here is the relevant snippet of code from that time.This is handling Case 1B and 2B as before. The function name has changed from ConnectInputs to ConnectBlock, but the redundancy in checking Cases 1B and 2B have remained from PR 443. As we already saw, UpdateCoins does the second double-spend check. CheckBlock does the first double-spend check by calling CheckTransaction:Since this is the second time checking the same thing, the only way for the double-spend check in UpdateCoins to fail is if there\u2019s some sort of UTXO database or memory corruption. Indeed that seems to be the reason for the change to an assert. We already know the transactions aren\u2019t double-spending as CheckBlock via CheckTransaction does that check before UpdateCoins. Thus, PR 2224 correctly surmised that getting to this state in UpdateCoins must be a system error, not a consensus error. In that case, to prevent further data corruption, the correct thing to do is to halt the program.In 2017, PR 9049 was introduced as part of Bitcoin 0.14. As Segwit was going to make blocks larger, this was one of many changes to speed up the block validation times. The code change was pretty small:You can see here that the boolean fCheckDuplicateInputs was added to speed up Block checking. This was believed to be a redundant check as we\u2019ll see below. Unfortunately, the code in UpdateCoins was changed in PR 2224 to a system corruption check and not meant to be a consensus check. By 0.14.0, the code had modularized more and the assert looks a little different:What was once a redundant check was now responsible for a block-level single-tx double-spend (Case 2B) and halts the program. This still technically enforces consensus rules, just very badly, by halting the program.How did PR 9049 get through? Greg Maxwell referred me to this chat on IRC:Major props to Greg Maxwell who helped spell out for me what\u00a0happenedTL;DR, the developers, when discussing PR 9049, were predisposed to think that a block-level single-tx double-spend (case 2B) was being checked elsewhere from PR 443 without taking PR 2224 into account. This caused the developers to not look as closely at PR 9049.To sum up:PR 443 was introduced in 2011 to prevent relay of double-spending transactions (Case 2A). This had a side effect of creating a redundant check of consensus rules for double spending in blocks (Cases 1B and 2B).PR 2224 was introduced in 2013 and as a side effect, upgraded the code in (1) for block validation from being redundant to consensus-critical.PR 9049 was introduced in 2017 and skipped over the code in (1) for the single-tx-double-spend-in-a-block case (Case 1B). The developers wrongly believed the code to be redundant because they didn\u2019t take (2) into account. In actuality, this change skipped over a consensus critical part.It\u2019s fair to say that this was a strange confluence of events that led to the bug.The Severity of the DoS VulnerabilityThis meant that Core 0.14.x software could crash given a weird enough block. Because of where the code is situated, to cause a crash, an attacker would have to:Create a transaction spending the same UTXO twiceInclude the transaction from (1) into a block with sufficient proof-of-workBroadcast that block to 0.14.x nodes(1) and (3) are not very costly. (2) costs at a minimum in 12.5 BTC as the amount of hash power required to create a block with sufficient proof-of-work requires the same amount of energy/mining equipment as finding a valid block.If you believe that splitting the network isn\u2019t that great from a game theory perspective, the incentives to exploit this vulnerability are pretty low. At best, as an attacker, you take down a narrow slice of full nodes for the cost of 12.5 BTC. With the unlikely prospect of profiting off of a split network, which requires a lot more than just being able to crash some of the nodes at will, there\u2019s not much to gain as the attacker cannot easily recoup the cost of the attack.If this were the only vulnerability, the attacker can inconvenience a lot of people, but it\u2019s not a sustained inconvenience since those nodes can simply reboot and connect to nodes other than the ones feeding them the bad block. Once there\u2019s a longer chain, this bad block attack would completely lose its teeth. Unless the attacker continues to create blocks at a cost of 12.5 BTC per block and feeds them to 0.14.x nodes on the network, the attack would more or less end there.In other words, while the vulnerability is certainly there, the economic incentives for DoS were pretty low.Inflation BugStarting at 0.15.0, there was a feature introduced to make looking up and storing UTXOs faster and that introduced the next iteration of the bug. Instead of crashing when a block with a single-transaction double-spend came in, the software saw the block as valid.This means a pathological transaction (same UTXO being spent multiple times in the same transaction or 2B above) which crashes 0.14 nodes were now seen as valid in 0.15 nodes, essentially creating BTC out of thin air.Here\u2019s how that came about. Introduced in 0.15, PR 10195 encompasses a lot of things, but the main gist of it was that the way the UTXOs were stored changed to make them more efficient to look up. As a result, there were many changes, including one to the UpdateCoins function from earlier:Notice how the code around assert(false) was taken out entirely. Noticing this, PR 10537, also in 0.15.0 changed the code so that the assert was put back.The conditions under which the assert fails now depends on inputs.SpendCoin which looks like this:Essentially, the only way for SpendCoin to return false is if the coin doesn\u2019t exist in the UTXO set. But as you can see that requires the coins to be FRESH and not DIRTY. These are not obvious terms, but thankfully, core developer Andrew Chow explains here:So now the question is, when are UTXOs marked as FRESH? They are marked FRESH when they are added to the UTXO database. But the UTXO database is still only in memory (as a cache). When it is saved to disk, the entries in memory are then no longer marked as FRESH. This saving to disk happens after every block (as well as at other times, but that is not important).FRESH coins are ones that entered the memory pool. An attacking miner can crash the nodes through that assert statement in UpdateCoins. But worse, if the coins are DIRTY (essentially read from disk), then this can cause inflation.It\u2019s thus possible to trick core software from 0.15.0 to 0.16.2 to accepting a weird, invalid block that inflates the supply.The Severity of the Inflation VulnerabilityThe economics of this attack seem significantly better than the Denial of Service case as the attacker could potentially create BTC out of thin air. You still need mining equipment to execute the attack, but the potential for inflation might make this worthwhile, or so it seems.Here\u2019s what the naive attack on Bitcoin using this bug would look like:Create a block with a transaction that spends some amount of BTC back to yourself twice. Say 50 BTC \u2192100 BTC.Broadcast the block to everyone on 0.15/0.16Here\u2019s what would have happened:0.14.x nodes would have crashedOlder nodes and many alternative clients would have rejected that blockMany block explorers run on custom software and not core, so at least some would have rejected the block and wouldn\u2019t have shown any transactions from that blockDepending on the software miners were running we may have ended up with a chain split.It\u2019s possible all miners were running Bitcoin Core 0.15+ in which case non-vulnerable clients would have simply stalled. It\u2019s also possible a miner would have been running something else in which case a chain fork would have happened as soon as they found a block.Because of these irregularities, people on the network would soon have tracked this down, probably have alerted some developers and the core developers would have fixed it. If there was a fork, the social consensus at that point about which is the right chain would start getting discussed and the chain creating unexpected inflation would have likely lost out. If there was a stall, there likely would have been a voluntary rollback to punish the attacker.So for the attacker, this wouldn\u2019t have resulted in +50 BTC, but much more likely -12.5 BTC. If the attacker double spent a bigger amount, say 200 BTC, there would be even less chance that the inflation block would stick around as the attack would be much more blatant.So from an attacker\u2019s perspective, this wouldn\u2019t be a very good return on investment.The other way that an attacker could have profited is by shorting BTC and then executing an attack. This, too, is risky because it\u2019s not guaranteed that BTC price would go down, especially if the crisis was handled swiftly and decisively. Furthermore, given the AML/KYC around most exchanges offering margin, this likely results in the attacker getting doxxed in fairly short order.Not only does an attacker have a significant amount of monetary risk, but also physical risk. The ROI isn\u2019t really there and from an economic perspective, this is not an easy exploit to profit off of.A state-level actor, however, could have used this as a way to scare Bitcoiners. The ROI would be more abstract, so in theory, this could have accomplished the purposes of a state-level actor.ConclusionFor sure, this was a pretty severe bug. And despite my differences with Awemany, I\u2019m grateful that this person chose to disclose responsibly. That said, given the economic game theory of the exploits, I don\u2019t believe the bug was nearly as severe as people like him have made it out to be.Even if the bug was made known to bad people before it was found, it\u2019s likely that this wouldn\u2019t be something an attacker would choose to exploit as the economics don\u2019t really make sense. To be sure, the technical part should be fixed and made better, but the group of people that this exploit would actually be useful to is really tiny (state-level actors who want to try to destroy Bitcoin, basically).The lessons for Bitcoin Core are many:Any consensus changes (even tiny ones like 9049) need to be reviewed by more people.More tests for pathological cases need to be written.More clarity in the codebase about which checks are redundant and which ones are not and what the actual code is meant to be doing.There have been bugs in the past, there will be bugs in the future. What\u2019s important now is to learn and incorporate these lessons.", "responses": "12"}, {"title": "Bitcoin is Being Hot-Wired for Settlement", "author_name": "Jeff Garzik", "link": "https://medium.com/@jgarzik/bitcoin-is-being-hot-wired-for-settlement-a5beb1df223a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 29, 2015", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "2.3K", "content": "Bitcoin is Being Hot-Wired for SettlementJeff GarzikBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 29, 2015Disclaimer: The following is personal opinion and does not reflect an official position by Bloq, MIT or any other organization or group.(\u4e2d\u6587\u7248)The proposed roadmap currently being discussed in the bitcoin community has some good points in that it does have a plan to accommodate more transactions, but it fails to speak plainly to bitcoin users and acknowledge key downsides. The roadmap summary most relevant to bitcoin users isBitcoin is shifting to a new economic policy, with possibly higher fees.Core block size does not change; there has been zero compromise on that issue. In the face of rising transaction volume\u200a\u2014\u200ait has doubled over the past year\u200a\u2014\u200agetting stuck at 1M results in higher fees, notable economic changes, and suffers from increased political risk by embracing an accidentally-created economic policy tool.Change By\u00a0DesignHigher fees and reshaping the fee market impact all bitcoin users, yet it is only mentioned obliquely in paragraph 18 of the roadmap,These proposals help [\u2026] prevent defection between the miners from undermining the fee market behavior that will eventually fund security.and in the middle of paragraph 4 of another BIP by the same devs,The development of a fee market and the evolution towards an ecosystem that is able to cope with block space competition should be considered healthy. [\u2026] However, the purpose of such a change should be evolution with technological growth, and not kicking the can down the road because of a fear of change in economics.Notable devs think it necessary to change bitcoin to a different economic system with \u201chealthy\u201d competition for block space. In the field today, that is accomplished by maintaining the core block size in the face of rising transaction volume\u200a\u2014\u200aan outcome the current dev consensus has produced, and the roadmap continues.In an optimal, transparent, open source environment, a BIP would be produced, covering a change in bitcoin\u2019s economics to a \u201chealthy fee market.\u201d This would be analyzed through the lenses of technical, economic, hard fork etc. risk. This has not happened.There would also be a related BIP describing the basic requirements for a full node in terms of RAM, CPU processing, storage and network upload bandwidth, based on experiments\u200a\u2014\u200anot simulations\u200a\u2014\u200adone on a platform like planet-lab.org. This would help determine quantitatively how many nodes could propagate information rapidly enough to maintain Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized global consensus at a given block size.How Satoshi Avoided a \u201cVisible\u00a0Hand\u201dGetting stuck at 1M core block size transforms a historic DoS limit into an accidental policy tool. Satoshi added the 1M consensus limit in 2010, intentionally set above the free market fee range. This artificial ceiling acts against network DoS, raising the cost of attack. Setting the limit above free market range resulted in a safety limit reasonably free from politics.The update process was also described by Satoshi in 2010.As average block size approaches the 1M limit, the game theory picture changes. The accidental, artificial 1M limit becomes a Visible Hand in the market. Competition occurs not only for block space, but for developer consensus\u200a\u2014\u200abecause in this new economic system, the ability to freeze or move the 1M limit produces a system where humans\u200a\u2014\u200anot the free market directly\u200a\u2014\u200awield oversize power.By accident or design, Satoshi managed to create a working free market and push this Visible Hand years into the future by setting the limit high, well above the free market range for transaction fees. The limit served for years as a DoS limit, exponentially increasing cost-of-attack, while a free market equilibrium range established itself.This block size debate ultimately comes down to competing economic and system survival theories. One theory is that a free market range exists for block size, in absence of a hard limit. Another theory is that a hard limit is required to forcibly constrain the free market. Stalling on core block size changes the former to the latter\u200a\u2014\u200auncharted territory for bitcoin.A System-wide Upgrade To Avoid A System-wide UpgradeThe resultant bitcoin user and market view is muddled: From 2010 through Scaling Bitcoin:Montreal, it appeared that the core block size would see an increase. Following Scaling Bitcoin:Hong Kong, the roadmap abruptly switches direction to Segregated Witness (SW).SW avoids an ecosystem-wide hard fork through ecosystem-wide upgrades to bitcoin transactions, blocks, addresses, scripts, full nodes, miners, wallets, explorers, libraries, and APIs. All to provide partial relief to core block pressure assuming users upgrade\u200a\u2014\u200a1.6M if 100% upgrade, based on current usage.SW roll-out requires extensive software modifications just to maintain current functionality in the face of rising transaction volume. SW complicates bitcoin economics by splitting a \u201cblock\u201d into a basket of two economic resources\u200a\u2014\u200acore block and extended block\u200a\u2014\u200aeach with unique price incentives and (heavily intersecting) sets of actors.In contrast, increased core block size is compatible with existing bitcoin software; Some wallets will work seamlessly with no change at all. The total number and scope of changes to wallets, databases, libraries etc. is very minimal. The high hurdle is the hard fork itself.One of the explicit goals of the Scaling Bitcoin workshops was to funnel the chaotic core block size debate into an orderly decision making process. That did not occur. In hindsight, Scaling Bitcoin stalled a block size decision while transaction fee price and block space pressure continue to increase. Scaling Bitcoin was useful in surveying consensus on core block size. 2M appears to be the consensus most common denominator.Skipping Hard Questions Until Too\u00a0LateThe roadmap skips the short term issues ofWhen are fees too high?What is the process for changing core block size then?Why do we need high fees at this early stage of bitcoin\u2019s life?Rather than an automated software system, a fixed core block size puts an economic policy tool in the hands of humans. Humans are making subjective decisions about \u201chealthy\u201d fee levels, what miner income should look like, and the relative expense of bitcoin transactions, rather than the free market.Users have concerns that this roadmap and new economic direction dances obliquely around a shift of bitcoin from a network for P2P cash payments to a settlement system for as-yet-incomplete technology such as side chains or payment channels, pushing out businesses that bought into the original \u201cP2P electronic cash\u201d vision of bitcoin. As the RootStock white paper notes,If Bitcoin block size is not increased via a hard-fork, when the next Bitcoin reward halves, Bitcoin transaction fees may become prohibitively high for certain applications.Maybe that\u2019s inevitable. However, in the short term, we have a disappointing situation where a subset of dev consensus is disconnected from the oft-mentioned desire to increase block size on the part of users, businesses, exchanges and miners. This reshapes bitcoin in ways full of philosophical and economic conflicts of interest. As noted here, inaction changes bitcoin, sets it on a new path.Way ForwardBitcoin is not an academic science project. Stalling on hard questions produces tangible market changes. Few have the luxury to pause until a new payment layer is developed on top of bitcoin-1\u2019s emerging settlement layer. Stuck-at-1M risks reversing bitcoin\u2019s network effect by pricing users out of the core blockchain, forcing them onto centralized platforms.A better way forward includes leadership on a definitive short term core block size decision, plain talk with users about exploring new fee market economic theories and system survival theories, and plain talk with users about the risks and possible negative consequences of getting stuck at 1M.Core block size resolution and validation cost edge cases are the top priorities. A positive outcome of Scaling Bitcoin was a consensus of 2M, assuming some validation DoS fixes. Segregated Witness can proceed in parallel, sans the assumptions that it\u2019s an easy change or that it mitigates economic issues described above.And finally, to remove long term moral hazard, core block size limit should be made dynamic, put in the realm of software, outside of human hands.Bitcoin deserves a roadmap that balances the needs of everybody who has worked hard over the last six years to grow the entire ecosystem.\u2014 Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen", "responses": "25"}, {"title": "Bitcoin, I\u2019ve Been Here\u00a0Before", "author_name": "Monty Schmidt", "link": "https://medium.com/swlh/bitcoin-ive-been-here-before-bf3279e67f27?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 22, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "2.7K", "content": "Bitcoin, I\u2019ve Been Here\u00a0BeforeMonty SchmidtBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 22, 2017In the summer of 2000 I was momentarily worth 200 million dollars. It was the dot-com era and in only a few months our company had skyrocketed to a market cap of over a billion dollars. It was exciting and we thought it would last forever. Four months later it was gone.Dot Com DazeIn 1991, I left my day job to found Sonic Foundry. I wrote one of the first Windows based audio editors, Sound Forge. The company grew, added new products and went public in 1998. What was once a startup in sleepy Madison, Wisconsin turned into a substantial company.In 1999 things went crazy. The internet bubble had begun and we went from being an audio/video editing company to a company that was \u201cMoving Media Online\u201d.The 1999 SFO Annual report (SFO rather than SOFO because we started on the\u00a0AMEX).In December our stock went from $9 to over $50 in less than a month. We were local heroes. By March of 2000 the stock doubled again as investors rushed in. At over $100 a share there was a feeling of euphoria as investor portfolios swelled.Sure, there were the nay-sayers. Our revenues hadn\u2019t grown to meet the valuation, they said. Caught up in a bull market, we brushed them off as old people who didn\u2019t get the new paradigm of the internet.People were taking out loans to buy internet stocks as no one wanted to be the person at the party who missed out. But for every doubting Thomas there was an analyst who predicted that the ride would continue.SOFO (SFO when we were on the AMEX) looks pretty much exactly like the NASDAQ and every other dot com company at the time. The reason the numbers are a different is that we would eventually do a 2 for 1 split, followed much later by a 1 for 10 so to get the dollar values at the time you divide by\u00a05.Boom Becomes BustIt didn\u2019t take long for us to go from heroes to goats. In just four months, our stock was back where it started. I went from $200M to $200k net worth.Wherever you went in town you had a good chance of running into someone who\u2019d lost money on Sonic Foundry. The complaints and personal attacks were impossible to ignore. Occasionally I would run into someone who\u2019d say \u201cI love Sonic Foundry, it allowed me to put an addition on my house!\u201d These were the happy few who took profits on the way up.Most of us didn\u2019t take anything off the table during this time. We were along for the ride and obviously selling would\u2019ve been bad optics. But we were also true believers.Rebuilding from the BustWe downsized quickly and in 2003 we sold off our main products, Sound Forge, ACID and Vegas to Sony. Over the next 8 years I led our team to build Mediasite a knowledge capture platform. Unfortunately in 2011 a difference in opinion between myself and some of the board would leave me \u201cpursuing other interests\u201d. One of those would be Bitcoin.Drunk on BitcoinI had been aware of Bitcoin as early as 2011 but in 2013 I ran across a talk by Bitcoin cheerleader, Andreas Antonopolos, https://antonopoulos.com/. After a couple of videos and a few days of research I immersed myself in the technology. I completed a 2 semester online course in cryptography http://www.crypto-textbook.com/. I purchased an overpriced AMD video card, a couple of cheap hardware miners from Butterfly Labs, set up a mining rig and joined a mining pool.I wrote code to map out the bitcoin network attaching myself to as many nodes as I could swamping our home network. I didn\u2019t realize it until my wife walked in and said \u201cIs our internet down?\u201dI sponsored a Bitcoin Hackathon and attended a fair amount of anarchist filled Bitcoin meetups. I even made the first Bitcoin election donation to a state candidate in Wisconsin (only to have to take it back).So what does all of this have to do with anything? I\u2019m trying to show you that I believe there is great promise in block chain technology. But when people are comparing Bitcoin to Amazon there\u2019s a problem. And it\u2019s reminding me of 2000.Bitcoin isn\u2019t AmazonBitcoin isn\u2019t a company. It was an open source experiment to create a payment network with no central authority. It succeeded. Back in 2014 I was paying for lunch with Bitcoin. Transactions were picked up and validated almost immediately and cost less than pennies.Today you can\u2019t do a transaction for less than $15 in fees. The Bitcoin network is creeping along at 3 transaction per second, the same as 7 years ago and since software by committee tends to move slowly don\u2019t expect to be buying lunch with Bitcoin anytime soon.The financial establishment has long been bashing Bitcoin. Back when it was working as intended I thought they were wrong. Terms like Ponzi scheme didn\u2019t really apply but we\u2019ve entered new territory. Unfortunately every Bitcoin price increase makes it even less useable as a payment network.Maybe a Nice Sun-room?I love the idea of Bitcoin just like I loved the idea of moving media online. But I\u2019ve been here before, smack in the middle of a bubble. Will there be more upside? Possibly. But if you\u2019re in Bitcoin I hope you end up with an addition on your house and not a bunch of worthless bytes.Crypto-currencies and the block chain are here to stay. Good things will come from all of this attention. But just like 2000, the price of that attention will be paid by unfortunate people hoping to make a quick buck.This story is published in The Startup, Medium\u2019s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by 276,798+\u00a0people.Subscribe to receive our top stories\u00a0here.", "responses": "19"}, {"title": "Bitcoin to Surpass $100k by\u00a02021?", "author_name": "Jared", "link": "https://medium.com/@Jared_J2/bitcoin-to-surpass-100k-by-2021-fec3a8c7de84?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 21, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "3.5K", "content": "Bitcoin to Surpass $100k by\u00a02021?JaredBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 21, 2018For nearly the entirety of 2018, the cryptocurrency space has experienced the doldrums of a bear market and Bitcoin has failed to sustain a price above $10,000 (as of writing this, Bitcoin is stuck in the $6k/$7k range).

This event is significant since the amount of Bitcoin mined after each ten minute block will drop from 12.5 Bitcoins to 6.25 Bitcoins. After the halvings of 2012 and 2016, a considerable appreciation in Bitcoin\u2019s price was reflected within the year. It\u2019s also likely that speculators may temporarily provide a spike in anticipation of the next halving as it is approached. With less Bitcoin being distributed into the circulating supply and increased demand, the halving may serve as a distinguished price catalyst.Comparison of Current and Historical MarketsSource: Internet History\u00a0PodcastAt the height of the dotcom bubble, the NASDAQ was worth nearly $7 trillion.

In contrast, the cryptocurrency market is global, so it has the potential to far eclipse the trillions witnessed during the dotcom boom. Currently, the entire crypto market is less than $300 billion, with Bitcoin accounting for about 45% of this sum. Bitcoin\u2019s size pales in comparison to other markets, which may help to put it\u2019s growth potential into perspective:January 2018 U.S. Stock Market Peak = $30 TrillionImplied Market Cap of Gold = $7.8 TrillionValue of Dotcom Bubble Peak = $6.71 TrillionDaily Volume in Forex Market = $5.1 TrillionBitcoin\u2019s Market Cap = $125 BillionFurthermore, each of the top 10 companies in the US stock market, on their own, have greater market caps than all of crypto. The likes of Apple and Amazon are on the cusp of reaching $1 trillion valuations. Will anybody want to buy Bitcoin at $100k? Admittedly, Bitcoin has less stable growth, but Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s class A shares have had prices above $300k, so the price alone shouldn\u2019t be a deterrent.By the end of 2021, the supply of Bitcoin will be around 18.7 million, meaning that the market cap of Bitcoin would need to be approximately $1.87 trillion to achieve $100k. Taking the aforementioned numbers into consideration, it\u2019s conceivable that such a price point can be reached by 2021.Lost Bitcoin and Hodl\u2019ersSource: Fortune\u00a0MagazineIt\u2019s estimated that nearly 4 million Bitcoins are lost forever, many during the early days of Bitcoin\u2019s history. This is a sizable figure considering that the current circulating supply is just north of 17 million and the final supply of Bitcoin will be 21 million.Another aspect that is highly underestimated is the conviction of Bitcoin\u2019s holders. Typically referred to as Hodl\u2019ers, they are likely to hold their Bitcoin through the dramatic and often chaotic swings of the market. Bitcoin is not just mere speculation, it\u2019s a movement. There\u2019s a growing number of individuals favoring the principles embodied by Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network instead of the established banking systems. Hodl\u2019ers, in conjunction with Bitcoin\u2019s missing coins, may serve as compounding effect on supply and demand, which may ultimately contribute to positive price action.Crypto Advancements Provide Added MomentumSource: Robinhood\u201cIt resonates with us when a client says, \u2018I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aRana Yared, Goldman Sachs ExecutiveDespite the often negative headlines and incomplete information that is proliferated in mainstream media, behind the scenes, a cryptocurrency arms race is transpiring:There\u2019s been of migration of Wall Street\u2019s top talent to the crypto spaceBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, will be adding its first fiat trading pairs this yearNasdaq has expressed interest in trading cryptocurrencies and is supporting the launch of the DX crypto exchange overseasCircle, backed by Goldman Sachs, purchased the crypto exchange Poloniex and Goldman is entertaining the possibility of trading BitcoinCoinbase is continuously active and has made a number of strategic acquisitions including Earn.comMobile applications supporting crypto, like Robinhood and Abra, are now making it more convenient and easy to purchase BitcoinThe demand for blockchain and crypto-related jobs has also skyrocketedAs you may have noticed, the number of gateways into Bitcoin has increased greatly and the infrastructure behind crypto is strengthening. While immense progress is being made, there may be a future application(s) that will usher in greater levels of adoption and the complexities once presented to user\u2019s may be essentially eliminated.Other product offerings will act as mechanisms for growth. Coinbase will be adding Ethereum Classic and other potential cryptos, which I think will benefit Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity.Interestingly, the currently purposed CBOE ETF, if accepted, will cost around 25 Bitcoins per share. This is significant since the under lying asset, Bitcoin, will be purchased in the process. If such options become more widely available, then Bitcoin\u2019s exposure may extend to new vehicles like brokerage accounts and your 401k. Once the first ETF is approved, then other variants of ETFs are likely to be constructed.Economic Downturn: Bitcoin Provides Safe HavenSince Bitcoin\u2019s inception, the US stock market has generally been in a steady uptrend. If a cataclysmic event similar to the 2008 crash occurs, then we\u2019ll truly learn what Bitcoin\u2019s correlation is to traditional assets. It\u2019s an often expressed belief, within the crypto space, that investors might flock to Bitcoin if a stock market crash happens.Source: Economist.comIn other countries, such as Venezuela, Bitcoin has proven to be a safe haven as the local currency (the bolivar) is incurring a precipitous decline. Global occurrences are often overlooked by first world countries, but in Venezuela, the importance of Bitcoin is pronounced. The Venezuelan bolivar is suffering from hyperinflation at the current rate of 16,428% a year, basically making it worthless. In such a crisis, many residents are resorting to Bitcoin as a way to preserve their capital. Unfortunately, I believe that such scenarios could play out in other countries, which will contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s value.Millennials: Their Buying Power IncreasesFor a set of millennials, cryptocurrencies are the preferred investment vehicle over the stock market. Since many millennials have mostly known a society integrated with the internet, they may be more receptive and gravitate towards cryptos in their investment journeys. As each year progresses, more millennials will accept new job offers and substantial pay increases may add to their disposable incomes. This development may encourage the purchase of more Bitcoin.Moreover, many millennials are becoming disillusioned and feel like they live in a system that cares little about their financial well-being. A prominent example of this is the increasing student loan debt epidemic that has stifled many in their financial growth. As a result, Bitcoin may become an attractive option, since it\u2019s not tied to a system that hasn\u2019t necessarily served their best interests.", "responses": "18"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "", "link": "https://medium.com/@drewmillard/chasing-the-bitcoin-boys-in-the-crypto-capital-of-the-world-57dac53ce28c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 30, 2018", "readtime": "15 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "The people of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, have always hated rules. A shipping town first settled in the 17th century, Portsmouth was by 1864 home to 120 bars, 30 brothels, and three police officers. It\u2019s a place where a young exhibition shooter named Annie Oakley spent her summers giving free shooting lessons to women, and it\u2019s a place where Blackbeard, among other pirates and privateers, allegedly left buried treasure.Today, it\u2019s a place where a Tesla Model X SUV bearing the state\u2019s \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d plates zooms by as I walk to the Seacoast Repertory Theater, the lobby of which houses a Bitcoin ATM.When I arrive, I quickly discover that the term \u201cBitcoin ATM\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a thing you stick a debit card into exchange for Bitcoin. Instead, it\u2019s a cube that eats your cash and spits Bitcoin into a cryptocurrency wallet app on your phone. Which means that to buy cryptocurrency at this Bitcoin ATM, I have to find an actual ATM, withdraw cash, then return to the Bitcoin ATM and give it my money.\u201cIt only takes hundreds,\u201d says a guy in the lobby who has borne witness to my struggle. He\u2019s a local who spends a good chunk of time at the theater and says my predicament isn\u2019t uncommon. People come from miles away to use the thing, he adds. \u201cThen they only have twenties\u2026 then they have to go find hundreds somewhere.\u201dPortsmouth is a strong contender for the most cryptocurrency-friendly city in the\u00a0world.When the machine was first installed, in December 2016, he says, \u201cit was getting so much foot traffic.\u201d That was around when Bitcoin began looking less like something nerdy anarchists traded for drugs and more like a sound place to park your money. In 2017, its price rose from about $900 per coin to $20,000, and with those monstrous gains came a class of investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs buying in, hoping to ride the cryptocurrency rocket to the moon.As those interested in emerging technologies (or schadenfreude) are well aware, the bubble did indeed burst\u200a\u2014\u200awith a resounding pop. After a dramatic early 2018 drop, Bitcoin\u2019s price has spent the past few months hovering between $6,000 and $7,000 per, occasionally swinging up but never coming anywhere close to its previous highs.That drop-off hasn\u2019t stopped Portsmouth, with a population of just 21,000 people, from becoming an unlikely haven for crypto. According to CoinMap.org, the Portsmouth area is home to 24 businesses that accept cryptocurrency, including restaurants, clothing stores, juice bars, regular bars, restaurants, a yoga studio, a dance studio, a hair salon, a vape shop, and a law office. If a grocery store started accepting cryptocurrency, one resident told me, it would be possible for a person to leave the U.S. dollar behind and exclusively pay for things with a jumble of Bitcoin, Dash, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, and Zcash. While places like New York City, Amsterdam, and the Bay Area have more businesses that accept cryptocurrency on the whole, Portsmouth is a strong contender for the most cryptocurrency-friendly city in the world on a per capita basis.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Why Bitcoin\u2019s Price Is Skyrocketing", "author_name": "Miguel Cuneta", "link": "https://medium.com/sci-ventures-blog/the-real-reason-bitcoin-price-is-skyrocketing-4b2d1632f716?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 8, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "2.3K", "content": "Why Bitcoin\u2019s Price Is SkyrocketingMiguel CunetaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 8, 2017The price of a Bitcoin just rocketed past $7,500. Let\u2019s explore the reasons behind the rally to constantly new all-time-highs.Most people are amazed that the price of Bitcoin has gone from $330 to hovering around $7,500 in just 24 months. That is a whopping 23-fold increase! No asset class in the world has performed better, and it seems that there is nothing stopping this bull run from reaching even greater heights. Stories of people finding bitcoin in their computers that are now worth millions of dollars are going to start popping up in the news once again, and the media cannot get enough of it. And of course, it makes sense for this to be over hyped because 1,000% growth in 24 months is not \u201cnormal\u201d.The thing is, people also want to know why bitcoin\u2019s value keeps rising. Why is a Bitcoin worth $7,500 today?Whatever explanations you hear from so-called experts, don\u2019t believe them. There is only one reason for the price of Bitcoin, or the price of anything else for that matter, to go up or down, and that is\u2026THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMANDThe law of supply and demand. Free market forces dictate that when there is more demand than there is supply, prices will rise. That\u2019s it. There is nothing too complicated about it. The reason why Bitcoin\u2019s price keeps rising is that there are more people buying bitcoins than there are people selling bitcoins, and because Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units.This brings us to the real question we should be asking: Why are more people buying bitcoin today?Utility + Scarcity = ValueJapan, one of the most advanced countries in terms of technology and also one of the biggest economies in the world, just made Bitcoin a legal payment method nationwide. Suddenly, Bitcoin became useful in Japan for merchants and consumers alike. This drove the demand for Bitcoin up, and since it is a very scarce asset, it naturally also drove the price up. It actually increased by over 100% since then. They are the first country to do this, with the Philippines following suit with circular no.944 of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas taking effect early this year. Expect more countries to follow too.A Hedge Against Financial CrisisBitcoin, as mentioned by CNBC, has become a safe haven asset for investors, much like gold or other commodities that go against the flow of capital. Simply put, when the economies of the world are tanking, Bitcoin price tends to go up. Savvy investors are starting to learn that taking a small percentage of your savings or investments and placing them into Bitcoin will offset most losses and actually give much bigger gains, as proven historically. This means that more people want to buy Bitcoin, which translates to a higher price.SpeculationThe world of Finance is like one big casino. A lot of people get into foreign exchange currency trading or the stock market for one reason alone\u200a\u2014\u200ato make money. There are a lot of risks if you do not know what you are doing, and you could easily go broke. Bitcoin, being a very volatile asset class where the price fluctuates up and down, is seen by a lot of traders as a risky but exciting way to earn money. Historically, anyone who has ever bought Bitcoins at any given time in the last 8 years has made money. Since people want to trade Bitcoins daily, it only means that\u2026 more people are buying it on a daily basis.Bitcoin Has Become A Global Reserve CryptocurrencyAltcoins, or other cryptocurrencies, are also on the rise, with a market value of over $80 Billion today. There is a gold rush across the whole industry, and Bitcoin is the way to get in. Most Altcoins cannot be directly traded into regular currencies and need Bitcoin to be able to buy in or cash out. So all these people that want to trade cryptocurrencies are buying Bitcoins to fund their trading. This drives the demand for Bitcoin up and up and up, hence the price follows.Here\u2019s a fun fact: People who bought $100 worth of Bitcoin seven years ago and kept it all these years will be sitting on $69.6 Million today.So, what is the real value of one Bitcoin? This can only be determined by the free market, and no one else. What gives it value? It\u2019s utility and scarcity, or demand for its different use-cases outpacing its global supply. Will it keep rising tomorrow? Who knows? But it is definitely here to stay. In fact, Leo Melamed, the 85 year old chairman emeritus of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which will launch the first institutional Bitcoin Futures trading next week, says Bitcoin will become a totally new asset class of its own. And he would know about currency trading having to gain acceptance\u200a\u2014\u200aHe\u2019s the one who launched the International Monetary Market currency futures trading platform through the CME Group back in 1972.\u201cMy whole life is built abound new technology.

Highlights include:Willy Woo\u2019s NVT Ratio and Dmitry Kalichkin\u2019s NVT SignalRecent work presented by Nic Carter at this year\u2019s Honey Badger conferenceThe subsequent MVRV (Market Value to Realised Value) paper written by Murad Mahmudov and David PuellThis sort of analysis is valuable and unique to the world of cryptoassets. For the first time, absolutely anybody who is investing in a particular asset can observe its underlying activity and performance\u200a\u2014\u200aby using blockchain analysis.This is not possible for the average investor investing in traditional stocks and shares. In those markets leading fund managers and top company execs are typically the only people who know in real time what\u2019s happening within the underlying business of any given stock or share. So if you find the idea of cryptoassets bringing financial equality to the world exciting, then it is essential to understand the role that blockchain analysis plays in that.Bitcoin Network Momentum is another piece of the puzzle to help our understanding of Bitcoin fundamentals and their impact on price. Bitcoin Network Momentum looks at the relationship between Bitcoin\u2019s price and the BTC value of daily transactions flowing through the blockchain.It is important to note here that we are using the BTC daily value flowing through the blockchain, not the USD daily value which NVT Signal uses.What we see when we look at this is that the BTC value of daily transactions acts as a leading indicator of Bitcoin\u2019s major market phases.Note: This article will also discuss the recent introduction of Bitcoin Liquid and its impact on blockchain analysis metrics.Bitcoin Network Momentum and its relationship with\u00a0priceWhen we overlay Bitcoin\u2019s price with the BTC value of transactions running through the blockchain each day, we see that they both follow patterns.Daily Network Transaction Value (in BTC) and Bitcoin price\u00a0chart.At first glance, it is clear that both daily transaction values and price move in cyclical patterns, but that those patterns are not in sync with each other.On closer inspection, we see that BTC daily transaction values provide a leading indicator insight into what stage of the market cycle price is at and therefore where price is likely to go next.This can be broken down into three phases as we can see when we look at the previous market cycle:Early Bear phase: Daily transaction values have dropped right down to around 100k BTC a day. Price is falling.Late Bear phase: Daily transaction values are rising. Price is broadly flat.Bull phase: Daily transactions have reached a sufficient minimum value (220k in the last market cycle, 150k in the one before) where the market finally responds and price starts to increase. We will explore in a moment why this phenomenon occurs.So by monitoring the blockchain momentum in this way we are able to identify when we are closing in on the start of the next BTC price bull run.Why is network BTC daily transaction value a leading indicator to Bitcoin\u00a0price?To understand this, we need to recognize that there is a divergence in behavior between short-term market participants who are dictating short-term price action, and longer-term HODL\u2019ers and investors who are purchasing Bitcoin on-chain.This explains why we see both daily transaction values and price exhibit cyclical patterns but not in sync with each other. Both are driven by different human emotions and motivations.Short-term mindset traders heavily influence the Bitcoin price, long-term mindset investments are more likely to be recorded on the blockchain so have a greater contribution to the network BTC daily transaction value.So why does price lag behind when daily transactions are initially increasing during that Late Bear phase we saw in the previous chart?At this stage as short-term mindset market participants continue to sell, big buyers with a long term view are stepping in. The buyers\u2019 volume steadies the price decline over time and creates the sideways accumulation zone where sells are roughly equal to buys. More and more smart money investment starts to come in until eventually the \u2018healthy\u2019 level of BTC daily transactions is reached. This is the point where the general market herd realizes that things are looking good again for Bitcoin (with its strong level of daily blockchain activity) so price goes up and the next bull market and FOMO cycle starts all over again.It is worth remembering that this Late Bear phase needs to occur before we see a significant price increase. Which is why I become concerned when I see people expecting the price of Bitcoin to jump up immediately on news stories about institutions planning to buy into crypto. Even if they do, we still need actual network daily transaction value in BTC terms to increase to a sustained healthy level before price reacts in a significant way.The minimum daily transaction levels of the previous market cycles that kicked off the new bull runs for BTC\u00a0price.This principle, therefore, helps to explain why we are seeing opportunities highlighted by other blockchain indicators such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) and NVT Signal. For example, when we look at MVRV we can now understand that the market value picks back up above the Realized Value because the network\u2019s daily transactions in BTC terms have reached their healthy level and confidence comes back into the market from both short term and long term mindset investors.Market Value to Realized Value Ratio\u00a0(MVRV)What we can expect going forward for the next bull\u00a0runDaily transaction values are currently low, at around 100k BTC. This means we still have to go through the Late Bear phase where transaction values rise before we start to see a new bull run and any meaningful price increases.Bitcoin Network Momentum: where we need to go\u00a0next.You can see that the network\u2019s healthy level kicking off a new bull run was higher in the 2015\u20132017 market than it was in the 2012-14 market. The reason for this is most likely due to the increased number of coins in circulation\u200a\u2014\u200ashout out to Willy Woo for sharing this thought. As more coins become available, the healthy level of daily transaction value in BTC terms marking the start of the next bull run will need to increase.Projected number of Bitcoins in circulation over\u00a0timeBitcoin Liquid and its Confidential TransactionsAnother factor that we now need to consider with this and other blockchain analysis is the recently launched Bitcoin Liquid. Bitcoin Liquid is a sidechain that allows large exchanges to transfer funds to each other off the main chain in a way that provides much faster and secure transactions. It also supports Confidential Transactions. This means that it will not be possible to view any of the transactions that use this service using blockchain analysis. This is significant because exchanges that account for 50\u201360% of all trading volume will now be using Bitcoin Liquid.So does this make blockchain analysis such as Bitcoin Network Momentum and NVT Signal redundant if we now can\u2019t see such a large proportion of transactions? Well, no it doesn\u2019t, it just means that we no longer have the full picture of the total market. We will now only be able to analyse the remaining section of the market that isn\u2019t using Liquid Confidential Transactions, which is still sizable.One could argue this development will actually make such analysis cleaner as the blockchain transactions we see going forwards will capture less short term exchange driven transactions and have a higher proportion of transactions from long-term investors.Either way, the data we see is still driven by human emotions and so we will continue to observe these cyclical patterns take place and therefore a relationship between the blockchain data and price.", "responses": "10"}, {"title": "What is Bitcoin Cloud Mining\u00a0?", "author_name": "Bitxoxo", "link": "https://medium.com/@bitxoxobitcoin/what-is-bitcoin-cloud-mining-50915ff7aea5?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 10, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "771", "content": "What is Bitcoin Cloud Mining\u00a0?BitxoxoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 10, 2018Bitcoin Cloud Mining is not as complicated as bitcoin mining where the miner needs to set up powerful new gen hardware, favorable climate conditions, and low-cost electricity.The cloud mining is very simple and easy method of sharing, where an individual interested in mining can use the cloud to earn its reward in coins.

Euro! Pound! Afghani! Kaldaar! Tomaan! Rupya!\u201d and on and on.If your currency is better than the Afghani note, these men will happily exchange\u00a0it.Like in many other undeveloped countries with weak national currencies, money exchangers play a major role. Since 2001, with the influx of foreign governments, visitors, workers, businesses, remittences, there has always been a need to convert between the numerous currencies\u00a0being\u00a0dumped\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0country.Sarafis, as money exchangers are called in the local language, also occasionally play the role of money transferrers, usually for remittances or even settling business\u00a0accounts. The concept of these \u2018hawala\u2019 money transfers go back thousands of years and the trusted method of how they operate has practically stayed the same. For a fee of usually 1% you can send money to your family even bypassing sanctions such as in Iran. For some people this traditional affordable, censorship resistant method is the only one available to them.Banks and Western Union can\u2019t compete with these men.When you are approached by the airport sarafis, as a veteran traveler you know to ignore them because they usually charge \u201cunfair\u201d exchange fees, according to locals: usually $1\u20132 dollars per $100 being exchanged or 2% for a single transaction, depending on if you are a khareji, or foreigner. A high price, by local standards (by comparison, you can buy four skewers of lamb kabob for $3.00).Afghan lamb\u00a0kabobs.If you are smart you know to travel only a few neighborhoods away from the airport where you will find many \u201cfair\u201d sarafis, usually on every corner but almost always concentrated near banks. Once you decide on a sarafi, you communicate to them how much you plan to exchange for what currency. The next thing they do is stick their hand in their cargo vest or peran tumbaan pocket and whip out their smart phones. They check the exact exchange rate, according to the internet, at that moment.(FYI to locals, if you pay any more than 10 Afghani notes ($0.20 USD) to exchange $100, you were ripped off)Afghans, like many people in other underdeveloped countries, don\u2019t typically save their hard earned money in the local currency. It works fine for spending but for saving, they almost always exchange the Afghani note to the US dollar. Actually, in certain parts of the country shopkeepers will refuse to accept the national currency altogether! I had this problem in eastern Afghanistan where they prefer the Pakistani Kaldaar, considered a stronger currency and used for trade and business with Pakistan.Afghan women love\u00a0gold.As an aside, I\u2019ve met many families where most of the savings and finances are managed by the family matriarch who also prefer to convert funds to the age old trusted store of value, gold. FYI good luck using your Afghani notes to buy gold. Gold sellers prefer dollars.Enter a gold shop and all you see. Every. Single.\u00a0Time.So why is it despite the numerous other currencies traded in the market in so many underdeveloped countries that Bitcoin is still so unheard of?To answer this question, first we need to examine the underdeveloped countries where Bitcoin has gained a following. Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Iran are the first to come to mind. What do these countries have in common? The answer boils down to mostly necessity, but partly to availability. In the case of Venezuela, having cheap electricity made it possible for Venezuelans to mine and therefore introduce Bitcoin into the currency market where there was already a large demand for foreign currencies. Zimbabweans, with their high-risk national currency the zollar, see Bitcoin even with its price volatility as a relatively stable currency that also pays to save in over time. This demand has allowed a number of Zimbabwean entrepreneurs to launch successful exchanges around Bitcoin. Iranians, cut off from the financial world due to sanctions, see Bitcoin as a way to circumvent them. Iran also has a highly educated and technologically savvy population with many enthusiastic engineers. It\u2019s also quite easy to purchase Bitcoin from your local sarafi in Tehran, I\u2019ve heard.While in the West early adopters of bitcoin have largely been attracted to it ideologically, the adoption in third world countries is much more opportunistic. They need Bitcoin. So why have so few underdeveloped countries seen any meaningful adoption?A few months ago I started a Facebook page for Bitcoin in Afghanistan out of curiosity. I only posted a few videos and articles before I stopped using it and focused on other projects. I had 0 followers anyway.I last logged in yesterday to see 40 followers, all who I\u2019m guessing were searching for how to buy bitcoin. The number one messages I had received were \u201cWhich sarafis sell bitcoin???\u201dYou can literally buy almost any currency in the money\u00a0bazaar.In underdeveloped countries, such as Afghanistan, where the locals dont have faith in their national currency, the currency market is already flooded with other, more relatively stable currencies\u00a0than\u00a0their\u00a0own. There is no reason that Bitcoin cannot catch on either. What is missing is the ability for the people in these countries to buy bitcoin in a simple manner.The Afghans who had messaged my Facebook group seemed to have one thing in common. They came off as very educated or entrepreneurial and perhaps had heard of Bitcoin or read a bit about it in English or Iranian sources. I have yet to see any Afghan media sources mention Bitcoin. These people were kind of exceptional. After all, the country has less than 40% literacy.Despite that, people who cannot even read or write in their native language, let alone English, still use smartphones. They may not know the Persian alphabet but they know how to browse Facebook, like their friend\u2019s photos, and post their own. They can use Facebook to access the news in the form of videos. No literacy required.He may not know how to spell his own name but he knows how to find you on Facebook, jaanam.Facebook has made their platform very user friendly and as a result literally anyone can intuitively start using it. Its adoption in these countries is quite phenomenal. In Afghanistan, if you have a smartphone with mobile internet, chances are you also have an active Facebook account. Official statistics show that of the 16% of internet users in the country, 9% have Facebook accounts. The numbers grow every year.Yes, that woman (pictured left) who was not literate fled a remote village to a remote hilltop and knew what Facebook was.Many people new to Bitcoin think they already missed the boat for being successful in this space but that is far from true. There are small, eager populations hoping to purchase their first bitcoin or satoshis but simply don\u2019t know enough about wallets, keys and so forth to go about doing it. For the ones who don\u2019t know about Bitcoin and wouldn\u2019t understand it even if you explained how it works to them, like Facebook, once they see the value in its use they too will start using it. Like the sarafi who may or may not be literate, the easy to use global forex app he uses to check prices is invaluable for his business.It\u2019s only a matter of the right tools existing that can make Bitcoin more accessible to not just non-technical populations, but even non-literate ones. Ten years ago the only way to send and receive Bitcoin was to be highly technical and know how to manually program transactions. Today, there are many user-friendly wallet applications and hardware devices that obscure the technical nitty gritty so even non-technical Bitcoin enthusiasts can use them.For those willing to become pioneers in an unexplored territory, a world of opportunities await the entrepreneurs and creators interested in building real value in this emerging space.", "responses": "10"}, {"title": "The 5 Minute Guide to Bitcoin\u00a0Futures.", "author_name": "Of Minds And Markets Ph.D", "link": "https://medium.com/swlh/the-5-minute-guide-to-bitcoin-futures-804a4935b583?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 7, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "2.5K", "content": "The 5 Minute Guide to Bitcoin\u00a0Futures.Of Minds And Markets Ph.DBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 7, 2017Big Money is here. Is Bitcoin Ready? https://unsplash.com/@ricktapConfused about Bitcoin Futures? You are not alone.That\u2019s why I have put together a 5 minute guide that will tell you everything you need to know to understand Bitcoin futures.What are\u00a0futures?Normally, when you buy something, the transaction is \u201csettled\u201d immediately. I give you 5 dollars, you give me a three eggplants and we are done. A futures contract is a little different\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead of settling now, we agree to settle at a specific time in the future, for a specific amount.A futures contract has two parts\u200a\u2014\u200athe price, and the date of delivery.So if I agree to give you 5 dollars on Monday for 3 heirloom tomatoes\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s a futures contract. There are a few more details you will need to know\u2014 but that is the essence.Who uses\u00a0futures?There are two main groups of futures buyers.1: The producers and consumers of the underlying commodity who want to\u00a0hedge.For example, If you grow tobacco, you might sell tobacco futures so you can lock in your price, in case the price of tobacco drops by the time you bring your tobacco to market. In the case of bitcoin, the miners fall into this category.On the other hand, if you produce cigarettes, you might buy tobacco futures, so you can lock in your input costs.In both cases, you are using futures to hedge against future price changes.Buying futures hedges against the price going up, and selling futures hedges agains the price going down.2: The traders who want to speculate on the price movements of\u00a0futures.The other group who buy and sell futures are speculators such at day traders, portfolio managers, hedge funds and other institutions. Speculators are drawn to futures because of their high leverage and relatively fast price movements.Speculators don\u2019t actually deliver the underlying asset (I can sell an oil future without actually planning to deliver a barrel of oil). Instead, the contracts are usually just settled for cash.What is the advantage of trading\u00a0futures?Futures are highly leveraged, which means that a trader only has to put up a fraction of the full contract as margin\u200a\u2014\u200abut can profit from the price swings of the full contract. This allows a trader to control a large position with a small amount of capital.Also, futures markets allow traders to take short positions\u200a\u2014\u200aessentially profiting if the price of the asset goes down. While you can short sell traditional stocks or cryptocurrency, you have to borrow the underlying asset first and pay interest\u200a\u2014\u200anot so with futures. So futures drastically reduce the friction of short selling.Are Futures Leveraged?Yes, as mentioned above\u200a\u2014\u200aone compelling aspect of futures is that you can control a large amount of an asset with a small amount of cash. The way this works is that you are required to maintain a certain fraction of the value of the futures contract in your margin account. For CME bitcoin futures, that is set at 35%.Can I buy Bitcoin\u00a0futures?Yes, but the CME contract size is 5 bitcoins, so for example, at today\u2019s rate of $14,000 USD each contract is $70,000 USD.With 35% percent margin required, you will need to maintain a balance of $24,500 just to hold one futures contract.And keep in mind\u200a\u2014\u200aif the price move against you, you will be required to add to your margin balance to keep it above the cutoff. For more info on how margin works on futures contracts\u200a\u2014\u200asee this video from the khan Academy.All this is to say that the futures market will not be financially accessible for a large number of retail traders\u200a\u2014\u200ait is better suited to deep pocked individuals and institutions that can weather a $10k+ drawdown without flinching.Edit: Reddit user Mav-911 points out this correction -Next week the CBOE bitcoin future will be 1 bitcoin. The following week CME bitcoin future will be 5 bitcoins.How will the price of futures be related to the price of\u00a0Bitcoin?Usually, the price of futures is close to the \u201cspot\u201d price. (Spot price = current price of the underlying asset).Any large difference in the price will be usually reduced by arbitrage.Think of it like this: If a futures contract costs more than Bitcoin, you could buy Bitcoin, and sell a future contract at the same time, then, when the contract is up, you deliver the bitcoin for the agreed upon price and therefore profiting on the difference. This is called \u201ccash and carry\u201d arbitrage.In rare cases, there can exist a large difference between the spot price and the futures price\u200a\u2014\u200afor example if there is an oversupply of a commodity, or a shortage is expected in the future.A typical situation will have the futures price slightly higher than the spot price. This is because there is a cost to holding an asset\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have to store it securely for example (no easy task with Bitcoin sometimes).In addition, you lose out on potential interest on the money you use to buy the asset.So when you buy a futures contract\u200a\u2014\u200ayou get the benefit of someone else holding the asset for you, and you get to use your cash elsewhere to earn interest in the mean time\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is why thay are usually (but not always!) a little more expensive than spot.How will futures affect the price of\u00a0Bitcoin?Now that is the million dollar question.In the long run, futures are supposed to increase the market efficiency and reduce volatility.But in the short run, we could see an increase in volatility as a wave of new participants now has access to the market\u200a\u2014\u200aboth to go long and short.For an investigation into how the futures market affected gold, see my article\u00a0: \u201cWill Futures do to Bitcoin what they did to gold?Are there any more important details?Yes, there are a few more things you should know:There is a minimum tic size of $25 per contract\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning the price cannot fluctuate in increments smaller than 25 dollars per contract (5 dollars per Bitcoin)Ther is a daily price fluctuation cap of 20% above or below the previous day\u2019s settlement price. Thus is supposed to limit runaway flash crashes which are all too common on current cryptocurrency exchanges.For all the contract details and the trading hours\u200a\u2014\u200ahere is the official CME spec.

It not holding signifies to me that the market structure has changed and we might be moving towards a differently trending market.The monthly still isn\u2019t bearish but according to it there is quite some room left to move downwards, due to the parabolic rise in 2016 and 2017 not providing much support.Monthly now with support lined\u00a0outNext would be the weekly chart:Weekly chart beginning of\u00a0FebruaryBack then I talked about the parabolic break and was warning about it making a significant move down likely.\u201cShort after daily close below 10k\u201d turned out to be pretty good advice and so was warning about having tight risk management.The current weekly chart shows three support areas, the first being the are between 6800 and 7000 the 2nd one being the previous dip to 6k and the last one being the confluence of the old bull channel and the previous top around 4600.I honestly think that if we break the first support around 7000, 6000 will not stand a chance.I\u2019ll try to knife catch 7000 once, if that fails I\u2019ll prepare for 4300-4600 based on the monthly and weekly support zones.Updated weekly\u00a0chartFor me the weekly market structure has turned bearish a long time ago, I regard candle closes higher than candle wicks meaning that the market structure looks like this to me:Weekly market structure currentlyBlue lines show highs, red lines lows.As you can see we haven\u2019t been able to make any new highs while having made a new low a few weeks ago.My current support and resistance zones for the weekly look like this:Weekly support and resistance levelsLast but not least I talked about the daily chart:Daily chart beginning of\u00a0FebruaryThe candle I outlined back then ended up closing exactly like I expected it to creating the perfect short setup the day after, making this candle the last high before the move to 6k.Daily chart\u00a0nowToo many charts to keep up with, I know. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll sum it up.Monthly support zones:$4700\u20134300~$1100Weekly support zones:$7000\u20136800$6150\u20135800$4600\u20134400Daily support zones:$7000\u20136900$6600\u20136500Anything below those daily levels and I need at least a monthly or weekly support level to trust any reversal.That means once we fall below $6500 I\u2019ll not buy based on the daily chart.I might buy capitulation but I\u2019ll wait for the big levels to trust any trend reversal.Now those are quite a lot of levels, trading them all would be madness.So which one would I trust, which will I be buying?The ones with confluence across timeframes (Indicated in red):Support and resistance across timeframesMy gameplan is the following:I\u2019ll wait for price to hit those zones and I\u2019m waiting for it to respond to them.If they do so in the way I want them to I\u2019ll take a stab at longing them.I\u2019m fully prepared to get stopped out on some or even most of these trades, I consider those lost trades opportunity cost.I\u2019ve had my times with shorts ever since my \u201cBears are in control\u201d article, they\u2019ve been good to me.Being bearish when the chart turned bearish now allows me to knife catch a few times.I\u2019ll leave the big short running that I\u2019ve still got until I get a really good monthly or weekly bull setup but I won\u2019t be adding more Bitcoin shorts (Altcoins are still fair game) unless I get a really really good setup.I\u2019m not going to short BTC far below my perceived value of it, I\u2019d rather just stay flat and try to get a good position for the next run.I feel like the bottom will be in this year even though I doubt we\u2019ll go back up quite as quickly as most think we will.It\u2019ll take time to go parabolic again, in fact, I think after the next capitulation event the market will turn quite boring for a while but I\u2019m pretty sure the parabolic times will come back.And just like last time most people will miss the entry and then beat themselves up over having missed it.Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it.", "responses": "7"}, {"title": "Bitcoin price follow up continued\u200a\u2014\u200aHow will the shakeout\u00a0end?", "author_name": "DK", "link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/bitcoin-price-follow-up-continued-how-will-the-shakeout-end-b0bdb55e265f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 25, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "3.6K", "content": "Bitcoin price follow up continued\u200a\u2014\u200aHow will the shakeout\u00a0end?DKBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 25, 2018Briefly before I start: the below is my personal opinion and not my professional advice. I am describing my views, not giving advice. Prices of any asset can rise or fall.This is a follow up post from a series of price opinion pieces. The latest one can be found in this link below and it makes sense to briefly re-read it to be on the same page:Bitcoin price follow up & some \u201cbold\u201d predictionsI need to start this by clearly stating that this is my personal opinion. It is neither my professional opinion nor is\u2026blog.goodaudience.comWith the price of bitcoin falling as low as $5,750 this weekend seemed to be a good time to refresh my outlook.To recap, in November my scenario (linked in the above article) said that we would possibly rise by more than 100% in short order to complete what I call the \u201cbubble roof\u201d and then likely would come back down hard to \u201cas low as $5,500\u201d. The wave count I presented stayed true till about May 2018, when (as explained in the post linked above) it seemed that the last wave down would be an extended wave that took a bit longer, but the target derived was still $5,000 (but possibly as low as $2,000).As the price has now approached those targets it is time to update my outlook.Chart outlookThe only reason I look at charts is that I believe people as a whole behave similarly in similar situations over time and therefore a look at the past can help to find a likely outcome for the present.Medium Term\u00a0ChartIf you refer to my other price-related articles you will see that the Elliot Wave count (no matter whether you think this is correct from a technical analysis precision stand point; I am aware and have said before that my wave count is basic as all I try to capture is human emotions, not a \u201cperfect\u201d technical analysis and hey\u200a\u2014\u200ait works for me) was only altered once since November 2017, namely by moving the small and capital \u201cC\u201d end point a bit further out in time. Otherwise it still remains valid and I still believe that we will be hitting the area around $5,000 at some point sooner rather than later. Even if we don\u2019t go as low anymore, with my last article predicting this dump at a time when bitcoin traded at $9,300 you can imagine that I am reasonably happy with how the moves played out, whether they hit my final target or not.The more interesting question to me is whether hitting this target means that bitcoin has bottomed and that it is likely to start a new bullish market cycle at that point (1\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20135 waves up; followed by a new A-B-C correction). You can see below that this would be quite significant in that the last 5 wave (green, bold numbers on the chart below) took us from c. $200 to c. $20,000.Long Term\u00a0ChartSo what can we do to determine which is more likely to happen? On the technical side, we can examine how the \u201cbig brother\u201d of our bitcoin bubble, namely the\u00a0.com bubble, played out (nota bene: if you still do not believe that we were or are in a bubble, then you don\u2019t need to read on). I posted the below two charts on Twitter a few weeks ago and there are a few interesting takeaways in my opinion..com vs crypto\u00a0bubblesAs you can see, the Nasdaq had four significant bear market rallies during the\u00a0.com bubble bursting. If you look at their magnitude, as well as their timing, you cannot help but notice how similar (on a much faster time scale, but still very similar in terms of proportionality on the chart) the bitcoin bubble has burst to date. Both bubbles had a strong rally of approximately 35% almost directly after their all time high, which failed to reach a new high. That was followed by a strong rally after the initial sell off and then another one a few time intervals later.The Nasdaq had one more strong bear market rally of close to 60% from a capitulation low before it built out its final leg down, which also ended in capitulation, but importantly was characterized by a much slower grind downwards than the moves prior. Now, let\u2019s look at how the last bitcoin crash from 2014 unfolded. I have tried to show what I mean by combining the bitcoin chart of 2017/18 with the one of 2013/14 on the same screen:The \u201cgood\u201d news here is that (eerily analogous to the Nasdaq chart) after another small and sharp move down ($5,000-$5,500?) that should still come here, we would be in line for a very strong 50%+ rally. The bad news of course is that (also analogous to the Nasdaq chart) after all your usual suspects on crypto twitter will have convinced you that this was the \u201cWyckoff spring\u201d and that we are now on the road to new all time highs, causing a lot of people to FOMO buy into that rally, we would see the final shakeout, which would likely end somewhere in the $2,000s.I personally think that the two analogies drawn here are too strong to ignore if you buy into the notion that bitcoin is currently driven almost exclusively by either manipulated tether trading or human emotion. There is a way to fit this move into Elliot Waves as well (meaning we would not have been in an A-B-C correction but in a 1\u20135 move down instead of up), but I would revisit that when we actually get there.Concluding, in my opinion it is still likely that the current move ends in a sharp move towards $5,500 or slightly lower. After that, everything is in place for a relief rally (likely driven by short covering, not new investment), but the final shakeout will still happen. A bubble like the current one is unlikely to end with initial buyers (for my purposes people who bought around $1,000\u20132000) still being as relaxed as they currently are. These are the guys that will need to break a sweat in my opinion for us to have found a sustainable bottom. In any case, I personally would not trust any rally that does not clear $12,000 significantly.Fundamental considerationsIt is important to note that the entire technical commentary above is based on a certain view of the fundamental state of crypto. The main pillars of this view are:99% of all ICOs are worthless and will lose investors money UNLESS they add security-like rights (see here)Crypto is sadly full of scammers that have an easy time taking advantage of inexperienced retail investors (see here)Regulations are not enforced and still very unclear, so large institutional investors, even if they truly wanted to (which they currently don\u2019t for the same reasons retail ones don\u2019t\u200a\u2014\u200ano FOMO), cannot enterCrypto is currently a closed community. Those that are part of the \u201ccult\u201d have c. 80\u201390% of their investable funds already invested and cannot buy much more. In order to truly break free from the current bear market new money that is currently not interested in crypto has to move into cryptoChinese regulators uphold their ban on bitcoin investing. If they lift this ban, there is a chance this is enough new money to break free (but it more likely just fuels the last bear market rally as described above).Tether is unlawful, unauditable and a major manipulative force that will likely still implode. For example by the US government seizing the funds on their accounts (noting the law firm letter is not an audit in passing) under money laundering regulations.Also, you may want to have a brief look at these considerations:The biggest myths in cryptocurrency investing today and what would cause a new all time highFollowing the cryptoshpere on twitter and elsewhere I notice that quite a few myths hold steady in different parts of\u2026blog.goodaudience.comIf any of the above environmental factors change, the technical situation would become irrelevant and we could see a large move up or down at any time.Thank you for reading. If you enjoyed this, please clap and have a look if you\u2019d like to follow me on twitter.Lastly, the all important disclaimer: this is my personal opinion, not my professional advice. Most of all this is not investment advice in any way. Crypto assets can fluctuate widely in value and all of your capital can be lost. I have a 50/50 chance of being right. Any negative views expressed are solely aimed at the token in question, never at the development teams behind them for which I have utmost respect (if they are sincere).", "responses": "12"}, {"title": "A lot of people will lose money on Bitcoin today.

I think we may see $25,000 per Bitcoin in the next 2 years.We are in one of the greatest bull markets of all time. And a lot of people are going to lose money. As in, get completely rekt.Let me explain.You see, the market conspires to take your money. It does this by playing on your psychology in nearly irresistible ways, enticing you to make exactly the wrong move at exactly the wrong time.No one is immune.The main purpose of the stock market is to make fools of as many men as possible.-Bernard BaruchLets see how this works in practice with an example from earlier this year.Follow me on the journey of a typical \u201cinvestor\u201d in nine simple pictures:This is how you make a $600 loss when the market is a raging bull. Rinse and repeat a few times and you\u2019ve blown your whole account.This behavior is nothing to be ashamed of, it is built into your psyche. The successful traders are the ones who have learned to suppress these emotions, and to make decisions that are uncomfortable.But you can nip this whole cycle of loss in the bud if you follow one simple rule:Rule 1 of Trading: Never chase the price.When the price of an asset makes a rapid increase in price, the fear of missing out kicks in.It\u2019s almost painful to watch the price go up while you sit on the sidelines. Your mind will play tricks on you. It will feel like the last bus is leaving town, and you\u2019re not on it.But another bus will come\u200a\u2014\u200ait always does.Take a look at Bitcoin over the last five months. I count at least four major price breakouts (the colored triangles). Every single price breakout was \u201cclosed\u201d, i.e, the price eventually returned to the breakout level or below before moving on.This time will be no different. Remember this when you see the price taking off again.Fools will chase, you will wait patiently.Of course, it\u2019s easy for me to say, and it\u2019s easy to nod your head and promise to never chase the price.But I have done it, and you probably will too.Most people just have to learn the hard way.

This post is not intended to be investment advice.Bitcoin has experienced a meteoric rise in the public consciousness since late 2017, much of it driven by short-term speculation by newcomers who have no idea what Bitcoin actually is or does, but are simply hoping its price keeps going up so that they can make some quick and easy money.At one point, worldwide Google searches for Bitcoin surpassed searches for Trump, which is no easy feat.Despite this giant wave of new interest, it\u2019s safe to assume that most people\u2019s opinion of Bitcoin is still either really negative, mildly negative, or just plain apathetic.That kind of skepticism is understandable. At first glance, Bitcoin seems like yet another silly, overhyped plaything for tech nerds, from the same industry that brought us dubious \u201cinnovations\u201d like Google Glass, Yo, Soylent, and Juicero.In fact, many of today\u2019s most passionate Bitcoin enthusiasts will tell you that they, too, started out as doubters, and that the notion that something like Bitcoin could ever become a meaningful part of the global economy seemed delusional.But it\u2019s becoming harder to dismiss Bitcoin with each passing day. This thing that is endlessly compared to Dutch tulips and ridiculed as \u201cdigital Beanie Babies\u201d has now been around for nearly 10 years and counting, has survived hundreds of premature obituaries, is owned by tens of millions of people, and has a market capitalization of nearly $200 billion. If Bitcoin were a company (which it isn\u2019t), it would be one of the top 30 biggest in the world.Bitcoin\u2019s rise has been largely driven by speculation and greed, but there\u2019s so much more to Bitcoin than just its price.What newcomers may not realize is that Bitcoin\u2019s technology is the foundation for a radically new type of financial system which is already challenging many of our long-held assumptions about what money is, and how it could change in the future.You would never know this from reading the news, though. The more you learn the details of what Bitcoin is and how it works, the more you realize just how little most journalists actually know about it. With a few exceptions, most mainstream media stories about Bitcoin are embarrassingly bad. Many are poorly researched, while others only seem interested in using half-truths and misinformation to generate controversy (which brings in more clicks and ad revenue for news sites).Whether due to dishonesty or just ignorance, the end result of all this low-quality Bitcoin journalism is that most newcomers never get to learn about all the new and exciting things made possible by Bitcoin\u2019s core technology.The #1 reason why Bitcoin is\u00a0coolToday, if you want to send money to a friend or family member in another country, making an international wire transfer via the existing global interbank payment network (SWIFT) could take anywhere from 2 to 10 days, with average total fees of up to $50. Believe it or not, wiring money internationally can be slower and more costly than sending that same amount as cash in a physical package.And if you or the recipient don\u2019t have a bank account\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is still the case for more than 2 billion adults worldwide\u200a\u2014\u200ayou would have to use a company like Western Union which can charge as much as $95 in fees to send $1,000. What\u2019s worse, it\u2019s generally poorer working-class people who are more likely to be unbanked and have to pay these extravagant fees to send their earnings to family members overseas.With Bitcoin, for the first time in history it\u2019s possible for anyone with an internet connection to quickly and securely send any amount of money to anyone else, anywhere in the world (or even Mars!), for low or zero fees.And this isn\u2019t just theoretical. It happens every day on the Bitcoin network.The largest Bitcoin transaction in history was for more than 500,000 BTC on November 16, 2011. That amount was worth around $1 million at the time and at today\u2019s prices is worth roughly $5 billion. This transaction was transmitted and processed instantly, for $0 in fees, and no government or corporation could have stopped the transaction or tried to add on extra fees even if they wanted to.Why Bitcoin is differentBitcoin\u2019s most important property is arguably its censorship resistance, which means it can\u2019t be controlled by any single government or corporation.Bitcoin is able to be censorship-resistant because Bitcoin transactions are not processed by a bank or a credit card company. Instead, they are processed by independent bitcoin mining groups that are spread throughout the world and are continuously competing against each other to be the one to process your transaction first.Companies like VISA, Bank of America, and PayPal are centralized corporations that are headquartered in the US, and thus they can be pressured, sued, subpoenaed, or even forcefully shut down by the US government at will.On the contrary, Bitcoin operates as a global decentralized network of independent miners, and the more decentralized something is, the harder it is for any one person or group to control it or shut it down.For example, even if the Chinese government were able to successfully shut down all bitcoin mining companies in China tomorrow, you would still be able to make bitcoin transactions as long as there are enough miners outside China who are willing to process your transaction.What is mining? And how does it make bitcoin censorship-resistant?It\u2019s not out of the goodness of their hearts that those bitcoin miners are willing to process your transaction. Rather, processing your transaction is simply a means to an ends, and the ends they are after is the mining reward of 12.5 BTC (worth about US$125,000 at Feb 2018 prices) that accompanies every new block that is added to the blockchain.The blockchain is the undisputed permanent record of every Bitcoin transaction that has ever happened, and at any given time more than 10,000 volunteers\u2019 computers are maintaining an identical copy of the blockchain for even more security and censorship resistance. Each \u201cblock\u201d in the blockchain is simply a collection of transactions (up to 1MB in size), and a new block of transactions (along with the 12.5 BTC reward) is \u201cmined\u201d and added to the blockchain once every 10 minutes, on average.You can think of the mining of each block like a competitive lottery. The 12.5 BTC mining reward from each new block is a \u201cjackpot\u201d, and the more computing power and electricity a miner expends to process transactions for the bitcoin network, the higher their chances of winning each new block\u2019s mining reward. This process of expending computing power and electricity to process transactions and secure the network is part of a system called \u201cproof of work\u201d.The rising price of Bitcoin over the years has attracted more and more new miners, which in turn helps to make the Bitcoin network even more decentralized. As the number of independent mining groups increases and becomes more geographically dispersed, it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive for governments to shut them all down. As a result, to this day the Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked.A case study in censorship resistance: WikileaksWikileaks is a highly controversial organization, which makes it a great case study for Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance.Supporters of Wikileaks argue that it keeps powerful institutions accountable by empowering less-powerful individuals to anonymously leak evidence of unethical behavior.Meanwhile, critics of Wikileaks argue that it threatens national security and international relations, and that it\u2019s often biased in terms of who it decides to target (e.g. the US) and not target (e.g. Russia) with its leaks.As a result of this controversy, in 2010 several of the world\u2019s biggest payment providers including Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, PayPal, and Western Union started making it impossible for people to donate to Wikileaks through their payment networks.This was a huge blow to Wikileaks, which is a non-profit that depends on donations to stay afloat. There was no legal basis for this kind of financial blockade, and Wikileaks had not been charged with or convicted of any crime at any level. The blockade seemed completely arbitrary and reactionary. After all, these same companies had never found it necessary to block donations to hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Even critics of Wikileaks had to begrudgingly agree that this financial blockade set a dangerous precedent for monetary freedom.However, thanks to Bitcoin, which cannot be blocked by any government or corporation, Wikileaks was able to start accepting Bitcoin donations in 2011 to help cover their operating expenses. It was a victory for free speech, and a blow to governments and large corporations who want to be able to monitor and control how citizens spend their money.Maybe you don\u2019t care about Wikileaks, or even actively dislike them. But I\u2019m sure you have a favorite non-profit organization that you have donated to in the past. Maybe it\u2019s the National Rifle Association, or Black Lives Matter, or Freedom to Marry, or Planned Parenthood, or Scientology. Whatever it is, how would you feel if, one day, the government or some bank decided that they didn\u2019t like what that non-profit stands for, and started preventing you and others from donating to that organization, causing it to go bankrupt?That is what is at stake here, and while government censorship will always be a threat, Bitcoin makes financial censorship more difficult than it\u2019s ever been.How Bitcoin can help the poor and\u00a0unbankedIf you are a middle- or upper-class person living in a developed country, it\u2019s easy to take bank accounts for granted. Everyone you know probably has multiple bank accounts, which in turn enables you to use credit cards, buy and trade stocks, get a loan, and use payment apps like Venmo, Square Cash, and PayPal.However, 2 billion adults worldwide are still completely \u201cunbanked\u201d and don\u2019t even have a basic checking or savings account. Instead, they rely on physical cash for their day-to-day transactions, which is not only inconvenient but also means that they could be robbed of their entire life savings on any given day.There are a lot of reasons why people wouldn\u2019t use banks. It might be because they don\u2019t trust banks in general; or because they want to avoid paying overdraft and minimum account balance fees; or a variety of other reasons.In turn, banks have very little incentive to serve the unbanked. It\u2019s much more profitable for them to serve \u201cless risky\u201d people with higher net worths living in higher-density urban areas. That ends up excluding poor people, people living in rural areas, and people who don\u2019t qualify for a bank account due to past financial mistakes.This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, and it\u2019s something that we shouldn\u2019t expect will ever change. It\u2019s a fundamental limitation of our existing financial system that ensures that banking will never be for everyone\u200a\u2014\u200aonly the privileged.The first breakthrough: Kenya\u2019s\u00a0M-PesaIn that regard, one of the biggest innovations in money and \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d has come from a country that many might not expect: Kenya. Despite having a GDP per capita ($1,500) that is only 1/40th of that of the United States, Kenya has achieved something that no country has done before\u200a\u2014\u200abecome a pioneer and the worldwide leader in bank-less mobile payments.In Kenya, there is a service called M-Pesa that is operated by the country\u2019s largest telecom provider and allows anyone to deposit money into their mobile phone and then send that money via text message to anyone else in the same mobile network, without ever having to interact with a bank.Since launching in 2007, M-Pesa has become ubiquitous in Kenya, with more than two-thirds of the adult population now using the service.It also become a boon for Kenya\u2019s underserved population. The share of the unbanked who use M-Pesa rose from about 21% in 2008 to 75% in 2011, while the prevalence of bank accounts in the same period stayed relatively flat. Access to mobile money services like M-Pesa helped lift 194,000 Kenyan households out of extreme poverty, with female-headed households seeing far greater increases in consumption than male-headed households. And another study found that income increased 5\u201330% for rural Kenyan households that adopted M-Pesa.This was a breakthrough in financial inclusion and innovation, and there were high hopes early on that Kenya\u2019s success could be quickly replicated in other countries and spread to the rest of the world\u2019s unbanked population as well.However, that hasn\u2019t happened and mobile money services have struggled to gain similar traction outside of Kenya. In retrospect, it seems that Kenya had a perfect combination of government support, pent-up consumer demand, and skillful implementation that has been difficult to replicate in other countries.While M-Pesa proved that it can reach and benefit millions of people that banks cannot (or will not), unfortunately, mobile money services like M-Pesa suffer from the same limitations and bottlenecks as the banks they aim to replace:Profit Concerns: M-Pesa is operated by a for-profit telecom company, Vodafone, which means they have to charge fees for their service in order to make money, and will only expand to new areas if it is profitable for them to do so.Geographic Limitations: M-Pesa users can only send money to other people in the M-Pesa network, and within their own country.Infrastructure Bottlenecks: Services like M-Pesa need to establish a new infrastructure in every country they hope to operate in, which includes partnering with banks and telecom companies, gaining regulatory approval from the government, building a large network of local \u201cagents\u201d to enable deposits and withdrawals, and so on.Bitcoin, on the other hand, has none of the limitations of M-Pesa (or banks):(No) Profit Concerns: Bitcoin is not a company. It doesn\u2019t have any quarterly revenue targets, and it doesn\u2019t have any shareholders who can pressure it into raising fees to improve its profit margins.(No) Geographic Limitations: Bitcoin is inherently global, like the internet and like email. The process of sending Bitcoin to someone in Japan, or in Germany, or in the United States, is exactly the same.(No) Infrastructure Bottlenecks: Bitcoin can be sent or received on any internet-connected device, so its global infrastructure is already built. No governments, banks, or telecoms necessary.Bitcoin: Finishing what M-Pesa\u00a0startedBitcoin could do for money and financial inclusion what Wikipedia did for encyclopedias and access to knowledge.For almost 2,000 years, encyclopedias were only available in print form. The most famous brand was Encyclopedia Brittanica, which cost a whopping $1,400 for a full 32-volume print edition.Encyclopedia Britannica\u2019s $1,400 print version was discontinued in\u00a02010Then, in the early 1990s, as home computers became more commonplace, encyclopedias became available on CD-ROMs as well. The most successful of these was Microsoft\u2019s Encarta, which launched in 1993 and cost $99.The move from print to digital made encyclopedia knowledge more accessible by a factor of more than 10x ($1,400 vs $99). Encyclopedias were now something that the middle class could afford to own as well.Microsoft Encarta was discontinued in\u00a02009Finally, in 2001, Wikipedia came along and changed everything, with an idea that seemed absolutely ludicrous at the time: Instead of a for-profit company like Encyclopedia Brittanica that centrally employs hundreds of full-time editors, Wikipedia is a non-profit that relies on a decentralized community of millions of passionate volunteers across the world to edit its content for free.Today, Wikipedia is the fifth most popular website in the world behind only Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Baidu. In the span of a few decades, the cost of access to the world\u2019s knowledge has gone from $1,400 to completely free and universally accessible for anyone with an internet connection.Whether you\u2019re a software engineer in California on a $1,000 iPhone X, or a working-class person in India on a $40 Android smartphone, Wikipedia is the first place most people go to learn about a new topic.In this metaphor, if the banks are Encyclopedia Brittanica (least accessible) and M-Pesa is Encarta (more accessible), then Bitcoin is Wikipedia (universally accessible). Like Wikipedia did for knowledge, Bitcoin represents a fundamentally different vision for how money should work, and it makes possible things that would never have been possible in the old system.Imagine a jewelry maker in Mongolia being able to directly sell a handmade necklace to a hipster in San Francisco; a teacher in Ghana being able to directly purchase a subscription to the New York Times for their classroom; or a wealthy Japanese patron being able to directly fund an up-and-coming independent Argentinian filmmaker\u2019s next project.These kinds of things are all possible (and already happening) with Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200awe just need to make it simpler and easier for anyone to get started.\u201cYou fool, this isn\u2019t even [Bitcoin\u2019s] final\u00a0form!\u201dBitcoin is just a kid. It isn\u2019t even 10 years old.Bitcoin today is comparable to the internet in the mid-90s, back when we were still using AOL to check our email and using dial-up modems that sounded like this and were literally 1000x slower than today\u2019s broadband speeds. At the time, the thought of one day being able to do things like instantly stream unlimited videos on your phone for free (i.e. Youtube), was unfathomable.The way we use money in the next 10 and 20 years will probably look totally different from how we use it today, and it would be foolish to think that the same big banks and lending companies that caused the catastrophic 2008 global financial crisis are going to be the ones driving that change.Following the 2008 crisis, people occupied Wall Street and the US Department of Justice (reluctantly) attempted to prosecute financial firms and executives, but nothing really changed. You can count on one finger the number of Wall Street executives who went to jail for helping cause the crisis.Perhaps Bitcoin can succeed now, where activism and our political system failed. Not by protesting greedy executives or putting them in jail, but rather by slowly making their industry obsolete. And big banks are starting to take notice.Bitcoin optimists think it can eventually become the world\u2019s global currency\u200a\u2014\u200aa borderless \u201cmoney without rulers\u201d. On the other hand, Bitcoin pessimists think that the same powerful institutions that control the world\u2019s financial system today will simply co-opt Bitcoin\u2019s ideas, and the end result will be the same groups remaining in power, just through different means.My own views fall somewhere in the middle. I don\u2019t expect Bitcoin to take over the world anytime soon, but I do love that it\u2019s giving people (especially the underserved) more options, beyond what banks have been willing to provide.Widespread change takes time, and there are few things in this world that will be harder to change than the world\u2019s financial system. Even Amazon, which has been around for more than 23 years and has become one of the most dominant companies in the world, still accounts for only 4% of all retail sales in the US.But for the first time in a long time, I\u2019m excited for how things could change for the better. I believe that, for all its growing pains, Bitcoin\u2019s greatest contribution to society so far has been in helping us see a different and better future, and making us realize that it\u2019s a lot closer than we thought.The only question now is how soon that future will arrive.As you read this, many of the world\u2019s smartest developers, entrepreneurs, and computer scientists are hard at work trying to help Bitcoin fulfill its massive potential even a day sooner, if possible.You could be one of those people, too.", "responses": "29"}, {"title": "Breaking (away from) Bitcoin\u2026 Building the Easy Smoke\u00a0DEX.", "author_name": "Stoner", "link": "https://medium.com/smokenetwork/breaking-away-from-bitcoin-building-the-easy-smoke-dex-dc1b9ef591c9?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 9, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "3.4K", "content": "Breaking (away from) Bitcoin\u2026 Building the Easy Smoke\u00a0DEX.StonerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 9, 2018\u201cA group of people brainstorming over a laptop and sheets of paper\u201d by \u0160tefan \u0160tefan\u010d\u00edk on\u00a0UnsplashMost, if not all cryptocurrencies suffer at the fate of Bitcoins hand.When BTC rises so do the small cap alts, and when BTC falls the alts fall rapidly, often outpacing the fall of BTC as sellers panic, exacerbate the problem as they try to lock in what gains they may have.What is the\u00a0problem?Trading pairs and lack of value.Most cryptocurrencies rely on Bitcoin as their main on ramp, off ramp and liquidity pair, and as such these cryptocurrencies are bought and sold, not for USD, but for what seems to be endless decimals and fractions of bits being bought and sold tirelessly day in and day out.Cryptocurrencies are also extremely volatile and almost impossible to derive a true value as it is simply not backed by anything other than supply and demand. With the Smoke blockchain there are incentives to stake coins in the network in order to influence how minted coins are distributed..\u00a0. Tokens sitting on-top of a base layer such as Ethereum, NEO or Bitshares suffer even further as the base trading pair to these have even less on ramps and off ramps and often require purchasing Bitcoin first, to cash out or put money in, creating yet another step for traders, speculators and users to derive value in the asset they end up holding. Because of this inefficiency in the market tokens with low liquidity are often at the mercy of price swings as the USD price of the token is derived from the base pair pricing.\u201cThink of it this way, imagine someone wanted to drop the entire stock market by 50%. What\u2019s the BEST way to do that? Well all valuation is tied to the USD. If you could drop the dollar value by 50% relative to another fiat like the Euro, immediately, the stock market would crash by 50%. Governments prevent this from being possible. BTC is our USD and Alts are stocks. Their value, even if traded for each other is all tied to the value of BTC just like all stocks are tied to the dollar.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMAXIDIGIThe solution is a direct FIAT bridge and Decentralized Exchange.Thanks to our recent partnership with EasyDEX, we are able to implement a fully decentralized exchange into the Smoke Network, with full FIAT on ramp and off ramp for both USD and EUR, as well as other popular cryptocurrencies and cannabis tokens directly on the Smoke Decentralized Exchange powered by the Bitshares blockchain and SMOKE EasyDex bridge.\u00a0.How will this work with the Smoke blockchain?On signing up for an account on the Smoke mainnet blockchain, users will be generated a Smoke account as well as a Bitshares account with the same owner key and username on both blockchains. If you already have a Bitshares account you will be able to generate a Smoke account via your existing Bitshares owner key if you wish to do so. A bridge will allow users to deposit liquid SMOKE from their Smoke account to their Bitshares account which will allow trading into other cryptocurrencies and fiat.EasyDEX brings with them many years of experience working with DPoS blockchains as well as trustless account recovery options for both Smoke and Bitshares accounts created through our platform.The partnership with EasyDEX and the integration of Bitshares opens SMOKE chain up to exciting possibilities such as cross-chain transfers, a bridge service for fiat and other cryptocurrencies, and later EOS integration, as well as e-commerce and point of sale systems\u2026 not to mention other DApps in the works and Whaleshare community tokens that will be present in the Smoke Ecosystem.", "responses": "442"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Matt Schlicht", "link": "https://medium.com/zapchain-magazine/the-best-resources-for-learning-to-build-bitcoin-and-block-chain-applications-8de1953506f5?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 14, 2014", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "1K", "content": "The Best Resources for Learning to Build Bitcoin and Block Chain ApplicationsMatt SchlichtBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 14, 2014These resources were collected by the Bitcoin community on ZapChain.Thank you to: Melissa Volkmann, Anthony Di Iorio, MacLane Wilkison, Derek Minter, Pantera Capital, Pat Jack, Ni Ma, Mitchell W.

Humans can rely on essential traits like DNA to serve as stable markers of identity, and nonliving systems (corporations, for example) can rely on governments and legal systems to anoint them with stable identities.Cryptocurrencies and public blockchains, though, have no such privilege. They aim to decentralize their leadership without relying on a single third party in establishing their identity. Instead, they rely on subjective social- and economic-consensus mechanisms. While some cryptocurrencies use foundations or corporations to resolve disputes and arbitrate core issues of identity, that\u2019s a fragile approach and generally not consistent with the objectives of these systems.The most sustainable approach for cryptocurrency is to dispense with the kingmakers, bite the bullet, and leave it to intersubjective consensus. This requires a commitment to a set of practical values that constitute the essence of the system. Systems with more internal consistency and more universally agreed upon value sets are better equipped to last.The Ship of Theseus\u00a0ParadoxA classic question-of-identity paradox goes like this: The Greek hero Theseus asks his crew to rebuild his travel-worn boat, and they replace it plank by plank. When the task is done, he ponders whether his restored boat is really the same boat as before, given that all the parts have been replaced. He further considers that if he were to ask his crew to build a new boat with the planks of the old one, two boats would both have a credible claim to being his old vessel. But which is the true original?It\u2019s compelling because there\u2019s no clear answer. The story shows us that the identity of an object isn\u2019t absolute\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s assigned, rather than essential.This comes up even in human contexts: Your cells replace themselves so often that the present you shares very little physical matter with the version of you that existed a decade ago; prisoners held for violent crimes are paroled with the assertion that they have become \u201ca different person\u201d in some vital sense; or\u200a\u2014\u200aperhaps the simplest example\u200a\u2014\u200ayou might at some time have credibly apologized the day after an intoxicated argument by asserting, \u201cI wasn\u2019t myself last night.\u201d In all these cases, the person is clearly the same person in one sense of identity, but in another sense, many of the traits that make up the person are mutable.This is okay because the systems that depend on humans to have stable identities can account for the fact that personalities, memories, and physical selves change over time. On a day-to-day basis, our friends and family recognize us, even with decades-long gaps. Low-stakes identity challenges can depend on the recall of certain things we know about ourselves\u200a\u2014\u200aSocial Security numbers, passwords, birthdays, mom\u2019s maiden name, or the name of your first pet. And high-stakes identity challenges can depend on physical markers like fingerprints, retina scans, or DNA tests.If you build a system meant by its very nature to dis-intermediate third parties and exist independent of governments and legal systems, then you have a\u00a0problem.But those human identifiers all rely on the involvement of third parties. And, similarly, certain nonliving systems can use third parties to establish their sense of identity. Creating legal entities like corporations solidifies abstract, malleable sets of individuals and ideas and gives them persistence over time, even if their staffs and business models change entirely. And granting legal assignments like trademarks or patents gives ideas and concepts persistent identity as well as gives their owners exclusivity.Most nonliving things don\u2019t have these kinds of third-party tiebreakers, though, making them especially vulnerable to Theseus problems. If you build a system meant by its very nature to dis-intermediate third parties and exist independent of governments and legal systems, you have an identity problem. And that problem is one public blockchains face.The Theseus Problem of BlockchainsWhile I do not much like the term \u201cblockchain,\u201d I\u2019ll use it here for simplicity. What I am referring is not enterprise blockchains but rather open and permissionless systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum. These two blockchains, in particular, have suffered severe crises of identity over the years.For Bitcoin, its crisis turned on whether it should attempt to scale up as a P2P payment network immediately (and raise throughput) or whether it should pursue a layered approach. Ethereum had to contend with a reckoning in which participants had to determine their desired level of immutability in response to the DAO exploit.Both sides had credible cases. There was no constitution that specified, one way or the other, that Bitcoin\u2019s blocksize was permanently capped or that Ethereum couldn\u2019t use a hard fork to reverse (ostensibly) illicit transactions. (Ethereum has a formal specification, but that is a more technical rather than constitutional document.) Instead, there were messy processes of social-consensus formation, appeals to authority, deep readings of original documents, and, ultimately, rancorous splits.These are not incidental problems or one-offs; they are a core feature of decentralized systems. Public blockchains like Bitcoin, with no recognized leadership, are exposed to competing views of what they are and should be. In a previous post, Hasu and I made an effort to chronicle those disparate visions over time. For sure, there are developers, entrepreneurs, thinkers, miners, and capital allocators who wield disproportionate influence in Bitcoin, but no single individual or institution exerts unilateral control. Therefore, divergent views of the protocol cannot simply be quashed.Two Approaches to These\u00a0ProblemsHow do we cope with this? There are two ways: One is expedient and the other is more sustainable.The first and most common method is to give a corporation or foundation rights to a trademark, as is the case with Tezos or EOS.IO. This is the default for non-Bitcoin blockchains and gives an entity the legal force to anoint and ratify a single chain. Of course, no one is bound to follow this, and there could be a fork of Tezos that everyone mutually agrees to use.However, the trademark carries certain legal protections, and if a fork tried to retain the name, the trademark owner would have recourse, at least where the fork tried to interact with regulated institutions. In this case, the trademark is just one manifestation of the core issue, which is confirmation that the leadership of a blockchain is seeking authoritative ratification of their control. Other activities this entity might engage in would be pressuring exchanges to use one ticker over another or support one fork over another as well as spreading a consistent message to the media. All of these give the entity de facto control over which fork is chosen in a dispute.Consider just how little persistence Bitcoin\u2019s components have. The entire codebase has been reworked, altered, and expanded such that it barely resembles its original\u00a0version.The other approach is to throw caution to the wind and spurn any external marker of identity, relying instead on an intersubjective consensus, such that the system can change over time while remaining faithful to its original goals. This is the approach leaderless (or, more accurately, leader-minimized) systems like Bitcoin and Monero go for. Of course, there are influential individuals in both systems, but neither has a foundation or corporation in control of a trademark or a clear decision-making body. Many critics would say that Bitcoin Core, as the author of the dominant implementation of Bitcoin, wields disproportionate control, but that\u2019s a reductive reading. It is not an official body, and the dominant implementation that they create does not define the essence of Bitcoin but rather its instantiation. Pierre Rochard puts it well:Bitcoin\u2019s block and transaction validity rules are a social consensus that is automated with software. Where they diverge the software is wrong. This is an uncomfortable reality for proponents and detractors alike.This concept deserves formalization and a lengthier treatment, and I will cover it in a more detailed manner in a forthcoming post.To pause for a second, consider just how little persistence Bitcoin\u2019s components have. The entire codebase has been reworked, altered, and expanded such that it barely resembles its original version. Core features like multi-signature transactions and pay to script hash have been added over the years, and the protocol only loosely resembles the system described in the white paper\u200a\u2014\u200awhich itself is not a constitution but rather an introduction and teaser. None of the original nodes from 2009 are still running (to the best of my knowledge). Mining has become industrialized and has virtually nothing in common with the hobbyist mining of the early days. The leader has left, as have many of the early developers and stewards of the system, and new sets of developers have sprung up in their place.The registry of who owns what, the ledger itself, is virtually the only persistent trait of the network, but the ability to copy it at will means it can be splintered. The Bitcoin Cash fork copied the UTXO set and started a new history while retaining the old balances. So it is largely trivial to copy the history and make a claim to the name. Indeed, this was exactly the strategy employed by Bitcoin Cash proponents\u200a\u2014\u200astrident appeals to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision.To be considered truly leaderless, you must surrender the easy solution of having an entity that can designate one chain as the legitimate one.Their argument was, in effect, that Bitcoin Cash more closely recaptures the essence of Bitcoin. Bitcoin may own the name, but we are closer to the system as intended by its creator and, hence, the true heirs. And they were free to do this because Bitcoin has no foundation, corporation, or entity that sets policy and lives entirely outside of the government, which ultimately adjudicates decisions like these in more conventional contexts. The Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash struggle was so bitter precisely because there is no single entity that can anoint a true Bitcoin, so it had to be fought in the market, in the media, and in the minds of proponents.Many critics identify this struggle as a shortcoming or flaw of a distributed system and propose alternative mechanisms to adjudicate disputes. Whether these will work are an empirical matter, but ultimately, the tradeoff remains. To be considered truly leaderless, you must surrender the easy solution of having an entity that can designate one chain as the legitimate one. Political consensus as to the true, genuine protocol must be continually sought and found. Without a stable identity, the system is guaranteed to splinter into pieces.One Solution to Leaderless IdentityHow can you have persistence of identity in a distributed, leaderless system? The cheap solution of having a single entity take de facto or de jure control is unavailable in this context. In fact, the answer is already quite established, although it hasn\u2019t been much discussed. The way that Bitcoin has survived a decade of identity crises, absent any single leader, is this: It has a robust and mutually understood set of ideals that constitute the essence of the system.The stronger the consensus around these shared ideals, the easier warding off competitors and resisting fragmentation becomes. Additionally, the market mechanism of pricing forks (sometimes prior to their birth through futures) enables individuals to receive powerful informational signals about what their peers are intending to do, which propagates consensus-forming signals efficiently.During the Bitcoin Cash fork, the core question was whether Bitcoin is a protocol for small, P2P payments at the expense of node operators or a system for cheaply verifying P2P payments at the expense of expediency and short-term scalability. The resounding answer (although some still disagree) was the latter.The challenge is that these rules cannot be \u201cfound\u201d anywhere. Much like the U.K.\u2019s government, there is no single written constitution. The rules aren\u2019t in the white paper, which is incomplete in many respects. They aren\u2019t exclusively in Satoshi\u2019s writings on the mailing list or the forum\u200a\u2014\u200aand given his departure after two years, Satoshi sought to resign from the position of ultimate arbiter anyway. The system is best described by the original codebase, although that has changed over time. More fundamentally, the core values of Bitcoin are an intersubjective agreement around a few concepts. David Puell makes a credible attempt to capture it here:Source: David\u00a0PuellIn fact, codifying and refining these rules is our challenge. By leaving, Satoshi left that task to us. Consistently define the protocol, give it a soul, and let it grow and adapt while being true to its original essence. This is an ongoing challenge, and we learn more and more about its essence with each passing battle, hostile fork, and attempted corporate takeover.Ultimately, the commitment of the Bitcoin community to these ideals may represent a source of risk. Absolute commitment to the sound monetary policy (the 21 million hard cap) is a core virtue of Bitcoin but limits its design space and ability to pivot if the fee market doesn\u2019t work. But this is the tradeoff Bitcoin has opted for. Other protocols instead sought a more malleable set of core values, relying instead on appointed institutions or well-defined leaders to designate the path forward. The more corporate and top-down these are, the less they rely on a shared identity; in other words, they become empty and soulless. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any substitute for diving in at the deep end and relying on essence rather than top-down decrees.Toward a Bitcoin\u00a0OntologyIn its 10th year, Bitcoin continues to struggle with these metaphysical issues. It suffers from more existential crises than a philosophy undergrad reading Kierkegaard for the first time. And the reason is that Bitcoiners are strongly opposed to a clear hierarchy for decision-making in Bitcoin. The lack of a benevolent dictator or philosopher king for Bitcoin is held as a strength, even if that makes decision-making less efficient.In this context, it is not only difficult to forge consensus on key technical issues but also to organize the expenditure of political capital to actually implement those changes. The dispersion of decision-making power and the lack of a unified developer entity is the \u201cproblem of governance\u201d that Bitcoin is said to suffer from.But, here, the disease is also the cure. Bitcoin\u2019s lack of governance is what makes it interesting. It\u2019s a set of rules for moving money around that is very difficult to influence in any way whatsoever. Other open-source projects have benevolent dictators, but in a high-stakes game where the developers can serve as kingmakers for how resources are allocated in society, it\u2019s wise, in my view, to make interfering with the protocol as difficult as possible. Of course, development occurs, but certain core attributes are walled off and considered largely untouchable.As for the problem of a stable identity, absent a single foundation that maintains the trademark, Bitcoin must make do on its own. In practice, users, exchanges, miners, businesses, and developers engage in an ad hoc, socio-political process of adjudicating between competing visions of Bitcoin.I expect this debate will end with three divergent philosophical stances within the Bitcoin camp, although it has implications more generally:First, you have what I call \u201cessentialists\u201d and \u201cmaterialists.\u201d Essentialists, like myself, believe that the actual code is just a representation of some more fundamental values that the code is trying to express. Essentialists are amenable to rollbacks if something goes wrong in extreme cases because, at that point, the code will have been a poor expression of the form and can be overridden.I expect there will arise a rival camp of materialists who believe the code is supreme and, in fact, represents the actual substance and reality of the system. Materialists are fond of saying things like \u201cBitcoin Core is Bitcoin.\u201d They don\u2019t buy the argument that Bitcoin Core is just an implementation of a more nebulous, uninstantiated specification. They often believe that the creators of Bitcoin Core control Bitcoin more generally.Just as certain Supreme Court justices are strict constructionists and other justices are loose constructionists, it is the same with\u00a0Bitcoin.Leaving materialism aside, essence and essentialists\u200a\u2014\u200ain practice\u200a\u2014\u200acome down to differing interpretations of the written materials that Satoshi left us, the broader cypherpunk canon, and subsequent empirical findings (such as asserting that the SPV scaling model Satoshi described doesn\u2019t work). Just as certain Supreme Court justices are strict constructionists (believing the Constitution must be interpreted as written) and other justices are loose constructionists (believing the Constitution is a living document that we have to interpret in context), it is the same with Bitcoin.So, further stratifying the essentialist camp, let\u2019s call the white paper enthusiasts \u201cintentionalists\u201d and their opponents \u201canti-intentionalists.\u201d Intentionalists tend to think Satoshi\u2019s vision was scaling on the base layer while anti-intentionalists tend to think Satoshi\u2019s precise vision is irrelevant and that what matters more is the system he gave us and its evolution over time. Note that anti-intentionalists are still essentialists. They believe that Bitcoin should be able to adapt while remaining true to its essence but that its exact instantiation doesn\u2019t have to be true to the original specification.Labels can be dangerous, and excessive labeling is usually not very useful. But these three factions\u200a\u2014\u200amaterialists, intentional essentialists, and non-intentional essentialists\u200a\u2014\u200aare what I\u2019ve identified, and I think making the lines clear will help us clarify any debate.The last year has been a period of relative respite in the war over Bitcoin\u2019s soul.

Rising fees caused significant frustration for users trying to transact in smaller amounts of value during late 2017, but they have since fallen off a cliff due to a variety of factors. Lower transaction demand, improved fee estimation algorithms, adoption of segregated witness, and transaction batching have resulted in more efficient use of block space and less contention for this scarce resource.Source: https://oxt.me/chartsSource: https://p2sh.info/dashboard/db/segwit-usage?orgId=1Source: https://oxt.me/chartsIt appears that various entities have used the opportunity of lower fees to consolidate their UTXOs.

Sidechains use pegging mechanisms to cryptographically lock BTC on the main chain and then allow users to unlock a proportional amount of tokens on a sidechain. This allows for experimentation with other features that are unlikely to be added to the Bitcoin protocol. At time of writing the only two production sidechains are RSK and Liquid.Lightning NetworkAt the beginning of 2018, the lightning network was mostly on testnet. The mainnet lightning network began forming (against the recommendations of developers) in late December / early January.Lightning\u2019s capitalization grew slowly for most of the year with a few notable bursts. In July, Andreas Brekken added a quarter million dollars (35 BTC) to the network, which generated a fun news cycle around \u201cone person controlling half of Lightning Network.\u201d Brekken removed his BTC from Lightning not long after, citing that the risk was not worth the reward.In November a new service started adding a ton of nodes and channels to which they assigned the aliases of LNBig.com.

This is also a bit of speculation, but during the FIFA World Cup 2018 there is a fair chance that Bitcoin value will soar to new heights again. However, as is true with speculations, the value of Bitcoin will not rise exclusively due to the World Cup, but in fact, the very idea that Bitcoin has a future will drive its growth.Bitcoin valuation is still below the $8,000 level as of June 07 2018, a steep decrease after reaching a maximum of $17,900 on December 15 of 2017. But the point to note here is that the value is still in the \u2018gain\u2019 zone, and rising again. Here is a chart that portrays the latest weekly changes in the price of Bitcoin:Chart: Bitcoin Value in the week May 31st to June 7th (Coindesk)Since there is no speculation in this chart, it is fairly easy to make an assumption that Bitcoin is gaining momentum gradually. Whether this is due to the World Cup or something else, that is the real question to be answered. However, since there is no other major reason for Bitcoin to grow as most of the other factors are either stable or absent, we can really assume that the World Cup is beneficial for Bitcoin holders.Here\u2019s why.The Real Reason why Bitcoin should Gain Value during the FIFA World Cup 2018The first thing to notice here is that the 2018 FIFA World Cup is being hosted by Russia, a country which has many obstacles in the use of fiat currencies due to the sanctions being implemented by major cash processing US companies, such as VISA and MasterCard. This makes the life of a tourist traveling to Russia difficult, as although Kremlin does not accept it, these companies are the global giants which control 90% of the global money exchanges.Therefore, people who travel to Russia for the 2018 World Cup (or any other reason) would need to resort to alternative payment methods. The best solutions available are converting all their expense funds to Rubles before they reach the country, or, in an attempt to feel secure and less perplexed (which seems to be the popular option), they can try using cryptocurrencies that have a good acceptance in the country for reasons already mentioned above.Now, as you may have already guessed, once more tourists reach Russian territory to attend any World Cup event, they will either switch their funds to digital fiat currencies or to cryptocurrencies (mainly Bitcoin) for safety. As more and more people opt for Bitcoin, its demand will gradually go up\u200a\u2014\u200athe value of any currency, whether Crypto or fiat, goes up when the demand is high following basic principles of economics, and so the value of Bitcoin will rise once the demand for the cryptocurrency goes up in Russia.According to an estimate, around 3.2 billion people (TV viewers included) watched the last World Cup, and while the estimate for total number of tourists is a bit murky, the demand for tickets can be inferred from the fact that 66,000 Iceland fans have requested tickets for the 2018 World Cup\u200a\u2014\u200aalmost 20% of the entire population of Iceland.POINT to NOTEThere will be over 17,000 volunteers, and Germany\u2019s football fans have made the second most ticket requests (around 338,414). According to statistics, one million international fans are expected to visit Russia for the World Cup, and Russia has done away with visas for football fans so long as they have valid ID, according to DW.com.With more than one million tourists arriving in Russia for the 2018 World Cup, there is hardly any doubt that nothing could be better for Bitcoin\u2019s acceptance and value within the next four to five years, at least, than it making its way into the hands of these football fans.Some Important Points to Note Regarding Money Matters in RussiaIt is illegal to pay directly with dollars or euros for general transactions in Russia. Now, since people cannot carry Dollars and Euros, the strongest fiat currencies in the world, they must choose better alternatives to get around in Russia. While the Ruble is a very common option, a lot of international tourists might want to convert their money to Bitcoin instead, since Russia is friendly to Bitcoin.Businesses in Russia are already cashing in on these opportunities. Some renowned hotels in the Russian city of Kaliningrad\u200a\u2014\u200aa host of some games\u200a\u2014\u200aare accepting Bitcoin as payment, while some airlines and travel agents, as well as bars, are accepting the cryptocurrency already. The usage levels are going to spike, as only a few other alternatives remain in the long run till the grand tournament ends (it will begin on the 14th of June and complete a month after that date).The use of Bitcoin as a means of value exchange has been a problem since sending fees for Bitcoin spiked in December. However, in comparison to 400,000 Bitcoin transactions per day in December 2017, there are now once again around 200,000 transactions per day and the fees are back down along with the daily transaction rate. This means people can now exchange their fiat currencies for Bitcoins easily, suggesting that the value of Bitcoin will most probably go up as the 2018 FIFA World Cup unfolds in Russia.About CINDXCINDX is an investment platform that allows individuals to combine several crypto exchange accounts into one trading terminal, and gives them the option to connect to the best managers without having to transfer their funds.

Both camps can pursue their own vision of Bitcoin.You would think that everyone would peacefully go on their merry way...So, Why is Bitcoin Cash Being Constantly Attacked?To be fair, there is strong rhetoric and loud arguments continuing from both sides. However, the nature of the communication from each side is often of a completely different nature.While \u2018attacks\u2019 on Bitcoin Core mostly consist of pointing out key facts and glaring contradictions, the attacks on Bitcoin Cash are mostly dishonest\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes blatantly dishonest and vicious.I\u2019ll give an example to prove my point\u2026Also, it may be helpful to remember that one side engages in heavy handed censorship, while the other allows an open discussion.Electron CashI maintain a Bitcoin Cash wallet called \u201cElectron Cash\u201d, which is quite popular because it doesn\u2019t require you download the entire blockchain.A few days ago, I noticed the ElectronCash.org website was down. Turns out the domain registrar paused it because of an \u201cICANN WhoIs Innaccuracy Complaint\u201d.Yes, I admit I made a mistake by not filling out the WhoIs information correctly. The error was corrected and the site is back.Who would complain to ICANN and why?Here Come the Trolls, Right on\u00a0Cue\u2026When the site went down, I promptly took action, contacting the registrars to resolve the issue while making sure the wallet was available on Github. A discussion about it was started on r/btc.Then, in a goofishly pathetic (and predictable) attempt to discredit Bitcoin Cash, no less than 7 pre-certified Core trolls came out of nowhere to join the discussion, all postulating the risk of losing coins on the Electron Cash wallet.It gets worse:These trolls actually created an entire fake Github repo, tried to claim that it was mine and that it was untrustworthy because it couldn\u2019t be compiled.After I complained to Github about their fake repo, they retaliated and got my (real) repo flagged! It was down over the weekend while Github investigated. Thankfully, both the website and the Github repository are now back online.The whole series of events goes beyond trolling and rhetoric. It was a malicious attack. This is just one example of the lengths they will go to, and the absurdities they will engage in.Why?Because they hate Bitcoin Cash! They find it threatening.Here\u2019s Why They Are Terrified of Bitcoin\u00a0Cash:They are afraid because they know they cannot compete on merit.They must engage in spreading misinformation because they secretly know the truth: People do not WANT a settlement layer controlled by large financial institutions, corporate interests, and government bureaucrats\u2026 and they certainly don\u2019t want high fees and slow confirmations.Transcending these things was the whole POINT of Bitcoin in the first place.The Fear Runs\u00a0DeepI\u2019ll say it again\u2026 they are scared.They are scared because people are finding out that Bitcoin Cash functions the same way as Bitcoin did from 2009\u20132016, and the current version of Bitcoin Core does not.They are scared because the feasibility of huge blocks is being scientifically proven and empirically validated.They are scared because Bitcoin Cash is starting to see everyday use in the real world\u2026 even though it is barely a month old.They are scared because Bitcoin Cash has bright and competent developers that deliver what users want, and who are working on things that are actually useful.They are scared the next wave of decentralized applications will leave Bitcoin behind in favor of other currencies like Bitcoin Cash.They are scared that Point-of-Sale applications are being rapidly developed.They are scared because Bitcoin Cash is the genuine article so they have to resort to desperate attempts to \u201crebrand it\u201d to remove the Bitcoin name.They are scared because Bitcoin Cash has arguably the best cryptocurrency community in the world.They are scared because barely anyone is using their beloved SegWit \u201cscaling solution\u201d.They are scared because their censorship of r/bitcoin is being catalogued.\u2026and they are probably scared for a dozen other reasons.Join the Conversation, Join the CommunityI invite you to find out more about Bitcoin Cash and join the conversation, which is largely taking place on r/btc.We will not censor your opinion (unlike r/bitcoin) if you disagree with us.Heck, we\u2019ll probably end up tipping you in Bitcoin Cash, which is now possible with low fees and cool applications being built.", "responses": "32"}, {"title": "An open letter to the Bitcoin community to change the proof-of-work algorithm", "author_name": "C\u00f8bra", "link": "https://medium.com/@CobraBitcoin/an-open-letter-to-the-bitcoin-community-to-change-the-proof-of-work-algorithm-12a6545c20d0?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 23, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "4.6K", "content": "An open letter to the Bitcoin community to change the proof-of-work algorithmC\u00f8braBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 23, 2018One of the reasons many of you got into Bitcoin was the fact that it was decentralized. But did you know that this is slowly changing? More and more of the network hashrate is starting to become concentrated into the hands of one man and his company. The security of our network essentially depends on them acting honourably, and us being prepared to respond to it. They get more powerful each day.Based on conservative estimates of gross margin of 75 percent and operating margin of 65 percent, Bernstein analysts calculate that Beijing-based Bitmain made $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profits in 2017As long as they control the majority of the hash rate, the only way to keep the network secure is the threat of a hard fork to a new PoW, but this will only work for as long the community is reasonably small and still overwhelmingly shares the same morals for a decentralized Bitcoin.In a decentralized system, we shouldn\u2019t be put into a position where we rely on a centralized point of failure to behave themselves. People talk about \u201cnew entrants\u201d to the mining scene, but it\u2019s almost impossible for anyone to catch up to the total domination of the mining space by BITMAIN. They are light years ahead. That $4 billion dollars of profit will be used to build even better hardware, allowing them to further dominate mining for the foreseeable future and likely buy stakes in their competitors.The hashrate has already been abused to give political support to reckless and dangerous hard fork attempts. They have questionable allegiance to Bitcoin at best, seeming more interested in supporting Bitcoin Cash, undermining the very network that employs them. Even more dangerously, they are based in China, a country with a long track of human rights abuses, censorship, and generally evil behaviour. The miners are in a position where the Chinese government can take over their equipment at any time; something they will no doubt do if Bitcoin grows enough to allow them to use their control of the hashrate to push a Chinese geopolitical agenda.The more Bitcoin grows, the harder it becomes to hard fork. If it\u2019s this bad right now, it could be even worse in a few years time, but by then it will be too late. We don\u2019t want our transactions being decided by the Chinese government. The solution is to adopt a new hybrid PoW system, possibly with a PoS combination, and choosing algorithms that are very easy and simple to build ASICs for. The playing field needs to be even again, and structured in a way where it\u2019s harder for one entity to dominate it.The truth is that PoW provides very little security if it isn\u2019t distributed effectively among multiple independent participants. This is historically why mining pools were very careful to avoid accumulating too much hashrate. But now we have a situation where one man controls the majority of the hashrate, and we are OK with that so long as he behaves himself. Imagine if someone followed you around with a gun pressed against your head, and you were OK with this because \u201che is incentivized to not shoot me because of the threat of jail\u201d, people would call you stupid and crazy, and yet when it comes to Bitcoin, we\u2019re totally fine with thinking along those lines.Economic incentives only work when broadly applied to many participants. If mining was distributed among 100 independent miners, each with 1% hashrate, spread all over the world, you can trust the economic incentives to work as expected. It\u2019s much less likely for something to happen that would take control of 51 of those miners. However, if you have like 3 miners who matter, with 2/3 of them in one country, these incentives break down. Maybe their government takes their equipment, or they\u2019re insane, or they are just evil.This mining problem is the root cause of all of Bitcoin\u2019s problems. It\u2019s the miners that have supported every hostile attempt to take over the network. It\u2019s the miners who block new features for their strange political agenda. It\u2019s the miners who lend support to altcoins that undermine Bitcoin. We need to get rid of them while we still can, they\u2019re no longer a useful part of our community. Hard forks are scary, but let\u2019s not be afraid to at least try to build consensus when we can all see the problem right in front of us.", "responses": "59"}, {"title": "How I turned $26.24 into $1,000+ of\u00a0Bitcoin", "author_name": "Peter Schroeder \ud83d\ude80", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/how-i-turned-26-24-into-1-000-of-bitcoin-c0b44bf2b17d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 7, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "1.97K", "content": "How I turned $26.24 into $1,000+ of\u00a0BitcoinPeter Schroeder \ud83d\ude80BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 7, 2017Without spending a single dime on Bitcoin\u2026 \ud83d\udcb5", "responses": "24"}, {"title": "As A Major Milestone Hits Bitcoin, What Happens\u00a0Now?", "author_name": "Kevin Virgil", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/as-bitcoin-hits-a-major-milestone-what-happens-now-21ddfd4f8b1f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 30, 2018", "readtime": "13 min read", "upvotes": "2.8K", "content": "As A Major Milestone Hits Bitcoin, What Happens\u00a0Now?Kevin VirgilBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 30, 2018Foreword: My intent for this article is to review recent events in the crypto market, starting with two data points that we encountered in the past week, and then reviewing the past year to understand what began and ended 2017\u2019s parabolic bull run. We\u2019ll then look at what happened to the last wave of crypto speculators, and who\u200a\u2014\u200aif anyone\u200a\u2014\u200awill replace them. Lastly, and most importantly, we\u2019ll seek to understand what will need to happen before they enter.========================================Two events came to our attention this past week\u200a\u2014\u200aone that we judge to be very good/bullish, and one that is most assuredly not.Let\u2019s get the bad news out of the way first.First, the Bad NewsBarring an unexpected and unlikely move, this week is going to mark an occasion that has only two precedents over the past six years, and has not happened since November 2015.Unfortunately, you\u2019re going to have to keep the champagne locked up in the cellar for now as this will be an event we would all just as soon forget. Why? Assuming that its price remains in the current range, then on November 1st 2018, for the first time in three years, Bitcoin\u2019s 12-month trailing return will move from positive into negative territory. A Halloween horror show, indeed.Source: Coinbase Market\u00a0DataI\u2019ll follow that up with this little gem of a table. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better way to illustrate the wild ride that has been crypto for the past five years, than this:As you can see, anyone who bought their first Bitcoin in January 2013 had a very merry Christmas that year. Conversely, those who entered the market in January 2014 ended the year with a big lump of coal (or a lump of something else entirely) in their stockings.You may ask, why am I bringing this up? It\u2019s not because I enjoy dwelling on the negatives. After all, my parents always encouraged me to seek out the positives in any setbacks or disappointments. Maybe that\u2019s because I was raised in the upper Midwest, where the weather is consistently terrible.Nonetheless, the fact remains that we arrived at this milestone amidst a remarkably stagnant period. I didn\u2019t start actively trading crypto because I expected it to be boring. Quite the contrary. After all, one of my favorite crypto quotes comes from Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMex, who recently argued that \u201cfor crypto, a decline in volume and volatility is deadlier than white wine and painkillers\u201d. Yet, as the charts below demonstrate, here we are.In fact, Bitcoin\u2019s annualized volatility is now below or on par with that of many of the largest US tech stocks, including Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX).Source: Kosmos Research, Coinbase, NASDAQNot surprisingly, this has coincided with:(1) Bitcoin trading in an ever-narrower range over recent months. In fact, when I last checked the price an hour ago, the 24-hour change was precisely 0.0%. We try not to stare at the ticker all day, but that was a first for me.(2) Exchange-traded volumes are falling off a cliff. To take BTC as but one example, see below a table showing the lowest 10 daily volumes of 2018:Yes, you are reading the table correctly: four of the ten slowest days year-to-date occurred last week and nine of the ten came this month. To put this in perspective, over US$ 11 billion traded on January 1 of this year.Great\u200a\u2014\u200aso the market is stuck in an almighty rut. How does that help us as investors?Hold that thought for a moment. First, let me tell you about a conversation that we had last week that brightened our mood considerably.Now, The Good NewsAmidst all the crypto doom and gloom (but definitely no boom, sorry Marc Faber) my partner recently caught up with one of his friends, a macro hedge fund manager based in London. The crypto market loves to obsess over when that \u201cinstitutional wall of money\u201d is going to arrive. Well, this guy is an integral part of that wall. So we\u2019re always interested in hearing his thoughts on crypto, to the extent that he has any.After all, like most macro fund managers he doesn\u2019t have much time for an asset class where the capitalization isn\u2019t measured in trillions of dollars. As recently as the fall of 2017 he had admitted to knowing \u2018next to nothing\u2019 about crypto, and lacked the bandwidth or incentives to spend time learning more.But this time the conversation went differently. He told us that he has begun reading up on the space and had questions. And if he is working his way up the learning curve, we strongly suspect that he is not alone. Our friend is not the type to waste time or energy on a topic unless he has identified a compelling opportunity. To us, more than anything we have read on Crypto Twitter, this was a bullish market signal.Most importantly, we found it interesting that this conversation took place just as Bitcoin\u2019s one-year trailing return was about to descend into negative territory.However it\u2019s important to consider these two data points\u200a\u2014\u200aone good, the other not so much\u200a\u2014\u200ain the context of what has transpired in the past year. Let\u2019s briefly recap what happened to the crypto market in 2017, and why.Past Is (Not) PrologueLike most greed-driven bubbles, Bitcoin\u2019s historic 2017 move started slowly. BTC traded at less than $1,000 on January 1st, and was worth only a few dollars more at the end of March.But something happened in the second quarter\u200a\u2014\u200aby the end of June BTC\u2019s value had increased by over 250%. Three months later, it had doubled in value again. And December, of course, is when the frenzy went into full swing. Prices doubled in less than three weeks, and nearly touched $20,000 before finally collapsing.Now, some might argue that initial coin offerings (ICOs) are what sparked the market frenzy. To an extent, we agree with this position. After all, the ICO mania is what initially shone the spotlight on crypto and forced the mainstream investing public to take notice.Looking more closely though, we would argue that a more consequential trend emerged in the second half of 2017. Rumors of\u200a\u2014\u200aand seeming steps toward\u200a\u2014\u200ainstitutional market entry were what ultimately drove Bitcoin into its parabolic end-game.An Annotated (Recent) History of BitcoinSource: Coinbase/CoinigySimultaneously, announcements of Bitcoin futures contracts, paired with headlines regarding Wall Street interest and breathless predictions of imminent change, conspired to fuel a self-fulfilling narrative of ever-higher asset prices.CNBC, December 2017.\u00a0Boo-yah!The hysteria peaked on December 18th, 2017. Bitcoin had just hit an all-time high of $19,783 on Coinbase the day before.Two weeks earlier the Chicago futures exchanges, CME and CBOE, had announced launch dates for their Bitcoin futures contracts. Predictably, the cryptoasset market went ballistic as new entrants flooded in ahead of the \u2018wall of institutional capital\u2019 that was widely rumored to be imminent and was going to propel Bitcoin to new heights. The price of Bitcoin doubled in the first two weeks of that month.CBOE futures debuted on December 10th and traded 19% higher on their first day. Trading was halted twice due to exchange \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 rules. The market continued to buy, waiting with bated breath for the CME launch a week later.The CME contract opened to much fanfare, and then\u2026traded 2% lower. It was the embodiment of failed expectations.And this was only the beginning of the pain. The institutional money never arrived in earnest and did not drive this bubble.In short, 2017 was almost exclusively a retail-driven train, and the late-arriving punters got crushed in the derailment. The institutional capital has not yet joined the party.Where Is The Proverbial \u2018Wall of Money\u2019?Go to any crypto meetup or convention today and the same question will be asked. It will be repeated like a mantra\u200a\u2014\u200ain the panels, during the keynote, and in the furtive conversations backstage:\u201cWhen are the institutions coming in???\u201dWe\u2019re like teenagers waiting by the phone, staring at it like Luke Skywalker stared at that X-Wing Fighter on Dagobah\u2026just willing it to ring. Come on, Blackrock, show us some love!There are an abundance of different but credible theories to explain what might push Bitcoin below the well-defended price floor of 5,800 that has been maintained since late June. On the other hand, the smart people we talk to in the space as well as the \u201ccrypto media\u201d are fairly unanimous in their view that the next bull run will be driven by widespread institutional adoption\u200a\u2014\u200athe \u201cwall of money\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athat in most permutations of this vision arrives on the back of a long-awaited Bitcoin ETF. While we love being contrarians, on this point we wholeheartedly concur.For your average long-term retail HODLer, the initial reaction to this question is likely an eye-roll. Why? For a concrete example, take a guess at the dates when these headlines were published.The first article, from the Financial Times, was written on 12 August 2018. The WSJ story was published a little over a year ago.You see, we\u2019ve been here before and we\u2019re still waiting for the institutions to arrive.We all know what the reaction was to the Journal article\u200a\u2014\u200asee chart above. And how did the market respond to the more recent FT piece?Source: Coinbase/CoinigyIronically, the conviction that institutional capital is the rocket fuel needed to ignite another crypto moonshot is, if anything, stronger now than last year. So why did the possibility of institutional entry drive such mania in 2017, and why has it failed to move the needle this year?Really it all comes back to the specific inquiry we received from our friendly British hedge fund mogul: \u201cwho is buying Bitcoin here and now?\u201dThe Importance of Market PsychologySome of the smartest people I have ever met are working day and night to develop effective valuation approaches for cryptoassets. This is a monumental task, since crypto is unlike any other asset in human history. Market capitalization (sorry, CoinMarketCap) is generally useless. Certain equations that we learned in Economics 101, such as MV=PQ, are better but also have their limitations.So crypto doesn\u2019t yet have a universally accepted valuation metric. But we do have quite a few proxies. One of them is the measurement of how many active users are in a blockchain\u2019s ecosystem at a given point in time. We refer to this as Daily Active Addresses (DAAs), which records the number of Bitcoin (or other token) wallets that engaged in transactions on a given day. DAAs are easy to track on the Bitcoin blockchain.Source: Coinmetrics.ioTake a hard look at this chart. Let it sink in.The number of active wallets is\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally\u200a\u2014\u200ahalf of what it was just ten months ago.Now, if you\u2019re reading this in late October 2018, you have most likely been in the crypto market for awhile. You probably enjoyed some\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe even all\u200a\u2014\u200aof the 2017 bull run and you\u2019re still sitting on top of significant gains, even after this year\u2019s drawdown. You\u2019re in this for the long haul.But now, imagine you\u2019re one of those poor souls who decided to join the Great Crypto Buying Frenzy of December 2017\u200a\u2014\u200aright at the top of that chart. Maybe you were smart and just invested a small percentage of your net worth. Or maybe you weren\u2019t so smart, and you mortgaged your house to go \u2018all-in\u2019.If you decided to #HODL, like all of those other amateurs on Twitter, you\u2019re staring at an unrealized loss of 61%. What do you suppose your feelings toward crypto are by now? Are you buying more? Averaging down your cost basis?Most likely not. You\u2019re probably cursing the friend who told you to open a Coinbase account, and wondering how you will ever make that money back. And you\u2019re definitely telling anyone who will listen to your rants that they should stay away, too.While we acknowledge this is an imperfect measure, let\u2019s assume that each of those new December 2017 DAAs equates to one late entrant. If so, then over 600,000 people were burned in the latest crypto crash, and have left the market with their portfolio in a smoking ruin.For an asset class with a market cap below $250 billion, that is a LOT of people. And it\u2019s going to take a lot of good news to bring them back\u200a\u2014\u200aif ever. If anything, we believe this wallet count understates end users as many on-exchange transactions get netted before they are ever recorded on-blockchain.The damage was compounded by the fact that these people could have served as crypto ambassadors to the next tier of risk takers. That misery is now being further exacerbated in real time because, starting this week, people who bought 12 months ago\u200a\u2014\u200aeven before the last parabolic push higher\u200a\u2014\u200aare now underwater too.In many ways this is an age-old story: an asset collapsed, people lost money and therefore are more cautious this time around. However the scale of the carnage, given the proportion of investors who have been burned, is nearly unprecedented.\u201cWho is buying Bitcoin here?\u201d we were asked. The answer was immediate and obvious: No one.The marginal retail buyer\u200a\u2014\u200athe people who were trying to front-run \u201cbig institutional money\u201d in Q4 2017\u200a\u2014\u200ado not exist. So who does that leave?The Wall of Money\u2026 yet againAre you as tired of this metaphor as we are yet?We\u2019re not talking about Chicago high-frequency traders here, or \u2018Mrs Watanabe\u2019 in Japan. This refers to the real allocators. Pension funds. Sovereign wealth funds. Endowments. Powerhouses with asset pools that run to twelve digits, or more.These organizations are managed by inherently risk-averse people who know that investing into new and untested markets implies significant career risk. Portfolio managers rarely get fired for buying German Bunds or T-bills. Any fund managers who went long crypto in December 2017 are probably dusting off their CVs now.With no retail investors and no genuine prospect of them returning again before a big-time upside breakout that reinvigorates the FOMO on which crypto has historically thrived, it is these institutions who will have to carry the water to get things started.There is no crystal ball on my desk, and I won\u2019t pretend to know when this will happen. The timing of this evolution depends on a host of factors that are both endogenous and exogenous to the crypto market. However, we do feel confident in saying that no other spark exists for the next crypto bull run.Are we there yet?Two conditions must be met before that spark can be lit:(1) Institutions must have the ability to participate in the crypto markets(2) Institutions must have the desire to participate in the crypto marketsHere\u2019s the irony: in 2017, the desire was certainly there. Having worked on Wall Street, I can confirm that bankers and traders were watching this market intensely, and in many cases they personally participated. But they had no ability to participate professionally because the key building blocks\u200a\u2014\u200aqualified custodians, trusted trading counterparties, and (in some cases) leverage\u200a\u2014\u200awere simply not there. (Remember, career risk is one of the most powerful forces in nature.)And now, less than a year later, the conditions have been reversed. Over the past ten months the crypto community has improved its infrastructure by leaps and bounds. From actual, live people answering customer queries (thanks, Coinbase! and what\u2019s taking you so long, Binance?!?) to fully licensed custody solutions, this market is evolving more rapidly than ever.And yet, even though institutions now have the ability to enter\u200a\u2014\u200adesire has left the building as volatility, volumes and returns have all evaporated.It\u2019s a sad day when Apple stock carries more vol than\u00a0crypto\u2026So where does that leave us?We\u2019ve already established that the retail investor will not rescue the crypto market from its current plateau, and that institutional capital will eventually provide that needed boost. However, something needs to get them off the sidelines and into this asset class.And while it\u2019s safe to say that a Bitcoin ETF certainly can help to increase market adoption, we don\u2019t believe this is the deus ex machina that the crypto market really wants\u200a\u2014\u200aor needs.According to the World Bank, institutional investors in developed economies currently manage over $100 trillion of assets. Think about what just fifty basis points of that capital would do to the crypto market.That capital won\u2019t be allocated overnight\u200a\u2014\u200aeach institution needs to arrive at its own decision to do so. And in order to allocate, an institution must believe that cryptoassets have finally arrived as an asset class that is worthy of investment.But other things are happening out there, far beyond the reach of crypto exchanges. Dark clouds are forming over equity and fixed income markets, for the first time since Satoshi\u2019s white paper was released to the world.What happens if Wall Street loses its appetite for equities or corporate debt? Where does that capital go?In the right circumstances, could Bitcoin even be considered a safe haven?I think it\u2019s very possible, and in our next article we\u2019ll take a close look at how that just might happen.========================================I work at Kosmos Capital Management, which actively trades the emergent class of digital assets.

So much so, that I couldn\u2019t find any recent tutorials on GPU mining for bitcoin.I took it as an opportunity to create one myself.Here\u2019s how:Note: folks have it correct. Bitcoin mining on the cloud without an ASIC miner does not yield any profit. Still, it\u2019s a fun experiment.Step One: Get cloud\u00a0hosting.a) Sign up for AWS.First things, first: sign up for a free account at Amazon Web Services. AWS offers virtual machines, storage, and a host of other services\u200a\u2014\u200ain some cases, for free during your initial 12-month trial.Warning: Account verification can take up to 24 hours.b) Navigate to the services console.Once your in, navigate to the home page and select EC2.This brings you to the EC2 dashboard:The dashboard gives you access to anything and everything you\u2019d ever need concerning launching and maintaining your VM. Including security. Let\u2019s deal with that next.Step Two: Create security settings.a) Setup a security group.On the left-side menu, at the bottom, under the submenu \u201cNetwork & Security,\u201d select security groups, then click on the bright blue \u201cCreate Security\u201d group button in the top nav.A modal will pop up.Give the group a name and a description, and keep the VPC to the default setting. Below that, you\u2019ll see a tabbed panel asking you to create some access rules for the group. Don\u2019t worry about that. We\u2019ll keep with the default settings here, too. We\u2019re mostly concerned with Inbound Rules, so select the Inbound Tab and click Add Rule.We\u2019ll be creating three in total:For the SSH Rule, you\u2019ll want to select \u201cMy IP\u201d under source, and the input area will populate your device\u2019s IP address for you. Then click create.b) Create a key pair.Now, under the same \u201cNetwork & Security\u201d submenu,you\u2019ll want to click on \u201cKey Pairs\u201d and then click on the blue \u201cCreate Key Pair\u201d located in the top nav of that page.Once you hit create, you should see the\u00a0.pem file in your downloads.The contents of this file enable you to connect with the remote instance you\u2019ll be launching in the next step. Put this file somewhere safe, and where you can remember, as you\u2019ll need it every time you attempt to reconnect with your server.Step Three: Get an Ubuntu server up and\u00a0running.So before we get started, here\u2019s the thing. Accelerated computing power, even in the cloud, isn\u2019t cheap.In effect, EC2 instances work like leased VMs with passthrough capabilities to stellar graphics cards. You can use Azure or Google Cloud Computing, but to be honest, if you\u2019re a MAC user most familiar with Linux and looking for lower hourly rates, AWS seems to be the best option.Can\u2019t I just use Virtualbox and run a server for free?The answer: it depends on your hardware and whether you know how to passthrough your hardware\u2019s GPUs to a Virtualbox VM. That can take some time, still considered to be very experimental, and most commercial devices (like my Macbook) don\u2019t have GPUs capable of hashing at a fast rate.AWS takes care of virtualizing the hardware for you.But again, yes, EC2 instances of the g2, g3, and p2 flavor can run you a pretty penny. We\u2019ve also been forewarned that we\u2019ll be competing with massive bitcoin mining farms that use ASIC miners that blow GPU mining out of the water.So, this is more of an experiment than anything else. Nevertheless, let\u2019s do this.Luckily, AWS allows you to bid on instances with several GPUs at below market pricesa) Start a Spot Request for an EC2 instance.Navigate to Spot Requests in the side menu, and click the \u201cRequest Spot Instances\u201d button in the top nav.b) Choose an AMI.Next, search for an Amazon Machine Image (AMI )\u2014 basically a template for your server that comes pre-set with certain software installations and configurations\u200a\u2014\u200athat gives you the latest version of Ubuntu (16.04 aka Xerial).I already have some saved:You can find the one I\u2019m using for this tutorial by clicking Search for AMI, selecting \u201cCommunity AMIs\u201d from the dropdown\u00a0, and inputing \u201cami-cd0f5cbx\u201d into the search bar.c) Choose an instance type.The instance types that offer NVDIA cards belong to the g2, g3, p2 family. I\u2019ve played around with all three families, and while all do fairly well with mining scrypt coins, p2 by far offers the most punch.Unfortunately, it\u2019s also the most expensive of the three. Hourly bidding prices fluctuate between $1.4\u2013$1.7, depending on the time of day. I\u2019ve been keeping track of optimum pricing, and as a rule of thumb, you can find lower prices for g2 instances after midnight, and lower prices for p2 before noon.AWS also offers pricing history you can refer to:I\u2019m gonna go with the mid-sized p2 instance (p2.8xlarge). This will give you 8 GPUs to work with.Other specs for this instance:8 NVIDIA K80 cards32 virtual CPUs488 GiB of RamPeer-to-peer communication between GPUsBam.These instances do well with deep learning and gaming, for example.d) Choose your allocation and pricing strategy.It\u2019s best to stick with the details. If you\u2019ve got the heart, you can opt-in to setting a max price. Beware, your instance can terminate if bid prices go beyond your max price.In saying that, AWS won\u2019t charge for the interrupted hour. Tread lightly.e) Configure your storage settingsWe won\u2019t be downloading any blockchains, so we don\u2019t need too much storage. 20GiB+ root storage should do the trick for what we\u2019re trying to achieve.f) Configure security settings.Now choose the key pair and security group you created in the previous step and click next.g) Review your request.Make sure everything\u2019s the way you want it, and click launchA modal will pop up to let you know you\u2019re request has gone through.h) Wait for your request to be fulfilled.Now this part, can yield errors\u200a\u2014\u200amost likely, because of spot limitations for free-tier users. If you run into this type of error, you can contact AWS support and start a increase limit request.Tip: when you file the support ticket, ask to be contacted by phone. It speeds up the service time quite a bit.Eventually, your request should be fulfilled.Step Four: Connect to Your Ubuntu\u00a0Servera) Check your instance state.In the left menu, select EC2 Dashboard again, and click on Running Instances.b) Get the public DNS for your instance.In the top menu, click the Actions button, then choose connect. This should bring up instructions for how to SSH into your new server.Don\u2019t be confused by the inconsistency. By right, based on previous steps, the\u00a0.pem file should be tutorial-keys.pem.c) Protect your\u00a0.pem file from accidental overwriting.Remember that\u00a0.pem file (your key pair) you downloaded earlier? Open up a terminal and enter the command:chmod 400 \"/path/to/your/file.pem\"So for example, I put this\u00a0.pem file I\u2019m using in my Utilities folder, located in my Applications directory:d) SSH into your instance.ssh -i \"/path/to/your/file.pem\" ubuntu@your-public-DNS.compute-1.amazonaws.comIt should look something like this:e) Type \u201cyes\u201d + enter to continue connecting.f) And you\u2019re in.Step Five: Install Project Dependenciesa) Check for Ubuntu 16.04 software updates.sudo apt-get updateXenial has a few updates\u2026b) Install the necessary dependencies to run a miner.Now, I\u2019ll admit, this might be a bit overkill. Some of these dependencies are only optional. However, if you\u2019d like to experiment with different miners and potentially other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin, this list should cover it:sudo apt-get install -y freeglut3-dev libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev gcc make libcurl4-openssl-dev autoconf git screen libncurses5-dev opencl-headers build-essential protobuf-compiler libprotoc-dev libboost-all-dev libleveldb-dev hdf5-tools libhdf5-serial-dev libopencv-core-dev libopencv-highgui-dev libsnappy-dev libsnappy1v5 libatlas-base-dev cmake libstdc++6-4.9-dbg libgoogle-glog0v5 libgoogle-glog-dev libgflags-dev liblmdb-dev python-pip gfortran libjansson-dev uthash-dev autogen libtool pkg-configStep Six: Download + Install NVIDIA/NVIDIA Driversa) Download NVDIA from the webwget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/375.20/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.20.runYou should get a 200 OK HTTP response.b) Make the NVIDIA installer file executable\u2026chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.20.runc) Run the installer.You can tell it\u2019s working by the loader\u2026d) Accept the NVIDIA license agreement terms.After the kernel modules build\u2026Just hit enter to OK to push through the warningsInstalled.e) Install Ubuntu Drivers Common Package.This enables us to list GPU devices working on our server.sudo apt install ubuntu-drivers-commonand choose y + enter to finish the installation.f) Auto-install latest NVIDIA Driver.sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstallDone with setting up NVIDIA. Next, install CUDA 8.Step Seven: Install CUDA\u00a08.0What is CUDA? Simply put, CUDA enables parallel processing on our machine and gives our GPUs a dramatic performance boost.a) Download CUDA 8.0 for Ubuntu 16.04wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_8.0.44-1_amd64.deb You should receive a 200 OK HTTP Response.b) Unpack the CUDA 8.0 download.c) Check for updates.sudo apt-get updated) Install CUDA.sudo apt-get install cudaand type y and enter to complete.CUDA 8.0 installed!Update: Alfonso, in the comments section, kindly provided the commands to install CUDA 9.1. For a more recent version of CUDA, use the following:wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_9.1.85-1_amd64.debsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_9.1.85\u20131_amd64.debsudo apt-key adv \u2014 fetch-keys http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install cudae) Check out the GPUs!nvidia-smiDope.Now, you\u2019ll want to reboot your instance.You can do this one of two ways:sudo rebootorGo back to your instance in AWS, select Actions > Instance State > Reboot.Step Eight: Download\u00a0BFGMinerNote: I tinkered with other miners that utilized the stratum proxy, but said repositories make still use HTTP protocol (rather than HTTPS). As of October 2017, that makes using a stratum proxy much more difficult. The file setup.py file used for out-of-the-box implementations still makes HTTP requests and produces an error. No bueno.a) SSH back into your instance.You might have to give it a minute or two before you can connect again.b) Switch to the root user.sudo suNow we don\u2019t need to prefix our commands with keyword \u2018sudo\u2019 anymore.c) update and upgrade everything.apt-get update && time apt-get dist-upgradeand type y and enter to finish upgrading packages.Some special configuring might be requested of you. Just \u2018OK\u2019 the default options.d) install bfgminer for mining bitcoins.apt-get install bfgminerAnd we have our setup!Step Nine: Create a bitcoin\u00a0walletNow, in order to receive any sort of reward or payout for our mining, we\u2019ll need an address to send our coins to.By far, Coinbase has the most popular wallet/US exchange right now. As an Ethereum enthusiast and developer, I\u2019m most familiar with Coinbase.a) Signup for Coinbase.However, Coinbase doesn\u2019t allow you to mine directly to their wallets\u2019 addresses (most likely, because every once in a while the addresses change).I still think it\u2019s a good idea to keep Coinbase as your primary wallet, but the verification process can be a bit lengthy. Since we\u2019ll still need a secondary address to link to our miner, I recommend using JAXX. (Feel free to use whichever wallet you\u2019d like, though!)b) Sign up for JAXX.You can download the JAXX app for any device and create a wallet in minutes. From there, you\u2019ll have a public bitcoin address you can mine to.Step Ten: Join a mining\u00a0poolIn the past few weeks, I\u2019ve come across tons of great mining pools\u200a\u2014\u200aDwarfpool and Minergate, for example. However, I think for GPU mining bitcoin, Slush Pool has a great interface, great service and useful dashboard to understand what\u2019s going on.a) Join Slush Pool.b) Navigate to my account.c) Create a new worker.Choose Workers from the top nav and name a new worker something cool, using the permitted character types.Click Create.Now navigate to Settings and add your wallet address for payouts.Step Eleven: Start\u00a0Mining!a) Start up bfgminer.Now that we have a pool username and a worker, we can start the bfgminer.To run the miner, type:bfgminer -o stratum.bitcoin.cz:3333 -O your_username.your_worker_name:x -S opencl:autoAnd it\u2019s going.Don\u2019t mind the error we get. After a few minutes, you\u2019ll notice that your getting some shares!The Hashing Speed isn\u2019t out of this world, but better than I expected (quite honestly).And grabbed a few block shares with fairly high difficulties! Highest accepted share difficulty: 12.2k!After giving it some warm up time, my slush pool clocked me in at a peak speed of about 4.121 Gh/s!Not bad! Minuscule in comparison to an ASIC miner, but moving. Some hours of mining only yielded about\u00a0.00000007 BTC. (Not profitable.)Welp. I might just have to stick with ethminer or minerd until I can get more GPUs.Some Closing Thoughts\u2026In my downtime, I\u2019m going to play around with the hashing algorithm to see if I can\u2019t get more speed. I\u2019ve just joined a deep learning specialization on Coursera, so this served as some good practice for me. I\u2019ll keep you posted on any progress with BTC GPU mining.If you appreciated this post, feel free to send me a tip in ether or bitcoin!bitcoin address: 1ARn8yHJmeo8WvAebUJVuz2pfn7jfg6BLgeth address: 0xcf8ee917fb71feddf9478d2c8a6ee22c51f8611d", "responses": "28"}, {"title": "Bitcoin Investment Theses (Part\u00a01)", "author_name": "Pierre Rochard", "link": "https://medium.com/@pierre_rochard/bitcoin-investment-theses-part-1-e97670b5389b?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 9, 2018", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "3.4K", "content": "Bitcoin Investment Theses (Part\u00a01)Pierre RochardBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 9, 2018We can classify the investment theses for (and against) investing in Bitcoin into categories. This helps clarify how much of an impact a given narrative could have to Bitcoin\u2019s valuation. Investment theses that have a short holding period are less meaningful for investors than ones with a long holding period. Likewise, theses with a large number of potential adopters are more meaningful for investors than ones with a small number of potential adopters. This is an imperfect heuristic that should be debated and refined.Investment theses with a short holding period are focused on using bitcoins as a method of payment. Some of these theses would find ubiquitous usage while others are niche verticals. If you disagree with anything written here, feel free to contact me on Twitter or on GitHub.A. Short holding period, wide\u00a0adoption1. Retail\u00a0paymentsThesis: Bitcoin, whether it\u2019s on-chain, off-chain, or Lightning, will supplant current retail payment methods including cash, checks, and credit cards. Bitcoin\u2019s advantage over cash and checks is that it is digital, the consumer only needs a smartphone and the retailer does not have to worry about handling cash or depositing checks. Bitcoin\u2019s advantage over credit cards is lower transaction fees, irreversibility which protects the merchant, and a \u201cpush\u201d system with no credit card numbers\u200a\u2014\u200awhich protects the consumer. Fast settlement means that merchants require less in working capital.Anti-thesis: Reversibility increases consumer confidence. A \u201cpull\u201d system enables subscriptions which are an important business model. On-chain transactions can not scale without centralizing the Bitcoin network. Off-chain and layer 2 transactions have an up-hill battle against entrenched debit and credit card payment systems. Credit cards give consumers flexibility in financing their purchases. Many countries have already deployed payment systems that are instant with low to zero fees. Consumers who acquire bitcoins with the intent of making retail payments end up just holding the bitcoins for price appreciation instead.2. MicropaymentsThesis: Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning network enables instant, high-volume micropayments. Micropayments will be leveraged by online games, content publishers, and social media tipping services to monetize interactions and consumption.Anti-thesis: Subscriptions provide a better revenue model for content publishers and social media tipping ignores why people actually engage with each other. Game creators and players currently have no serious issues with in-game purchases. If there are any complaints, it\u2019s from players who feel nickel-and-dimed, which would only be worse with micropayments.3. Machine-to-machine paymentsThesis: The Internet of Things (IoT) means your refrigerator could communicate with several grocery business APIs to negotiate for the best value replenishment. Soon the grocery business itself will automatically be negotiating with self-driving cars providing delivery services. This network of machine-to-machine payments will all be with Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network.Anti-thesis: It\u2019s unclear why the businesses, which own the machines, would not invoice each other on a monthly basis, instead of continuously streaming payments. Companies will continue to keep track of their payables and receivables, and netting them out for payment, in which case Bitcoin is not a necessity. Today Amazon Web Services charges by the second and can be controlled by an API, but payments are made monthly with fiat-denominated credit cards, wire transfers, or ACH.4. International remittancesThesis: Money transfers between countries are expensive and slow; Bitcoin can make them fast and cheap. Anyone, anywhere in the world who has an internet connection can receive bitcoins.Anti-thesis: Senders want to send their local fiat currency and recipients want to receive their local fiat currency. Neither side has bitcoins. Using Bitcoin means adding an FX conversion on the sender\u2019s side and on the recipient\u2019s side. This inherently increases cost. The cost of sending $200 anywhere in the world has declined from 10% in 2008 to 7% in 2017. Money transfers are expensive due to physical locations, marketing, licensing, and compliance. Bitcoin on its own does not solve any of those issues. The slow fiat payment rails are being improved by fintech startups using fiat banks and SQL databases.B. Short holding period, narrow\u00a0adoption1. Tax\u00a0evasionThesis: Just as restaurant waiters can under-report their cash tips, a person or business receiving bitcoin revenues could under-report them. There is no financial institution which the IRS can subpoena for records. If the tax evader is careful about how they use Bitcoin\u2019s public blockchain ledger then they can also avoid being caught with data analysis.Anti-thesis: Tax auditors have experts in computer forensics and there\u2019s always a paper trail for the creation and sale of a good or service. It would be risky and time consuming to convert the proceeds into fiat. Tax evasion does not scale due to whistle-blowers, reporting by third parties (1099\u2019s in the US), and the lifestyle/income mismatch.2. Black\u00a0marketsThesis: Before it was shutdown in 2013, the Silk Road was a marketplace for illegal drugs. It had tens of thousands of users and $22 million in annual sales. In 2017, a successor of the Silk Road called AlphaBay was also shut down. It was ten times the size of the Silk Road with hundreds of thousands of users. Bitcoin enables the sales of illegal goods and services because it is a permissionless, censorship-resistant payments network.Anti-thesis: Ultimately most goods and services have to be delivered in the real world, so even if the payment is pseudonymous the delivery can reveal the identities of buyers and sellers. Additionally, even if the bitcoins are bought and sold in person for fiat cash, there is a risk that the bitcoin broker is an informant or government agent. Buying and selling bitcoins on an online exchange with KYC/AML is even riskier. This problem is compounded by the visibility of on-chain Bitcoin transactions.3. RansomwareThesis: Ransomware is when malicious software encrypts a user\u2019s data, locking them out of personal or business information. The virus demands payment in bitcoins to decrypt the data.Anti-thesis: Increasing awareness of the problem is leading to effective mitigation strategies, whether with anti-virus software or offline data backups.4. Online\u00a0gamblingThesis: While online poker is legal in the United States, in practice the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 made it illegal for financial institutions to service online poker platforms and players. This eventually led to the wide usage of Bitcoin for funding online poker games. The phenomenon has expanded beyond poker. There are Bitcoin-funded sites for sports betting, blackjack, dice, and slots.Anti-thesis: If US legislation changes to be more favorable towards online gambling then this niche for Bitcoin could disappear.5. Unbanked businessesThesis: Payment processors and banks are facing pressure to not service businesses for political reasons. These businesses include gun stores, marijuana dispensaries, and sex workers. Other businesses and individuals do not have access to banking services due to redlining or credit history. A Bitcoin wallet enables these demographics to \u201cbe their own bank\u201d with a checking account and the ability to send and receive payments.Anti-thesis: As long as the rest of the economy is using fiat currencies, the unbanked still need a way to exchange their bitcoins for fiat. They can use in-person cash exchange services, though there are cases of people being robbed and it is not a scalable solution for anything but the smallest business.6. Speculative tradingThesis: Bitcoin exchanges are open for trading 24/7. On top of Bitcoin\u2019s volatility, they also offer up to 100x leverage. Tech-savvy traders are building bots that use the exchanges\u2019 public APIs to execute their strategies. The matching engines of exchanges are moving from AWS to dedicated hosting, in the same facilities where US equities trade. Exchanges are the most profitable businesses in the Bitcoin ecosystem, offering both spot and futures products. Speculators can now profit by going long or going short. The limited supply of bitcoins has led to repeated speculative frenzies, where fortunes have been made and lost.Anti-thesis: Speculation is zero-sum, eventually bad traders will run out of capital and good traders will see diminishing profits and move to greener pastures. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility has been decreasing as its liquidity increases. The markets are manipulated to favor whales and they will be shutdown or become boring when government regulators intervene to stop manipulation. The speculative frenzies are faked by wash-trading volume and fractional reserve exchanges.7. Ponzi\u00a0schemeThesis: While Bitcoin may not fit the definition of an actual Ponzi scheme, it has a lot of similarities. Preston Byrne popularized the concept of a Nakamoto Scheme. Early buyers of bitcoins recruit and sell to later buyers, at ever higher prices. The cries to \u201cHODL\u201d are there to prop up the price and keep the scheme from falling apart. \u201cTulips\u201d and \u201cgreater fool theory\u201d are used as shorthand for this thesis. Once the number of gullible buyers runs out, the price will crash as everyone tries to get out at the same time, much like a bank run.Anti-thesis: Every money has no intrinsic value. They are bubbles, shared illusions, inter-subjective Schelling points. A money is an unproductive asset which is best suited to be society\u2019s medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account. Bitcoin is bootstrapping to potentially fill that role from a value of zero. This has led to an astounding run-up in its fiat price. What goes unexplained in the Ponzi scheme thesis is why severe drawdowns (most recently a 91% peak to trough drawdown in 2014) are not a deathblow. So far, the value of Bitcoin has recovered and ultimately has increased beyond the previous all time high.8. Money launderingThesis: Corrupt politicians who were bribed with bitcoins want to convert them into legitimate assets without raising suspicions. The money launderer can take advantage of Bitcoin\u2019s fragmented market by sending small amounts to many different exchanges to sell for fiat, a form of structuring. A money launderer can also mix the illegal Bitcoin revenues with legal Bitcoin revenues, for example from an online poker business they control or partner with. A growing strategy is purchasing property with bitcoins, and then selling the property for fiat.Anti-thesis: Any involvement of Bitcoin raises suspicion, so laundering bitcoins is ultimately harder than laundering fiat.Data indicates that Bitcoin money laundering has been an increasingly marginal activity. Bitcoin faces stiff competition from large international banks, which continue to be the go-to providers of money laundering services.9. Routing around capital\u00a0controlsThesis: Countries which have a currency peg, like China, have to rely on capital controls to prevent their currency\u2019s exchange rate from appreciating or depreciating in an unexpected manner. For example, Chinese citizens can only purchase up to $50,000 of foreign currency per year. Chinese regulators have also recently prevented offshore investments into U.S. real estate. Bitcoin allows people to route around capital controls, by buying bitcoins locally, sending them to an exchange abroad, and selling them for the foreign currency.Anti-thesis: While Bitcoin can help small-scale evasion of capital controls, it is not liquid enough to capture market share from other forms of evasion. Governments have and will crackdown on their local Bitcoin exchanges to further reduce liquidity.10. FOMO\u00a0buyersThesis: Retail investors see the price going up and experience a \u201cfear of missing out\u201d on further price gains and the social phenomenon. Individuals want to be able to relate to each other, i.e. if your friends are talking about investing in Bitcoin then you feel a need to do so yourself. When the price stops going up parabolically the social fad quickly passes. Conversation turns to embarrassing losses and moves on to the next trendy investment.Anti-thesis: The FOMO buyers become FOCO (fear of cashing out) holders. They sit on the bitcoins they impulsively bought, waiting for the next bubble. A small percentage start to research what Bitcoin is and continue accumulating during the bear market.11. Vehicle\u00a0CurrencyThesis: In 1979 Paul Krugman published a paper titled \u201cVehicle Currencies and the Structure of International Exchange\u201d. In this paper he explained that \u201cPeople who want to exchange one currency for another will not necessarily make the exchange directly. They may make the exchange by way of some third currency, which becomes a \u201cvehicle\u201d for the transaction. Historically, certain currencies\u200a\u2014\u200athe pound sterling before 1914, the U.S. dollar in recent years\u200a\u2014\u200ahave come to be widely used as vehicle currencies.\u201d Bitcoin has the potential to become the vehicle currency of international trade.Anti-thesis: Bitcoin is not nearly liquid enough to be a vehicle currency. Competing with the U.S. dollar for this is extremely difficult, the most likely candidate has been the euro and it has made little progress.12. Electricity monetizationThesis: Governments and individuals that are struggling to get hard currency can use cheap local electricity to mine for bitcoins. The Venezuelan government has been seizing imported Bitcoin mining equipment so that they can use it themselves. The North Korean government acquired 11,000 bitcoins through a combination of mining and hacking.Anti-thesis: As Bitcoin mining finds increasingly inexpensive sources of electricity, it will become less and less profitable for governments to mine even if they have favorable access to fossil fuels.Part 2\u00a0here!", "responses": "10"}, {"title": "The Flippening: Ethereum vs.\u00a0Bitcoin", "author_name": "Kenny Li", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/the-flippening-ethereum-vs-bitcoin-2ac80a953ebb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 5, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "2.5K", "content": "The Flippening: Ethereum vs.\u00a0BitcoinKenny LiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 5, 2018If you\u2019ve been in the cryptocurrency space for more than a month, chances are you\u2019ve come across the term Flippening. As silly as it may be to pronounce, the term refers to the foretold event in the possible future that Bitcoin will be dethroned by another cryptocurrency. One of the major contenders for the championship belt has been Ethereum. In the current midst of the ongoing Bitcoin Crash, this legend is inching toward a possible reality.A couple of weeks ago, I published an article about the 9 Rules of Crypto Trading that focused on rules that Miles follows. He\u2019s one of the founders of Pure Investments, which is a Discord community that focus on cryptocurrency signals. Recently, he published a video on the official Pure Investments YouTube Channel regarding Ethereum and the Flippening.Take a look at the full Ethereum video posted by Miles from Pure InvestmentsMiles is a strong believer in the Flippening. While Bitcoin sustains its current dominance, Miles believes that Ethereum\u2019s strong value proposition will eventually outshine the current champion\u200a\u2014\u200awith strong reason. One of the major points that Miles argues is the \u201cFirst to Market Dominance\u201d claim with Bitcoin. Analogously, we have seen empires like Best Buy and BlockBuster crippled by innovative competition from the likes of Amazon and NetFlix. Apart from this, Miles also argues that\u2026Blockbuster: Rent 6, get 1 free; NetFlix: Get all you want for $10/month.\u201cMining Ethereum blocks takes about 14 seconds per confirmation compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 10 minutes.\u201dBitcoin, which is a behemoth that is becoming very comfortable on its throne, cannot offer the blockchain confirmation speed (well, arguably it can in the future with Lightning Network) of Ethereum. If you\u2019ve tried to send Bitcoin during a market correction, you\u2019ll know how much each second counts; in fact, Bitcoin Cash, a direct competitor to Bitcoin, has even been accused of exploiting Bitcoin\u2019s confirmation weakness in the past to congest the blockchain (look up the conspiracy Operation Dragon Slayer).Slower block confirmations on Bitcoin mean longer wait\u00a0times.\u201cThe majority of coins on Coin Market Cap are actually Ethereum-based tokens.\u201cBitcoin also does not have smart contract capability, which is what gave Ethereum many more use cases beyond transactional value. It is the foundation of the majority of past and current ICOs in today\u2019s cryptocurrency market.\u201cEthereum\u2019s transaction costs are fractions of what Bitcoin\u2019s transactions cost.\u201dBitcoin\u2019s notorious transaction fees, which are partly attributed to its scalability issue (which goes back to blockchain confirmation congestion), have been reported to hit an average of $28 per transaction mid December. This makes micro-transacting a losing game. Coffee shops can\u2019t take Bitcoin purchases for $2 coffee if the user will end up paying $30 including transaction fees. Again, the Bitcoin community is actively working to solve this issue with the Lightning Network.Network fees are Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s way of doing ATM\u00a0fees.\u201cA lot of my friends, if they\u2019re wanting to send Bitcoin quickly to another exchange, they\u2019ll actually trade their Bitcoin for Ethereum to send it over quickly and cheaply and convert it back to Bitcoin.\u201dThis is a common practice for users going through Coinbase/GDAX, which is a gatekeeper for a majority of US investors. While Litecoin (and now Bitcoin Cash) is an alternative option, the added benefit of transferring Ethereum is the fact that many exchanges have Ethereum marketplaces, too. This means that as soon as the Ethereum enters an exchange like Bittrex or Binance, a user can start trading it for coins that he or she wants.\u201cThe upcoming Casper update, which introduces Proof of Stake, is going to be very revolutionary for Ethereum\u2026\u201dProof of Stake is the new way of mining. In a nutshell, Proof of Stake lets you mine a coin by simply holding on to the coin. This means that, if you hold Ethereum, you will be \u201cmining\u201d more Ethereum, without having to actually set up a mining rig, buy expensive graphics cards, and consume electricity, which is the current way of mining, called Proof of Work. Apart from how expensive Proof of Work can be, it is harmful for the environment, too. Bitcoin\u2019s mining power, which still uses Proof of Work, is estimated to consume about as much electricity as Ireland.\u201c\u00a0\u2026and send the price through the\u00a0roof.\u201dYou can mine by simply holding Ethereum, so why not buy more Ethereum and hold it? With this logic, the price of Ethereum is expected to increase as sellers are more incentivized to hold their Ethereum.\u201cSpeaking of updates for Ethereum\u2026 the zk-SNARK update\u2026 is a major improvement for the security of Ethereum.\u201dThis adds privacy to transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Privacy coins have been a big trend in the market recently, and we\u2019ve seen the market\u2019s interest through coins that have mooned like Verge (XVG), which has grown by almost 4,000x since 2016.\u201c[Ethereum\u2019s] core development team is very healthy.\u201dFunny, because while I wouldn\u2019t picture Vitalik as the figure of pristine human health, it is true that Ethereum\u2019s core development team is much more active and responsive than the Bitcoin team. In fact, we don\u2019t even know who Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator(s) of Bitcoin, is. The name is a pseudonym, and it could be a person, organization, government, or AI? While this may sound cool and mysterious, it also means we don\u2019t know the true intentions of Bitcoin apart from its whitepaper, which may be an issue.FitVitalik is a humor-minded ICO that is aimed at turning Vitalik into the next Statue of\u00a0David.\u201cThe crazy amount of forks [on Bitcoin]\u2026\u201dForks are clones of a current code-base that is modified with a different vision. Let\u2019s face it\u200a\u2014\u200athis happens because people don\u2019t agree. With Ethereum, we see the current version as a fork of Ethereum Classic, which was a fork to strengthen security against future attacks similar to the DAO. By contrast, the Bitcoin community has attempted/executed forks including\u2026 Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, and SegWit2x. The community is not unified.Bitcoin forks are like cellular mutations. Is this cow really the future of cryptocurrency?The Flippening: To Happen or Not to\u00a0Happen?Despite the features and value proposition of Ethereum that arguably make it superior to Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency community is well-aware of the financial forces that are entering the market. With futures trading from CME and CBOE, a large influx of institutional investors are starting to keep a keen eye on Bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, if you are keen to keep up-to-date on the flippening, take a look at a website dedicated to it: http://www.flippening.watch/What do you think? Will the flippening happen, or will Bitcoin continue to hold the championship belt?

I ordered one the other day and when I got it, I decided to look for an application that could demonstrate the power of this new form of computing.Some of my friends know that I have been a bitcoin enthusiast for many years, even when it wasn\u2019t popular, and it occurred to me that bitcoin mining might be the problem to solve to show the power of a quantum computer (and to make some money while I sleep!)As you might expect, a quantum computer capable of solving the bitcoin mining algorithm was very expensive (this particular brand, the QIntellize Quantum Computer, costs at least $ 1million). Since the reward for mining a bitcoin block is now at 12.5 bitcoins, at $4000 per bitcoin I should be able to pay it off after mining a few blocks quickly!So I ordered a QC and set it up. It wasn\u2019t easy to get my one quantum computer to do the work that thousands of computers around the world are currently doing in mining bitcoin blocks; but I finally figured it out!This article is meant as an introduction to both bitcoin mining and QC\u2019s, to discuss some of the difficulties I had in cornering the bitcoin market in this way. While I won\u2019t reveal all of my secrets (I\u2019d rather keep my monopoly, mind you), there should be enough clues here to guide you in the right direction if you wanted to duplicate my experiment!How Bitcoin Mining Works: A Brief\u00a0OverviewI won\u2019t go into all the details of bitcoin (you can do a simple search more about bitcoin since there are thousands of sites dedicated to it), or bitcoin mining (you can read more about it here: bitcoinmining.com), but this is a quick summary.Bitcoin is a de-centralized currency and ledger where a very big file (called the blockchain), consisting of blocks, each of which has a list of transactions. The blockchain is the general ledger to say what happened to each bitcoin over time and where it went. Since multiple computers are managing the blockchain, there is no one computer in charge of what\u2019s happening\u200a\u2014\u200athe system is built on these distributed computers agreeing about what blocks should be on the blockchain.New bitcoin are created by bitcoin miners, who are actually computers that are trying to add blocks to the blockchain. The mining itself is an algorithm that adjust in difficulty so that a new block can be added on average once every 10 minutes or so. Miners computers are trying a set of random numbers to see if they \u201cmatch\u201d the current criteria for a new block.A small random number (4 bytes) is added as part of a blockheader (which is generated based on a proposed block of transactions), and the resulting number is hashed (twice using the SHA 256 algorithm) which produces a random number at the end. If the random number is less than a certain threshold, then you have successfully generated a new block in the blockchain, which is put forward and then validated by other computers. Figure 1 shows an overview of this process (source: bitcoinmining.com)Figure 1: How Bitcoin Mining Works (source: bitcoinmining.com)So why bother? Bitcoin mining is sometimes called a \u201clottery\u201d because if you successfully generate the block, you are given some bitcoin in return. Since the price of bitcoin is several thousand dollars per bitcoin now, with a market capitalization in the many billions, this can be significant.Why is this difficult? Because thus far hashing, which is the basis of current cryptography using secure keys, is a one way operation. At current, it\u2019s impossible to know what a specific set of bits will hash to without actually doing the hashing algorithm, which has multiple cycles of moving bits around.As a result, the best way to do mining currently is to keep trying random numbers to see which one hashes to a number that is less than the target difficulty. This is why bitcoin mining pools have cropped up where a large number of computers are working in parallel to find the solution to the problem\u200a\u2014\u200aif one of them finds the solution then the pool gets the reward, sharing it with all the other miners.How Quantum Computing Works: An even Briefer\u00a0overviewThis idea of pools working in parallel was what gave me the idea to use a Quantum Computer instead.While it sounds like science fiction, quantum computers work, by taking into account the idea from quantum physics that there are parallel worlds out there. Every time we make a decision, we branch into multiple realities, or according to some physicists, there are multiple future probabilities that exist around us all the time.This quantum foam, consisting of multiple probably realities, can be thought of as a quantum probability wave. Quantum physics tells us that an electron is really a set of probabilities of where that electron is likely to be, or that a photon is likely to be either a wave or a particle. When we observe the position or velocity of a particle, the quantum wave is said to collapse into a specific reality.Sounding now more like Eastern Mysticism than even science fiction, it\u2019s the conscious act of observing a particle that collapses the probability wave into a single, measurable reality.Richard Feynman first proposed the idea of a quantum computer back in the 1980s, saying that if we could create device that could use this idea of parallel universes of probability waves to try out all possible values of a specific variable and then \u201ccollapse\u201d it into the \u201cright\u201d answer. It\u2019s taken a few decades, but we are finally at the point where quantum computers are becoming viable.Quantum computers actually make difficult problems (those which require lots of computing power) significantly easier, because you are able to distribute the processing power across numerous probable realities.To bring it in to the parlance of computer science, if x is a number, and f(x) is a function of x which produces an output y, then a quntum computer can try out all possible values of x, in parallel universes, and then if you make the right observation and add up all the results from different universes in a certain way, you can figure out which value of x produces y.In regular computer science, the kind I learned at MIT, all data is represented as numbers which consist of a series of bits. Each bit is either a zero or a one\u200a\u2014\u200aeither on or off. By collecting bits we can represent any number in binary (b1011 for example is four bits and represents the number 11. If you have x bits, you can represent up to 2 raised the power of x. In most computers, 32 bits or 64 bits are the standard for how numbers are storedThe thing that makes QCs different form regular computers is that in addition to regular bits, they are able to use qubits. Qubits are quantum bits which like a quantum particle, can have two different states. This means that while a regular bit must be a zero or a one, a qubit can be either a zero or a one. You don\u2019t know until the quantum wave collapses based on some observation taken by the conscious mind.If you have a certain number of bits, you can try out all the possible combinations by running through all the values of 0 and 1. For example, to try out all the numbers between 0 and 512, you need 9 bits\u00a0. If you write a computer program to try each of the possible values of the 9 bits (0 and 1 for each bit), ranging from 0=b000000000 to 1 = b000000001 to 511 = b111111111.How To use a QC for Bitcoin\u00a0MiningSo this brings us to how I used the quantum computer to solve the bitcoin mining problem.If you have 9 qubits, you can try out all the values from 1 to 511 simultaneously. If you had 64 bits, you could try out the hash algorithm for all possible values of x to figure out which ones when input into function f(x) lead to a result of y, or in the case of bitcoin mining, less than some target value y.The bitcoin algorithm, relies on an input shown in Figure 1 (source: bitcoinmining.com), if you think of a potential new block of transactions, you have to generate a header. The header of a block consists of several components, including a nonce which is a random 32 bit number. See Table 2 for a list of the possible values.The exact algorithm is described here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm. The result of the hash is a 256 bit integer.Figure 2: Table of Inputs for Bitcoin\u00a0HashCloser inspection will reveal that of all the bytes that are used as input, only 4 bytes, the nonce, or 32 bits are actually random. The other bytes are actually coming from a block of transactions and timestamp, etc. The output is a 256 bit number which has to be less than a target.This is complicated, however by the fact that there may not be a solution for a given block of transactions, so you may be trying to find a nonce for a block of transactions which doesn\u2019t have a solution!A qubyte is 8 qubits. So basically, what I needed was to program my QC to use 4 qubytes, or 32 qubits, which represented all of the possible values of the random number, nonce, and append this value to a set of 76 regular bytes, and then run them through the hashing algorithm. Then I could take the output, which is a 256 bits, and choose one of the output values which is less than the target.Programming the Quantum Computer\u00a0CircuitIt\u2019s not quite that simple. Today, with my quantum computer, I had to come up with an actual circuit to accomplish this. In the future, there will be much simpler ways to program quantum computers\u200a\u2014\u200aI envision a simple programming language, let\u2019s QBASIC for Quantum BASIC which would be like the BASIC language that I learned computer programming on with my Apple II back in the day. Though first I suppose an assembly language would need to be made out of the basic circuits that perform logical operations like AND, NAND, OR, XOR, etc., and then someone can write, as Bill Gates and Paul Allen did for the ALTAIR computer in 1977, write a higher level language like BASIC.The beginnings of languages like this are out there\u200a\u2014\u200aQASM, QCL, but each of these have different models and results in quantum circuits, at least for the moment.The Quantum Computer I used didn\u2019t have a good language, so I had to build the circuit myself. Figure 3 shows the basic circuit architecture for how I programmed my quantum computer, but simplified to 6 bits. It\u2019s much simpler to see how this would all work with a smaller number of bits.The first four bits are the \u201cconventional bits\u201d and the second two bits are the qubits, which are in a super-positioned state of zero or 1. In this case the 2 qubits represent the nonce, and the 4 regular bits represent the rest of the header block.The implementation of the actual Hash Algorithm used by bitcoin (SHA-256) is left as an exercise to the reader. The idea in the bitcoin mining that the output of the hash has to be less than M, the hashing difficulty, which is adjusted in the bitcoin network every so often.From a binary perspective, what this means is that the first x bits out of n ( in our case, n = 6 bits, in the bitcoin case, n=256 bits in the output) have to be zero for the result to bed less than the difficulty M. For each level of difficulty, the number of 0\u2019s at the front of the hash output will need to change.Figure 3: A simplified version of the Hash\u00a0circuitThe hard thing about quantum circuits isn\u2019t just actually designing the circuit/program, but also to find a way to measure the output in a way that will give you the \u201cright\u201d (or in some cases, the optimal) answer!In a quantum computer, although all possible values of qubits are processed in all possible worlds, it\u2019s difficult to get the output of a single case when you don\u2019t know exactly which input value caused the output value you want.When you observe the output bits, the quantum probability wave collapses and you see only one set of possible values. While quantum computers are able to have all of the possible values of the qubits simultaneously, we are still at the point of needing to loop through all of the possible output values to find the one that we want at random.The real problem is how do you measure all of the possible values to get the one you want? It might seem we are still back to step one, as we\u2019d have to loop through all possible solutions one by one.Finding the Optimal Solution From All Possible\u00a0WorldsThe key is to find some function f2(x1,x2,x3..xn) which sums up the values in all possible worlds. Using f2 as simple addition, if the values of x1\u2026 xn were all 0 for example, then you would observe the result as 0. If the values were all 1, then you would observe a value of n (x1+x2+x3).The key is what\u2019s called quantum shaking. A quantum shake is a way to generate a wave such that the output is adjusted in the quantum universe/probably reality where the right answer is present differently from how it\u2019s adjusted in other universes where the right answer is not present. It\u2019s called a quantum shake because it adjusts the value in one universe.By doing this shaking a certain number of times, the input values of the nonce which resulted in outputs of less than target t, are isolated. We just take those 4 bytes, append them to the other 76 regular bytes that we put as input, and then submit the transaction to the blockchain.Another way to represent this is to use Grover\u2019s algorithm, a well known quantum computing algorithm that cuts down the time needed to find one out of many possible solutions, as shown in Figure 4. In a simple example of Grover\u2019s algorithm, you might have four qubits as an input, which would result in 2 to the 4th power, or 16 possible values.Figure 4: Using Grover\u2019s Algorithm to Find the Optimal\u00a0SolutionGrover\u2019s algorithm reduces this to the square root of N. So, for 16 possible values of the qubits you\u2019d have to go through 2 to the power of 16, or 65,536 possible output values. The square root of this is 256, a significant difference.Pulling it all\u00a0togetherThe output of bitcoin mining hash algorithm produces 256 bit output (that\u2019s why it\u2019s called SHA-256) which is a very large number.While I won\u2019t go through the bitcoin mining in detail, the final solution involved a bit of regular computing (assembling transactions into a block, calculating the merkle root of the proposed block, getting the previous block), the quantum computer was useful for the \u201chard part\u201d, which is to find the nonce, if one exists, that will produce an output less than the difficulty.Using a combination of circuits for the hashing of the bits, followed by Grover\u2019s algorithm or quantum shaking to reduce the search time of the solution, I was able to mine blocks by searching 256 values\u200a\u2014\u200aeasy!As I said earlier, since each mined block has a reward 12.5 bitcoins per block, you can figure out that it\u2019s going to make me pretty wealthy pretty quickly!OK, Did I Really Do\u00a0This?Those readers who are familiar with both hashing algorithms and the state of Quantum Computers today will realize that I didn\u2019t really do this today (I wrote the first part of this post in 2016, and now that bitcoin is back in the news, I finished it in 2017).For one thing, you can just look at who\u2019s mining the blocks and you\u2019ll see that they are being mined by mining pools. For another thing, the bitcoin mining algorithm uses the SHA256 algorithm, which can take up to a very large number of input bits but always outputs 256 bits. For all quantum computers today, the number of bits input and the output need to be the same. Astute observers will notice that the bitcoin algorithm actually requires running SHA-256 twice, so you could theoretically do what I proposed for the second SHA-256 if you could design a quantum circuit to implement it.Also, although there are now languages to help generate the underlying circuits, they have to be fed to the quantum computer. The languages are becoming better and though some are simulating the quantum computer on conventional hardware, the whole area of quantum computing is still very much in flux, moving quickly.So, the truth is that the full extent of what I \u201cdid\u201d is not possible. At least not yet.Although there are algorithms that can be used by quantum computers to break public/private key cryptography (Shor\u2019s algorithm for factoring for example), the computers themselves are not yet practical. However, if and when they do become practical, today\u2019s standard cryptography needs to be updated and new algorithms need to be invented.Another problem today with QC\u2019s is that errors can creep up due o the physical processes which are used to superpose individual bits. While not many people know this, the reason there are two values of a bit on a computer today and not 3 is simply that a \u201czero\u201d is represented by a certain range of volts and a \u201cone\u201d is represented by another range of volts. These ranges are far enough apart that there is very little error.Qubits are much more complicated and the physical implementation varies with each type of QC. When dealing with Quantum Computers, the chances of a physical measurement error corrupting your results are much higher than in a normal computer. In fact, you need to run the algorithm many times to be sure that there wasn\u2019t a physical error.This article was meant to be a (theoretical) discussion that would introduce both concepts\u200a\u2014\u200abitcoin mining and quantum computers\u200a\u2014\u200afor those who hadn\u2019t been exposed to them at the level of a computer programmer. Experts in both areas will no doubt find some errors or omissions or additional reasons why this is not possible today (at least not yet!).Feel free to leave comments on how/when/if you think this will ever be possible.", "responses": "24"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Sebastian Moonjava", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/the-flippening-how-i-learned-to-stop-loving-bitcoin-663e5db40707?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 12, 2017", "readtime": "11 min read", "upvotes": "427", "content": "\u201cThe Flippening\u201d & How I Learned to Stop Loving\u00a0BitcoinSebastian MoonjavaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 12, 2017The Flippening\u201cA scientific man ought to have no wishes, no affections,\u200a\u2014\u200aa mere heart of stone.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aCharles\u00a0DarwinThe feelings of love and affection for a network protocol may seem a bit absurd to an outsider of the cryptocurrency space, but not to those who have been in the industry for years, in fact, it\u2019s rather common place.

Conceived amidst the chaos of the global financial crisis and with such poetic timing, some might call it destiny. On January 3, 2009 the genesis block was generated and thus birth of the first digital talisman.Andreas Antonopoulos, the de facto spokesperson/preacher of Bitcoin, started his involvement in early 2012, quitting all other work to research and promote Bitcoin full time. Antonopoulos deserves massive respect, as he is the spring board from which Bitcoin has jumped. He has spread awareness of the value and utility of the cryptospace to the masses, likely responsible for more adoption, investment, and the creation of more Bitcoin Maximalists than any one\u200a\u2014\u200aever. Not even Ross Ulbricht, who is known for marrying Bitcoin to drugs, and that\u2019s saying a lot. The quit-everything-to-go-100%-into-a-pursuit is admirable, and many veteran Bitcoiners have a similar story. Once you truly begin to see how revolutionary something is, and how truly revolutionary Bitcoin was, it makes sense to follow it with all of your heart. Andres has done so magically, with grace and confidence to be rivaled only by some of the greatest rhetoricians/orators in the last hundred years. Antonopoulos helped secure my own faith and love for Bitcoin. His words transformed Bitcoin from a nerd\u2019s wet dream to a modern mythology to be admired by all of humanity.Bitcoin Maximalist: Individuals who are religiously pro Bitcoin. They see Bitcoin as \u201cthe one\u201d and \u201cthe way,\u201d calling all other digital assets \u201caltcoins.\u201dGaining an understanding of how Bitcoin Maximalists are created requires an investigation into psychology. Those individuals who shun all \u201caltcoins\u201d and scoff at the mere mention of another blockchain, have likely gained much from their devotion to Bitcoin. Interestingly they are also the only people who have any interest in ETC (Ethereum Classic, a hardfork of Ethereum)\u200a\u2014\u200athis proves their respect for Ethereum\u2019s protocol, but they are unwilling to provide it to their direct competitor, Eth. It makes perfect sense to gain a fondness for something that has provided you benefit. If you bought Bitcoin, let\u2019s say 2013 ish or prior, you have had to deal with tremendous levels of euphoria, and severe down-trend despair. The ups and downs force all kinds of feelings and an emotional history can spur strong bonding. Few people who have bought Bitcoin are experts in the technology, most have purchased speculatively, so when price shifts, as it has done intensely over the past few years, Bitcoin hodlers hodl on hope. When we do not fully understand something, but wish not to fret, we find faith. We seek it out to pacify our concern and anxiety from uncertainty. I have used faith in Bitcoin to remedy my own concerns when the price goes down or someone asks a question I cannot answer.\u201cClose your eyes, and hodl on, and everything will be\u00a0ok.\u201dThe trend has generally been up, as we have recently breached the all time high, only reinforcing the Maximalist\u2019s faith in Bitcoin, and confidence in the certain death of all alts. \u201cAltcoins\u201d are also pompously referred to as \u201cshitcoins\u201d by the Maximalist crowd. There is literally a movie called, \u201cThe Bitcoin Gospel,\u201d featuring Roger Ver - a man they call, \u201cBitcoin Jesus.\u201d Faith in Bitcoin has, until recently, been acceptable (or at least profitable), but continued faith in the near future will require a hodl based on wishes, affection, and blindness.It\u2019s unlikely that the true pioneers and veterans of the cryptospace are Bitcoin Maximalists. It seems that many of the earliest adopters understand that technology evolves, grows, and branches, and to love a protocol regardless of its faults is troublesome and slows advancement.New people to the space don\u2019t generally have this faith, they either go to what\u2019s popular and growing in value in hopes of gains or jump on what is useful. I will admit a few newcomers to the space will become Maximalists, for the sheer fact that Antonopolous could convert a banker to a pro Bitcoin lobbyist in a single sitting - provoking a faith in them that the battle was already over.Bitcoin has become pop music.Losing FaithIt\u2019s quite interesting to watch millions of new people jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon, caring little about the improved future, the great paradigm shift, or the mass disintermedation, often touted by Andreas as Bitcoin\u2019s claim to fame. The money is rolling into Bitcoin, yet the innovation has fled. Most people are reveling in gains made by the most recent wave of fresh investors, with little care, or knowledge of the stagnation and comparative decline of their techo-pulpit. It\u2019s possible this could continue well into the future, but information travels fast in the information age, so it is more probable that awareness of this atrophy is already spreading like a virus.July 20, 2015, the Ethereum Genesis Block was generated. The Ethereum Blockchain is about 1 year and 8 months old.In technology, potential has a shelf life\u200a\u2014\u200aand it\u2019s short.Ethereum reached a network value of 1 billion dollars in about 8 months; for Bitcoin it took 4 years 3 months (51 months). Ethereum reached the 1 billion dollar value milestone more than 6x faster. This rapid early growth can be attributed to Bitcoin laying the foundation of awareness and information channels that allowed for Ethereum to jump quickly into the consciousness of the freshly mined cryptospace. The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, understood these information channels well, as he had started his legacy as a writer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine. Surely Vitalik had a great appreciation for Bitcoin, dedicating his energy and time to it, but thankfully he is NOT a Bitcoin Maximalist.The greatest innovators in the space are not locked down by a religious sentiment for Bitcoin; they move freely from great idea, to greater idea, propelling forward the collective consciousness of technology. It appears that there is a great stagnation in Bitcoin, as the block size debate moves slowly, development on the protocol is non-fluid, leaving Bitcoin with few developers comparatively. It might be that the stagnation in Bitcoin is not a recent development, but inherent in the system. Slow development on Bitcoin is a \u201cfeature,\u201d as its intent was not to be adaptable, but rigid.The use of Bitcoin as currency is unlikely, as its transaction times and costs are growing. For Bitcoin currently the speed is 3tx/sec with a 10 minute blocktime compared to 20tx/sec and a 14 second blocktime for Ethereum. For something that claims to be the future world currency, you might think it would have a competitive advantage of speed or scale\u2026or maybe adaptability.Erik Vorhees, another pioneering Bitcoin millionaire, recently tweeted about Ethereum\u2019s possible use for payments instead of Bitcoin, for obvious reasons\u2026Clearly Voorhees is not a maximalist \u2014Surely there must be some use for Bitcoin, right? The digital gold of the world? Not a currency, but a commodity? A store of value? Its position as a possible non-perishable commodity is eroding quickly, as many of the up and coming digital assets, the \u201calt coins,\u201d actually have utility, such as Ethereum, which acts as a platform to develop Dapps (decentralized applications)/smart contracts, and can play the role of currency BETTER than Bitcoin and was built to be adaptive. There are numerous examples of new cryptocurrencies/digital assets that do what Bitcoin does, AND MORE. Once we have guided the Maximalists through this very psychologically difficult realization, they eventually agree and cry out \u201cbut\u2026but\u2026 the network effects, this is what will keep Bitcoin alive.\u201dThe network effect of Bitcoin will lend to Ethereum in the same ways it did to spur Eth\u2019s explosive entrance on to the scene. The network of the first roads were built for horses, and then the cars came\u2026As this is being written, de facto Bitcoin preacher #1 is writing Mastering Ethereum.Clearly Andreas is NOT a Bitcoin Maximalist either. He has a pioneering mentality, and will not ignore the future as it arrives, just as he did not ignore Bitcoin upon its arrival to the world. Though surely he will not stop advocating Bitcoin anytime soon, as it has made him, both monetarily, and publicly. His network, as with many others, will only lend favorably to the more useful of the \u201calts.\u201dThe main push behind Bitcoin\u2019s price recently is not because of its increased utility, but selling the dreams of getting rich from Bitcoin (or staying rich) - the sheer hype-effect of \u201cI\u2019ve heard Bitcoin has made millionaires.\u201d The recent ETF decision has done little to push down the price, which isn\u2019t surprising because the media attention is helping millions discover it\u200a\u2014\u200akeeping it \u201cnew\u201d and seemingly innovative, and it is\u2026compared to the old economy. It\u2019s utility dwindles, but speculation built on hope is keeping the price on the up and up. There is the false assumption that value of something (Bitcoin) is directly related to its utility or its health\u200a\u2014\u200aits continued increase in value is directly related to the delayed mainstream adoption & discovery process. The ETF failed to be pushed through, and though Bitcoin may get one in the future this only delays the inevitable\u2026 the migration to something truly useful.The network effect of Bitcoin is extremely limited, as it has built its own laborious network, benefiting only from its first mover advantage\u2026 likened to the \u201cMyspace advantage.\u201d Ethereum, on the other hand, has an entire network of network effects working for it. As each new token or smart contract built on Ethereum gains exposure, more people become aware of the utility and value of the Ethereum network. Iconomi, Augur, Golem, DigixDao, FirstBlood, and MakerDAO are a few Ethereum projects independently expanding and propelling the Etheruem network utility upward and multiplying the number of developers on the protocol\u200a\u2014\u200amore projects and potential use cases are popping up regularly. There are even tokens being developed on Ethereum that could act as a stable currency, far better than Bitcoin. Ethereum may soon have multiple tokens, filling the use-cases Bitcoin once claimed it would solve.Currently six of the top 20 digital assets by market cap exist on the Ethereum\u00a0network.Coinbase, another non-maximalist, has opted into Ethereum (oh.. the network effects), unable to deny its value - an initial hint at the dETHroning of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin monopoly was gone before most even realized there existed any competition at all. Those who continue to hodl to their hopes of Bitcoin supremacy have a rough road ahead. Some Maximalists even understand that others systems are better, but push archaic examples of network effects such as the QWERTY keyboard as their \u201chail Mary.\u201d Fortunately, the ultra fluid exchange from the inefficient to the efficient systems of today require only a click\u200a\u2014\u200ajumping from the bandwagon couldn't be easier. Pay attention: The once promised \u201cSwiss bank in your pocket\u201d is almost here, and its not Bitcoin\u2026 but Metropolis (the next Ethereum update).Moving On\u2026I am a confident that \u201cThe Flippening\u201d will occur and if you are new to the concept, I am glad to introduce you to the idea - much to the chagrin of the Maximalist community. There will be a time in the near future where Bitcoin is no longer the dominant \u201ccoin\u201d or blockchain, this will likely happen sooner than most expect\u2026 and Ethereum will be the one to take its place. This idea does not come from hope, nor love; it comes from logic.The single-use concept and rigid development protocol of Bitcoin was not intended to be the infrastructure of web 3.0. The world needs more than a \u201cdigital gold\u201d\u2026 the world needs Ethereum. It\u2019s highly adaptable nature allows for the infrastructure building of a new paradigm via smart contracts. As Wikileaks continues to unveil the troubles of today's governance protocol, the need for better privacy and security for the individual is ever increasing. The majority of our lives exist on the web; it\u2019s how we communicate with family and friends, it\u2019s the way we make purchases, it\u2019s where we store our memories, our data. Bitcoin is currently unable to provide the swift development and decision making necessary to be the protocol of the globe.Bitcoin may very well be the bridge to the promise land, but it is not, in fact, the promise land itself. Maximalists will fight this idea tooth and nail, hoping to maintain their \u201cI am ahead of the curve\u201d beliefs. It takes time to learn about the new kid on the block, and like the Bitcoin protocol itself, Maximalists have slowed and stalled.In contrast, Ethereum is blossoming rapidly into a rain forest of diversity. The ICO (Initial Coin Offering) movement is gaining momentum, over taking venture capital investments faster than anyone could have imagined. Any person, business or organization can launch an ICO crowdfund quickly using the Ethereum network with ease from anywhere in the world\u200a\u2014\u200athis is causing an explosion of innovation. Ethereum is laying the foundation for the new web, the infrastructure of the new internet and the 4th industrial revolution. Imagine if you could have bought a piece of the internet, when it first started\u2026 Ethereum is kind of like that, but magnitudes greater. As Ethereum is not simply the internet of money, it is the internet of decentralized cooperation, automation, the internet of things, AND money.We will bid a fond farewell to the information age when Bitcoin is surpassed -and with its passing, comETH a new era\u200a\u2014\u200aa digital and decentralized renaissance.I still love Bitcoin, but I am no longer in love with it.", "responses": "22"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Andreas M.

It\u2019s good enough to serve as a standalone piece because the misconception this aims to put to rest is a commonly raised one that becomes annoyingly repetitive.Understanding the Bitcoin network without\u00a0math.Bitcoin is more than just a chain of blocks. I want to help you understand how Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain network is designed because it\u2019ll help you fill in some gaps as you begin to acquire more knowledge in this field. I say blockchain network because Bitcoin also has a payment channel network (lightning) layered on top of it that doesn\u2019t effect the structure of the blockchain network. I won\u2019t be discussing Bitcoin\u2019s lightning network in this article though, as it\u2019s not that relevant to the points I\u2019ll make.Below is a rough example of the Bitcoin network scaled down to 1000 fully validating nodes (there\u2019s really 115,000 currently). Each node here has 8 connections to other nodes, because this is the default amount of connections the client makes without any changes made to it. My node is in here somewhere, and if you\u2019re running one, it\u2019s in there too. Coinbase\u2019s nodes are in there, Bitmain\u2019s nodes are in there, and if Satoshi is still around, Satoshi\u2019s node is in there too.Please note that this is just a diagram, and that the real network topology can (and probably does) vary from this. Some nodes have more than the default amount of connections while others may opt to connect to a limited number or stay behind just one other node. There\u2019s no way to know what it actually looks like because it\u2019s designed with privacy in mind (although some monitoring companies certainly try to get very close approximations) and nodes can routinely changed who their peers are.I started with that diagram because I want you to understand that there are no differences in these nodes because they all fully validate. This means they all check the entire chain to make sure each and every transaction and block follow the rules. This will prove to be important as I explain further.The ones on the inside are no different than the ones on the outside, they all have the same amount of connections. When you start up a brand new node, it finds peers and becomes one of the hive. The longest distance in this graph from any of these nodes to another is 6. In real life there are some deviations to this distance because finding new peers isn\u2019t a perfectly automated process that distributes everyone evenly, but generally, adding more nodes to the network doesn\u2019t change this. There are 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, and in 6 hops my transaction is in the hands of (almost) every node, if it\u2019s valid.I\u2019m going to select \u201cmy\u201d node from this group and drag it out, so I can demonstrate what happens when I create a transaction and announce it to the network. Below you\u2019ll see my node all the way to the right, and then you\u2019ll see the 8 other nodes (peers) that mine is connected to.When I create a transaction and \u201csend it out to the world\u201d, it\u2019s actually only going to these 8 peers. Since Bitcoin is designed from the ground up to make every node a fully validating node, when these 8 nodes receive my transaction they check to see if it\u2019s valid before sending it out to their 8 peers. If my transaction is invalid it will never break the \u201csurface\u201d of the network. My peers will never send that bad transactions to their peers. They actually don\u2019t even know that I created that transaction. There\u2019s no way for them to tell, and they treat all data as equal, but if I were to keep sending invalid transaction to any of my 8 peers, they would all eventually block me. This is done by them automatically to prevent me from spamming my connection to them. No matter who you are, or how big your company is, your transaction won\u2019t propagate if it\u2019s invalid.Now let\u2019s say you\u2019re not running a full-node, but you\u2019re using a light-client instead. Various light-clients exist for the desktop, and for your mobile phone. Some of them are Electrum, Armory, Bread, and Samourai Wallet. Light-clients tether to a specific node. Some can be set up to change the one they connect to over time, but they are still ultimately tethered. This is what tethering looks like:I want you to note that this is just a diagram, and it\u2019s easy to demonstrate tethering using a node that happens to be on the rim, but there is no real rim, and tethering is tethering wherever that node happens to be within this diagram. I\u2019ve highlighted this in yellow. The nodes being tethered to are green, and the blue dots are light-clients. All information going to or coming from the light-client goes through the node they\u2019re tethered to. They depend on that node. They are not part of the network. They\u2019re not nodes.Here\u2019s where it gets fun, and where other people try to misrepresent how the network actually works: What if I wanted to start mining?Mining a block is the act of creating a block. Much like a transaction you want to send, you must create the block and announce it to the network. Any node can announce a new block, there\u2019s nothing special about that process, you just need a new block. Mining has gotten increasingly difficult, but if you want you can purchase specialized hardware and connect it to your personal node.Remember that bit about invalid transactions? Same goes for blocks, but you need to understand something very specific about how blocks are created.First watch this video. I skipped to the important part about hashing, using nonces (random value) and appending the chain with that new block header:Please watch the entire thing if you have time. It\u2019s personally my favorite video explaining how mining works.When you get to the following part in the video where the labels \u201cPrev hash\u201d are applied, those are the block headers:What\u2019s not mentioned in this video is you can create valid blocks headers even if all the transactions inside the block are invalid. It still requires the same amount of time to mine blocks with invalid transactions as it does to mine a block with valid transactions. The incentive to spend all that time and energy creating such a block would be to push through a transaction that rewards you with Bitcoin that aren\u2019t yours. This is why it\u2019s important that all nodes check not just the block headers, but the transactions as well. This is what stops miners from spending that time. Because all nodes check, no miners can cheat the system. If all nodes didn\u2019t check you\u2019d have to rely on the ones that do check. This would separate nodes into \u201ctypes\u201d, and the only type that would matter would be the ones that check.So what if you join a mining pool? You might do this because mining is too difficult for you to do alone, or if you\u2019re a slightly larger entity you might prefer a steady income as opposed to a sporadic one. Many miners do this, and they connected their specialized hardware directly to a mining pool using an entirely different protocol call the Stratum mining protocol. Just like creating a transaction with your non-node cellphone, you don\u2019t have to run a node to connect your hardware to a mining pool. You can mine without running a node, and many miners do exactly that. Here\u2019s what that looks like below in blue. I\u2019ve used Slush Pool for this example:Remember, I dragged these pool-run nodes out of the diagram for demonstration purposes. Just like any other node, these pool-run nodes need peers. They need peers to receive transactions & blocks, and they need peers to announce blocks they create. Allow me to reiterate again: All nodes validate all blocks and all transactions.If any of these pools announce an invalid block, their peers will know because they fully-validate, and they won\u2019t send it out to other nodes. Just like transactions, invalid blocks do not enter the network.Here\u2019s another way to look at this without pulling these nodes out from the diagram. Below is a private miner who doesn\u2019t want to be known, it has 8 random peers, and none of those peers knows that it\u2019s a miner. Again, this is intensionally designed this way for privacy reasons. There\u2019s no way for any node in the network to know that the block they received was created by their peer, or relayed by their peer. All they know is if it\u2019s valid or not, and if it is they send it along, if it\u2019s not, they don\u2019t.Hopefully you\u2019re getting the picture, and I don\u2019t believe I used any fancy math or equations to get here. I\u2019d like to move on because I feel like this is complete coverage, but there is one final thing I\u2019d like to address because it\u2019s this final aspect that is used to confuse others who don\u2019t fully understand everything I just explained. It\u2019s so rampantly used that I need to address it.https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1000232465540136960My original comment was talking about light-clients, also called SPV clients, and how they aren\u2019t part of the network. I demonstrated this above with the blue tethered dots. His follow-up comment tries to imply that nodes that mine are the only nodes who\u2019s rejection matters. Remember: nodes have no way of knowing which other nodes mined a block versus who relayed a block, this was designed intentionally.Now for a final diagram so I can try and explain the logic that\u2019s used when people say \u201conly mining nodes matter\u201d. Some miners connect directly to other miners so that out of their peer list with the network, some of them are also other miners. Not all miners do this. Some of these miners that connect directly also use optional relay networks like the FIBRE network being designed by Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo, but even this side-network isn\u2019t exclusive to miners, anyone can join including you or me and it\u2019s just there to help block relay across the network. Either way, people try to argue that this interconnectivity of \u201cnodes that mine\u201d (whether using something like FIBRE or not) implies they\u2019re the only ones that matter, and it\u2019s absurd:In this example I left the node\u2019s peers inside the diagram. You should get the point by now. They reject invalid blocks. That group of nodes inside the green circles are most definitely not the only set of nodes that matter in this network.", "responses": "13"}, {"title": "Why I just bought 90 B2X (Bitcoin SegWit2X\u00a0futures)", "author_name": "Bart Jellema", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/why-i-just-bought-90-b2x-bitcoin-segwit2x-futures-f94d0ee13eb9?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 28, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "3.6K", "content": "Why I just bought 90 B2X (Bitcoin SegWit2X\u00a0futures)Bart JellemaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 28, 2017My BT2 balance in\u00a0BitFinexI just spent about $85.000 on buying B2X futures. This just means that once SegWit2x goes live, I\u2019ll already have 90 coins. But why did I spent nearly a $1000/coin for coins that everyone will get for \u201cfree\u201d?Simply because I think that the SegWit2x coin will become \u201cBitcoin\u201d and the current Bitcoin will become Bitcoin Classic. Let me explain\u2026Currently 85% of the mining power of bitcoin is signaling they will support a block increase to 2MB around the 16th of November. Once this block is generated, bitcoin will fork into Bitcoin Segwit2X (B2X) and Bitcoin Classic (BTCC). At this point either of them could become Bitcoin \u201cBTC\u201d.So you won\u2019t really get \u201cfree\u201d coins. More accurarely, your Bitcoins will be splitting in two\u2026 one BTCC and one B2X. One of these will be worth a lot, the other not so much. Together they will be worth around the same as one BTC before the fork, maybe a little more.Let\u2019s looks at what could happen to BTCC. If it really only gets 15% of the hashing power, blocks will take over an hour. Since the BTC blockchain is currently already congested, things will get almost 7 times worse, so transaction fees might go up a lot, just to get your transactions into the BTCC chain. This could lead to many people pulling out of BTCC, thereby lowering the price and that would cause a death spiral for BTCC. However, BTC has been proven to be quite resilient, so the price might stay as is and if the price stays high long enough, miners will shift mining power back to BTCC and B2X will crash into a death spiral instead.Keep in mind that this fork is very different from Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and the myriad of newly announced forks coming up. Segwit2X was agreed upon back in May by:58 companies located in 22 countries83.28% of hashing power5.1 billion USD monthly on chain transaction volume20.5 million bitcoin walletsAnd more have joined afterwards and some have left. This is still very different from the small amount of support that Bitcoin Cash and Gold had.Another major difference is the lack of strong replay protection. While this sounds desirable, the reason why the SegWit2X team doesn\u2019t want to implement this is clear from what Mike from BitGo had to say about it:\u201dReplay protection\u201d, as you call it, splits the chain. It simply doesn\u2019tmake sense- you\u2019d suddenly be breaking 10+million SPV clients thatotherwise work just fine. It is a goal of segwit2x to help avoid this.Today, we\u2019re on course to deploy segwit2x with a vast majority of minersstill signaling for it. On top of that, 99.94% of nodes & SPV clients willautomatically follow that longest chain (segwit2x).So in the end it will come down to which of the chains will receive the most support. With the huge support for B2X in the ecosystem, there is a good chance that B2X will be recognized as the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin and take the price of BTC, around $6000\u2026 and BTCC will become an altcoin worth a few hundred dollars.So if SegWit2X becomes the needed upgrade to Bitcoin it\u2019s trying to be, I walk away with a cool half mil. If not I take maybe a $40k hit. I think my odds are pretty good here, but time will tell.I\u2019ve bought about 84 BT2 coins (that\u2019s the name of the B2X future)at Bitfinex and 6 or so at HitBTC.UPDATE 9-Nov: So today I woke up to the news of the fork being cancelled. BT2 trading at $200 and B2X trading at $320. Obviously not the outcome I was hoping for, but I always knew this was a gamble. I still think it was a good gamble for the odds and that it had positive expected value. I\u2019d do it again.The moral of the story is, don\u2019t risk what you aren\u2019t happy to lose.(It looks like there\u2019s a rumor 30% of miners are going ahead anyway\u2026 not holding my breath, but I\u2019m holding my BT2)UPDATE 13-Jul-2018: I sold my BT2 at a big loss.

Difficulty is a number calculated by the Bitcoin protocol and embedded into each Bitcoin block. This difficulty is a measure of how many hashes it takes for a miner to find a valid block in average. It is recalculated every 2016 blocks (roughly two weeks) in order to keep block intervals at roughly 10 minutes.As of December 7, block 498048, the Bitcoin difficulty stands at 1,590,896,927,258. Each hash is effectively a random number between 1 and 2^256\u20131. The difficulty describes the target that the hash must undershoot. This is similar to throwing darts randomly at a large target. The difficulty describes the size of the bullseye. The smaller the bullseye, the more often you have to throw a dart to randomly hit the bullseye.We can calculate the number of hashes you need to compute on average to find a block within ten minutes using the formula D * 232 / 600. You can see how this formula is derived here. For the current difficulty, this gives us an estimation of 1.14x10^19 hashes per second, or 14 Exahash/s.Bitmain is a manufacturer of Bitcoin mining equipment based in Beijing and Shenzhen. They claim to have produced roughly 70% of the world\u2019s Bitcoin miners, using chips from Taiwanese chip foundry TSCM. Their latest model, the S9, uses a 19nm chip. From their website we can learn that the latest batch produces about 14 TH/s (14x10^12) at 1372W. Earlier S9 models use the same electricity per hash.As this is the currently most energy efficient miner on the market, it allows us to calculate a lower boundary for how much electricity is consumed.Dividing 1.14x10^19 by 14x10^12, we can calculate that there are a maximum number of 800,000 S9 miners currently in operation, consuming roughly 1,100 MW in total. The statistics provided by the International Energy Agency do not use MW or GW. Instead, they use \u201cMtoe\u201d, or \u201cMillion tons of oil equivalent\u201d. 1 toe is 11.63 MWh. The total energy estimated to be used globally in 2017 is 13,647 Mtoe, or 158,714,610 GWh. In comparison, by today\u2019s difficulty standard, we would expect the Bitcoin network to consume roughly 9,636 GWh over an entire year, less than one 16,000th of the global supply.Bitcoin consumes 1,100 MW in total, that is, 9,636 GWh over an entire year, or 0.829 Mtoe.This is just a lower boundary, but it is also a relatively good estimate. Some of the miners currently active on the Bitcoin network might be older and less efficient, but already the second most efficient Bitcoin miner generation, the Bitmain S7, consumers 1.5 times as much energy per hash as the S9. While it might be profitable to use this miner with Bitcoin\u2019s current rapid price increases, it will not be profitable in the long run.This lower boundary also serves as a natural equilibrium. If all other variables\u200a\u2014\u200alike price and technology\u200a\u2014\u200aremain constant, Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption will converge to this boundary.Google\u2019s data centers consume about double as much electricity in 2015 than Bitcoin consumes in\u00a02017Why does that seem so\u00a0small?There are many ways we can make that number look big or small in comparison, depending on what we want you to think. If I had the intention to lobby for a ban of Bitcoin mining, I would use references like the one below:Bitcoin uses as much energy as 520,000 Canadians every dayBitcoin uses as much energy as the Democratic Republic of CongoBitcoin uses more energy than 116 countries eachBitcoin uses enough energy to power 6 Nimitz-class aircraft carriersIt is also easy to make this number look very small:The energy that Bitcoin consumes in a year would only last the U.S. for 19 hours.Bitcoin uses only 20% of the energy from a single coal power plant in TaiwanThe Three Gorges Damn in China produces three times as much electricity as Bitcoin consumesThe U.S. produces more electricity from a single Geothermal plant than Bitcoin requires17 NSA Data centers together consume more electricity than BitcoinGoogle used about double as much electricity in 2015 than Bitcoin does todayWhat does the future of Bitcoin mining look\u00a0like?Bitcoin currently consumes mostly very cheap electricity. Miners race to the bottom of who can find the cheapest electricity, and everyone consuming electricity significantly larger than the average is forced to shut down their unprofitable operations.As a result, Bitcoin mostly consumes electricity in places where it is abundant, cannot be stored or transported. Because oil, gas and coal are often trivial to transport, you very rarely find Bitcoin mining operations that consume these resources, because it would be more profitable to ship the energy to a place where it can be sold for more.While some coal in landlocked and inaccessible locations is fired up in an environmentally unfriendly process to mine Bitcoins, most miners are powered by hydrogen dams, geysers and other geothermal energy sources that cannot be transported or stored.Bitcoin will continue to seek those cheap and otherwise unused forms of electricity, while it will probably never be profitable to mine in urban or industrial centers. You are willing to pay more for your air-conditioning or water heating than a Bitcoin miner can afford.How much does it cost to mine a\u00a0Bitcoin?Miners are rewarded for their efforts with Bitcoin payments. They are willing to only burn as much electricity as they are being given as a reward. Block 498048 (that we look at above) yielded 14.6 BTC as a reward for its miner, a relatively typical fee. This is about US$230,000 at the current volatile prices. Given a electricity cost at US$0.02 per kWh and 1,100 MW consumption, a block costs in average 183 MW, or US$3,600.If Bitcoin prices remain constant and enough miners can be built, we would expect Bitcoin\u2019s electricity consumption to increase five-fold in the short run.In the long run however, Bitcoin\u2019s mining reward will become smaller and smaller. It\u2019s base reward (currently at 12.5 Bitcoin per block) will half every four years, until it reaches zero. The reward from transaction fees (currently 2 Bitcoins per block) is expected to stay the same.How much electricity will be consumed by the Bitcoin network in this case depends on the size of the transaction fees, and the value of a Bitcoin. If a Bitcoin is one day worth US$1 million, two Bitcoins per block would mean 2 million dollars worth of electricity is destroyed every 10 minutes.Where will that electricity come\u00a0from?Bitcoin will continue to unlock largely inaccessible electricity in the form of hydro, geothermal and solar. Few Bitcoin mines will rely on oil, gas or coal, as these resources are largely exhausted, can easily be transported to areas with higher prices, and are expensive to extract.Also, one can argue that Bitcoin actually saves energy. The world\u2019s financial system requires many resources beyond the electricity to run servers. Banks house themselves in tall buildings with air-conditioning, private jet companies fly gold and cash around the world for discreet clients, while printing cash requires cotton farming or even the slaughter of animals.So is Bitcoin really taking a toll on global energy use? Given Bitcoin mining\u2019s trend toward renewable resources, and the fact that traditional banking is not so environmentally friendly, the cryptocurrency may actually have a positive effect on the Earth.", "responses": "19"}, {"title": "Truegame \u2014partner of the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference", "author_name": "Truegame.io", "link": "https://medium.com/@truegame/truegame-partner-of-the-blockchain-bitcoin-conference-4e57835a0bf4?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 15, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "252", "content": "Truegame \u2014partner of the Blockchain & Bitcoin ConferenceTruegame.ioBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 15, 2018Truegame became a partner of the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference that will be held on March 22, 2018 in Tallinn, Estonia.Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference is a net of Blockchain events taking place in Tel-Aviv, Berlin, Helsinki, Prague, Moscow, London and other European cities.Experts will share their experience of implementing Blockchain in governmental institutions (Govtech), banking system, trading, media, healthcare and other spheres.

These wallets are like USB sticks which you can anywhere you want without any hassle. There is no individual data connected to the equipment is not connected with any kind of personal detail that remains anonymous and can be transacted not your personal information remains private. These wallets are versatile to malware, that is very helpful when you lose your data because you can always recover your coins using a seed phrase.Online WalletOnline wallets or desktop wallet is the same wallet which operates on the internet. You can easily use your wallet from any corner of the world due to its presence online. This wallet is very convenient to use and have multiple advantages. The wallet can be accessible on only one computer with the help of private keys of the individual. Hence there are the possibilities of hacking your wallet if your machine gets tainted with malware intended to find keys and steal Bitcoins.Paper WalletA paper wallet is kind of old but secure way to store bitcoin.

Seriously!@MishaGuttentagBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 6, 2018tl;dr: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is marketing itself as Bitcoin (BTC), scamming consumers into thinking they are buying Bitcoin at a lower price. Its backers use at least three sites to perpetuate this scam\u2014Bitcoin.com, Reddit (r/BTC) and Twitter (@Bitcoin). Scams have no place on Coinbase, perhaps the best-known American digital asset exchange. But by adding Bitcoin Cash alongside its three other assets, Coinbase has helped legitimize BCH\u2019s scam, inviting a regulatory crackdown in this industry\u2019s early years.The other day, I was listening to an excellent interview of Papa-Wassa Chiefy Nduom, a banker who has recently made waves arguing that African central banks should add Bitcoin (BTC) to their reserves.Near the end of the interview\u200a\u2014\u200astarting around an hour and forty minutes in\u200a\u2014\u200aChiefy argues that Coinbase should remove Bitcoin Cash (BCash, or BCH):CHIEFY: \u201cIn terms of that Bitcoin Cash launch, [Coinbase] kind of half-apologized, but they need to apologize for that nonsense\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. You cannot feign ignorance to the responsible way to launch a new asset on a platform. My wish and hope is that they actually remove it from there\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I\u2019m joking! But I\u2019m not, really.As I reflected on Chiefy\u2019s statement, it became clear he was right. He might be joking, or says he is, but he\u2019s got a serious point\u200a\u2014\u200athere was something really fishy about Coinbase\u2019s surprise listing of Bitcoin Cash.Unlike Coinbase\u2019s other offerings\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH)\u2014 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is purposely misleading consumers into thinking they\u2019re getting Bitcoin. The longer it stays on Coinbase, the more it looks like Coinbase is endorsing that scam.Bitcoin and the rest of the digital asset market is still in its early years. Trust is earned, and it\u2019s earned when the community comes together to fight schemes like this. Coinbase should be helping new people get started, safely\u2014 not enabling this attempt to scam them.Here are just a few examples of how BCash is scamming consumers into purchasing Bitcoin Cash when they mean to buy Bitcoin:Using Bitcoin.com as a bait-and-switch for Bitcoin Cash: if you didn\u2019t know anything about Bitcoin and wanted to learn more, you might not know that there really isn\u2019t any company in charge. Thinking it was like Google or Amazon, you might try navigating to Bitcoin.com (instead of to Bitcoin.org or Lopp\u2019s FAQ, which is where most Bitcoin-familiar people would sent you). A cursory look at Bitcoin.com makes it clear that it backs Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin, and is actively misleading consumers. Below is the Bitcoin.com home page, the first thing you see when you arrive. See the phone display? It says BTC, which stands for Bitcoin. So far, so good.\u00a0But as you keep reading, you\u2019ll see the website is designed to attack Bitcoin, in favor of Bitcoin Cash.

SpencerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 11, 2018We all remember the Crypto Singularity of December, 2017. Altcoins and the cryptocurrency market grew enormously with Bitcoin\u2019s price even reaching above the $ 19k mark.However in a startling price correction, Bitcoin\u2019s price started to fall on December 20th, and by early February it had even gone lower than $ 7k. So what caused it? It was not a bubble, if it had been, the price of Bitcoin would have popped and gone to zero.More studies and articles seem point to the launch of Bitcoin Futures being to blame.Bitcoin\u2019s fall from almost USD 20,000 is directly tied to the launch of a futures market, according to research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve, published in May, 2018.The so called crypto singularity began in earnest at the end of October, 2017 when CME Group, the world\u2019s biggest exchange operator, announced plans to launch bitcoin futures contracts that would give institutional investors exposure to the new asset class. However, the futures hype may have also caused significant changes in Bitcoin\u2019s valuation that crippled some of the public enthusiasm over crypto in subsequent months.The Real Reason Bitcoin\u2019s Price Lost Half of its\u00a0ValueAccording to CNBC:Bitcoin\u2019s drop following its peak near $20,000 was directly tied to the launch of a futures market, according to new research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve.\u201cThe rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence,\u201d four researchers say in the regional Fed bank\u2019s recent Economic Letter.The cryptocurrency\u2019s highest price lines up with the day the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, introduced bitcoin futures trading.Crypto market manipulation by big players seems to have been at work here with the mainstream suppression of Bitcoin hype, that was getting a bit out of control for the business model of more mainstream financial services.BloombergA Little Bit of\u00a0HistoryAccording to the paper, after Bitcoins launch in January 2009, the dollar price of a bitcoin remained under $1,150 until February 22, 2017, when it increased exponentially for about 10 months, as shown in Figure 1 (see above).This explosive growth ended on December 17, 2017, when bitcoin reached its peak price of $19,511. Notably these dynamics aren\u2019t driven by overall market fluctuations, as shown by comparison with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index.CME\u2019s Launch of Bitcoin Futures Coincides with the \u201cBitcoin Correction\u201dThe peak bitcoin price coincided with the day bitcoin futures started trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\u00a0(CME).2017 was the Year Cryptocurrencies Became MainstreamAfter that date, it was all downhill where Bitcoin historically performs more poorly at the start of the year, a trend seen in years past as well.The cryptocurrency rose more than 1,300% in 2017 as optimistic investors continued to bid up.Even though Bitcoin is not tied to any tangible assets, altcoins inspite of the price correction continue to grow as the top altcoins emerge with complex relationships to the markets, that fluctuate largely in accordance with Bitcoin\u2019s Price.With increased regulation and bigger players trading in crypto, the price stability (as opposed to early volatility) should increase, in theory.The paper continues, before December 2017, there was no market for bitcoin derivatives. This meant that it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline in bitcoin price. Such bets usually take the form of short selling, that is selling an asset before buying it, forward or future contracts, swaps, or a combination.Since the crypto singularity, Bitcoin\u2019s price appears to have stabilized around a price of $9,000.CryptoDailyBitcoin\u2019s \u201cSpeculative Betting\u201d and it\u2019s\u00a0EndThe one-sided \u201cspeculative demand\u201d of Bitcoin and self-fulfilling prophecies came to an end when the futures for bitcoin started trading on the CME on December 17.So while the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) had opened a futures market a week earlier on December 10, trading was thin until the CME joined the market. Thus here was finally a way to bet on Bitcoin without gambling with its digital store of value. Thus, this created a major price correction and a new trajectory of cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin Futures Ended the Crypto SingularitySo according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco then:The new investment opportunity led to a fall in demand in the spot bitcoin market and therefore a drop in price. With falling prices, pessimists started to make money on their bets, fueling further short selling and further downward pressure on\u00a0prices.6 months later, as of May, 2018\u00a0, the bitcoin price had not returned to its pre-futures peak.So for Bitcoin\u2019s fate as a store of value:Given that there is no actual asset that backs the value of Bitcoin [\u2026] what will eventually determine the \u201cfundamental\u201d price of Bitcoin is transactional demand relative to supply.Do you agree or disagree?", "responses": "26"}, {"title": "Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, and COO, Mate Tokay, Joined Azbit Advisory\u00a0Board", "author_name": "Azbit", "link": "https://medium.com/@Azbit_news/roger-ver-ceo-of-bitcoin-com-and-coo-mate-tokay-joined-azbit-advisory-board-6b2f7a2ac088?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 10, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "5.3K", "content": "Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, and COO, Mate Tokay, Joined Azbit Advisory\u00a0BoardAzbitBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 10, 2018Every CoinsBank Blockchain Cruise does not go without sensations, and the present is not an exception: right on board, in the middle of the Mediterranean, was made an announcement of the partnership between Azbit and Bitcoin.com.

The call that meant he wouldn\u2019t go to college.The call that meant he would parachute into enemy fire, hack foreign governments, hack our own computers. \u201cI\u2019ve done so many things,\u201d he once told me. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine.\u201dThe call from a three initial agency. More than one.We met at a dinner. We were both obsessed with hacking and the latest flaws in computer security. We ignored every else and spoke for three hours.And we haven\u2019t stopped talking since.I don\u2019t mean this to be conspiracy theory. There\u2019s already been rumors about \u201cfake news\u201d, election hacking, etc.There are bot armies. There are hackers taking down electric grids every day. Every company in the Fortune 500 is completely hacked. Your computer is hacked.I\u2019ve spent many years talking to people in the security space.The reality is: the war is on.And it\u2019s being fought with data. And it\u2019s being fought all over the world. And it\u2019s being fought every day.Not just on election systems. Or at big companies. But on your computer. And the war is not always being fought by the people you expect. The enemeies we were always trained to believe.Mr. X spent time in special forces. Was in every overseas battle. Has been involved in more news stories than he likes to admit.He\u2019s also built and sold two companies using his hacking abilities. He lives a good life now and doesn\u2019t want his voice e or identity to be revealed.So we distorted it for the podcast.I asked him, \u201cDo you still work for \u2018them\u2019 \u201c.He turned away and said, \u201cYou never stop working for them.\u201dThe goal of this isn\u2019t to scare people. Information is power.And this is some of what I\u2019ve learned from Mr. X.1. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A VOICE, YOU HAVE TO SPEAK\u201cIn the past, to go up against an institution, you need to be an institution.\u201d Mr. X said. \u201cNow more than ever, we need to stand up for what we believe in. We have these powerful, engaging tools to influence others, but we still leave it up to the powers that control us to influence us.If you believe something, share it.In other words, don\u2019t let the media \u201cprogram\u201d what you believe in. Don\u2019t let the online word \u201chack\u201d into your brain. They already know more about you than you know about yourself. And they use that knowledge against you 24 hours a day.If you want to have a voice, YOU HAVE TO SPEAK.2. POLICE YOURSELFWe were talking about computer security. He told me all the ways you could be hacked\u2026 that you would never think of.\u201cLet me ask you, when\u2019s the last time you updated your firmware on your router?\u201dI had no idea.\u201cIf I\u2019m going in, I\u2019m going through the router,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of the fortune 500 use the same router\u2026 So you either trust the government to police data OR you need to be that person.\u201dAnd that was just one weakness. Next time you are on your phone check out how many apps on your phone have permission to turn on your video camera and start recording and transmitting what they record without you being aware.Don\u2019t think they aren\u2019t doing it.3. HOW DID OSAMA BIN LADEN REALLY DIE?Was Osama Bin Laden really casually sleeping on the third floor of a building with no access out? Or was he a prisoner and we had lost our use for him?Mr. X: \u201che was our prisoner for years. Then we had no use for him.\u201dAlways question everything the media and the government tells us. Always be a skeptic in a world where it\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s benefit to tell you the truth.This is not conspiracy theory. The only truth is to trust the people you love. The people who love you.This doesn\u2019t mean be irrational or paranoid or come up with crazy theories.This means practice being a skeptic every day on every issue.Practice skepticism. Not paranoia.4. BE VULNERABLE TO GETTING SHUT DOWNI knew there were millions of questions I wanted to ask\u2026 but couldn\u2019t.I asked anyway.\u201cAre you still involved in the government?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t say that,\u201d he said.\u201cWell, which agency were you in?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d\u201cDo people know it?\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a well-known 3 letter agency.\u201dAsk. Get shut down. Ask again.When I do an interview, I don\u2019t want to harass people for an answer. But sometimes if you poke and prod from various directions while you build rapport, you can get the answer.Not this time.5. KNOW WHAT DRIVES YOUMr. X started hacking when he was in military school.Everything was regimented:wake upfirst messsolute the flaggo to classsecond messsecond classchange 15 minutesgo to sportsthird messafter third mess, 2 hours of study hall, one hour of free timego to sleepdo it all over againThe school is isolated. And the students can\u2019t leave campus.The only way Mr. X could talk to girls was if he found them online. \u201cWe were heavily confined,\u201d he said.But he kept hitting firewalls.So he started hacking. He learned everything he could. Not because he wanted to \u201cattack\u201d websites. But because he didn\u2019t want to be alone.Always let the prison walls around you create your opportunities.Censorship created his curiosity.What frustrates you that can kickstart your curiosity.6. LEARN YOUR PATTERNSMr. X helped find one of the most well known serial killers in recent years and put him behind bars for life.Mr. X was paid to find patterns. He watched terrorists. The example: \u201ca burn phone.\u201d This is what criminals use to cover their call history. They buy a cheap phone.

This was a typo in the formula only. M\u00b2 was used for all calculations denoted as M.BackgroundIn the 1980s, Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet, proposed a formula:the value of a telecommunications network is is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n\u00b2)Since its inception, \u201cMetcalfe\u2019s Law\u201d (M) as it is now known, has become an influential formula for studying network effects and valuing online networks.In 2015, Zhang et al. found that Facebook\u2019s revenue\u200a\u2014\u200aa proxy for its value\u200a\u2014\u200awas proportional to the square of its monthly active users (MAU). In fact, M best fit Facebook\u2019s value when compared with other similar laws (Sarnoff\u2019s, Zipf\u2019s, and Reed\u2019s). Zhang also found that M best fit Tencent\u2019s revenue\u200a\u2014\u200aTencent is China\u2019s largest social network. What\u2019s more, Zhang found that the growth trend of Tencent\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s MAU fit the netoid function first defined by Metcalfe in 2013 (more on this later).Building off this work, Ken Alabi applied this thinking to the blockchain and found that Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dash also fit M.Here, we\u2019ll look closely at Bitcoin and Ethereum and show just how closely M fits their respective prices in USD. We\u2019ll also examine modifications of M (M1-M3) and other competing laws, Sardoff\u2019s and Zipf\u2019s, to explore how well these fit prices compared with M. We\u2019ll also examine how daily transaction volume in USD\u200a\u2014\u200awhich we\u2019ll term V\u200a\u2014\u200acorrelates with prices since this measure is the denominator of NVT. Finally, we\u2019ll explore whether we can use M or its variants to generate a ratio similar to NVT.First, our formulas:Sardoff\u2019s Law\u00a0(S)Metcalfe\u2019s Law\u00a0(M)M1M2M3Zipf\u2019s LawN = # daily transactions (or # unique active addresses)S = current supplyBitcoinLet\u2019s start by looking at the Pearson correlation of these 6 formulas with the USD price of BTC.Because we have data on both transactions and unique active addresses for Bitcoin, we\u2019ll examine both. TX will be used to refer to formulas that use transactions and ADR addresses. Also note that we only have data for every other day as opposed to daily which may affect precision. Finally, we\u2019ve removed any early data points at which the USD price was $0.Table 1 displays the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of BTC\u2019s USD price with our formulas unadjusted (row 1), smoothed using 30-day backward-facing moving averages (row 2), or smoothed using 90-day backward-facing averages (row 3). Only our formulas are smoothed, price is not. Rows 4 to 6 measure the correlation of the natural log of USD price with the natural log of our formulas.Abbreviations: ln, natural log; MA, moving\u00a0averageAll formulas show near perfect correlation with BTC\u2019s USD price, particularly on a natural log scale. In any other field, such a correlation would be considered witchcraft. V, S, and M perform best across all rows. However, the difference in correlation between the formulas is so small, particularly on the natural log scale, that they can all effectively be considered equal.Now let\u2019s see what the data look like when using active addresses.Abbreviations: ln, natural log; MA, moving\u00a0averageUsing unique active addresses increases the correlation of our formulas with BTC\u2019s USD price. V still performs best on a non-log scale whereas S, M and M2 perform best on the natural log scale. As above however, the differences in correlations are so small they can effectively be considered equal.To illustrate the point of just how correlative these formulas are with BTC\u2019s USD price, we\u2019ll overlay the 30-day moving average of BTC USD with that of M2, both on the natural log scale. As seen below, they are nearly identical (note: M2 was chosen because it fits the price curve best and does so without having to adjust for scale).Abbreviations: LN, natural log; MA, moving\u00a0averageNow let\u2019s look at Ethereum.EthereumOnce again we\u2019ll look at the Pearson correlation of these 6 formulas with the USD price of ETH. However, because etherscan does not have data on unique active addresses, we\u2019re forced to rely only on the number of daily transactions as a proxy for network usage. As above, we\u2019ve removed any early data points at which the USD price was $0.Compared with BTC, our formulas show very strong correlation with ETH USD when using transactions even on a non-log scale. This may indicate that these formulas lose some correlative strength over time (we have nearly 8 years of data on BTC vs. <3 years on ETH) or it may suggest that there are features unique to BTC transactions such that active addresses is a better measure of network usage (more on this here).For ETH, V, S and Z show the best overall performance. However, as with BTC, the difference in correlation between the formulas is so small that they can effectively be considered equal.Once again we\u2019ll overlay the charts of M2 with USD price using log-transformed 30-day moving averages.Abbreviations: LN, natural log; MA, moving\u00a0averageRatio Analysis\u00a0(NVT)Given that price correlates so closely with transactions (or active addresses), we can question what current network usage suggests about current price. To do so we will compute a Price-to-Metcalfe Ratio (PMR). Stephen Powaga of ETF Momentum Investing suggests that such a ratio may be somewhat analogous to a price-to-book ratio in equity analysis.The idea here is to study the relationship between the price (or value) of a cryptoasset and its fundamentals (as suggested by network usage). This type of ratio analysis is gaining popularity with Network Value-to-Transactions (NVT) being the most widely studied. For a background on NVT please see recent articles on rethinking NVT by Dmitry Kalichkin and a further expansion of its use as a trading signal by Willy Woo.Let\u2019s start by looking at NVT and defining its formula:Kalichkin\u2019s recent revision uses a 90-day backward-facing moving average (previous versions used a 14-day backward-facing and 14-day forward-facing moving average).While data on daily market capitalization of cryptoassets is easily obtained, both etherscan.io and blockchain.info have this for example, daily transaction volume in USD is not readily available. Coinmetrics.io has this data freely available for both ETH and BTC but they acknowledge some difficulty in estimating it here. What\u2019s more, other researchers calculate it differently as Willy Woo explains here. This underscores one of the potential limitations of NVT: obtaining reliable data.Bitcoin (NVT)Below is a chart of the natural log of BTC\u2019s USD price against its revised NVT ratio.Abbreviations: LN, natural log; MA, moving\u00a0averageAt the \u201cyellow zone\u201d line that Kalichkin suggests (at an NVT of 20) we can see a few areas where NVT may have been useful in predicting major corrections\u2014 moments in time where the price of USD far exceeded its underlying fundamental value as determined by USD transaction volume and resulted in a rapid downward correction.Ethereum (NVT)Applying NVT to ETH, the metric is less convincing but still appears useful. The NVT of ETH throughout its early history pre-2017 was in the hundreds and therefore way above our threshold of 20. Zeroing in on 2017 and beyond however, we see a couple spots where NVT may have helped predict corrections when using a threshold of 20.This is probably a good time to mention that barring formal research the choice of cutoff is somewhat arbitrary, so it\u2019s possible that different assets may benefit from slightly different cutoffs or that more optimal thresholds may be later identified.Limitations of\u00a0NVTAbbreviations: LN, natural log; MA, moving\u00a0averageWhile NVT appears to be a useful metric for predicting major corrections, it does feel like there\u2019s room for improvement.NVT is limited by the fact that on-chain USD transaction volumes are difficult to calculate and different approaches at calculating NVT\u2019s denominator can lead to slightly different conclusions. The other issues is that the numerator and denominator are both a function of the USD price of a cryptoasset. It\u2019s typically not good practice to rely on a predictive ratio that includes what you\u2019re ultimately trying to predict in both its numerator and denominator.That brings us back to Metcalfe and its variations. We\u2019ve already seen that i) these formulas are slightly more correlative than transaction volume, at least on a natural log scale for BTC, ii) they are simpler metrics that rely on data easily obtained from blockchain.info and etherscan.io (in the case of Bitcoin, we can use active addresses and move away from transactions and its limitations), and iii) they are not a function of the USD price.Price-to-Metcalfe Ratio\u00a0(PMR)So what would a PMR look like?To be honest, this is where things got a bit experimental as we relied largely on trial and error rather than formal testing. While we ended up identifying an interesting metric, more formal research may arrive at an even better metric.Given how well our formulas correlated with price on a natural log scale, we decided to focus on log-transformed data and ultimately arrived at the following:To clarify the above, when we say 30-day moving average of M2, we first take the 30-day backward-facing moving average of unique active addresses (or transactions for Ethereum) and then use those values for our daily M2 calculation. 60- or 90-day moving averages could also be used and perform similarly (they are a bit less sensitive but potentially slightly more predictive). And as described above, M2 correlates highly with USD price on a natural log scale and amazingly fits on the same scale as the log-transformed USD price without any additional adjustment.Let\u2019s see how PMR fits with Bitcoin.Bitcoin (PMR)Abbreviations: LN, natural log; MA, moving\u00a0averageAt first glance, we have what appears to be a rather strong leading indicator that accurately predicted 3 of bitcoin\u2019s largest corrections when using a PMR of 1.0 as the cutoff. Using a PMR of -1.25 we can also identify potential accumulation zones.One specific point to highlight is the recent correction we just experienced in early 2018. Bitcoin shot well above a PMR of 1.0, reaching as high as 1.5, before correcting. What\u2019s interesting here is that even after its rebound, it\u2019s still dangerously close to a PMR of 1.0, which is in stark contrast to its NVT. Something worth monitoring.Now let\u2019s turn to Ethereum.Abbreviations: LN, natural log; MA, moving\u00a0averageAs with Bitcoin, a PMR of 1.0 accurately predicted 4 of ETH\u2019s major corrections while a PMR of -0.25 appears to identify strong buying opportunities.Also of note is that PMR did not predict the most recent correction in early 2018\u200a\u2014\u200ain fact, according to PMR, ETH is currently in a strong buy zone. Does this mean that PMR failed? No. We believe the reason for ETH\u2019s crash was Bitcoin\u2019s over-inflated NVT and PMR\u200a\u2014\u200aboth of which indicated that Bitcoin was due for a major correction. And because Bitcoin is the dominant cryptoasset, when it corrects, the entire market tends to move with it.Limitations of PMRDespite the fact that PMR appears to offer some advantages vs. NVT, it\u2019s not without its limitations.We can\u2019t explain why M2 works as well as it does or where it came from.Because PMR relies on transactions or unique active addresses, it cannot capture off-chain transactions. Off-chain solutions like Lightning Network, Raiden, other side chain or state channel scaling solutions that move transactions off the main chain may reduce the predictive power of M2 and its variants over time. Similarly, some proportion of transactions reflects exchanges moving money around (in terms of USD volume this may represent a decent chunk of total volume but in terms of raw numbers of transactions, it may be less an issue).In the case of Ethereum, ERC-20 transactions now represent upwards of one third of all on-chain transactions. Because ERC-20 transactions do not directly relate to trading of ETH, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll need to discount transactions in the future by some function to account for the rise in non-ETH transactions. Similarly, as dapps begin to launch and Ethereum sees increased non-speculative usage, further discounting may be needed. On the other hand, perhaps this increased usage will not affect M2\u2019s correlative power. Time will tell.Because of these limitations, we believe that both NVT and some variant of PMR will be useful metrics moving forward.ConclusionsThere is no single indicator that can accurately predict the price of a speculative asset like ETH or BTC as there are too many variables to consider; however, if we accept the premise that blockchain networks that are predominantly in the speculative stages of adoption behave like online telecommunications networks, then Metcalfe may help us to better understand where usage and price intersect and when one has significantly outpaced the other.Whether this continues to hold true is difficult to predict, particularly as networks such as Ethereum begin to see usage beyond speculation. During these early speculative stages, however, the number of transactions or number of unique active addresses likely serves as a close proxy for demand.Ken Alabi addresses this nicely in his paper:Due to the fact that the assets we consider have very little actual use currently\u200a\u2014\u200athey are not really used much as a transactional medium for payment systems, nor even significantly as a payment rail\u200a\u2014\u200ait may be reasonable to interpret their adoption to be based on their perceived future potential. If that potential or value proposition is presented to a selected number of people, the expectation is that the same ratio in that set would convert into acquiring the assets. That group would then communicate that same value proposition to their own social network of friends and acquaintances, and on. Therefore, the basic adoption process might not be very dissimilar from that of a social network.Indeed, when prices rise, demand rises and when prices drop, so too does demand. Price and usage therefore share a symbiotic relationship such that neither can be used to predict one without the other, but what PMR and NVT are likely telling us is that there is a threshold to the extent that one may outpace the other and that reversion to the mean will eventually take place.Kalichkin refers to this concept as reflexivity.Taken in context with other indicators and external factors, both NVT and some variation of PMR may serve as useful additions to the conscious investor\u2019s toolkit. We caution however that thresholds should not serve as markers for immediate action. Instead, we would suggest a conservative approach: when an asset crosses above an upper threshold one could cease buying (as opposed to selling in hopes of timing the top and re-buying at a lower cost) and when an asset crosses a lower threshold one could start buying. The former suggestion is important because our charts show that a cryptoasset may continue rising in price after an upper threshold is breached and may even remain valued at a higher price even after a correction. In other words, it\u2019s difficult to perfectly time the top.Future WorkKen Alabi\u2019s paper suggests a new formula for valuing blockchain networks derived from Metcalfe. It is a more complex function that requires curve-fitting. Future work might involve fitting this function and comparing its performance to our variants tested here.Ken Alabi\u2019s revised model for network\u00a0valueMr. Alabi\u2019s paper also details a model for predicting future growth of a network\u200a\u2014\u200athe netoid function. As with Alabi\u2019s value function, application of this growth function requires curve-fitting. Using the netoid function, Alabi predicted that Bitcoin would reach its maximum growth rate in October of 2017 and that Ethereum would reach its sometime in 2018. The netoid function for these networks should be re-fitted based on recent data.If such a function is a useful predictor of future growth (in terms of transactions or active addresses) then it follows that it may be an accurate predictor of price given how well price correlates with network usage. This could make it a very powerful tool for speculation.Of course, for this to be true, we need to make some assumptions and assert some precautions. For starters, this would require that Metcalfe and its variants continue to maintain their correlative power which might be problematic (see \u201cLimitations of PMR\u201d above). Second, no model of growth can account for external events. A black swan event or the rapid rise of a superior cryptoasset competitor could see network usage dramatically shift in ways that cannot be modeled.As Alabi writes:In as much as the value of the network correlates with the number of users actively participating in it, that value can also prove to be as fleeting as the ease with which those users can move to a different network or cease to participate. The idea behind some of the assets designated for use on the networks studied here is one of fungibility. That fungibility also means that users can create new addresses on different networks and move their assets there easily, or simply just pull their assets out. In short, the ease with which users can move from the blockchain networks of the types studied here exceeds that of networks such as social media, where the user may have cherished items including pictures, conversations, social contacts, and other historical items that may not be as easy to move.We however disagree with Alabi\u2019s assertion that users will readily move between different blockchain networks\u200a\u2014\u200aat least more readily than between social media networks. As blockchain protocols grow and capture significant network effects, particularly through mainstream dapps built on top of their protocols, users will naturally become more vested within the network and its ecosystem making it harder to exit. Social circles are also generated both online and in meatspace which further constrains individuals to their respective blockchains.Finally, future work is needed to formally test PMR, its thresholds, and its variants.\u2014 panek (follow me on Twitter here or email us at clearblocksconsulting@gmail.com)Thanks to Kevin for insights and inspiration for this article.Want to see more content from us?ETH: 0x48324F360fc691Ed3849FfeF0c5778789C3A7f84BTC: 3D7fNUpNtRcXrYubCasntr1HAvRjXVUgf7", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "The Problem With Bitcoin Is\u00a0You", "author_name": "Laura Hackle", "link": "https://medium.com/the-crypto-times/https-medium-com-laurahackle-the-problem-with-bitcoin-is-you-8a73aafc6f22?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 3, 2018", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "3.2K", "content": "Photo by Icons8 team on\u00a0UnsplashThe Problem With Bitcoin Is\u00a0YouLaura HackleBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 3, 2018", "responses": "15"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Bitxoxo", "link": "https://medium.com/@bitxoxobitcoin/interesting-facts-about-bitcoin-86b8b8c4ba8e?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 6, 2018", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "770", "content": "BitxoxoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 6, 2018Interesting Facts About BitcoinThe term Bitcoin has started getting into people attention with its soaring price in the year 2017.

The digital currency can be stored in wallets and used to buy and sell products and services. The payments are secure and do not have the interference of the third party. Bitcoin has risen very fast in a year from $700-$8,500.The first transaction took place between Satoshi and Hal Finney in 2009 and in 2010 the person named Laszlo Hanyec bought pizzas and coke for 10,000 bitcoins that have the worth of million dollars now.Bitcoins are limited in number and gradually approaching to 21 million total coins. While the bitcoin mining is getting tough and complicated with every passing day. The transactions are highly secured and privacy of your transaction and individual identity cannot be revealed. The bitcoin address is made up of random and unique 34 alphanumeric characters.The bitcoin transaction is irreversible and cannot be reversed once initiated or processed from one end.

But like every good thing comes with both good and bad aspects. Bitcoin also has safety and security measures to be followed that cannot be ignored.Adopt below-given safety tips to secure your Bitcoins:Hardware WalletsAlways make sure to use hardware wallet for the security of your bitcoins. There are multiple types of hardware wallets available in the market but recommended hardware wallet is the Trezor. It keeps your private key private and secure from any theft and ill activity.Store Private Key OfflineTo ensure or raise your safety bars always keep your private key offline, in a computer which is not connected with internet. When you need to make transaction use your USB stick to take your key and connect to the internet to complete the transaction. Once completed disconnect and keep it back safe for the protection of your wallet.Dedicated HardwareMake use of single USB key to perform the task like moving data from online to offline computer. Using dedicated hardware can minimize the chances of and harmful viruses and web hack.Best USB DriveUsing best USB drive can increase your chances of bitcoin security. If you are looking for one, we will suggest you go for Linux it is the best-reviewed USB drive in the market for transferring data and information from an online computer to offline computer.Store in Cold and Hot WalletsStoring your bitcoins in a hot or cold wallet is your choice. People usually get attracted towards the online wallets which are also known as a hot wallet, because they find it easy from making the transaction and operating their business online well.But if you have a bulk of bitcoins are really looking out for safety measure than separate your Bitcoin. Divide them into both hot and cold wallets for more safety and security.

(1 BTC > $10,000) Bitcoin Cash investors should be celebrating too, because BCH has actually been a better investment over the past 3 months, with a 400%+ ROI.Nowadays you have these \u201cDigital Cash\u201d vs \u201cDigital Gold\u201d comparisons and discussions, but it\u2019s a false dichotomy. The reason why Bitcoin Cash exists is that some people in Bitcoin Core convinced themselves and others that \u201cBitcoin can\u2019t scale\u201d\u2026 and that there has to be \u201ctrade offs\u201d.I think this is a HUGE mistake and ultimately will result in Bitcoin Cash being the more useful and valuable coin, as I will explain.The Scaling Debate Has Become an Insane, Sad\u00a0JokeIf you\u2019re not familiar with the \u201cBitcoin Scaling Debate\u201d, it has to do with the size of the \u201cblocks\u201d. In BTC, you get one 1MB block every 10 minutes, which allows 2\u20133 transactions per second.This is not very much. So, it is no wonder that transaction fees have gotten huge while confirmation times have gotten long. The network is congested as users are all trying to compete to get their transactions in.Paying large fees was never what Bitcoin was about, and certainly doesn\u2019t make Bitcoin valuable. The dumbest part is that right now, blocks 1000 times bigger are being tested as safe.But never mind 1000 times\u200a\u2014\u200athe Core group fought tooth and nail to prevent even 2MB!In addition to the gigablock testnet project that\u2019s proving we can have 1GB blocks, I also noticed that home users have access to gigabit Internet speeds today.Technology is Only Getting Better and\u00a0Faster.So, why does Core developer Greg Maxwell say that \u201cThere\u2019s an inherent trade-off between scale and decentralization when you talk about transactions on the network\u201d.Maybe he\u2019s right, but this so-called \u201ctrade-off\u201d probably starts happening with blocks measured in the gigabytes, or 1000 times more transactions than we have today.1000 times more.The 1980s Are Calling. They Want Their 1MB\u00a0Back.1MB is a ridiculously tiny amount of data, and nothing less than absurd in 2018. Heck, the other day, I downloaded a 100 MB file in about 8 seconds.In 1982, a 5.25 inch \u201cfloppy disk\u201d was a common storage medium and even that held more than 1MB.Certain core developers (and their supporters) use sophistry and try to intellectually belittle those who question them. \u201cIf you can\u2019t dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit\u201d is the order of the day.They\u2019ve Convinced Themselves the Trade-off is\u00a0Real.A great many people have been bamboozled into believing that Bitcoin can\u2019t be both a great payment system and a great store of value, when in fact, most earlier Bitcoiners understood it to be both. And this is the very reason why people were so excited about Bitcoin in the early days and why it got to where it is today.For example, the first Bitcoin lead developer (after Satoshi), Gavin Andresen:Having convinced themselves and others that Bitcoin is going to be slow and expensive to use with a limited transaction capacity, the next mental gymnastics maneuver is believing that Bitcoin was never really supposed to be a payment system in the first place.\u201cWe already have instant transactions with credit cards\u201d, they rationalize. \u201cIt\u2019s digital gold! It\u2019s a store of value! That\u2019s the main use-case.\u201dSour GrapesThis is like the famous Aesop\u2019s fable \u201cThe Fox and the Grapes\u201d. The Fox, unable to reach the grapes high on the vine, tells himself \u201cI didn\u2019t really want them. They were sour anyway.\u201dCan Bitcoin Be a Great Store of Value Even if Its Not a Great Payment\u00a0System?To be honest, not long ago I would have said \u201cNo. Without the underlying payment system its just a greater fool\u2019s game.\u201dHowever, I realize that Bitcoin still has some utility as a payment system, even if it is poor. And the reality is that Bitcoin can be a great store of value (an appreciating asset) as long as people believe it and invest in it.The more people that do so, the stronger the network effect. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now with $10K BTC.Bitcoin Faces Huge Competition from Bitcoin\u00a0CashAfter 4 years of stalling, lies, censorship, and other nonsense, the Bitcoin community who really understood that Bitcoin was meant to be a Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System decided they had enough, and created Bitcoin Cash.Bitcoin Cash immediately raised the blocksize and re-aligned itself with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original roadmap and vision.So here we are.Perhaps Bitcoin will fill the niche of \u201cstore of value\u201d while Bitcoin Cash fills the niche of \u201cpayment currency\u201d. But here\u2019s the problem for Bitcoin: While it has a huge network effect advantage right now, it\u2019s potentially on unstable ground, fundamentally speaking.A globally used currency and a globally used \u2018digital asset investment\u2019 are completely different things, and I believe that they have quite different network effects.What is The Network\u00a0Effect?Network Effect is a principle that states that the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.An obvious example is Facebook. It\u2019s one of the biggest and most successful companies in the world because it\u2019s THE place to go to for social networking. Everyone\u2019s on FB, and competitors have an incredibly hard time gaining the critical mass of users required to create something that has a similar experience.Four Reasons Why a Global Currency Has a Stronger Network Effect Than a Global \u2018Store of\u00a0Value\u20191. Currency is more essential than investing.The first thing to ask when assessing the strength of a network effect is: \u201cHow essential is the main function?\u201d Almost everyone has to use money, so a payment system/currency is one of the most essential functions possible.Similarly, the network effect of language in society is extremely strong, since almost everyone has to speak and communicate.By contrast, investing is non essential to much of the world. Large segments of the population do not have disposable income (or even a bank account), and others may choose not to actively invest at various times for various reasons.2. Alternative investments are more accessible than alternative payment methods.If you think about it, there\u2019s not that many different ways we pay for things. Physical cash, check, money order, wire, Visa/Mastercard, and maybe a few others.Yet there\u2019s endless ways to invest money. From the thousands of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, to precious metals, real estate and cryptocurrency\u2026 it\u2019s quite a long list.Sure, you can say \u201cthere\u2019s only 1 Bitcoin\u201d, but there\u2019s many, many other cryptocoins with substantial marketcaps. And, it is easy to trade one crypto asset for another and to re-balance one\u2019s portfolio at any time.Many investors have switched from Bitcoin to Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, or Bitcoin Cash at various times, and will continue to do that.Payment systems and currencies are a lot harder. Here in the USA, you pretty much pay with US dollars or go home. A \u2018minority option\u2019 is difficult to use. That\u2019s the network effect here.And if Bitcoin Cash is able to get enough traction as a widely accepted payment system, it is going to be incredibly strong.3. Investment options have more competition than payment options.Another related aspect (apart from the choice of consumers) is: how easy is it for competition to spring up? As I mentioned, a payment currency has a very strong network effect that is hard to unseat.But investment vehicles are easy. Sure, there is still the network effect at work where Bitcoin is the largest and has momentum, but we see other coins pop up all the time, get some hype, and just take off out of nowhere.4. An investment vehicle can \u2018bleed\u2019 users much more easily than an established currency.Using the US dollar again as an example, its pretty hard for an American to just stop using it (even if you hate it). But its really easy to change what you invest in. Stated another way, Bitcoin might have a huge network effect that draws investors in, but its no problem to leave if you want.To add to this, we should consider why Bitcoin has the network effect it does. It used to be because it was also a great payment system. But if you take that away and you\u2019re just left with \u201cwell, because everyone believes it\u201d, you\u2019re on shaky ground.What if everyone stops believing it? What if there\u2019s a bear market? What if sentiment changes? What if the news cycles start putting out negative vibes? What if some really influential people stop backing it? What if the Core developers themselves stop promoting it?If the network effect depends so much on faith and belief, it definitely seems a lot weaker than something based on commerce and business activity.Don\u2019t Worry, Bitcoin Isn\u2019t\u00a0DeadI doubt Bitcoin is going anywhere, anytime soon. It will likely continue to appreciate as a digital asset, and may even appreciate greatly.However, I believe that Bitcoin Cash offers a risk reward proposition that is far superior.", "responses": "37"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "David Gilbertson", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/cardano-ada-better-than-bitcoin-but-can-it-be-best-adbdf9f0eb7a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 8, 2018", "readtime": "12 min read", "upvotes": "2.7K", "content": "Crypto adventures\u200a\u2014\u200aweek 15 (previous weeks)Cardano (ADA)\u200a\u2014\u200abetter than Bitcoin, but can it be\u00a0best?David GilbertsonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 8, 2018This week, I say good things about Cardano, ponder preferred realities and think about a nicer Twitter.But first\u00a0\u2026The profit\u00a0check-inLast week I was down 20%, now I\u2019m only down 10%.I\u2019ve doubled my money!Cardano (ADA)Ouroboros, doing it wrong.

People are wondering whether Ethereum could be Bitcoin 2.0, like Facebook versus Myspace, or VHS to Bitcoin\u2019s Betamax.Others have stated that Ethereum is carving out its own space entirely, calling it the oil to Bitcoin\u2019s gold.I don\u2019t share either opinion. In my view, Ethereum is in direct competition with Bitcoin, and going forward it\u2019ll most likely lose market share against it.On March 18 I took a first ETH/BTC short position. I got stopped out, after which I suspected a double top and I initiated a new short position:In this article I explain why I have a bearish outlook on Ethereum\u2019s token $ETH, certainly when expressed in Bitcoin terms. I don\u2019t claim omniscience and I of course could be wrong. Still, I think the following list gives voice to substantially under-appreciated concerns about the Ethereum cryptocurrency and ecosystem.If after reading this article you feel inclined to also short ETH/BTC, I suggest keeping in mind the following:Professional traders risk less than 1% of their capital in a trade, 2% in a maximum commitment. This is also my personal rule of thumb.Trading positions can only be held by an exchange, which means you will be subject to (significant) risk of loss of funds in case of a hack.A number of smart people are ETH-bullish\u2014I suggest studying their arguments, maybe even their direct criticism of this article.Even if my analysis is correct, I could still lose money on my trade: markets can stay irrational longer than we can stay solvent.Alright, let us dive in\u200a\u2014\u200afirst with an overview of the appeal of Ethereum, then with a criticism of its main selling point: flexibility.Ethereum\u2019s ambitionThe idea behind Ethereum is to move way past digital cash that simply registers transactions in an immutable ledger, such as is the case with Bitcoin. Ethereum\u2019s vision is to build a Virtual Machine, a cloud based decentralized computer. Interfacing with that machine, people can then create strings of code called \u201csmart contracts\u201d or \u201cdecentralized applications\u201d and publish these on the Ethereum network. In exchange for a fee, the network will then execute the code for anyone calling on it.After Gavin Wood published his Ethereum Yellow Paper, lot of enthusiasm ensued, and programmers started discussing and developing ideas such as a decentralized airbnb, decentralized prediction markets, a decentralized gold exchange, a decentralized hedge fund, and so on. Ethereum\u2019s programming language is simple to learn and young developers jumped on the opportunity to create decentralized applications (\u2018dapps\u2019). So far there are 298 such dapps listed.Sounds great, right? An all-in-one decentralized financial system with its own native currency, greater functionality than Bitcoin, and much easier to code applications for. Truly a \u2018Bitcoin 2.0\u2019.However, I think there\u2019s a catch. Having followed the project since inception, I\u2019m concerned that a number of risks and fundamental issues are being overlooked in bootstrapping this ambitious project. I think the project at least needs to undergo a big overhaul, and at worst needs to be abandoned entirely, to prevent more intellectual and financial capital to be wasted in the pursuit of impossible goals.(Here is probably a good place to acknowledge that I\u2019m not a computer scientist nor even a coder. I hope to compensate for that by linking back to sufficiently technically credible sources.)Computer network trade-offsImagine a network of computers, from bottom to top: the hardware, the energy needed to run the processors, the operating system, and the protocols that coordinate the data exchange. No matter which configuration you choose, there will be a trade off between cost, security, speed, and flexibility.Bitcoin\u2019s core protocol does everything to maximize security so that it can be used as \u2018digital gold\u2019, a decentralized store of value. Therefore it operates at a fairly high cost, while generating low speed, low flexibility transactions. Indeed, it doesn\u2019t acquire new functionality quickly\u2014as illustrated by the many failed colored coin projects. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that lower cost, higher speed, and high flexibility are impossible, but just that those things have to be built on other protocol layers on top of the Bitcoin module: layers such as the lightning network and sidechains.Ethereum has a different approach. It prioritizes flexibility and, I argue, compromises on security, speed, and even cost\u00a0.Let\u2019s go over each of these computer network categories one by one.FlexibilityThe Bitcoin \u2018digital cash\u2019 core protocol is a stern and barren environment. Its primary client is called Bitcoin Core, which runs on the C++ programming language. C++ is known for its precision in allocating memory and high speed, and for its steep learning curve. For constructing new transaction-commands, Bitcoin uses a scripting system: there\u2019s a list of less than 70 precise commands that can be executed at the core protocol level. Bitcoin smart contracts have been part of the roadmap since Satoshi, and a lot of thinking has gone into the limitations required to maintain consistency with the security confines of the Nakamoto framework.Ethereum is founded with different ambitions in mind. The Ethereum Homestead Guide, written mostly by Ethereum Foundation hired developers, states, \u201c\u2026unlike the Bitcoin protocol, Ethereum was designed to be adaptable and flexible.\u201dThe way Ethereum creates this adaptability and flexibility is in four ways: radical openness, multiple implementations, multiple contract specification languages, and institutionally endorsed hard-forks.First, the founders chose the opposite approach from Bitcoin\u2019s scripting system by pursuing Turing Completeness; in other words, by setting absolutely no restrictions on which type of code can be published and executed on the blockchain. In the words of Vitalik Buterin, \u201cInstead of having a protocol with lots of features, what you have is a protocol with a built in programming language, and then you can write whatever features you want on top.\u201dThe challenge here is that flexibility comes with a large attack surface. Ethereum code published on the blockchain can contain unintentional loopholes and other vulnerabilities. If any code can be embedded in Ethereum, so can code that is intentionally designed to crash the Ethereum software. We saw this exact scenario play out on September 18, when a specific smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain caused most geth and parity client nodes to crash at once, after which the hash rate dropped by 12%. Another such attack happened a few days later, on September 22nd, followed by more recent attacks which thwarted even the \u201ccome at me bro\u201d hotfix.The extreme openness of the Ethereum blockchain has been disapproved by several computer scientists and developers\u200a\u2014\u200acriticism that seems to have been validated by the recent client crashes:Secondly, the Ethereum developers created multiple interfaces to program and publish code on the blockchain, with the following motivation:Maintaining diversity in clients connecting to and running the Ethereum network forces the development and documentation of a cleaner protocol and enables increased robustness of the overall system: an issue with a single implementation will likely not take down the network assuming other implementations are unaffected.Ethereum Foundation director of technology Taylor Gerring adds:When a discrepancy occurs due to either human or computer languages, a roundtable of client developers can compare results and discuss the ramifications of a particular interpretation so as to determine a specific course of action.Today Ethereum features clients in different programming languages. While 90% of the nodes run on Geth, the Ethereum foundation also supports a python-based client and a C++ based client as official reference clients. There are currently also six active third party implementations.This strategy of supporting multiple implementations, rather than being a diversifying boon for the network, has been criticized as fundamentally undermining its goal of decentralized consensus:Even Satoshi Nakamoto was critical of multiple consensus implementations:I don\u2019t believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.For an in depth look into this issue, see the write up by Aaron van Wirdum: \u201cThe Long History and Disputed Desirability of Alternative Bitcoin Implementations.\u201d In it, Peter Todd argues that the September 18th Ethereum attack could have effectively resulted in an accidental split into two independently operating chains.Furthermore, in a recent article, Todd argues that Ethereum\u2019s multiple implementations do not make its network more reliable, because there exists no comprehensive protocol specification for those implementations to be based on. If we assume that geth, which recently had a 90% market share, is the de facto reference client, one could still argue that the other implementations form a serious distraction, and geth does not attract enough intellectual capital to make it an implementation that can compete with Bitcoin in terms of reliability. Gregory Maxwell points out that:\u2026In the last six months Bitcoin Core had 800 non-merge commits from 91 authors across 469 merges, while go-ethereum [geth] had 247 from 22 authors across 105 merges.Based on these numbers, one could say that Bitcoin displays four times as much activity and diversification compared to Ethereum.Furthermore, despite continuous cheers for the boons of diversification, the concerns about multiple implementations are not just theoretical musings. Ethereum\u2019s predecessor Mastercoin also had multiple implementations, causing numerous problems and leading them eventually to revert to a single reference implementation.It\u2019s my view that the multiplicity of implementations, in absence of a unambiguous specification, will lead to more problems down the road.A third way in which the Ethereum project has worked to adopt a flexible approach, is by supporting the creation of multiple contract specification languages (JS-esque Solidity, go-esque Mutan, python-esque Serpent,\u00a0\u2026).This \u2018shotgun approach\u2019 to protocol languages has not been universally lauded. One of the more popular Ethereum languages, for example, is Solidity. It was used to construct the now infamous TheDAO smart contract, a contract from which $50 million worth of ether was stolen (4.5% of the total supply at the time). Philipp Daian, Cornell graduate student under prof. Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, had the following to say in his post mortem analysis of TheDAO hack:I would lay at least 50% of the blame for this exploit squarely at the feet of the design of the Solidity language.\u00a0\u2026[T]he contract, even if coded using best practices and following the language documentation exactly, would have remained vulnerable to attack.Perhaps over time more and more bugs in Solidity and the other smart contract languages of Ethereum will be fixed.In comparison with the reinforced concrete of languages and implementations suitable for security, Ethereum\u2019s implementations and languages are weaker and more malleable\u200a\u2014\u200aone could compare it to straw. And of course, if you recommend entrepreneurs build houses with straw, you increase the risk of fire.It\u2019s important to mention that efforts are on the way to improve Ethereum smart contracts by working on better contract standards by means of formal verification. Though whether it\u2019s possible to formally verify the Casper protocol is still unclear.Finally, a fourth way in which Ethereum promotes adaptability and flexibility is by hard-forking the chain for security or scalability purposes.Simply put, a hard-fork is a change to the protocol that makes upgraded nodes incompatible with nodes running the older version of the software, and vice versa.Source: Bitcoin Developer GuideIn stark contrast to Bitcoin Core, which has never implemented such a drastic change to the code, most Ethereum developers see hard-forks as both an instrument for fixing undesirable features and acute problems with the network, as well as a legitimate tool with which to execute parts of the scalability roadmap.Core dev Vlad Zamfir said, \u201cI initially became a fan of protocol hard forks a long time ago, when I realized that they are a necessary part of the blockchain technology upgrade path.\u201dOf all its perceived sins against Satoshi\u2019s canon, Ethereum\u2019s pro hard-fork stance has probably garnered the most controversy\u200a\u2014\u200aI think for good reason. Here\u2019s a list of the criticisms against institutionally endorsed hard-forks that I agree with:Hard forks can result in two active, independent chains (which happened with Ethereum post TheDAO hard-fork). This introduces new security risks, political division, and consumer confusion.Institutional hard-forks destroy fungibility and annul settlement finality, which undermines Ethereum\u2019s status as a blockchain-based cryptocurrency as well as the autonomy of its users. The project\u2019s credibility has suffered too, as several key principles were violated.The Ethereum.org homepage, promising \u201cunstoppable applications\u201d without censorship or third party interference.Exchanges hate dealing with the risky repercussions of hard-forks.Institutional hard-forks open a political can of worms, leading to (in my opinion) an unstable and inevitably unfair system of lobbying and favoritism. Take for example the \u2018Buterin effect\u2019: when following the attack on TheDAO, Vitalik Buterin did not take a clear stance against a hard fork. People began to read between the lines of his statements (much like central banker tea leaf reading) and, probably correctly, assumed that he and the Ethereum Foundation were actually in favor. Supposedly the hard-fork was a decision by \u2018community consensus\u2019, even though voting on the issue only occurred during a 12 day window, during which owners of less than 6% of the Ether in circulation actually cast a vote.Institutionally endorsed hard-forks introduce legal risks for the core developers, which could endanger and discourage future development efforts. By supporting the hard-fork, core devs potentially \u2018prove\u2019 that they have the power to claw back funds, or fix other (perceived) unfairness on the network. As a result, they may be held liable in court by anyone who thinks they are a victim of some injustice (victims of theft, hackers, users of the old chain, FinCEN). One legal conflict-of-interest dance may have already begun, as Buterin, who was a trustee for The DAO, bought TheDAO tokens before the hard fork and then endorsed the new post hard-fork chain which re-allocated a large amount of DAO tokens, claiming community consensus. More legal issues could ensue based on the fiduciary obligations assumed by core devs Buterin and Zamfir over the funds transferred from The DAO into a trustee-like structure, or from the white hat attack group (consisting of several prominent Ethereum Foundation members) that tried to expropriate DAO tokens from the original attacker.Institutionally endorsed hard-forks are an unsustainable strategy to scale in the long term. Protocols are foundational layers on top of which infrastructure is built, and as an ecosystem grows, the vested infrastructure interests favor stability over predicted security or performance gains. Buterin agrees: \u201c\u2026hard forks will become technologically riskier and riskier over time and at some point assuming sufficient institutional adoption they just won\u2019t be available as an option anymore.\u201dIn conclusion, if Ethereum is to become the transaction ledger \u201cto securely execute a wide variety of services [\u2026] at the global level,\u201d then its contracts and programming language need to be sufficiently robust. The question remains whether the flexibility of the network is undermining this much needed robustness. I\u2019m afraid that it is.In closing part\u00a01In the forthcoming part 2 of this article, I plan to discuss three aspects of the Ethereum network: speed, cost, and security. I\u2019ll take a deeper look into the planned transition to a proof-of-stake protocol that uses sharding as strategy towards on-chain scalability. Meanwhile, I welcome comments and thoughts.I\u2019d like to thank Bryan Bishop, Christopher Allen, Pelle Braendgaard, MAbtc, and Jameson Lopp for reviewing a draft of this article. Of course, all errors remain my own.Disclaimer: Nothing contained in this article constitutes investment, accounting, tax or legal advice or a recommendation to buy, or sell any security or other investment, management product or service or pursue any investment strategy.Edits/corrections:Changed voting period on the hard-fork issue from 12 hours (source) to 12 days following comments from Vitalik Buterin.Removed \u201cSo can code that accidentally causes infinite loops\u201d. It\u2019s correct that in Ethereum infinite loops are extremely unlikely or even impossible due to the fact that writing to the blockchain costs gas.After consulting with a few people and studying the comments below (see also here) I decided to remove this passage: \u201cHowever, that could have sweeping repercussions for existing code. As remarked during a recent meeting of Bitcoin core devs, \u2018if you change something in Solidity, existing smart contracts might stop working.\u2019 \u201dNote (19 April 2017): I closed out the last tranche of this ETH/BTC short in December 2016 at around 0.008 BTC, turned out to be a profitable trade. So far I haven\u2019t written part 2, mainly because I\u2019ve been struggling to gather clear information about how Ethereum is going to scale. I did publish a new Ethereum article earlier this month: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about Bitcoin scaling, but I am losing sleep over Ethereum\u201d.", "responses": "48"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "StopAndDecrypt", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/thats-not-bitcoin-this-is-bitcoin-95f05a6fd6c2?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 27, 2017", "readtime": "14 min read", "upvotes": "3.2K", "content": "\u201cThat\u2019s not Bitcoin, this is\u00a0Bitcoin\u201d\u2026and some stuff about full\u00a0nodesStopAndDecryptBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 27, 2017IntroductionThis became much longer than I originally planned. It\u2019s all loosely strung together but there\u2019s a lot of information here that is definitely worth reading, especially if you\u2019re new to the community. Whether you already agree with me or not, I recommend reading this so you can pass it on to future members of the community. They are the most important ones that need to see everything I\u2019ve referenced below. Not us. Because this won\u2019t end. #NO2X\u201cI don\u2019t post on Reddit\u201d was my unofficial motto while browsing Reddit, until one day I was compelled into lecturing some person over why our grandmas won\u2019t be securing their own private keys.\u201cI don\u2019t post on Medium\u201d wasn\u2019t even a motto of mine. Developers post on Medium\u2026right? People \u2018involved\u2019 in this space post on Medium, and I\u2019m nobody\u2026right? I don\u2019t code, I don\u2019t have a name, I don\u2019t have a following, and I constantly make mistakes attempting to understand or explain the protocol to other people. I\u2019m just a user\u2026\u201cWait, hold on, what is he talking about? What is \u2018posting on Medium\u2019 even supposed to mean?\u201d -EveryoneYou\u2019re right. The fact that I\u2019m posting on Medium means nothing. It\u2019s just the name of a website, with features that allow me to represent myself in the way I wish to be represented in this moment. Therein lies the underlying topic at hand. I said \u201cMedium\u201d but what I meant was the avenue that Medium happens to provide for me at this moment.\u201cWhy is this significant? -Probably EveryoneAllow me to reiterate: I said Bitcoin, but what I meant was the avenue that the current state of the protocol many of us refer to as Bitcoin happens to provide for me\u2026as a user.We\u2019ll get back to that later. Anyway\u2026Bitcoin maximalists will say \u201cBitcoin only works if most people run full-nodes.\u201d It\u2019s a great endeavor, and I wish them the best of luck, but I personally don\u2019t see our grandmas running full-nodes. What percent of the total population are grandmas? By the time they\u2019re all running full-nodes we\u2019ll all be assimilated into the singularity running our spinal-tapped full-nodes over a wireless decentralized global Internet. Sounds like fun.Can you personally envision a world where most people run a full-node? Elaborate on the intricacies of your mother\u2019s day-to-day life while she runs a full-node. Tell me everything she did in a single day, and where was the full-node in these situations? Did she bring it with her to go shopping? What is \u201cmost people\u201d? 51% of 7 billion? 90%? Are we including children in the total percent? Does this, or does this not count all the automated robots that will be walking around with their own full-nodes built into their [bio?]mechanical bodies? The most plausible scenario for the near future circa the \u201cmass-adoption tipping-point\u201d is one on every persons phone. Is that really secure? Who\u2019s building those clients? Will Apple have their own built-in-walled-garden hardware version? Will they point all those built in clients to a seed node on their server? What implications would that have? Is it really even plausible?All of those questions are legitimate questions, but while they are legitimate, they are a distraction, because having as many full-nodes as possible is imperative to Bitcoin, and focusing on the numbers completely misses that point.Well, actually\u2026no it\u2019s not. It\u2019s imperative to me, it\u2019s imperative to most of community, and it\u2019s imperative to most of the developers paving the way for this technology right now. The Bitcoin doesn\u2019t care.Clearly it\u2019s not imperative to some people. Not to a select few developers, or to some of the people who invested early and already got rich, or those who happen to be successful at marketing themselves out to be important. It\u2019s also not imperative to the Ethereum community, but let\u2019s hold off on that until later\u2026See how they attempt to differentiate between full-nodes that mine and those that don\u2019t? Through misinformation, and use of the tactics I used in the earlier paragraph (asking legitimate, but redirecting questions), they\u2019ve been successful at garnering a following, and full-nodes are not imperative to that group that follows them either. We\u2019ve all heard the Satoshi datacenter quote ad-nauseam. Have you heard it yet?I\u2019m sorry, but Satoshi isn\u2019t a god, and nobody is perfect. It\u2019s easy to quote an individual for your cause when you know they can\u2019t clarify their opinions in an updated context. Satoshi didn\u2019t predict turning all nodes into a payment channel network (although he touched on the subject in correspondence with Mike Hearn). Every major cryptocurrency is adopting payment channel technology, but you still see these propaganda pushers try to knock down the technology in the name of The Bitcoin:Can anyone source this? I tried, I can\u2019t. Maybe it was paraphrased to fit 140 characters, maybe Vitalik said something else and Ver molded it into something he never even meant. Maybe Vitalik deleted it. Even if he did, maybe he changed his mind:Notice the dates on those posts? Roger Ver knows full well about the Raiden Network (Ethereum\u2019s Lightning Network) and Vitalik\u2019s support for it, yet he still uses quotes older than (presumably) 1.5 years ago, to instill this nonsense into the minds of the constantly growing set of new & uninformed people joining this community. This type of propaganda isn\u2019t going to go away. Did you notice the \u2018Pro Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019 tag I have for the user in the old Bitcoin-XT subreddit? Same campaign, different flag: Take control of the network. Take control of the name Bitcoin.This is an ongoing propaganda campaign that needs to constantly be shot down. New people coming into the community don\u2019t know the history, they don\u2019t know the ideology, and they don\u2019t know about the reoccurring tactics these groups use.Here\u2019s a great one from the famous \u201cI\u2019m Satoshi\u201d fraud:Like the caption says, he made that picture. He went on a Twitter spree that day with screenshots of random arbitrary charts, you can go look for yourself. Here\u2019s his Twitter, and here\u2019s an actual image of the current Satellite coverage Blockstream\u2019s satellite network has, that they just launched:Much different, specifically: This one wasn\u2019t hand drawn by a fraud to make it look like China was exclusively \u201cblocked\u201d, and permanently for that matter\u2026If they wanted no block-size they could\u2019ve went to Ethereum, if they don\u2019t care about the average users ability to run a node diminishing over time, they could go to Ethereum. Or they could go to Bitcoin Cash\u2026but somehow they still push SegWit2X after already getting their fork.ProTip: It\u2019s because they don\u2019t really want Bitcoin to succeed. They are dividing, and attempting to conquer.If you still for some reason want no limit to the block size, here\u2019s a real world example of a chain that doesn\u2019t have one. The Ethereum data directory size is growing exponentially for them because of the absent cap, but they just don\u2019t care, and that\u2019s totally fine because they aren\u2019t trying to hijack our system:For reference, here\u2019s the two links /u/senzheng provided: 1, 2.The issue is mentalities like these bleed over into the Bitcoin community and cause divides that lead to an obvious fallout: Chain splits, and the fight over the title of The Bitcoin.So what happens when there\u2019s an ideological split among the community? Other protocol implementations that are used to muddy the waters and sway public opinion are well known: block-size cap, total supply cap, miner version-bit signaling. What happens when a group of people decide that they want The Bitcoin to remove (not just increase) the \u201carbitrary\u201d limitation on block size? Is anyone for removing the 21 million coin cap? No? Don\u2019t be surprised when that becomes a target too. Ethereum already took both of those away\u2026How much weight do your ideologies really hold against the 7 billion people who have no idea what we\u2019re even talking about right now? 7 billion people who are easily influenced by misinformation. Are you prepared to publicly make the claim that 7 billion people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, and that they should be listening to you?So what exactly does the name \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 mean?What does it mean to be an American?\u200a\u2014\u200aScholastic\u201cIt is great to be an American. We get to play sports and eat lots of food. We get lots of toys, all because we are free\u200a\u2014\u200athe best thing of all.\u201d-Austin B., 11, WisconsinDo you think Austin knew about the USA Patriot Act that Congress signed into law less than a year from when Scholastic asked children to send their opinions in?Also notice how Austin said \u201cAmerica\u201d, but what he meant was the avenue that the current state of his country provides for him as a citizen to play sports and eat lots of food? Not really, but do you get the point?Sparing any 1984 analogies, what happens to the definition of America should sports and excess food no longer be an option for Austin? What happens to the title his ideology currently goes by? What will represent freedom in 500 years? What does it mean to be a Roman?This is what really drove me to Medium, because a Reddit response isn\u2019t sufficient enough to address these reoccurring debates that meddle with my ideology, in the name of The Bitcoin, which props up in a variety of ways from many different perspectives. Here\u2019s one:First and foremost let\u2019s actually address the technicalities of the above argument: Chain reorganizations are not protocol changes, and the phrase \u201clongest valid chain\u201d refers to the former, not the latter.Even then, the size of the \u2018difficulty sum\u2019 of all blocks in a chain determines validity in re-orgs, not block height:Using the \u2018LVC\u2019 argument to try and justify why the fork you\u2019re backing should/will hold the title of The Bitcoin is a fallacy akin to justifying why you skipped out on school today with the excuse \u201cI couldn\u2019t find my schoolbag\u201d, as if breaking your normal morning protocol somehow renders school itself useless:Bitcoin = [wake up\u2192shower\u2192grab schoolbag\u2192walk to school]*Queue the analogy Nazis.*\u201cI\u2019m glad we cleared all of that up, now I finally get it. So that\u2019s all, right? The longest chain measured by the sum of the difficulty of all the blocks is Bitcoin, correct?\u201d -BTC-101 Student / GMTH-203 StudentNope.See what I did there? I mirrored the response of someone who either didn\u2019t get the point (don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get there), or is ignoring it and just trying to leverage their argument for the fork of their choice with arbitrary technical merit. Yes, arbitrary technical merit. I could name some Core developers who wouldn\u2019t be too happy with that statement, despite the fact that I\u2019m on their side, but I don\u2019t care because it is arbitrary, given the overarching point.Let me make this clear: It doesn\u2019t matter what stance you take on any proposal, if you do this you either don\u2019t get it or you are being deceptive.In other words: Technicalities don\u2019t define The Bitcoin. Social consensus does, because language is an inherently social construct. Furthermore, my ideology doesn\u2019t define The Bitcoin either, because social consensus may not always align with what I currently want out of all of this, or my ideology might change in the future.This a blatant admission of my point about deceptive tactics. Using the block size to spur division among the community when the reality is they want to take control away from the developers. On top of all of this, Vinny is a proponent of Ethereum and the CEO & co-founder of a company with a token on the Ethereum network. Can you guess where his incentives align? Don\u2019t you think he would be better off if Ethereum was successful and the Bitcoin community was divided?To be fair, Vinny\u2019s response to that leaked email was to share more emails, here\u2019s an excerpt:So basically, he\u2019s still (or was in August) in support of SegWit2X going ahead with it\u2019s dead in the water chain split, because if Bitcoin works as planned, it won\u2019t matter\u2026While other companies continue to back out of the agreement they originally signed with the intent to keep everyone together, but now because of Bitcoin Cash, the whole agreement is moot.Tangentially, 1 CPU / 1 Vote was a phrase used when everyone actually mined with CPUs while running their nodes. Another famous Satoshi quote that can\u2019t be defended because he\u2019s effectively out of the equation. The entire environment is different now. How you can even justify using that line is beyond me when a single entity controls (conservative estimates) ~20+% of all the hashing power, continues to mine empty blocks but complain about not enough space, created Bitcoin Cash and forced the network to fork once already\u2026\u2026Moving on\u2026The following is an example of a person who gets it, but tries to leverage the technicalities of the protocol while ignoring the broader scope of the argument with Charlie. Deceptively conflating client reorganization with protocol change/upgrades, and claiming UASF\u2019s have no effect on The Network (see what I did there?) by using technicalities as leverage for their argument:Other Realities: Civil war, peaceful secession.Much further down this thread, after some work, this person admitted to not caring what the masses eventually called The Bitcoin, claiming it doesn\u2019t matter. It was the only thing we agreed on, and renders the whole conversation they had with Charlie moot, but readers don\u2019t know that if they don\u2019t follow through with the entire dialogue. The initial top level comment is all that matters because it gets the most visibility.To reiterate, chain reorganizations are not protocol changes, conflating the two for argumentative benefits is deceptive, and if you still don\u2019t get it here\u2019s a few examples:When Bitcoin activated SegWit, it was a protocol change, not a re-org.Bitcoin Cash was a protocol change, not a re-org.If Jeff Garzik\u2019s baby-child SegWit2x actually gets off the ground and forks away, it will be a protocol change, not a re-org.Ethereum was a protocol change (that happened to involve creating an entirely new transaction database)\u2026\u00a0\u2026not a re-org.\u201cRe-org-shme-org! SEMANTICS!\u201d -Craig Wright, Boy Genius / Not SatoshiNo, not really. Re-orgs happen all the time without any change to the protocol. It\u2019s a built in client mechanism that has nothing to do with upgrades, or claim to the title of The Bitcoin. The key is understanding that some protocol upgrades try to leverage re-orgs (soft-forks), while other protocol upgrades attempt to supersede re-orgs (hard-forks), and that neither of them are intrinsically bad for le Bitcoin, they just have their own use cases.Hopefully by now you\u2019re starting to catch on here. Protocol upgrades are inherently social in nature. The naming conventions assigned to those changes are also inherently social in nature. Re-orgs are inherently not social in nature, or whatever the silly term is for network logic. I could look it up, but not doing so helps drive the point even closer to home, it doesn\u2019t matter. Protocols don\u2019t evolve on their own, and a billion re-orgs wouldn\u2019t change a single line of code, so using it to justify your fork is a fallacy.So where am I really going with this all of\u00a0this?Well, for starters, if you share my ideology, you need to share this post. The community will keep growing until everyone is the community. Education will never end. You can\u2019t get frustrated, you need to learn how to properly source, reference posts & quotes, and ask the same basic thought provoking questions without being rude and saying/thinking \u201cnot this again\u201d. Everybody is new to the community at some point, and this won\u2019t end. Ever. Period. Will you tell your kids \u201cnot this again, just look at the github\u201d? No.I don\u2019t expect everyone to do this. I don\u2019t expect everyone to have the time or the energy. That\u2019s one of the reasons I put this post together and sourced a bunch of quotes from various members of the community. The least you could do is reference this when someone asks you \u201cwhat do you mean\u201d by misinformation and lies.Equally important, and the original underlying theme this post was supposed to have, is understanding that at some point, Bitcoin might not represent itself in a way that aligns with your ideology. If these misinformation tactics prove to be successful, they\u2019ll own the name Bitcoin. The developers are gone if that happens, they\u2019ve all been pretty vocal about it too, either by moving on to a different projecting or continuing to support the chain that wasn\u2019t stolen from us by the corporations, whatever name it winds up getting called (I\u2019ll be calling it Bitcoin).Screenshots courtesy of John Newbery, Bitcoin Dev:Reddit thread.Twitter chain.Bitcoin Core Blog Post.I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen if the network splits again, but I know that if we lose the name Bitcoin (because that\u2019s what this whole propaganda campaign is about) it won\u2019t be good. Maybe I\u2019m over concerned, maybe not. The only thing I can suggest is you take a look at what Bitcoin Cash\u2019s most prominent miner said about the recent chain BCash split:Bitcoin Cash is not BitcoinEngland = BitcoinAmerica = Bitcoin CashNow take a look at what Bitcoin Cash\u2019s most vocal user said about the recent chain split:Bitcoin Cash is BitcoinEngland = Bitcoin CashAmerica = ???Did that help clear things up for you? They can\u2019t even agree between themselves, because all they care about is stealing the name or dividing the community.#NO2XAddendum:I may try to format this article in the future for better flow. This was my first attempt to write something and I rushed it. It\u2019s become the beginning of what I hope to be a long series of articles related to Bitcoin politics and conceptual discussion. Craig Wright is a fraud.Twitter plug: https://twitter.com/StopAndDecrypt", "responses": "22"}, {"title": "Why Bitcoin is not trustless", "author_name": "Haseeb Qureshi", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-is-not-trustless-350ba0060fc9?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 18, 2017", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "2K", "content": "Why Bitcoin is not trustlessHaseeb QureshiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 18, 2017Cryptocurrencies have a trust problem.Blockchain evangelists claim that with the advent of Bitcoin, centralized authorities and financial institutions will soon become obsolete. Blockchain technology will run the world and corruption will be engineered out of existence. Society will become \u201ctrustless.\u201dIronically, the vast majority of people still don\u2019t trust cryptocurrencies.The evangelists claim those people don\u2019t understand the technical innovations behind blockchains. (As though a lecture on consensus protocols should be all it takes for someone to surrender their incredulity and their savings account.)There\u2019s a sleight of hand here: \u201cwith Bitcoin, you no longer need to trust any centralized entity or any counterparty. Therefore, Bitcoin is trustless.\u201d So because we don\u2019t need to trust banks or the person we\u2019re transacting with, there\u2019s no trust at all?In reality, not trusting Bitcoin is completely reasonable. Because Bitcoin is not trustless. In fact, Bitcoin requires far more trust than the US dollar.The key innovation of cryptocurrencies is that they decentralize trust. They do not eliminate it.There\u2019s no such thing as trustlessEverything requires trust. Aside from tautologies, it\u2019s impossible for you to verify anything without putting your trust somewhere.Take science for example.There\u2019s no central authority in science\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s all based on empirical observations, open publications, and decentralized peer review. Sounds kind of similar to the principles behind blockchains. So is it \u201ctrustless\u201d?In theory, maybe. But in practice, science is built on a mountain of trust.Consider the trust involved in reading about a single scientific study. If you take the study seriously, what are you trusting?First, you\u2019re trusting that the article you\u2019re reading accurately reports what the study actually says. You\u2019re trusting that the datasets and statistics are correct, because you\u2019re not re-running the regressions yourself. You\u2019re trusting that they didn\u2019t p-hack their way into statistical significance. You\u2019re trusting that there aren\u2019t more studies that show the exact opposite result, and that they weren\u2019t shoved away into a file drawer. You\u2019re trusting that the methodology is reproducible, and there\u2019s no contamination by something as simple as sex of the experimenters, or the fact that all of the subjects were undergraduates. You\u2019re trusting that the findings weren\u2019t motivated by industry funding, or by a professor who knows they need to produce a certain result to advance their career. And, of course, you\u2019re trusting that the researchers didn\u2019t just outright fabricate data.You trust science because you\u2019re delegating your trust to the decentralized process known as \u201cscientific consensus.\u201d This sometimes works out, but often it doesn\u2019t. Science is not trustless.But you are still are right to trust science. You don\u2019t trust science because it\u2019s decentralized or trustless or anything like that. You trust it because, despite all of its problems, science has worked. It\u2019s better than any other process we know of for advancing human knowledge. It worked damn hard for that trust, and now science holds significant sway in society.The trust we place in science is orthogonal to it being decentralized.So what about cryptocurrencies?The trust in cryptocurrenciesDecentralized cryptocurrencies imply you don\u2019t have to trust a central party. After all, the Bitcoin protocol dictates that every node stores a record of every transaction and double-checks everything themselves. No trust required\u200a\u2014\u200aright?Heat map of reachable Bitcoin nodes around the world (https://bitnodes.earn.com/)Nonsense. The trust is not gone, it\u2019s just distributed across more parties. So where is the trust now?It\u2019s pretty much everywhere.You are trusting the developers not to build buggy or insecure software. You are trusting the miners not to collude. If you don\u2019t run a full node (which you probably don\u2019t, there are only 10K Bitcoin full nodes in the world), then you\u2019re explicitly trusting any full node you happen to connect to. You are trusting the community not to hard-fork away from you. You are trusting nation-states and corporations not to shut down mining, or launch a 51% attack. You are trusting that markets are not being manipulated (or that if they are, they\u2019re being manipulated in your favor). You are trusting miners and bad actors not to frontrun you, or grief you, or attack the contracts you use. You are trusting your wallet software to generate cryptographically secure keys. You are trusting attackers not to split the network using BGP routing attacks. You are trusting exchanges to hold your assets and not get hacked, or not to hide it from you if they do. And, of course, you\u2019re trusting that however you\u2019re storing your cryptocurrencies, you don\u2019t get your credentials stolen.Sure, in a simplified adversarial model where you hand-wave away all the details, cryptocurrencies have elegant security properties. But in reality, there\u2019s a great ocean of trust that fills in all those gaps you waved away.Engineering is what fills those gaps. And solid engineering takes time. As in, more than a decade kind of time.Even still, 9 years after the creation of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have a lot of lingering unknowns. Do you trust that the consensus protocols are actually correct, and don\u2019t have any lurking major vulnerabilities? Do you trust fees won\u2019t just balloon to becoming unusable? Do you trust that cryptocurrencies won\u2019t just collapse under network congestion? Do you trust that quantum computers won\u2019t come along and break all the public-key cryptography? Do you trust that even if they do succeed, nation-states won\u2019t recognize the threat and immediately replicate their successes, except this time with the backing of geopolitical power?It should go without saying that the US dollar requires a lot less trust than Bitcoin. No one can break the US dollar, but a motivated nation-state or corporation could easily manipulate or destroy Bitcoin. They would probably face meager consequences for it.This is not to say that Bitcoin is fragile, or that you shouldn\u2019t use it. It\u2019s a beautiful protocol, and the first decentralized currency to ever solve the double spend problem.But engineering is all about tradeoffs. And cryptocurrencies make different tradeoffs than fiat currencies. Seldom is one system strictly better than another\u200a\u2014\u200amore often, it\u2019s a question of what strengths and weaknesses you choose.In principle, decentralization can lead to more robust systems. But it\u2019s obvious that Bitcoin has not yet accomplished that.Innovation requires\u00a0trustHere\u2019s the thing.Cryptocurrencies require lots of trust. And that\u2019s okay. Early on in any system\u2019s lifespan, of course it requires trust. It\u2019s an experiment. We\u2019re still in the early days.I believe cryptocurrencies are the future of finance. But if cryptocurrencies win, it won\u2019t be because they\u2019re \u201ctrustless.\u201d They\u2019re not. It\u2019ll be because they\u2019re better. They\u2019ll have to solve actual problems better than fiat currencies do.If cryptocurrencies win, it\u2019ll be because of their ease of performing micro and macro payments, their global availability, their faster clearing times, their cheaper fees, their immutability, their programmability, and their ability to disintermediate and automate costly financial relationships via smart contracts.For more of my thoughts on cryptocurrencies\u2019 improvements over fiat, see:We already know blockchain\u2019s killer appsIt wasn\u2019t too long ago that Silicon Valley scoffed at cryptocurrencies. All over coffee shops in Mountain View and\u2026hackernoon.comDecentralized protocols are wonderful and fascinating. But decentralization for its own sake doesn\u2019t get you anything. Trust is earned through years of good engineering, not through protocol design or elegant white papers.Despite all the mania of mainstream attention, cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy. Perhaps one day they\u2019ll be even more robust than fiat, but we\u2019ve got a ways to go.One thing is for sure: cryptocurrencies are already asking powerful questions about what money can be. Instead of being a contract between people and a nation-state, cryptocurrencies let us imagine: what if the monetary system were a community commons? Owned, managed, and governed by everyone?It\u2019s a radical idea, and one of the most fascinating financial innovations in the last 50 years. As far as ideas go, I think it\u2019s a pretty good one.But it\u2019s risky.Don\u2019t let anyone convince you it\u2019s not.\u2014Haseeb", "responses": "17"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "", "link": "https://medium.com/world-wi-fi-blog/world-wi-fi-at-bitcoin-russia-forum-daa531fab69?source=search_post", "post_date": "", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Bitcoin and Virtue Part 1:\u00a0Prudence", "author_name": "Jimmy Song", "link": "https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-and-virtue-part-1-prudence-78a7dfad0b33?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 19, 2017", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "2.2K", "content": "Bitcoin and Virtue Part 1:\u00a0PrudenceJimmy SongBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 19, 2017I\u2019ve been involved in Bitcoin one way or another for about 6 years now and it\u2019s never been lacking in drama. Exchange hacking, Darknet markets, Scaling debates, altcoins, ICOs and, of course, price volatility have all been a part of Bitcoin in that time and it\u2019s very easy to get caught up in any/all of those things without seeing the big picture. In this series, I hope to tell you why Bitcoin is good for the society at large and how I think Bitcoin, by acting as sound money, will change the world for the better.The main way I\u2019ll do that is by examining Bitcoin in relation to the classical cardinal virtues. In today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll examine how Bitcoin, and sound money in general, encourages the virtue of prudence.Fiat MoneyAlmost all money used today (USD, EUR, JPY, CNY, etc) is fiat money. That is, creation of the money is dictated by some central authority. This means, in general, that fiat currencies can and do get inflated. Largely, this is because entitlements and benefits are popular but taxes are not, so politicians tend to inflate through deficit spending. This is a lot like charging money on your credit card, but not having to pay off the principal for 30 years or so.This means that a dollar today will not have the same purchasing power as a dollar 10 years from now. This makes sense since inflation is the act of increasing the money supply. In other words, we live under a monetary system where the ultimate supply of the currency is at best unknown and at worst uncapped.Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a capped, known supply. There will never be more than 21 million BTC. This is even better than traditional sound money like gold as the potential supply of gold is unknown.Ultimate supply may seem an esoteric economic fact, but in actuality, money supply has enormous second and third order effects beyond degrading the purchasing power of the currency.Time PreferencesFiat currency, because of its inflationary property, encourages spending. Spending money now vs. later changes the mentality of people in a particular way. Specifically, they are less motivated to be prudent with their money.Now in of itself, spending money to get some good or service is not a bad thing. That\u2019s how markets work. When inflation enters the picture, however, the motivation to spend increases and thus, the demand for goods increases. This means that in general, goods and services become more expensive. The preferences change so that people are more motivated for things now vs. things later.Since saving is discouraged in a fiat system, there is less planning. In a fiat system, there is a preference for living day-to-day rather than planning a life many years from now. The typical mentality found in people with short-time preferences is YOLO (you only live once) without much regard for tomorrow.Sound money, and Bitcoin in particular, motivates people to plan and save. Most Bitcoiners I have met regret most purchases they\u2019ve made with Bitcoin because unlike fiat, Bitcoin increases in utility and value. People that were once living paycheck-to-paycheck now look at investment horizons of 10\u201320 years.Bitcoin encourages people to be wiser with their money, to think before they spend, to plan ahead and not act so much on impulse. In other words, Bitcoin encourages the virtue of prudence.Role of\u00a0PrudenceBitcoin encourages thinking through the actual consequences of spending and other decisions. This means that as more people own Bitcoin, more people will have a longer-term outlook. This means that more people will be planning for possible ways to make the future better, which leads to cooperation. Groups of people cooperating to make a better future is exactly what makes civilization possible.In other words, Bitcoin creates alignment between individuals to improve the future. Contrast that with the government budget situation in almost every country. Almost all budgets are deficit spending, meaning that they get goods and services now in return for debt paid by future generations. Sound money creates motivation to treat the future like an investment to be made instead of a resource to be raided.When Prudence\u00a0LacksWhen a society lacks prudence, what happens is that the society collapses or goes into chaos. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the average lifespan of a fiat currency is only 27 years. Usually, war is what devastates a country as governments do not have the natural restriction of money in a fiat system. The problem right now is that money and state are inextricably linked. Sound money, like Bitcoin, is the way to unlink them.Civilized society depends largely on the virtues of its citizens, prudence chief among them. Without prudence, planning for a shared future becomes impossible as most people simply don\u2019t think much about it. Bitcoin and sound money encourage prudence and change the incentive structure toward future-orientation.ConclusionBitcoin decouples money and state. Bitcoin can thus be sound money. Sound money motivates people to be more prudent. As a result, civilized society can be planned for and improved upon instead of made worse through neglect or ransacking future generations.Bitcoin is good for society because sound money aligns people\u2019s preferences toward building a better future.Want to get curated Technical Bitcoin News?

As opposed to following the traditional route of physical tender, one based in principles of previous centuries, Nakamoto combined the power of the computing age with the math behind cryptography to create the first, truly modern form of currency.Ways to Talk About\u00a0BitcoinSince that time, thousands of cryptocurrencies have popped up on the market, ranging from outright scams and vaporware to novel projects that build upon what Bitcoin was first able to establish. The confusion of the market and complexity of the technology has given rise to a number of media detractors, including this article which labeled Bitcoin as the \u201cgreatest scam in history.\u201d As time passes, it\u2019s becoming clear that certain factions are forming in the cryptospace, with each group out for its own set of motivation:The Ideology Believer. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has been wrapped up in libertarian beliefs since inception. Decentralization and possession of a tender that operates outside of government fiat is a substantial tool for anyone looking to reduce the role of overbearing political powers in their life. For these people, Bitcoin provides an outlet of freedom, security and privacy that is not afforded through the traditional banking route. Roger Ver, one of the most exemplary and outspoken libertarian figures in the industry, claims that he supports Bitcoin as a method for world peace: without funding governments, through fiat and taxes, he is no longer a participant in the wars arbitrated between political and geographic powers. With the situation escalating in Syria, his stance could become a beacon for more Bitcoin converts.The Casual Observer. There are a lot of people in Bitcoin that have no interest in the underlying technology, no interest in the principles of cryptography or libertarian applications, and are only tangentially concerned with price movement. These are people who see Bitcoin as a novelty, a distraction in the digital age like social media and gaming that they would like to be apart of. They don\u2019t invest enough to be at risk of the volatile price swings, but they also wouldn\u2019t mind taking a piece of the profit. These people are not out to trade Bitcoin or to promote the technology. Instead, they want a piece of the excitement that is sweeping the world in certain circles, with a take-it-or-leave-it approach to the little details. These people represent the greatest potential market for Bitcoin growth. People who are willing to buy, send and pay for Bitcoin because of the action itself (using an address as opposed to debit card, having a miniscule fraction of a whole coin, something different from regular money, etc.) are the people that are going to drive real world implementation and use-cases as opposed to holding for long-term appreciation.The Tech Enthusiast. If the casual observer is the most important figure in terms of growth and adoption, the tech enthusiast is the one who will drive the industry forward in terms of usability. The tech enthusiast is concerned more with the utility of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency than price appreciation. They see their investment in Bitcoin as a logical extension of disruptive technology and the appreciation in price is simply the reward of being an early adopter. To this group, traditional fiat is outdated and limited in its use compared to the possibilities of Bitcoin.The Price Speculator & Amateur Investor. Overwhelmingly, the industry was plagued at the end of last year with an influx of price speculators and people looking to get rich overnight. This led to vastly overbought conditions, in particular by investors who had been swept up in the cyclical nature of a bull market. The media fueled the frenzy, with popular outlets like CNN and CNBC changing their tune from the evils of Bitcoin to the millions that were being made (unsurprisingly, these outlets soon turned negative as the price turned downwards). The problem with crypto price speculating is not the pursuit of profit, which brings large investors, hedge-fund interest and other influxes of capital that help cryptocurrency reach greater market saturation. The real problem is that people forget these are currencies. Wences Casares, CEO of Bitcoin wallet Xapo, has long gone on record saying that Bitcoin should function as a digital asset: secure, scarce, and capable of appreciating overtime. But for most of the market, Bitcoin and other cryptos represent a replacement for currency and are built with the function to do so. Without the ability to use these currencies, Bitcoin loses any intrinsic value, the general public gets annoyed with the empty hype surrounding crypto, and short-term investors begin to doubt their choices.The Real Problem with Price SpeculationThe problem with price speculators in Bitcoin is how it shifts the purpose of the technology to something that closely resembles a ponzi scheme, and by extension, another form of dot.com bubble and tulip mania. If the primary use for Bitcoin is only through price speculation, trading and waiting for appreciation profits, there is almost no way to grow the industry organically or get others involved in crypto on an individual basis without actually participating in a ponzi-like model.Imagine you tell a coworker about Bitcoin. They ask what it\u2019s for. Instead of telling them all the ways they can use Bitcoin as a replacement for fiat, and the advantages of BTC as a modern form of digital tender, you instead focus on the price aspects. Your argument boils down to this: buy Bitcoin today because it will be worth more tomorrow. That is the exact process for a pyramid scheme and emphasizes the value of Bitcoin not in the underlying technology but as a FOMO opportunity.Bitcoin needs to fill a real world need in order to have a future. It could pose as a superior form of money and one that gives individuals a way to sidestep the process of banks and government fiat. Instead, we have a market that functions on the supposition of an escalator pricing model. The reason to own Bitcoin today is in case someone a year from now will buy it for a much greater price. This line of thinking has deep implications for the industry, the least of which is continued volatility. People buy into cryptocurrency at an unrealistic rate, creating the conditions for a bloated, overvalued industry made primarily of overextended, thereby weak-handed investors. You know the industry has developed bad practices when Coinbase, one of the most popular Bitcoin-buying exchanges in the United States and a company that thrives off of transaction fees, was compelled to send an email reminding users not to spend more than they were willing to lose.How to Talk about Bitcoin without\u00a0PricePrice speculation and talk strangles any discussion about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. Instead of focusing on the myriad uses and potential of Bitcoin in reshaping the world of money, taxes and government practices, discussions surrounding BTC often boil down to hushed excitement over what the price will be six months, six years and six decades from now. That\u2019s not a conversation, but wishful thinking. Investing in cryptocurrency is not like the stock market: there is no share of a productive company backing each purchase; there are no board members and government regulators to protect the interest of investors. The sole value of Bitcoin comes from what the next person in line is willing to pay for it.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "An Open Letter to the SEC | The Case for a Bitcoin\u00a0ETF", "author_name": "Nicholas Merten", "link": "https://medium.com/@nicholasmerten/an-open-letter-to-the-sec-the-case-for-a-bitcoin-etf-e3a308b12fa?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 26, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "5.6K", "content": "An Open Letter to the SEC | The Case for a Bitcoin\u00a0ETFNicholas MertenBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 26, 2018Dear Commissioners,With the recent move of the SEC to postpone any decisions on a variety of proposed Bitcoin ETFs until September, I thought it might be helpful to get a balanced opinion from someone who\u2019s active in the space. Today, I\u2019d like to provide the case in support of a Bitcoin ETF, along with providing details as to how this will help meet some of the SEC\u2019s current concerns for this emerging currency market.The SEC\u2019s stated objective is to provide protection to retail investors, and various concerns have been listed, such as liquidity and manipulation. Understandably, there will be multiple concerns in any new market. But these two, I feel, make up the majority of the SEC\u2019s concerns in approving an ETF, which is why I\u2019ll be primarily addressing these two points. They not only coincide with one another, but there is a high degree of evidence that proves a Bitcoin ETF would help to dissolve these concerns.Liquidity & ManipulationThere\u2019s no doubt that in an emerging currency market, which has only existed for a little over nine years, there will be excessive volatility. But I feel the SEC\u2019s concerns aren\u2019t stemmed simply in the speculative or fast moving price action of cryptocurrencies. If that were the case, things like 3x leveraged ETFs on volatility, commodities, or pharmaceuticals wouldn\u2019t be able to trade. If I\u2019m correct, most of these concerns stem from the large concentration of ownership in the hands of a few (commonly referred to as whales in the cryptocurrency space). With headlines from major media outlets like Bloomberg claiming that, \u201c1,000 People Own 40 Percent of the Market\u201d, or estimations that Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, owns over one million of the coins in circulation, there\u2019s a large amount of fear on the fundamental distribution of the currency. There are even studies that aim to dispel these fears, such as a research piece done by Chainalysis, which claims that nearly 3.9 million bitcoin have been lost. Staying critical however, let\u2019s take this fear into account, along with the fact that the market is still quite small at around a $300 billion valuation. The SEC has reason to be cautious with these points alone.But excluding manipulation such as smaller scale \u201cpump and dumps\u201d (P&Ds) and the fraudulent activity in the ICO space, we have yet to see a massive exit sale of Bitcoin in cryptocurrency markets, leading the price to zero. Why is this? The obvious answer many would claim is that most, if not all, are holding. But in reality, some are selling, they\u2019re just not doing it on the exchanges. OTC markets have been the leading force in allowing early adopters, mostly miners, early investors, libertarians and cypherpunks to liquidate some of their holdings, bringing both better distribution to the supply and a way for billions of dollars worth of trades to be facilitated that would have otherwise never happened. On the buying side, we see that most are family funds, hedge funds, or other institutions of finance that manage money for their clients. On traditional exchanges, both the buyers and sellers could never make these types of transactions. When dealing with millions, if not, billions of dollars, both sides would face concerns of slippage in the underlying cryptocurrency\u2019s value.This leads me to my case for a Bitcoin ETF. When we open up markets, and allow more participants to gain access to any given asset, commodity, or currency, markets flourish, and distribution is an inevitable symptom. Much like how the OTC market opened up an opportunity for institutional participants to gain access to Bitcoin under hedge funds, ETFs help markets become mainstream, providing an easy framework for investors to obtain a holding of the underlying item. By creating an ETF to allow both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, many of these whales will open the doors to swap their bitcoin for fiat currency over OTC markets, which will provide the opportunity for ETF producers to purchase the underlying bitcoin for each share. All of this could happen without major fluctuations of price on the open exchanges, and will lead towards a healthier distribution of the underlying cryptocurrency.There are many steps that the SEC and other regulators can take to help protect investors in this emerging market of currencies. Establishing large penalties for partaking in coordinated \u201cpump and dumps\u201d and establishing ways to protect investors from scams in ICO markets are all great steps that financial regulators have already taken. And to that, many of us, myself included, appreciate you for your hard work and determination. But blocking the possibility of everyday citizens to engage in these new markets will not only hinder the SEC\u2019s long-term objectives of fighting manipulation and bringing liquidity into the space, but it will also prevent retail participants, yet again, from having the freedom to easily access these new markets.I\u2019ll finish off by referring to a quote made by SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, on initial-public-offerings (IPOs) in a recent interview on CNBC. In reference to the growth of private equity markets, rather than public equity markets, he claimed that this trend was, \u201cshrinking the opportunities for our Main Street investors\u201d, and I couldn\u2019t agree more. As someone who\u2019s spent seven years investing in traditional equities markets, it upsets me that more and more opportunities are being stripped away from the people who the SEC aims to protect; Main Street, retail investors. And though I believe that regulation and protection are necessary functions of the SEC, I also feel that in doing so, the organization should also aim to guarantee that the investors they\u2019re protecting have an equal set of opportunity to their institutional counterparts.Sincerely,Nicholas Merten", "responses": "6"}, {"title": "Bitcoin\u2019s Glory Days Over & the Future of Blockchain", "author_name": "Michael K.

SpencerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 25, 2018itsblockchainWe\u2019re still writing as if Bitcoin were supremely relevant, I see editor\u2019s picks on Medium about Bitcoin. Even as its price has slumped, from nearly 20,000 to currently around $7,500. Not just that, crypto has been dragged through the mud, as if crypto and blockchain weren\u2019t two sides of the same coin!ICO fraud, crypto pump and dump schemes, rankings in crypto and for ICOs that make little sense, poorly written spammy content about every side-angle about crypto\u200a\u2014\u200abut everyone is seemingly on the blockchain train.Bitcoin is the Jesus of\u00a0CryptoBitcoin? It\u2019s like Jesus, a martyr for its kin. There are so many altcoins and ICOs nobody seems to know what\u2019s real anymore, and what\u2019s a fad\u200a\u2014\u200awhat crypto and altcoin experiments will likely have no value in two or five years.Blockchain? Most central banks will be on it transitioning their fiat currency on to centralized blockchains. Ethereum will become even more integrated with enterprise, Facebook will likely have its own form of crypto payment, and Amazon\u2019s Cloud, AWS will be the most agile for enterprise and medium sized companies to adopt blockchain solutions.If Bitcoin was the yin, Blockchain is the\u00a0yang.The U.S. department of justice is even looking into if Bitcoin price fixing and market manipulation occured. So many cryptocurrencies are supposed to be decentralized stores of value, but their top 100 addresses usually still own the majority of the wealth. They are\u2019t managed with economics of supply and demand that makes sense that\u2019s tied to tangible assets with multiple ties to real-world indicators. In this sense many of them are speculative ponzi schemes, high-risk digital assets for retail and small-time investors. They aren\u2019t always tied to great products; that have any realistic chance of having sustainable value and that offer long-term viability.In many ways let\u2019s admit it, the Bitcoin hype created a moral vacuum, blockchain has created hype where the results may take several more months and years to the the evolution they said it would be in 2015. Bitcoin has fuelled and created a digital decentralized scarcity that is not always of this world, it\u2019s innovative, but is it even useful?Bitcoin is the Digital Gold but Ethereum is the\u00a0SiliconDecentralized app platforms with smart contacts that can be foundational, are on the other hand, useful. So why does the cryptocurrency market still go up and down with Bitcoin? A wave of innovation tethered to the origin point?So long as the ideal of decentralized payments doesn\u2019t exist, the vision that Bitcoin represents will just be monetized. Bitcoin has been hoarded, badly enough to make it feel like more of the same wealth inequality.This is what humans do to innovation.Humans think they can own blockchain, they think that if we make our central bank on the blockchain with fiat currencies, we\u2019ll own it. Perhaps this is why there is an unofficial race for countries to implement fiat blockchain solutions. For Banks to mimic and use the blockchain for their own profiteering ends. There are Bitcoin celebrities and very wealthy men who own a lot of Bitcoins. But that\u2019s not the final destiny of the blockchain, is it?Coinbase is trying to be the Facebook of cryptocurrency trading, Facebook now thinks it can be a blockchain company. It\u2019s sickening. Google offered Vitalik Buterin a job, as if he wanted to be a part of that ethical nightmare. We\u2019re forgetting all about the \u201cdecentralization\u201d part and why it matters. It\u2019s sort of fucking important, it\u2019s the liberating part of the \u201cyin\u201d of Bitcoin. Putting highly controlled transactions on the blockchain, is not using the tool we were given to its full maturity. We need to think differently about what \u201cmoney\u201d and transactions are in the post-capitalism world. Capitalism as we know it, could fail in our lifetime, we may witness the fact.Bitcoin and blockchain at their core, value statements. The world can and should work differently. Super imposing current power structures, hierarchies and wealth inequalities on the blockchain, isn\u2019t the point. Governments controlling blockchains and cryptocurrencies as they were their property isn\u2019t the ideal. The entire infrastructure of the financial order needs an overhaul. That and nothin but that, is the secret promise of the \u201cyin\u201d of Bitcoin.However we live in a materialistic world where the \u201cyang\u201d predominates, how to use blockchain to elevate our business model, is what everyone is asking, much in the same way they are using AI to power their businesses governed by data and optimize their products and customer experiences. But the blockchain and AI are just tools, tools that need to be used responsibly. In a world where algorithms and data harvesting have been abused, what hope should we have that AI and the blockchain will be used for good, towards uplifting and life-empowering ends? The internet run by Google and Facebook is advertising spam, and user monetization, a far cry from the idealism of the 90s.Unity has historically been achieved by eliminating competing religions and altcoins. However what if that\u2019s no longer the solution. While New China have gone with mobile payments of WeChat Pay and Alibaba, the U.S. dollar is the defacto value, but nothing lasts forever. Wall Street will one day crumble and a new financial center will take its place. This is another event we will witness, and the manifestation of the blockchain may play a key role in how this plays out.Bitcoin points the way to how this could be achieved. China is the most ambitious nation when it comes to State backed blockchain, blockchain startups and R&D going into blockchain innovation. Therefore it\u2019s natural it will use blockchain to achieve economic supremacy. Don\u2019t believe me? Watch it happen in the next ten years.ICOs are five years old, but crypto trading markets are really just getting started with the Bitcoin boom of December 2017, what I term the crypto singularity. At that point, altcoins and ICOs began to multiply exponentially where a battle for dApp platform smart contract utility is taking place and while Ethereum appears to be the heir apparent to Bitcoin; another may take its place.Bitcoin Shot Down in a Blaze of\u00a0GloryA Bitcoin correction of early 2018 appears to have stabilized Bitcoin in the price range of $6,500 to $9,500. However compared to the $19,500 US dollar price of mid December, 2017 the entire cryptocurrency market cap has been dropped effectively in a volatility of a semi-bear market (the opposite of bull).While it\u2019s not exactly the end of crypto\u2019s glory days, it\u2019s definately a period of regulatory oversight, more objective rankings, a clearing up of fraudulent ICOs, SEC pressure, and possibly, mainstream cryptocurrency market trading.Blockchain is supposed to be secure, and yet cryptocurrency markets and altcoins have been hacked, harming their reputation. Also for Bitcoin, the longer a bear market goes on, the more pressure there is to sell and for Bitcoin\u2019s price to potentially crash.While some analysts think Bitcoin still has potential to go up, other financial pundits are warning Bitcoin\u2019s price could still crash further.The likes of Coinbase, Robinhood and Circle evolving certainly don't\u2019 feel like the next era of the internet, either does Facebook adopting blockchain. So why is the idealism behind Bitcoin not winning, but the rules of the Silicon Valley internet of profiteering? Has adoption of cryptocurrencies just been about greed, and nothing more based on values of decentralization and the potential of dApps to change the world for the better?The Crypto singularity and ICO tsunami has made some people rich, but has it pushed crypto innovation in the right direction? If the market still determines what wins, and not the better technology and better forms of consensus, decentralization and integrity\u200a\u2014\u200ais what Bitcoin represents a failure already? You can witness this struggle with Ethereum, and even the microcosm of its own internal decision making process.The only crypto related organizations that I witness platforms scaled with idealism are actually Ethereum and Binance. While coinbase is run like a startup, it\u2019s Silicon valley to the core, without any substantial value shift that would appeal to Millennials and GenZ attracted to decentralization in the long run. This is problematic in how America is adopting cryptocurrencies, and shows how a capitalist-first approach to blockchain innovation might not be the right approach.If Banks are adopting blockchain in China, Japan and elsewhere, American financial institutions are slow, lack large innovative networks and publically slaughter Bitcoin\u2019s reputation while saying they are open to blockchain with small moves. It\u2019s not the radical blockchain adoption we are seeing in Asia, and this does not bode well for America keeping up in blockchain innovation as the financial services sector is showing to be not very agile in FinTech. U.S. banks and institutions already have low consumer trust, if you think of the scandal Wells Fargo has been through.The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, which is likely to contribute to the bear cryptocurrency sentiment, however many young American citizens are more pro cryptocurrencies than they are relating to American banks themselves. This trust problem therefore is serious for the J.P Morgan Chase\u2019s of the world. Furthermore, as wealth inequality continues to scale, this mistrust of Banks is only going to grow as student debts continue to rise, along with the cost of healthcare, housing and other living expenses without adjusted rises in wages.That\u2019s not to say that the Crypto Singularity was an honest trading environment. According to the report, the criminal probe\u2019s investigators will specifically looking into practices like spoofing (filling the marketplace with fake orders that are later canceled to manipulate others to buy or sell a particular coin) and wash trading (trading with oneself in order to falsely imply more market demand than there actually is). Traders were \u201ccheating\u201d the crypto market to make a buck, while Banks and even Big Tech work together to \u201csuppress\u201d crypto enthusiasm with Ad-bans. To say that Bitcoin is controversial, would be an understatement.Where digital, blockchain and crypto innovation is more native and integrated with existing services, such as in Japan, there\u2019s no such problem. America appear to be stuck in an old system by making Bitcoin the bad guy. Japan has adopted Bitcoin payments in retail, blockchain startups are thriving in China, cryptocurrency trading is fervent in South Korea. In America, Facebook, Amazon and even Walmart are now adopting blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200aso the \u201cright people\u201d can profit from the enthusiasm. At home, the game is fixed. For America, Bitcoin\u2019s glory days might indeed be over. The American dollar as the default veto of global currency means the cryptocurrency market is monopolized and tethered to American policy and sentiment; thus easily controlled by the 1% there.There\u2019s an argument to be made that I have written about, that Bitcoin\u2019s price drop began and was achieved by the introduction of Bitcoin Futures. With the likes of Coinbase, with high trading fees ramping up aggressively, America is simply redistributing the wealth of crypto enthusiasm into its own pockets; Silicon valley types with strong ties to Wall Street and the government. Bitcoin was not something that could have been invented in America. A purely capitalistic mindset is outdated when dealing with blockchain innovation or a utility token environment. Facebook is likely a decade behind in payments innovation to China\u2019s Tencent (WeChat).If Bitcoin is the martyr, decentralization is the second-coming of the savior. But that savior will have to deal with Wall Street whose values and thinking are years behind Asia.The SEC has been slow to figure out and regulate ICOs, while blockchain innovation goes on. If Wall Street has been slow to accept cryptocurrency markets and integrate it, other cryptocurrency markets in Asia have risen to dominance. Bitcoin as a new concept is basically disrupting Wall Street and America\u2019s hold on the future of the global economy. With each year, China\u2019s influence on the global economy is growing, and as the place where the majority of blockchain startups are located, China\u2019s rise as the center of the financial world, can be correlated in the future to the rise in popularity of Bitcoin.Google offering the Ethereum founder a job in a secretive crypto project, shows the deep depravity, greed and misunderstanding of Big Tech of what decentralization actually means. Facebook wants to integrate blockchain into its business model for profit, not to further the evolution of the blockchain! Amazon\u2019s introduction of blockchain into its Cloud AWS, at least can help democratize how enterprise integrates blockchain.Misunderstandings about Bitcoin can be seen in legacy tech companies. LinkedIn usually covers negative aspects of Bitcoin and crypto, showing Microsoft\u2019s outdated editorial insights into something that young people care passionately about, not to mention young developers and entrepreneurs. The world is still run by baby boomers and GenX, while its younger values belong to an impoverished generation, permanently maimed by the great recession of 2008. The sets up a generational war for the future, where cryptocurrencies are the weapons. You cannot blame Bitcoin for problems of wealth inequality, failures of capitalism and the moral deficiency of big tech. That\u2019s just not going to fly with younger Millennials and GenZ natives who will have the final say on the interpretation and implementation of blockchain and the future era of digital innovation.I blog as a futurist and a crypto enthusiast on a publication made for futurists called Future Sin.

The ExtraCredit team definitely had this in mind when developing XTRA tokens. The reason for making this conclusion is simple and that is the crypto space is growing and it is expected to be here for a while thus the need to learn about it.Blockchain technology is as revolutionary as the internet or better meaning that once a good percentage gets wind of the technology, many will come looking to be educated just so they don\u2019t miss out. Unlike most other tokens which have to contend with stiff competition from other existing cryptocurrencies, Extracredit is likely to face less competition due to the fact that there is currently no other cryptocurrencies created for the same purpose as Extracredit. What\u2019s more, Extracredit has collaborated with one of the most established learning institutions for blockchain known as BitcoinHomework.XTRA is an incentive token meaning that students will be rewarded with XTRA coins upon completion of a learning module with Bitcoinhomework. Essentially, students will get paid for leaning. It does not get better than this.One of the key features of Exracredit is that it is built on the Ethereum blockchain and makes use of smart contracts. Smart contracts are technically contractual programs developed to work on the \u2018if-then\u2019 syntax. In this case, every time a student completes a module, the smart contract will release the tokens to the provided wallet. This brings us to the next efficiency feature of XTRA tokens. XTRA tokens are ERC-20 tokens which means that they can be stored in any available wallets that supports ERC-20 tokens. These wallets include Metamask, mist, parity and my Etherwallet. Therefore, one needs not go through the daunting task of looking for a wallet supporting the XTRA tokens.It goes without saying that the value of a token is a good as the size of its community. where a token has a small community chances of that token achieving massive adoption is likely to be very thin and the opposite is true. Moreover, the size of the community hints of the nature of public sentiment regarding the token. Considering the magnitude of the community behind ExtraCredit, it is imperative to say that there is significant positive public sentiment for ExtraCredit. On Twitter, BitcoinHomework and ExtraCredit have over 10,000 followers, over 20,000 followers on Facebook, 1500+ telegram participants to mention but a few.Different industries have already experienced the blockchain disruption and now the education sector is about to experience the same with ExtraCredit and BitcoinHomework. An important point to take note of regarding the learning resources on BitcoinHomework is that they will be sourced from different contributors. The content contributors will then be rewarded in XTRA tokens. The advantage of this is that one BitcoinHomework and ExtraCredit achieve global recognition, the value of the XTRA tokens will increase to the advantage of the token holders. The success of ExtraCredits Pre-ICO is evident of the potential of this token.If looking to get educated on blockchain and earn while at it, try BitcoinHomework and visit our Presale Homepage\u200a\u2014\u200aExtracredit.io", "responses": ""}, {"title": "#Bitcoin Lightning Network\u00a0FAQ", "author_name": "Brand7", "link": "https://medium.com/@The1Brand7/lightning-faq-67bd2b957d70?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 21, 2016", "readtime": "12 min read", "upvotes": "2.5K", "content": "#Bitcoin Lightning Network\u00a0FAQBrand7BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 21, 2016", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "Bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200aStore of Value is a Useless Use\u00a0Case", "author_name": "Matt Ward", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-store-of-value-is-a-useless-use-case-f786b2ddbb25?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 7, 2018", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "2.8K", "content": "Source: BTCNovostiBitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200aStore of Value is a Useless Use\u00a0CaseWhy Digital Gold Won\u2019t be a\u00a0ThingMatt WardBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 7, 2018Prior to August 15th, 1971, a US dollar was worth 1/35th of an ounce of gold\u200a\u2014\u200aknown as the gold standard (actually the Gold Window, FDR had started the process of removing the gold standard in 1993).This was a monumental moment. The gold standard kept the US (and other governments honest)\u200a\u2014\u200abecause there was only so much gold in the ground, there could only be so much Fiat\u200a\u2014\u200apreventing rapid inflation.Changing this dynamic was a paradigm shift\u2026The concept of\u00a0moneyHistorically \u201cmoney\u201d has served three purposes:medium of exchange (ability to trade)unit of account (standardization)store of value (risk management).In practice, the first two are linked. Because the US issues US dollars and while the UK works with British pounds (GBP), there are standards of exchange across currencies. Due to the number currencies worldwide, it would be impractical to peg every fiat currency to every other, and thus the US dollar is the primary pegging mechanism (as is BTC in crypto).Rather than maintaining exchange rates with 180+ currencies worldwide, everyone trades into (and out of) USD\u200a\u2014\u200athe standard.Gold as a store of\u00a0valueThe storage of value is really nothing more than trust. You trust gold to stay relatively consistent in price as do others around the world because there is only a limited supply and the ROI on holding is quite low (meaning low demand).If however the price of fluctuated or countries began dumping gold bricks into the oceans, the decreased supply would trigger price jumps and subsequent unrest. But because we are all motivated by money, that does not happen.This isn\u2019t true with dollars (or any Fiat currency). Here trust is in the issuing entity. You and I both need to trust the US government and the stability of the dollar to be able to transact with it. And because a government is inherently less stable than a distributed supply of gold, the trust relative to gold is significantly lower\u200a\u2014\u200athus equating to lower value.And as the supply of fiat is not fixed, the value of the dollar decreases every year with inflation as more dollars are printed (and so does our trust in the dollar and by definition US government).Source: InflationData.comNOTE: I am not leaning one way or another or using the term \u201ccash\u201d or \u201cdigital cash\u201d to represent Bitcoin Cash or any other cryptocurrency. This is a noun to describe a purely theoretical and probable outcome.But along comes\u00a0BitcoinCryptocurrencies change everything. The reason gold is trusted isn\u2019t any inherent value, it is its limited supply and our historical fascination with it.That said, due to its lack of utility, Warren Buffett isn\u2019t a fan:\u201c(It) gets dug out of the ground in Africa or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their\u00a0head.\u201dBut Bitcoin started as a peer-to-peer payment system with utility\u200a\u2014\u200aquickly morphing into digital cash, a non-governmental currency that citizens of the world could use in a trustless, decentralized fashion.Today Bitcoin sits at $9065, down from an all time high of $19,343 on December 16th, 2017.Source: CoinDeskWhat started as a medium exchange has turned into a high cost, high demand speculative asset.This has driven transaction prices through the roof, now making small payments untenable and disenfranchising many of Bitcoins early advocates\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin is again changing.Digital gold is\u00a0dumbEnthusiasts call Bitcoin digital gold. This is a flawed understanding of the nature of money. There won\u2019t be a digital gold, it serves no purpose. Gold was valuable for its trust, nothing else.With decentralized, trustless, non-governmental cryptocurrencies, what is the purpose of assets?There is literally no reason to have a \u201cstore of value.\u201d In a scenario where one (or more) cryptocurrencies become actual currencies, ie begin being used for commerce and penetrate the mass market, there has to be relatively stable pricing. When supply and demand are relatively consistent, prices hardly fluctuate.This is the reason you can ride the bus and pay at the beginning or end of the trip without worrying about inflation/deflation. The cost in units of trust is the same\u200a\u2014\u200athat is how functioning economies work.So if we can all agree that at least one cryptocurrency will reach this level, which I believe most crypto enthusiasts can, then isn\u2019t the trust in this currency essentially infinite? Anyone can use/accept it, no one controls or can stop it\u2026Gold wasn\u2019t a good everyday currency because it was too cumbersome, thus paper replaced it for everyday use.This isn\u2019t true for crypto. You can put 0.001BTC or 100k BTC on a hardware wallet and it takes the same amount of work (and time).Designing a trifecta\u00a0currencyCryptocurrencies have become a bloodbath recently, between greed grabs and differences in theology (yes cryptocurrency is a religion/theology\u200a\u2014\u200asee below), it has been an interesting and exciting time to be in the blockchain space.The Hateful, Hypocritical Theology of CryptoCryptocurrencies are a Religious Cult and it is hard not to laugh at Bitcoin Maximalistshackernoon.comBut at the same time, the original vision of cryptocurrencies is transparent, trustless money for and by the people. If we get to this point, it doesn\u2019t matter who \u201cwins.\u201dA cryptocurrency looking to be \u201cthe digital cash\u201d and replace currencies and cryptos of the world, needs the following attributes:1. TrustlessI don\u2019t trust you, you don\u2019t trust me. Transparency (at least between parties) is necessary to conduct business without a \u201ctrusted\u201d intermediary (like a bank that charges lots of fees).Cryptocurrencies currently don\u2019t have regulatory bodies. If you get robbed, Batman (or the police) isn\u2019t coming to save you.2. Decentralized and censorship-resistantIf governments or illicit organizations can shut off or alter the supply of money, we are right back to fiat.This creates the question of how to decentralize/secure the network. Currently Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are the common protocols\u200a\u2014\u200aboth with strengths and weaknesses.Solving this problem may prove the most important key to cryptocurrency adoption.3. PrivateTransparency isn\u2019t always a good thing. Why should the barista at Starbucks know your net worth and all the organizations/individuals you interact with? You are just asking to get robbed or hacked.For privacy coins to work without a complete governmental collapse, there will need to be certain auditable information. But beyond the basics, sharing economic status with the world seems a recipe for disaster.4. StableFor mass adoption, we need stable cryptocurrency. You cannot buy things, pay salaries or expect to function in a society of rapidly changing rates\u2026There may need to be DAO-like governance structure needed to maintain stable prices. This however has not been worked out adequately to date and needs a lot of work.Closing thoughtsWhat is cryptocurrency? What are your thoughts on the article?

In this article, I\u2019m going to give a gentle, step-by-step overview of how to contribute to Core development.So You Want to Be a Core Developer\u2026Before we get into the actual nitty-gritty of contributing to Core, there are a few caveats to get out of the way.First and foremost, Bitcoin Core is a meritocracy. As a noob, you are unlikely to get a crazy proof-of-work change pull request merged into Core. Like any meritocracy, you start with zero reputation and work your way up.The good news is that nobody cares about your background. Whether you\u2019re a 14-year-old in India or a 45-year-old CTO of a Fortune-500 company, the only thing that really matters is the quality of your work.The bad news is that you have to be willing to leave your ego at the door. Nobody cares how many years of experience you have or what great ideas you have for fixing Bitcoin. The quality of your code, reviews, documentation and testing are what count.Second is that you should set your expectations accordingly. Notable Core developers like Pieter Wuille, Cory Fields and Gregory Maxwell have earned their respect through many years of blood, sweat and tears. Adding a PR that corrects a spelling error is not going to win you a Pieter Wuille-level of respect. Good work will earn you recognition and respect, but only after you\u2019ve been producing for a while.Third is that this is not an easy road. Being the top developer at company X will not necessarily make you a good Core developer. There\u2019s a variety of reasons for this, but in general, your work has to meet some pretty high standards of testing, documentation and code review not often seen in even very competent technical companies.All that said, if you have the humility, drive and desire for excellence, contributing to Core will make you a better developer, code reviewer, documenter and tester.PrerequisitesYou will need some knowledge and skills to begin.Bitcoin Core is mainly in two languages, C++ and Python. You\u2019re most likely going to have to learn at least some of both if you hope to contribute.Source control is managed through Git. At a minimum, you should know how to fetch from origin, how to make topic branches and how to rebase. If you\u2019re testing someone else\u2019s code, you should also know how to add multiple repositories to your local development environment so you can fetch and test the code.All changes to Core are merged on a PR by PR basis on Github, so you will need a GitHub account.Lastly, you\u2019ll need to know how to install and remove packages on your platform. The instructions are pretty thorough, but it helps, for instance, to be able to add and remove ZMQ as needed.Starting OutThe first thing that you\u2019ll want to do when starting out is to read some documentation. The README and the contribution guidelines are good places to start.Afterward, head over to the doc directory and read the README there. All the documentation in the doc directory is described in the README, so you can refer back to it if you get lost or confused at any point.Note that you don\u2019t have to understand everything in every document I\u2019ve suggested. There are a lot of very nice people that can help you on IRC, StackExchange and Slack if you encounter something that you don\u2019t understand.Building From\u00a0SourceNow that you\u2019ve read the basics of how development is supposed to work, start by building bitcoin from source. First, clone the bitcoin Git repository:git clone git@github.com:bitcoin/bitcoinNext step will be to set up your development environment. This will depend heavily on the platform you\u2019re on, but compiling is something you\u2019ll need to do frequently so it\u2019s well worth getting this part down.Additionally, you\u2019ll want to run all the integration tests, so be sure to turn on the GUI and ZMQ when going through the instructions below.*nix instructions are here.osx instructions are here.windows instructions are here.openBSD instructions are here.As you set up your environment, if something doesn\u2019t work, Google the errors first before submitting a documentation PR. As mentioned before, IRC, StackExchange and Slack are good resources, but please don\u2019t be that person that asks really simple questions and drains everyone\u2019s time.TestingNow that you\u2019ve compiled everything, the next step is to test out the software. Thankfully, Bitcoin Core has a variety of unit and integration tests to check that the software you just compiled works properly.First, run the unit tests located here. Unit tests are compiled along with everything else, so all you need to do is run the binary that results. Check that all the tests pass. If they don\u2019t there\u2019s probably some instruction that was missed.If all your unit tests pass, run the integration tests located here. You\u2019ll want to run the extended tests. The pruning test in particular takes a long time to run, so you will want to exclude that test when running integration tests in the future.Again, check that all the tests pass. You will see a lot of dots until a summary shows up at the end. If something doesn\u2019t pass, you probably missed some instruction, though at times, some integration tests can be a bit fickle based on RAM and CPU.Contribution CategoriesNow that you have your system set up, you can begin to contribute!You may think that contribution means adding a bunch of code, sending in a PR and getting the glory. In actuality, a lot of the work is around the reviewing and testing code that other people submit. It helps to understand the steps involved in how a PR gets merged.Someone creates a change and submits the code via a Pull Request (PR).One or more people review the code.One or more people test the code.When enough people have reviewed and tested the code, a maintainer will merge the code\u200a\u2014\u200aonly a handful of people can do this.Most people think of contributing to an open source project as only contributing code, but in reality, testing and review are more important to the success of the project. Lack of review and testing is often the reason for security flaws in many projects as we saw in the recent Ethereum Parity Bug.Review and testing are also critical as it\u2019s often hard to have an adversarial mindset that covers all cases. Having many eyes look and test the code helps to uncover possible ways in which the code can be exploited.Finally, not only are reviewing and testing good for the project, but they\u2019re good for you! Reviewing and testing will force you to learn more about the code base and will give you a much deeper understanding than even writing code will do.Starting OutTo get used to the contribution process, you should not start by adding lots of PRs. Instead, as a new developer with no reputation, your best bet is to start off reviewing and testing other people\u2019s work. Reviewing and testing tend to be bottlenecks, so you can contribute and earn some reputation in the community at the same time.It\u2019s worth mentioning here that part of the reason why Greg Maxwell has such a great reputation among developers is that he is a really good reviewer and tester. He has world-class talent when it comes to finding possible ways something can break, and he reviews and tests a lot more code than writes. I promise you will appreciate him even more after you\u2019ve reviewed and tested some code yourself.Additionally, code is generally written once, but it\u2019s read a ton of times. Review is therefore a much more important step as it reveals how \u201creadable\u201d the code is. The general rule of thumb is that for every pull request you do, you should be reviewing about 3 pull requests. At the beginning you may want this ratio of reviews to pull requests to be even higher.How To\u00a0ReviewGenerally, you will not be able to give a good review of a Pull Request until you understand what the code is doing. As they say in coding, writing is a lot easier than reading, so take some time to really understand the code.Oftentimes, to get a grasp of what is going on in a PR, you will have to look up the functions and methods that are being used and carefully examine the context of the code. If you get confused and the person whose code you\u2019re reviewing is on IRC, you may want to ask questions directly. Most of the time, PR authors are very appreciative of reviewers and will be happy to help you.Much like reviewing an article or a book, there are a lot of things that you should be looking out for, namely:Is the code doing what it should be doing?Is the code tested sufficiently?Are all the comments around the code helpful and accurate?Is the code clear and easy to modify later?As a general rule, if you disagree with how something is done, it is better to assume you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on rather than launching into a lecture. Empathy and tact will get you a long way here. Remember, you are in many ways commenting on someone\u2019s baby. Ask questions and be gentle, at least at first. Oftentimes, these coders don\u2019t know you or your intentions. Be very clear when something is a minor issue of style vs. a major issue that may break something. It\u2019s much better to sound like a student trying to get a grasp of what the improvement is than a gatekeeper of sorts.Once you are sure what it is the code is trying to achieve, then you can comment on whether this is a feature worth doing. Until you\u2019ve built up some reputation, stay away from any comments that could be perceived negatively.When you are done reviewing the code, comment on the PR with the appropriate peer review comment. If you want to NACK, start over and assume you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, converse with the author and ask questions until you\u2019re positive this is a bad PR. Even then, converse with more experienced people to make sure.How To\u00a0TestIn order to test properly, you\u2019ll have to download the code from the pull request, compile again and run the tests. If you can think of a way to test the feature in some way manually, so much the better, but that is not required.Most of the time, the pull request will include one or more tests. If the coder didn\u2019t provide test coverage, try to understand why\u200a\u2014\u200arefactors often don\u2019t for obvious reasons. If you think there should be a test, you can write \u201cthis needs a test\u201d in the PR. Better yet, write the test yourself and let the author know where it can be cherry-picked in the PR! This is an excellent way to build up some good will from people whose code you\u2019re reviewing.Your job as a tester is to make sure the tests pass and that they sufficiently cover the functionality introduced. A good comment in a review might be \u201cIt would be nice if such-and-such situation could be covered by a test that does this-and-this\u201d.After testing, be sure to note in the PR that you\u2019ve tested.Better Pull\u00a0RequestsEventually, you will get to a point when you feel comfortable creating pull requests of your own. A pull request can be anything from adding documentation to consensus-critical functionality. Whatever the change, the key to making good pull requests is to make it easy to understand and painless to review.To that end, please don\u2019t torture your reviewers by making your PR a single commit with 3000 lines of changes. Separate those changes into easy-to-review commits of less than 300 lines (or maybe less than 100!) and grouped appropriately. As an example, you should put formatting changes into one commit, actual coding changes into another and large moves of code blocks in yet another.Take pains to explain exactly what you\u2019re doing and the reasoning behind what you\u2019ve done in each commit. I can\u2019t emphasize this part enough. Bend over backwards to make everything in your PR easy to understand!

As is usually the case, good data and good stories are mutually reinforcing. The chart alone doesn\u2019t tell us why things are happening, or even entirely what things are happening. Instead, it helps understand what events in the real world were significant. And offers evidence to support hypotheses, whether about the past or the future. Almost no piece of data from the chart is new, but seeing it laid out in one place is revealing.Four Eras of\u00a0BitcoinThere have been four distinct eras in the relatively brief history of cryptocurrency. The early hobbyist days went from Bitcoin\u2019s 2009 launch to the rise of two dominant platforms: the Mt. Gox exchange and the Silk Road dark marketplace. There was turmoil when both collapsed between late 2013 and early 2014. The price of Bitcoin plummeted from over $1000 to under $300, where it largely stayed for two years.In 2014\u20132016, activity diversified away from Bitcoin, in two directions. First, Ethereum and other platforms generalized Bitcoin\u2019s digital currency into a mechanism for decentralized applications and services. Second, enterprises and governments got excited about distributed ledger systems that added a permission layer to Bitcoin\u2019s open network. These were the days of \u201cblockchain, not Bitcoin.\u201dIn 2017, the pendulum swung again, as the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies suddenly took off. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptoasset trading were all the rage. The price of bitcoin briefly approached $20,000 in December 2017, bringing the total value of cryptocurrencies in circulation to roughly $750 billion. Millions of retail investors around the world piled in, hoping for massive gains. The Coinbase exchange\u2019s mobile client was briefly the top download in the Apple App Store.And then in early 2018, the market corrected. Bitcoin fell swiftly to roughly $8,000. Regulators such as the SEC started going after fraudulent and non-compliant ICOs, while China and South Korea banned them entirely. What\u2019s surprising isn\u2019t that the bitcoin bubble popped. Unlike 2013, it didn\u2019t. It deflated in a relatively orderly way. The folk explanation is that cryptocurrency holders, convinced of the fundamental superiority of this form of money, will hold on (or HODL in the lingo) when normal investors would run for the exits, triggering a panic.Now let\u2019s look at the chart.Remember, this isn\u2019t a diagram of bitcoin prices; it shows what bitcoin sellers are exchanging it for. Yet all the market shifts are there. In early 2014, the market fell off a cliff with the death of Silk Road and, especially, Mt. Gox, which at its peak represented something like 80% of the bitcoin exchange market. That we know. What the Morgan Stanley chart highlights is where all the activity went: to China. (CNY is the Chinese currency, the yuan.) From mid 2013 to mid-2014, China went rapidly from a negligible share of bitcoin trading to virtually the entire market. There are a few possible explanations for this. Perhaps bitcoin/yuan volume spiked as a percentage when bitcoin/dollar volume cratered, even though it didn\u2019t change much in absolute terms. Perhaps it related to Chinese dominance of bitcoin mining, which arose around this time. Miners earn newly-minted bitcoin, which they then often sell. Or perhaps something sparked an upsurge in bitcoin trading activity in China. It will take more data to answer this question.The period from 2014\u20132016, when bitcoin prices were in the doldrums and the newer blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms were getting off the ground, was therefore also something else: the era of Chinese bitcoin hegemony. What\u2019s odd is that the Chinese government during this period wasn\u2019t exactly welcoming the spread of the cryptocurrency. It was clamping down, banning banks from engaging in bitcoin transactions. Reports from the time noted this paradox, but couldn\u2019t explain it. There are two likely explanations. Ether the Chinese authorities didn\u2019t appreciate, or didn\u2019t care, that it was ground zero for bitcoin during a critical period of its development, because the activity was small and disconnected from the official financial system. Or they wanted it that way, so long as too much currency wasn\u2019t leaking out of the country or being used for scams.Then in spring 2016, there\u2019s another massive shift reflected in the chart. Overnight, the bitcoin market leapt across the Sea of Japan. The Japanese yen went from marginal to the largest trading partner for bitcoin, a status it still appears to enjoy today. In this case, the precipitating event is not hard to identify. In March 2016, the Japanese cabinet approved bills declaring bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be legal forms of money, and authorizing exchanges subject to regulation. The prospect of a nearby global financial center expressly allowing cryptocurrency transactions, compared to their quasi-illegal status in China, was obviously compelling. In mid-2017 China banned exchanges from bitcoin/yuan trading, but as the chart indicates, the market had already shifted completely.Strangely it seems, the biggest bull market in bitcoin history looks relatively stable on the Morgan Stanley chart, with yen remaining the dominant trading partner. And there\u2019s no sudden phase transition like 2014 or 2016 when the bitcoin market reversed in 2018 either. Instead, there are two less dramatic yet very noticeable trends. One is the rise of \u201cother\u201d currencies, which become as large or larger a share of the market than yen at times. The chart doesn\u2019t say, but these are almost certainly other cryptocurrencies, rather than fiat currencies issued by governments. The graph to the right shows that category representing 40% of all cryptocurrency trades today. In 2017, that represented the rise of ICOs, which mostly took in bitcoin or ether in return for their newly created tokens. The percentage of ICO transactions dropped in early 2018 according to the chart, but then stabilized, which is consistent with databases of ICO activity. The big driver of the Bitcoin bull market, it seems, wasn\u2019t bitcoin at all. It was people buying bitcoin and ether as gateways to other tokens.That brings us to the final stage of the market, so far. One question is why the price of bitcoin fell. A second is why it didn\u2019t fall further. To answer the first, we need to look at another chart recently published by the Financial Times, this one based on analysis from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.What happened around December 2017 is that long-time bitcoin holders (here labeled as investment coins) collectively cashed out some $30 billion to speculators. That much selling, in what remains by financial standards a thin market, is bound to push down the price.So why wasn\u2019t there more of a crash? Partly it\u2019s the HODL factor. Those long-term investors sold a lot, but they kept a lot too, as shown in the bottom-most graph in the Chainalysis chart. Partly it\u2019s residual optimism about cryptocurrencies, institutional money flowing into cryptoasset trading, and bitcoin taking share away from gold as a basic \u201cstore of value\u201d immune from politics. But partly, it\u2019s the last bit of the earlier Morgan Stanley chart.The new entrant on the bitcoin trading scene at the very end of 2017 is a cryptocurrency called tether. Tether is a \u201cstablecoin\u201d which is, in theory, pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. It is affiliated in poorly-disclosed ways with Bitfinex, a major cryptocurrency exchange. Over $2.5 billion of tether has been issued, supposedly backed 1-to-1 by U.S. dollar reserves, though no one really believes that. Still, all that tether became a huge destination for bitcoin. Tether essentially creates new buying pressure for bitcoin. The money stays in cryptocurrencies, because tether is not actually redeemable by right for dollars. So the price impact of the bitcoin selling is moderated.There are valuable uses for a cryptocurrency stablecoin. Circle, a major cryptocurrency firm that has been scrupulous about regulatory compliance, announced its intent recently to create something that sounds suspiciously like tether, only without all the suspicious elements. For now, though, tether is the one determining the fate of the bitcoin market. Critics have identified numerous highly questionable aspects of tether, which its promoters have never fully answered. The announcement in late May that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of a criminal probe of cryptocurrency market manipulation could be the harbinger for action against tether. Whether or not that happens, the shift from a crypto-to-fiat market into a crypto-to-crypt-market is likely to define this next stage of development.Where do we go from here? Too early to tell, and this analysis isn\u2019t designed as investment advice. One lesson from the Morgan Stanley chart is that bitcoin itself hasn\u2019t changed all that much technically in nearly ten years, but the bitcoin market has gone through tumultuous shifts. There\u2019s no reason to believe it will look similar in 2020 to what it does today. The industry around cryptocurrencies is maturing, and it\u2019s converging at points with the mature ecosystem of financial services companies. But there\u2019s no way to read the Morgan Stanley chart that suggests a master trend rather than sharp reversals. It\u2019s hard to imagine the volatility that has been one of its dominant characteristics going away any time soon. And as I hope to elaborate in a follow-up post, the chart confirms that the biggest factor in the bitcoin market is the very one it was designed to avoid: government policy decisions.", "responses": "5"}, {"title": "Beyond Bitcoin: Why Ethereum Could Change The\u00a0World", "author_name": "Noam Levenson", "link": "https://medium.com/blockchain-for-grandma/beyond-bitcoin-why-ethereum-could-change-the-world-1b24a8ba1aef?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 30, 2017", "readtime": "12 min read", "upvotes": "4.3K", "content": "Beyond Bitcoin: Why Ethereum Could Change The\u00a0WorldSmart Contracts, DApps, and ICOs will become the new internet.

Maybe you even brought up Bitcoin at Thanksgiving during the lull between your grandma talking about how she doesn\u2019t usually like turkey because it\u2019s so dry and your cousin spilling gravy all over himself. The reception was strong and now you feel like an expert. Well calm down buddy, because we\u2019ve still got a lot to learn.Bitcoin is only the tip of the iceberg. If we really want to understand the potential of blockchain, let\u2019s talk about Ethereum. Established in 2014, Ethereum is the new kid on the block. If Bitcoin is the traditionalist, the guy who sits in coffee shops and reads Hemmingway, Ethereum is the visionary, the Red Bull drinking, hold-my-beer-while-I-try-this type kid. And it took the crypto world by storm.Vitalik ButerinThe Ethereum project is headed by Vitalik Buterin, a 23-year-old, and he truly is one of the geniuses of our time. In 2013, Buterin envisioned a decentralized internet, on which anyone could build applications. This system would solve the current issues of our internet: the lack of available trust. As we understand, Bitcoin uses the blockchain, a decentralized and unchangeable method of information storage, to secure and confirm transactions on the Bitcoin network. Buterin created a new blockchain, one that transcended the limitations of transactions. What were you doing at 19?When the internet was first developed, it was used for porn. The internet wasn\u2019t advanced enough to support YouTube, Facebook, and endless animal GIFs. But it could support basic images\u200a\u2014\u200aand teenagers everywhere rejoiced. Just as how in the early internet days, porn was the simplest application of the technology, Bitcoin utilizes the simplest function for the blockchain: transactions. Ethereum however, can do much more.The peak of our technological prowessWhat can Ethereum\u00a0do?Ethereum is the main platform of today\u2019s blockchain world. Ethereum is the operating system. Ethereum is the canvas, the paper, or that bar bathroom wall that you can\u2019t help but read. It is the protocol people build upon. Ethereum is a generalized blockchain; it\u2019s not specialized for any one purpose (unlike Bitcoin\u2019s). It is generalized so that anyone can program it for their specific needs. Information and transactions are still placed in blocks and secured by miners, but the information doesn\u2019t only need to be purely \u201csend and receive\u201d transactions; it can be used for far more complex applications. Just like with the internet, Ethereum is the toolbox for the development of this new technology\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s up to developers and innovators to make use of the tools.Let\u2019s explore the toolbox of Ethereum and then we\u2019ll look at what those tools can build.When I came up with Ethereum, my first first thought was, \u2018Okay, this thing is too good to be true.\u2019 As it turned out, the core Ethereum idea was good\u200a\u2014\u200afundamentally, completely sound.\u200a\u2014\u200aVitalik\u00a0ButerinSmart ContractsEthereum\u2019s most revolutionary technology is smart contracts. Anyone can deploy an Ethereum smart contract and the blockchain secures them in a decentralized and transparent manner. In today\u2019s world, contracts can be any agreement, from corporate agreements to that fantasy football league that you WILL win one of these years! But a contract in its simplest form is a \u201cif\u201d and \u201cthen\u201d agreement. If Bob wins the fantasy football league, then he has bragging rights for the whole year. If Ron can eat 23 crepes in an hour, then he doesn\u2019t pay the bill (a questionable incentive\u2026but anything goes in college towns). But since the restaurant might still charge Ron for those crepes after he eats them, we put contracts in writing and rely on lawyers, judges, and our institutions to enforce their terms. A smart contract on the other hand, is simply a cryptographically secured digital contract that enforces the terms via code.Welcome to the\u00a0futureThe vending machine that you walk to every ten minutes at work because it\u2019s \u201cnot technically a break\u201d is the simplest example of a smart contract. There is a simple program running inside that receives an input and produces an output. If a dollar is put in and A4 pressed, then a Snickers will fall. Don\u2019t put in the dollar, don\u2019t get the Snickers, it doesn\u2019t matter how much your shake it. Ethereum enables anyone\u200a\u2014\u200awell, maybe not anyone considering my grandma still doesn\u2019t have an email account, but anyone with programming knowledge\u200a\u2014\u200ato program their own smart contracts.So what does that mean in reality? It means that an unchangeable contract can be created, that can be seen by everyone, and where the terms are automatically enforced. For example, imagine that for Bob, bragging rights are not enough to incentivize him to spend his weeks pouring over football stats. He wants prize money. So everyone playing in the league throws in $10. Currently, either one trustworthy member of the league holds the cash, or they must use a third-party site to hold the money. Trust must be placed in one of these entities; for a $10 bet, the risk is minimal. But with huge amounts of money, there are serious risks associated with trusting middle men\u200a\u2014\u200alet alone the additional fees. A smart contract could be programmed where all the money is sent to the Ethereum contract. The contract holds the money with the condition that the winner of the league will receive the funds. When proof of victory is provided to the contract, the funds release. If anyone breaks the terms of the agreement, their money is forfeited. No need for lawyers, judges, courts, or credit. There is no way to cheat and Bob gets his money. There\u2019s just unfortunately still no way of encoding bragging rights.DApps\u200a\u2014\u200aDecentralized ApplicationsEthereum allows any company to use their open source code to build upon the Ethereum blockchain. This allows people to have an easy-to-use and programmable blockchain that can be customized for their needs. Companies are created with fascinating ideas that utilize the toolbox that Ethereum provides. These applications address many issues and weaknesses that we have in our systems today, but likely most of the revolutionary ideas have not even been created yet.So what makes a DApp a DApp? First, the application is decentralized. This is the most important characteristic. The DApp has open source code that anyone can read and verify and it isn\u2019t controlled by any one entity. All the data from the application is stored in a public blockchain. And the application uses a token to allow users to interact with the DApp in a decentralized way.Here\u2019s a basic metaphor for how this system would work. Imagine a mall with lots of stores. The mall is Ethereum\u200a\u2014\u200ait provides the sellers with the framework for the store. The store\u200a\u2014\u200aPho Real (trademarked name so don\u2019t even think about taking it)\u200a\u2014\u200ais the DApp, but it\u2019s not owned by anyone. Instead, ownership of the store is shared by all those who work in the store in some manner. The rules of Pho Real are made public and can only be changed if a majority of the workers agree to the change. But you can\u2019t spend dollars at Pho Real. You can only spend X Coin. X Coin is the special token for the store. Just like how at a casino, you can\u2019t spend dollars, you can only spend purchased chips, it works the same at this store. And X Coin\u2019s information and transactions are all stored within the mall\u2019s vault, which is the Ethereum blockchain. Now when this store is created, to raise money for the general store operations, the store decides on how many of X Coin to create. Let\u2019s say they create 10,000 of them. They then sell these coins to anyone who would like to purchase them. This is what the cryptocurrency world calls an ICO\u200a\u2014\u200aInitial Coin Offering. Now the store is still in production; whether or not it delivers on its promise of providing a one-stop-shop for all your Pho-related needs remains to be seen. But since there are only 10,000 X Coins in creation, if this store offers a high demand product, the coin will also be in high demand and the price will rise. This is exactly what happens today. People purchase these tokens because they believe that one day, many people will want to use the product offered by the project, and that the demand for tokens will increase dramatically.An overview of many of the projects in the blockchain spaceExamples:\u00a0IEx.Ec and other cloud computing services: these DApps want to create a cloud computer. Today, when you aren\u2019t using your computer, your computer\u2019s processing power and graphics power stop working. But there are plenty of people around the world who, while you\u2019re catching up on some Zzz, are trying to digitally delete their ex-girlfriend from all their prom photos or download the entire collection of Friends and could use a little help. These programs allow users to rent out the unused computing power of other people on the network at a price. People would merely connect to the network and commit their GPU or CPU. A smart contract would hold their computing resources which would be made available to a buyer if that buyer put money into the smart contract (sounds like a vending machine, right?). That money must be in the form of that company\u2019s unique digital token. There is no risk, because if either the buyer or seller doesn\u2019t uphold their end of the bargain, the contract is reversed. It\u2019s 100% trustworthy. You don\u2019t need a lawyer to tell you that.The GOATGambling\u00a0:Both sides place their bets into the smart contract. The terms of the bet are programmed into the smart contract. If Tom Brady throws 5 touchdowns, Brad wins the bet. The contract only executes when it receives word of Brady\u2019s magnificent performance\u200a\u2014\u200aand good god, who wouldn\u2019t want to bet on the guy? Fees for setting a bet are paid with the ecosystem\u2019s token.There are tens of other use cases\u200a\u2014\u200afuture article idea?ICOsAs I mentioned above, and this deserves its own future article as well, ICOs are the new fundraising tool for blockchain startups. The companies create a business project and a token on the Ethereum blockchain. The token is offered for sale by use of a smart contract. The smart contract basically says that if you transfer this amount of Token Y, you will get this amount of our token. You buy the token as an investment opportunity and the company fundraises for initial capital.Greater use\u00a0casesAs our world transitions more and more into the digital world, this technology will be central in many of our industries. Soon, real world assets\u200a\u2014\u200aownership of cars and houses, diamonds and gold, and supply chain shipments\u200a\u2014\u200awill be digitized. They will have a digital identity and can be traded, sold, tracked, and verified. The blockchain can store these assets while also protecting the information associated with them. With the Internet of Things, every electronic device in your house, from your coffee pot, fridge, and car, will be able to communicate and coordinate with one another. All these developments, combined with smart contracts and blockchain, create enormous potential.Here are how smart contracts, DApps, and all the other tools in the Ethereum toolbox come together. Imagine how apartment renting works today. Creditors track social reputation and ensure that each party is relatively trustworthy. Sites like Airbnb have two options to provide security: One, they rely on reviews to provide confidence that Bill and Sally from Missouri aren\u2019t a modern day Bonnie and Clyde. But that\u2019s hardly foolproof. Or two, they request and hold lots of your personal information to hold you accountable, personal information that a middleman like Airbnb has no right to hold, is vulnerable to theft, and that ultimately they can (and do) abuse.Or instead, the traditional route uses contracts written by lawyers and enforced in a court of law if either party breaks the agreement. Each of these actors takes a fee for their services. With Ethereum smart contracts and the digitization of real world assets, those players become obsolete. Imagine that I have an apartment for rent. I use a DApp to create a smart contract with all the terms of the rental. I deploy this smart contract and transfer the digital key for the apartment to the smart contract. You come along and want to rent the apartment. You first transfer your payment to the contract. The contract executes and sends the key code to your phone. In the future, you will likely have a scanner on that door that reads the digital key on your phone. Viola! If you stop paying the rent, the code and ownership is transferred back to me. No work on your end needed. No lawyers, brokers, creditors, or real estate agents needed, and you can finally explore the Alaskan backcountry without needing to climb mountains to find that cell service.Here are some of the potential industries that this technology could\u00a0disruptSo what is\u00a0Ether?Ether is Pho Real\u2019s X Coin, but for Ethereum. Any interaction with the Ethereum blockchain costs a fee. That fee is paid in its native token: ether. This includes sending ether to other people or interacting with an Ethereum smart contract. You know how your inbox is full of emails promising \u201cPenis Enlargement\u201d and \u201cRussian Dates?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aok, maybe they\u2019re just targeting me. But regardless, if it cost a penny to send an email, spam would likely cease to exist. With Ethereum, it works the same way. Because the Ethereum blockchain uses the same mining principals of bitcoin, the speed with which it can process transactions is limited. Thus, to cut down on \u201cspam\u201d transactions that just bog down the network, a fee is charged. This fee also rewards miners on the network, just like with Bitcoin! Thus, the more DApps and users that utilize the Ethereum blockchain, the more demand there will be for ether, and the higher the price will rise.\u201cEthereum has taken what was a four-function calculator of a programming language in Bitcoin and turned it into a full-fledged computer.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aFred Ehrsam, Cofounder of\u00a0CoinbaseSummaryIf you feel like technology just slapped you in the face, welcome to the blockchain world. Welcome to the Internet 3.0. It\u2019s only going to get crazier from here.What people fail to realize about Bitcoin, is that it was simply the messenger for this technology. While Bitcoin very well might be the single greatest investment of the 21st century, it was Bitcoin\u2019s ability to create digital scarcity and a decentralized security system that was revolutionary. Blockchain, smart contracts, and digital assets could disrupt entire industries. As Uber disrupted the taxi industry, Apple the cell phone market, and top ramen beat out every other food option for college students, Ethereum could do the same for finance, online shopping, micro-lending, and ownership.Now you\u2019ve just finished your third article. Too bad Thanksgiving is gone and you missed your chance to talk about Ethereum. Well Christmas and Hanukkah are right around the corner and I\u2019m sure your family would appreciate some Ethereum-small-talk. So brush up on your lingo, ask lots of questions, and prepare to blow away your tech savvy Uncle Steve.Part 4: https://medium.com/blockchain-for-grandma/round-4-grandma-versus-bitcoin-f39ca4d2112b", "responses": "7"}, {"title": "How Coinbase Builds Secure Infrastructure To Store Bitcoin In The\u00a0Cloud", "author_name": "Brian Armstrong", "link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/how-coinbase-builds-secure-infrastructure-to-store-bitcoin-in-the-cloud-30a6504e40ba?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 28, 2016", "readtime": "10 min read", "upvotes": "778", "content": "How Coinbase Builds Secure Infrastructure To Store Bitcoin In The\u00a0CloudOr how to build paranoid infrastructure on top of\u00a0AWSBrian ArmstrongBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 28, 2016Three and a half years ago, Coinbase launched using a simple hosting platform: Heroku.It was the right solution at the time. With just two technical founders building the product (neither with any serious dev-ops experience) we knew that Heroku would be more battle tested than any solution we could hack together on our own.But we also knew this wouldn\u2019t work forever. Early in our company\u2019s history, we started to contemplate the next version of our infrastructure that would run inside AWS. It had to be built from the ground up with security in mind (the most common ways that bitcoin companies die is due to theft and hacking) but we didn\u2019t want to compromise on engineering happiness and productivity.After about a year, we finally completed the transition and we\u2019ve been running inside AWS for quite some time now. This post outlines some of what we learned during the transition. It can be used as a starting point to building paranoid and productive infrastructure in the cloud.Today, Coinbase securely stores about 10% of all bitcoin in circulation.Disclaimer: Though we discuss some of our security measures below, our security measures are continually evolving. These are just a few measures that have existed at one point in our growth. For more on our approach to security, see this YouTube talk.Layered Security & No Single Point Of\u00a0FailureTwo of the most important principles we followed when designing our infrastructure are layered security and eliminating single points of failure. Both of these concepts encourage you to not put all your eggs in one basket. Instead, strive for redundancy and consensus amongst multiple parties. These concepts are used heavily in bank security, nuclear launches, certificate authorities, corporate governance, and even human resources.Separate passwords and second factor tokens amongst different people.A simple example of this in practice is securing your administrator account on AWS with a two factor token that is controlled by a second person. If you have one person who controls the password to the account, give the second factor token to another party. Store the second factor in a vault or safe deposit box off site for some physical (in addition to crypto) based security.It can prevent a single person maliciously (or accidentally) ending the company.Lock Down Production AccessThe developers on your team should not have (or need) production SSH access to do their regular work (deploying code, spinning up new services, debugging, etc).However, it is difficult to entirely eliminate the need for SSH access. Some people in the company will always need a way to debug obscure problems. When people do need SSH access, here is how you can lock it down:Add two factor to your SSHEvery SSH should require a second factor. You can use Duo two factor authentication for SSH which pushes an approval request to your phone, or a FIDO U2F key which is like a small hardware security module on a USB stick. As mentioned above, if you don\u2019t want anyone to be able to unilaterally SSH into production, you can even separate these keys and require all SSH to be \u201cpair programmed\u201d.Use special laptops for SSH accessYou may want to avoid being able to SSH into production using your regular laptop. Getting malware on a laptop due to spear phishing has been responsible for many (if not most) of the high profile breaches we\u2019ve seen in recent years. People often assume that hacks are caused by 0-day vulnerabilities or other sophisticated techniques. But in reality, simple spear phishing (clicking on spoofed links in emails) is far more likely to get you. We\u2019ve seen attackers dedicate 6 months or more to establishing relationships, all with the intent of spear phishing. Set aside some special machines in the office that are in a locked room, that you only use for SSH access. Throw a Dropcam in the room to record who enters and leaves. Don\u2019t use the machines in the room to open email, or browse the internet (you can use your regular laptop for this). You should probably wipe these special SSH machines on a regular basis as well.Heavily Audit SSH AccessSet up bastion hosts that all SSH requests must run through. Restrict who has access to these least-privilege hosts and let the team know when they\u2019re accessed (via Slack notifications). You can also wake people up (PagerDuty) when certain commands are issued. To avoid an untraceable action after getting inside, durably log every action and keystroke which goes through the bastion host. Coinbase wrote a custom piece of software to handle this portion, and it may be something we open source in the future. The storage of the SSH logs is just as important, since they often contain sensitive info. We run a separate disaster recovery environment that guarantees storage of every action in our environment for at least 10 years. Immutable logging is important because it gives you an audit trail if a breach ever happens to find the root cause.Limit SSH access to people who are less likely to stealSet up special rules around who gets production access. For each employee who gets access, run a background check on them to check for criminal records, make copies of their driver\u2019s license and passport, and you may even want to collect a copy of their fingerprints. Make sure you have everything you need to issue an arrest warrant if something ever goes wrong. This one can be controversial, but you may want to only grant production access to people who are citizens of the country where you operate, especially if they have family ties there. Most people would be unwilling to steal $1M if it meant never being able to see their friends and family ever again. You want to create a culture where production access is taken very seriously. It should come with a great deal of responsibility and oversight.Cold storageIf you have any particularly sensitive keys (in our case, bitcoin private keys) try storing them entirely offline (air-gapped). Coinbase early on made a decision to store the vast majority (98%+) of customer bitcoin entirely offline, in safe deposit boxes.Air-gapped security.Version one looked like this. Just some USB drives (and paper backups) stored in a safe deposit box at a local bank.We\u2019re now on version three of our cold storage and it has come a long way. Keys are generated offline in a secure environment, and split using Shamir\u2019s secret sharing. Each private key is divided into parts, and some subset of the pieces are required to restore the secret. This way some pieces can be lost and the secret is still recoverable (redundancy). It also requires a quorum of key-holders to come together to restore a key (consensus).Key holders are geographically distributed and follow a protocol during key signing ceremonies to verify their identity and assure the integrity of the ceremony.Here is a simple example of generating a 2 of 3 key (where at least 2 of the 3 pieces are required to recombine the secret) using Hashicorp\u2019s open source Vault Project. You can require 5 of 10 pieces or any threshold you\u2019re comfortable with.Log All The\u00a0ThingsIn addition to logging production access (as mentioned before), you should log everything happening across all containers in your infrastructure.It is critical to have a good audit trail if there ever is an incident. The only thing worse than being hacked, is being hacked but not knowing how it happened. Your only option then is to hope you\u2019ve patched the right thing, and relaunch with fingers crossed (guess and check).Great logging also creates a deterrent against theft. People are less likely to steal if they feel there is a chance they will get caught.Designing an environment focused on low-latency and high variety logs required a new design for our new infrastructure. To reduce the complexity of logging, we wanted to push all of our logs through one place that could be consumed in many ways. Running bitcoin nodes around the world required our logging endpoints to be accessible across many networks. To minimize the complexity of adding log producers and consumers, we now pipe every event across Coinbase through a streaming, distributed log (Kinesis) that provides flexible at-least-once guaranteed processing and a multi-day buffer of data that can be replayed as needed.We run a fleet of Docker containers that process the entirety of this pipe to perform a variety of transformations, evaluations and transfer data to more permanent homes for archival, search and more.Anomaly DetectionAnother piece of software that we built looks for irregularities in the logs flowing through Kinesis. It has three levels of alerts when it detects something:WarningsWarnings appear in our infrastructure Slack channel and can be passively observed by the team to get context. An example would be someone attempting to brute force passwords (and running into our rate limiting).ErrorsErrors trigger PagerDuty so that someone gets woken up even if it is the middle of the night. These represent more serious issues that require immediate attention. An example would be an unusual movement of funds.Critical issuesThese can trigger a kill switch we have set up that gracefully shuts down critical services (including outgoing payment processing). Kill switches require their own key signing ceremonies to re-enable them. An example of a critical issue would be unauthorized access to certain machines or services.Consensus Based\u00a0DeploysEarlier I mentioned that developers shouldn\u2019t need production access to do their regular work. One of the most common tasks in development is deploying new code.To solve this, we\u2019ve developed a number of tools in our infrastructure around the idea of consensus. We believe in a 3 phase process where anyone should be able to propose any change, but consensus should be achieved before that proposal can be applied. One of our tools enabling this is called Sauron which comments on every pull request. It requires approvals on pull requests (+1\u2019s from other developers) before code can be deployed into production.This particular branch, requires a +1 from two developers other than the author. But more sensitive services in our SOA can require even more approvers of special types. During periods of increased risk, such as if you suspect someone\u2019s laptop has been compromised, you can dial the number of +1\u2019s up as high as is needed system wide (without blocking all deploys). This protects against the case where one or more developers get malware on their laptop.We also use this idea of consensus based changes when making updating our environment (such as the docker-compose files we use to launch our services). Anyone can propose a change, but no single person can push a change to production.We\u2019ve been running entirely on Docker in production for over a year now. Prior to the influx of new deployment tools (and looking to embrace a consensus approach to deployment), we started building our own tool, CodeFlow. Codeflow gives each developer the power to deploy their code by combining a Dockerfile, Docker-Compose file, and Envars to deploy 12-factor applications. We could probably write a whole blog post on this single tool, but the goal of it is to combine consensus based deployment with the developer productivity and happiness of Heroku.ConclusionThis post just scratches the surface of what it takes to build secure/paranoid infrastructure in the cloud (as you can see there are a lot of moving parts!).

Today, we\u2019re pleased to update you on the launch of bitcoin futures contracts developed by Bakkt in collaboration with ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Clear US. We\u2019ve worked closely with the CFTC to develop contracts that both meet our customers\u2019 needs for trading, transparency, and market certainty, and are also compliant with Federal regulations.Customers active in crypto markets\u200a\u2014\u200aand many still waiting to get in\u200a\u2014\u200ahave had a voice in shaping the design of the initial product offering. As detailed in the ICE Futures U.S. filing with the CFTC today, bitcoin futures will be listed on a federally regulated futures exchange in the coming months.In conjunction with our exchange and clearing partners at ICE, we\u2019ll be working with our customers over the next several weeks to prepare for user acceptance testing (UAT) for futures and custody, which we expect to start in July. We\u2019ll provide more details in upcoming posts, but we expect to use UAT to ensure that customers have time to onboard and can test the trading and custody model we\u2019ve built to their satisfaction.The new bitcoin futures contracts have been shaped by our conversations with stakeholders, and offer unique trading, security and risk management features:1. Two futures contracts will be listed: 1) A daily settlement bitcoin future, which will enable customers to transact in a same-day market. And 2) a monthly bitcoin futures contract will enable trading in the front month and across the forward pricing curve.2. Price formation in these benchmark contracts will be supported by proven tools to detect abusive or disruptive trading practices, including wash trades. That means that the settlement prices on ICE Futures U.S. will be based on prices discovered in our physical delivery contracts without relying on unregulated cash markets.3. The futures contracts will be margined by ICE Clear US, including the collection of initial margin collateral and variation margin to manage risk. This approach is consistent with capital-efficient risk management practices in global futures markets, ranging from oil and gold to interest rates and equity index futures.4. Bakkt will contribute $35 million into the clearinghouse risk waterfall. This puts our own \u201cskin in the game\u201d and aligns our interests for market integrity and safety with market participants.5. For physical delivery and secure storage of bitcoin, an integrated custody service will be fulfilled by Bakkt\u2019s qualified custodian, subject to regulatory approval. Safekeeping will be supported by insurance, cybersecurity, and comprehensive compliance, including an anti-money-laundering program and blockchain analytics.As we also shared last week, we\u2019re working with the New York State Department of Financial Services to become a trust company and operate as a qualified custodian for digital assets, alongside our CFTC-regulated futures products. That work continues and will enable custody for delivery of bitcoin futures.Closing out, I\u2019ll note that our team continues to expand at Bakkt. We recently welcomed Marc D\u2019Annunzio onboard as our General Counsel. Marc\u2019s breadth and depth of experience, which includes securities law, M&A, and international regulatory matters in the payments industry, is truly impressive. He will lead our management of legal, regulatory, compliance and governance matters at the company. Marc was most recently with the Atlanta office of Alston & Bird, where he practiced in its Payments Group.As we help bring digital assets mainstream, we\u2019ll continue our collaboration with regulators and customers.

HardingBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 12, 2017Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) are a proposed addition to Bitcoin that allows for smaller transaction sizes, more privacy, and larger smart contracts. In this post, we\u2019ll explore the basics of MAST, describe its potential benefits, and summarize some of the current proposals to add it to the Bitcoin Protocol.The problem: unused script\u00a0dataSatoshi Nakamoto gave Bitcoin an interesting feature that wasn\u2019t described in the original whitepaper. Instead of requiring bitcoins be received to a public key and spent by a digital signature, Nakamoto gave users the ability to write programs (called scripts) that would act as dynamic public keys and signatures.When you specify a script \u2014which is the default in every wallet\u200a\u2014\u200athe consensus-enforced Bitcoin Protocol won\u2019t let anyone spend your bitcoins unless the script returns True. This allows you to specify restrictions, called encumbrances, such as requiring the spending transaction be signed by your private key.More complex encumbrances are possible too, such as the following example we\u2019ll use throughout this article: Alice wants to be able to spend her bitcoins at any time, but if her bitcoins aren\u2019t spent within three months (maybe because she\u2019s dead or incapacitated), she wants her siblings Bob and Charlie to have her bitcoins as long as they can agree on where to spend them.The encumbrance script below which specifies the policy described above includes not just Alice\u2019s public key (needed to verify a signature from her private key) but also some conditional logic, a time out, and the public keys for both Bob and Charlie.In the current Bitcoin Protocol, all of the data above must be added to the block chain when Alice\u2019s bitcoins are spent. That includes the parts of the script that don\u2019t get used in a particular spend, such as Bob\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s public keys on the occasions when Alice spends her own bitcoins.Unused encumbrance data increases the size of transactions, reduces privacy by publicly disclosing more information than necessary, and primarily limits smart contracts by their size rather than by their validation costs. MAST seeks to improve this situation by removing the need to directly include unused parts of a script in the block chain.The origins of\u00a0MASTThe idea behind MAST\u00b9 comes from two pre-existing concepts, abstract syntax trees and merkle trees. Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) are a way of describing a program by splitting it into its individual parts, which can make it easier to analyze and optimize. To generate an AST, you connect each function to its dependencies until all of the dependencies have been mapped out. Here\u2019s an AST for the example encumbrance described above:On the other hand, merkle trees allow you to verify that an individual element is a member of a set without the whole set being present. For example, Bitcoin SPV wallets use merkle trees to save bandwidth by verifying that individual received transactions are a member of a block without downloading the full block.Example merkle\u00a0treeTo generate a merkle tree, each member is individually hashed, producing a short unique identifier for that member. Each of those identifiers is then paired with another identifier and hashed again, producing another short unique identifier for that pair. This step is repeated until only one identifier remains, called the merkle root, which uniquely identifies the whole set in just a few bytes of data.To verify that a particular member is part of the set, someone with the whole set provides you with just the identifiers you need in order to connect that particular member to the merkle root of the whole set. This proof that the member belongs to the set is called a merkle proof.In short, the technique behind ASTs allows us to split a program into its individual parts, and merkle trees allow us to verify the individual parts belong to a complete program without the entire program being present. This is the basis of MAST, which allows spenders to replace the unused parts of encumbrances with a merkle proof\u200a\u2014\u200areducing transaction size, increasing privacy, and making larger smart contracts possible.An example of\u00a0MASTLet\u2019s take our example encumbrance from above and split it into separate sub-scripts for each of the two possible outcomes we allow:Alice can spend her bitcoins at any time (below left)Or, after three months pass without Alice\u2019s bitcoins being spent, Bob and Charlie can agree where to spend Alice\u2019s bitcoins (below right)Let\u2019s create a merkle tree based on these two independent sub-scripts:The merkle root for this tree uniquely identifies Alice\u2019s complete encumbrance in just 32 bytes of data. Alice then uses a substitute encumbrance that says that a spender must provide a merkle proof connecting the merkle root to one of the sub-scripts and that the sub-script must return True.The merkle proof with sub-script could be visualized like either of the examples below depending on which sub-script we wanted to use:Benefit #1\u200a\u2014\u200asmaller transactionsLet\u2019s start our examination of the benefits of MAST by looking at how it allows users of complex encumbrances to create smaller transactions.In the example section above, we used an encumbrance that had two sub-scripts: either Alice spent her funds, or Bob and Charlie waited three months and spent the funds themselves. Let\u2019s imagine an infinitely-extendable version of this where a third sub-script says that after three months and one day, Dan and Edith can spend the funds; or a fourth sub-script says that after three months and two days, Fred and George can spend the funds; etc\u2026This gives us the ability to create the following simple plot that shows the number of sub-scripts and how much encumbrance data needs to be added to the block chain with and without MAST in order to make that possible.Here\u2019s the same plot in log scale:Although MAST starts off being slightly more expensive than the same example script without MAST for just two sub-scripts, non-MAST increases in cost linearly while MAST increases only logarithmically.If saving bytes is the primary goal, this can be optimized further. For many encumbrances, spenders are much more likely to use one condition than the others. For example, Alice is hoping to live for a long time, so she constructs her merkle tree so that her spending condition is always near the top and all other conditions are on the bottom.This gives us two different sizes for the MAST merkle proof, one for the best case where Alice is alive and spending her bitcoins, and one for the other cases where Alice is dead and her beneficiaries are spending her bitcoins; let\u2019s overlay those sizes on the previous plot.We can see that Alice is now always using the same number of bytes in the best case no matter how many potential beneficiaries she adds to her encumbrance, and that the other potential spenders only use a few more bytes than the previous normal case.Whichever arrangement Alice chooses, we see that MAST can make encumbrances with multiple sub-scripts much smaller, reducing transaction size so that users can pay less in fees and blocks can hold a greater number of advanced transactions.Benefit #2\u200a\u2014\u200amore\u00a0privacyBecause we\u2019ve been discussing Alice\u2019s example in depth throughout this article, you know all the details of the encumbrance, but imagine if all you saw was the data actually added to the block chain when Alice spent her bitcoins (below, left example):With just this information, you wouldn\u2019t know whether or not anyone besides Alice could access the funds or what conditions might restrict their spending. You might guess from the use of MAST that there were other conditions, but that would be only a guess\u200a\u2014\u200aAlice might be just pretending to have other spendable parts of her merkle tree.Alternatively, if all you saw was the other branch (above, right example), you wouldn\u2019t know that the funds were spendable before the timeout or that a single person (Alice) could spend them. Again, you might guess that there were other conditions, but you couldn\u2019t be sure just by looking at the block chain.The ability to keep private any unused encumbrance conditions can be quite important to some users, such as businesses who want to keep their smart contract arrangements as confidential as possible from potential competitors. This stands in contrast to some altcoins that claim to be designed specifically for smart contracts but which provide no privacy for any part of those contracts.Privacy can also provide another benefit that applies to all Bitcoin users, even those who don\u2019t care about encumbrance privacy itself. Imagine that Alice is the only person who ever uses the non-MAST encumbrance template from the first section of this article. Because the full encumbrance is public, anyone can track all of Alice\u2019s spending just by looking for cases where that template is used, destroying Alice\u2019s privacy.Anything that makes it easy to identify particular users also makes it easy to treat their bitcoins differently than other people\u2019s bitcoins, called a lack of fungibility. If someone knows what Alice\u2019s encumbrances look like, they can bribe or force miners not to mine those transactions in order to prevent Alice from spending her bitcoins.MAST alone can\u2019t entirely fix this because Alice (or Bob and Charlie) still need to reveal part of the encumbrance when Alice\u2019s bitcoins are spent, but it is possible that many different complex encumbrances can be resolved down to a smaller number of simple MAST-style encumbrances.For example, Alice\u2019s default spend looks like the default spend for any transaction where just a single signature is required, so Alice\u2019s MAST-based transactions blend in with other MAST-based single-signature transactions. This returns Alice\u2019s privacy and increases both her fungibility and the fungibility of everyone else who uses MAST-based encumbrances that can be satisfied by a single signature.This particular benefit of MAST is likely to combine well with other proposed features that improve privacy and fungibility for Bitcoin users by allowing certain complex encumbrances to by satisfied by a single digital signature, for example Pieter Wuille\u2019s and Gregory Maxwell\u2019s generalized threshold trees, Andrew Poelstra\u2019s scriptless scripts, and Thaddeus Dryja\u2019s discrete log contracts.But even if none of those things ever becomes possible on Bitcoin, MAST by itself provides users with more privacy and more fungibility for sophisticated encumbrances than they can get today on any altcoin that supports smart contracts through user-specified encumbrances.Benefit #3\u200a\u2014\u200alarger smart contractsBitcoin has three different byte size hard limits that apply to individual scripts depending on how the encumbrance is constructed: a 10,000-byte limit added in July 2010 for bare scripts, a 520-byte limit for P2SH, and a 10,000-byte limit for segwit. Let\u2019s overlay these thresholds on the size chart we used previously.We can see that even for our very basic infinitely-extendable example, MAST makes it possible to have many more conditional branches than would be allowed using any other current mechanism. Indeed, MAST scales so well that if you had at your disposal all of the energy believed to exist in the entire observable universe, you could only create a balanced merkle tree whose merkle proof would be about 8,448 bytes in size. Yet even a merkle proof of that size could be validated in less than a millisecond by a full node running on any modern laptop.There are other limits that also apply to Bitcoin scripts which MAST allows bypassing by virtue of not requiring full nodes process unused sub-scripts. In this aspect MAST laudably preserves and extends a long-held design goal of Bitcoin smart contracts, which is that as much as possible of the contract burden should be placed on the contract participants, and that network nodes whose use of bandwidth, memory, and processing power goes uncompensated should be burdened as little as possible.So the real achievement of MAST is not that it allows Bitcoin users to create more advanced smart contracts than before, but that it does so without placing any new worst-case burdens on Bitcoin nodes.Making MAST possible: multiple proposed\u00a0methodsSo far, two methods have been proposed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list for enabling the use of MAST in the Bitcoin Protocol, both of which are still draft proposals subject to change.The first proposal is BIP114 by Johnson Lau (jl2012), which uses a segwit-based extension feature that allows native segwit addresses (bech32) to commit to the merkle root of a MAST encumbrance. Spenders can then select a single sub-script from the tree.The second proposal is two yet-unnumbered BIPs (1, 2) by Mark Friedenbach (maaku), which increase the flexibility of the Script language in a way that allows programmers to write scripts that can themselves validate MAST-based encumbrances. If implemented in Friedenbach\u2019s preferred way, this would make it possible to use merkle proofs in all three types of scripts currently supported by Bitcoin (bare, P2SH, and segwit).Both approaches present tradeoffs when compared to each other but either approach will provide the benefits described previously (plus or minus a few bytes). Either approach can be activated as a soft fork.Conclusion: so when do we get\u00a0MAST?After describing the benefits of MAST and briefly mentioning two proposals that would make it available on Bitcoin, you\u2019re probably wondering when you\u2019ll be able to use it. Sadly, I don\u2019t know.The path from idea, to proposal, to complete implementation, to proposed soft fork, to activated soft fork is not straightforward. I think the two years of drama surrounding segwit made that clear.But it does seem to me that the basic idea behind MAST is something that has strong support among the Bitcoin technical community, and that the developers most interested in MAST will continue working on it unless it is proven to be completely untenable. Should those developers succeed in producing peer-reviewed soft-fork-ready code, it will be up to the readers of this article and other Bitcoin users to decide whether or not MAST becomes part of the Bitcoin Protocol.Further readingBIP114: Merklized Abstract Syntax Tree by Johnson LauTail Call Sematics by Mark FriedenbachMerkleBranchVerify opcode by Mark FriedenbachDiscussion at core.tech meetup by Mark Friedenbach (transcribed by Bryan Bishop)Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees by Jeremy Rubin, Manali Naik, Nitya SubramanianAn explanation and justification of the tail-call and MBV approach to MAST by Mark FriedenbachMaking MAST Meaningful by Brian DeeryThe next step to improve Bitcoin by Aaron van WirdumAcknowledgementsI thank Mark Friedenbach, Jimmy Song, and John Newbery for their reviews of drafts of this article.

Please check out the latest and enhanced version of this guide on Github:https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/blob/master/thundroid/README.mdMy goal is to create the perfect Bitcoin Lightning node, running on unfairly cheap hardware, set up completely trustless from scratch. This guide brings you what I think is a near perfect solution.Running our own nodes is important, both to learn more about this amazing technology, and also keep the network decentralized by not trusting any third party.Being able to do that on cheap hardware is important. This is why I published the Beginner\u2019s Guide to Lightning on a Raspberry Pi (my RaspiBolt) which created a lot of positive feedback.The Pi is available everywhere and has a huge community. It has some drawbacks, however, mainly in the area of performance and the the hassle with attaching external storage that is important when storing the whole Bitcoin blockchain. One feedback sparked my interest to consider the Odroid HC2 mini-computer.ODROID HC2 | HardkernelHardkernel ODROID HC2 is a mini PC that run Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Arch and OMW. Installed with a high performance SATA and Gigabit Ethernet port, with metal frame body designed to store a 2.5\" HDD/SSD or 3.5\" HDD with great heat dissipation. www.hardkernel.comCompared to the Rasperry Pi, it has the following advantages:price comparable to Raspberry Pimore powerful (8 core CPU, 2 GB RAM, Gigabit Ethernet)internal housing of harddisk, direct connection using SATA3only one power adapter for everythingNot available are features like HDMI output, built-in Wifi or GPIO pins, all of which are not relevant to this project, however.Performance is way better and production is guaranteed until at least 2020 (and longer, if parts are available), thus it seems more future-proof.Performance of Odroid HC2 is identical to XU4 (which is more of a media\u00a0pc)I decided to try this setup, ordered the Odroid HC2 and, after setting it up and running it for a month now, I think this is as good as it gets for a low-cost Bitcoin / Lightning node. This is why I am going to describe the setup of a Bitcoin Core full node with a LND lightning node here, in case you might want to try this as well.As this project needs a cheesy name as well, I\u2019ll call my node Thundroid.\u00a0:-)PurposeMy aim is to set up a trustless Bitcoin Core and Lightning node that runs 24/7, is part of and supports the decentralization of the Lightning network by routing payments and can be used to send and receive personal payments using the command line interface.This server is set up without graphical user interface and is used remotely using the Secure Shell (SSH) command line. In the future, this server should function as my personal backend for desktop and mobile wallets, I\u2019m not quite there yet. So, command line it is for the moment.Spoiler alert, this is the goal of this guide, simply buying a Blockaccino:Things on my bucket & todo list: web interface, desktop und mobile wallet.Please note that only the setup for Lightning on Bitcoin testnet is described at the moment. Once a well-tested mainnet release of Lightning is available, I will update this guide and provide update instructions.Target audienceThis will not be a beginner\u2019s guide, but the setup is comparable to the RaspiBolt guide, so you can easily get more detailed explanations from there. The goal is to do everything ourselves, no shortcuts that involve trust in a 3rd party allowed. This makes this guide quite technical, but I try to make it as straightforward as possible.Also, please be aware that all Lightning implementations are still in alpha phase and bugs are to be expected. If you like to learn about Linux, Bitcoin and Lightning, this guide is for you.If you are curious about the inner workings of the Lightning Network, this article in Bitcoin Magazine (by the excellent Aaron van Wirdum) offers a very good introduction:Understanding the Lightning Network, Part 1: Building a Bidirectional Bitcoin Payment ChannelThe Lightning Network is probably the most highly anticipated technological innovation to be deployed on top of\u2026bitcoinmagazine.com1) Hardware RequirementsI ordered the following items directly with Hardkernel in Singapore. There are resellers available worldwide, but not for Switzerland, unfortunately.Hardkernel Odroid HC2 ($54)Power adapter & cord ($7)optional: Odroid HC2 case ($5)You also need the following:Micro SD card: 8 GB or more, incl. adapter to your regular computerInternal hard disk: 500 GB or more, SATA, 3.5\" hdd, or 2.5\" hdd/ssdNetwork RJ45 cableConsiderations for Bitcoin\u00a0mainnetThis guide is configured to use the Bitcoin testnet. You can easily download and verify the blockchain using the Odroid HC2. However, for a switch to Bitcoin mainnet, will will need to initially download and verify the Bitcoin blockchain on a regular computer (only once, not regularly).There are multiple options (not covered in this guide) to transfer the mainnet blockchain (~200 GB) to your node:connect your internal hard disk directly to your computer,transfer the blockchain over the networkuse an additional external hard disk to transfer the data via USB.We are going to format the internal hard disk using the Ext4 file system, which is not compatible with windows. If you want to connect the hard disk later to a windows computer, you need additional software (free for once-time-usage).Assemble the\u00a0hardwareAssembly is easy, just enter the hard disk and fix it with the the screws included with your Odroid. If you ordered the plastic case, just slide it over the metal body.2) Write down your passwordsCreate strong passwords for the following users and interfaces. As this is not a Pi, I will use the user \u201cadmin\u201d instead of \u201cpi\u201d in the original guide.[ A ] User password for \u201cadmin\u201d and \u201croot\u201d[ C ] User password for \u201cbitcoin\u201d[ D ] Bitcoin wallet password[ E ] Bitcoin RPC password[ F ] Lightning API password3) Installing the operating systemWe use Ubuntu 16.04.03 LTE (Minimal, Bare OS) that is provided by Hardkernel.odroid-xu4:os_images:linux:ubuntu_4.14:ubuntu_4.14 [ODROID Wiki]Software Release for Linux/Ubuntu Kernel 4.14 on XU4/XU3/HC1/MC1wiki.odroid.comExact file used: ubuntu-16.04.3-4.14-minimal-odroid-xu4-20171213.img.xzDownload the image, flash it on your MicroSD card, put it into your Thundroid, connect it to your network via cable and connect the power adapter. The initial boot can take several minutes. SSH is on by default.4) Connecting to the\u00a0networkGive your Thundroid a fixed IP address in the DCHP settings of your router. See section (4) of the RaspiBolt guide for additional information.5) Working on your ThundroidThe command\u00a0promptEverything is configured on the Linux command prompt. Throughout this guide I use the following notation:# this is a comment, just for information$ command            This is a command to enter (without the $)                      and confirm with the enter keyNo prefix            This is either an output of the command above                     or something you can copy/paste into a fileWhen you enter commands, you can use the \u201cTab\u201d key for autocompletion, eg. for commands, directories or filenames.If you are using Windows, I recommend to use the SSH client KiTTY. You can copy text from the shell by selecting it with your mouse (no need to click anything), and paste stuff with a right-click.Basic configurationConnect to the node using SSH.

Investors want to know what the fundamental drivers are behind BTC price gyrations, and whether at a given time Bitcoin is overvalued, undervalued, or at fair value. The new measures we suggest here are tools to help with that judgement. We build on work that goes back to 2011, and use the Bitcoin blockchain to extract market information not generally available for traditional commodities.We suggest two new ways to measure changes in Bitcoin saving behavior:Relative Unrealized Profit/Loss Ratio (\u2248investor sentiment)HODLer Position Change (\u2248insider buying/selling)Also introduced is the Liveliness measure, which reflects the extent to which a cryptocurrency is meaningfully used by savers.A History of Bitcoin Valuation ResearchHere\u2019s an overview of the quantitative approaches we\u2019ve seen Bitcoin investors take to help them decide what its fair value is at any given time.In 2010, Bitcoin users tried calculating the \u201cvalue\u201d of one Bitcoin by estimating the electricity cost of mining it. However, the usefulness of this was quickly dismissed, as the cost of mining goes up when investors bid up the price of Bitcoin.In 2011, early investors came up with the idea of calculating Bitcoin\u2019s market cap as a valuation tool, and with the concept of \u2018Bitcoin Days Destroyed\u2019. The latter was dubbed an \u201cindicator of market health and participation\u201d and it was the first valuation metric that considered the age of addresses. There was also discussion about a \u201cPrice over Difficulty\u201d ratio, to determine whether it was better to mine than to buy BTC, and forum threads emerged about how many lost coins there might be.In 2012, Trace Mayer suggested the 200 Daily Moving Average of Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization as a value indicator, because it filters out the long-term secular uptrend.In 2013, various authors explored the idea that Bitcoin\u2019s price is in a long-term parabolic uptrend, and that deviation from that trend line is indicative of over- and under valuation.On January 1st, 2014, user gbianchi proposed \u201cNetwork Value\u201d as the ratio of Bitcoin\u2019s address growth and its market capitalization\u200a\u2014\u200asimilar analyses followed later that year.In November 2014, developer Jon Ratcliff published his analysis of the blockchain, showing the distribution of bitcoins based on age of last use, and commented \u201cThis graph shows\u00a0\u2026 how many bitcoins are actively moving at any one time over time.\u201dIn September 2017, Willy Woo and Chris Burniske published research around the NVT ratio, which was called a \u201cPE Ratio for Bitcoin\u201d as it focused on comparing Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain volume with its market cap.In March 2018, Dmitry Kalichkin suggested a variation on NVT which he dubbed the 90-day NVT ratio. Two months later he introduced the Network Value to Metcalfe ratio (NVM) which was based on Daily Active Addresses.In April 2018, Dhruv Bansal updated Ratcliff\u2019s work on UTXO age distribution, and suggested the concept of HODL waves. He commented: \u201cIt is not possible to make charts such as the one above for traditional asset classes. It\u2019s only Bitcoin and other public blockchains that meticulously track these data throughout their whole histories. This enables post-hoc analyses of large-scale market behavior.\u201dIn October 2018, inspired by Pierre Rochard, Nic Carter and Antoine Le Calvez created the Bitcoin \u201crealized cap\u201d which is the aggregate value of the UTXOs priced by their value when they last moved. Soon after, Bitcoin \u201cthermocap\u201d or \u201caccumulated security spend\u201d was suggested, which is the aggregated miner revenues over the entire history of Bitcoin.That same month, Murad Mahmudov and David Puell published work on the Bitcoin Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV).In December 2018, Tam\u00e1s Blummer introduced the concept of Liveliness, which reflects how much a given blockchain is used for meaningful transaction settlement.Goal: Measure Changes in Saving\u00a0BehaviorGiven that we view Bitcoin\u2019s primary use case as censorship resistant store of value (digital gold), and its utility as a payment mechanism as only secondary, our main goal in identifying the components of our valuation toolbox is to find data that specifically reflects changes in saving behavior.Limitations and challenges of existing valuation methodologiesThe Bitcoin blockchain records a lot of data, but not all data. It is blind to how many bitcoins are lost. It doesn\u2019t know whether a transaction represents a transition from one owner to another (sale), or whether it\u2019s simply the same owner moving coins to another address in his control. It also doesn\u2019t reflect off-chain transactions\u200a\u2014\u200afor example it won\u2019t show balance transfers from one Bitfinex user to another, or Liquid Sidechain transactions, or Lightning Network transactions.The limitations of blockchain-recorded information, as well as the commodity nature of cryptocurrencies themselves, have consequences for valuation methodologies:With cryptocurrencies, information about real circulating supply is opaque, exchange listing requirements are often extremely loose, and dilution schemes can be stretched to extremes. Assigning a \u201cmarket cap\u201d to a cryptocurrency (mined coins \u00d7 token price) doesn\u2019t at all create an objective comparison tool\u200a\u2014\u200aa coin\u2019s \u201cmarket cap\u201d doesn\u2019t teach us anything about the commitment of coin holders. To illustrate: a centralized coin with a premined supply of 1 billion tokens and a single recorded sale of one token for $10 would yield a $10 billion market cap, identical to a decentralized coin with a large community of long-term savers. This \u201cmarket cap\u201d measure is also blind to lost coins, which stretches the comparison with the securities world where the assets are held by transfer agents, making loss a very rare phenomenon.The challenge with using the number of active addresses or transaction volumes (e.g. NVT, NVM) is that these data sources don\u2019t allow us to separate behavior that is long-term oriented from behavior that is short term oriented. These measures don\u2019t directly differentiate speculators from value investors, and can conceivably be gamed or inflated by moving a large amount of coins back and forth, or by creating a flurry of small on-chain transactions.SolutionOur solution is to collect data that places each circulating quantity of Bitcoin in its historical context, in the tradition of previous work such as HODL Waves, Realized Cap, and MVRV. We focus on the data provided by the Bitcoin blockchain, as this is the ultimate (most secure and final) settlement layer for all its important transactions. By taking the Output Quantities of a block, and combining it with the Recorded Time of that block, we learn more about the behavior of Bitcoin savers.Relative Unrealized P&L (\u2248investor sentiment)Every time a bitcoin moves on the blockchain, its market value is realized. The owner was aware of its value and affirmed his control over it at the point of the move. It doesn\u2019t matter if the transaction represents the owner sending the coins to somebody else (a sale or gift), or if it is an act of self-dealing.If we value every coin at the time it last moved and aggregate these values, we arrive at the \u201cRealized Capitalization.\u201dBy subtracting the Realized Cap from the Market Cap, we calculate Unrealized Profit/Loss (P&L):We see that Bitcoin investors in aggregate currently face a significant unrealized loss, which is quite a change if compared with the 2017 huge unrealized profits.The measure of Unrealized Profit also contains the unrealizable profit of Lost Coins. Some coins are certainly lost as they were associated with a provably un-spendable output script, but the majority of lost coins can only be guessed by setting a threshold of inactivity after we consider them Lost.The measure of Unrealized P&L estimates the total dollar amount of paper profits/losses in Bitcoin, but it does not clearly filter out the relative change that accompanies it. By dividing Unrealized P&L by the Market Cap, we arrive at the Relative Unrealized P&L, which can be interpreted as an indicator of investor sentiment:When a high percentage of Bitcoin\u2019s market cap consists of unrealized profits, it can be interpreted that investors are greedy. The ratio drops as prices decline and investors likely become more fearful. When the unrealized gains turn into unrealized losses, we enter the phase of capitulation and apathy. Here\u2019s a suggested illustration:So why does the percentage of Relative Unrealized P&L go up in a bull market? What this indicates is that on average, investors are realizing profits at a slower rate than the growth in the market cap. For the time being, 20% of the market cap consists of \u2018underwater\u2019 holdings\u200a\u2014\u200acoins that would generate losses if they were sold today.Before we move on to a new suggested valuation tool, HODLer Net Position Change, we first need to explain the measure of Bitcoin Liveliness.LivelinessThe idea of old coins moving on the blockchain has always spoken to the imagination of Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors: \u201cWhat are the \u2018Bitcoin whales\u2019 doing?\u201d, \u201cWhat might Satoshi be up to?\u201d, etc. The analytical work mentioned in our historic overview provides investors with information on how Bitcoin savers move coins at any given time. However, the challenge with measures such as HODL waves is that they don\u2019t provide us with a clear signal or unambiguous utility. We instead propose a single measure that focuses on the coins that move relative to how long they were previously dormant.What is Liveliness?Liveliness is a new quantitative measure that gives insights to shifts in saving behavior. The higher the amount of meaningful transaction settlement a blockchain accommodates, the higher its Liveliness.Liveliness can be defined as the ratio of the sum of Bitcoin Days Destroyed and the sum of all Bitcoin Days Ever Created. (See here for a more detailed breakdown.)Let\u2019s illustrate with a few examples:A blockchain that during its lifetime has not yet seen a transaction other than issuance, has a Liveliness of 0%. Likewise, a blockchain where only one recent balance is systematically moved back and forth would produce a very low Liveliness\u200a\u2014\u200ain other words, this measure is unforgiving for lack of meaningful transactions. Bitcoin has high Liveliness if it facilitates the transfer of large amounts of old coins on a regular basis.A blockchain where all the coins move within a single block has at that moment a Liveliness of 100%. A blockchain of two years old with no new block rewards, and where exactly one year ago all coins moved within a single block and no transactions moved since, would have a liveliness of 50%. In other words, the measure fluctuates relative to the total lifespan of the blockchain.The total circulating supply also impacts Liveliness: if in the previous example 20% more new coins were created in the year since all the coins were moved, then the Liveliness today would not be 50% but only 40%. So this measure also warns us about blockchains with high inflation/dilution.Liveliness can be used to weight market cap if comparing cryptocurrencies, as it will be close to zero for currencies that have inflated market cap through pre-mined coins or wash trading of the same few units.Besides this, Liveliness can also be used as a foundational tool from which to derive other insightful time series. One of these metrics is the aggregation of Lost or HODLed Bitcoins and alerts us to moves of large and old stashes. For this purpose, subtract Liveliness from 1 and multiply with the circulating supply at the time.HODLer Position Change (\u2248insider buying/selling)Now that we know the approximate number of coins that are held as a long term investment or are lost, we can approximate the monthly position change among Bitcoin savers. We call this measure HODLer Net Position Change. Because it only measures actual moves of coins, our graph naturally excludes lost coins.We see that significant quantities were cashed out during bull markets of Bitcoin, and net new positions were accumulated by HODLers in bear phases. Net buying seems to switch into net selling once the previous top is reached (cf. arrows on the graph above).It\u2019s important to note that a significant amount of coins are held on Bitcoin exchanges and that mere administrative decisions on their behalf can have a significant impact on measures like HODLer Net Position Change. However, serious effort has been made to de-anonymize exchange addresses, so future analysis should be able to mitigate for \u201cexchange bias.\u201dFor example, one anomaly in the graph is the recent negative position change of meaningful Bitcoin savings (Dec 2018). While at first sight this is worrisome, we found evidence suggesting that a significant part of the move stems from Coinbase reshuffling around 5% of all BTC in circulation.Another notable negative position change is the 278,000 BTC net move in August 2017. This is likely attributable to the Bitcoin Cash hard fork (BCH) of that same month. Every Bitcoin private key gave access to an equivalent amount of BCH as the BTC in that wallet. And so with BCH rallying strongly\u200a\u2014\u200aat some point reaching over 20% of a BTC\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin HODLers were incentivized to split the two via on-chain transactions and either buy more BCH and sell their BTC, or vice versa. Given how strong the (flawed) narrative was at the time of BCH being \u201cthe real Bitcoin,\u201d it\u2019s conceivable that many old bitcoins were actually sold. More analysis is needed in this area.ConclusionBy creating tools that measure changes in saving behavior on the Bitcoin settlement layer, we believe to have meaningfully contributed to the valuation debate. Relative Unrealized Profit/Loss in Bitcoin tells us about Mr. Market\u2019s emotional state, HODLer Net Position Change gives us information about how Bitcoin whales are moving their pieces on the chessboard, and Liveliness gives us a powerful tool to meaningfully compare long-term investor activity, as well as a platform for building new valuation measures in this space.In a follow-up article we will share our take on what these and other measures tell us about Bitcoin\u2019s valuation today.

But before all of that, permit us to tell a story of a person named Joe.Joe\u2019s life has had its share of unfortunate events. But eventually, he came across something that could change his life. Not in the sense that many would think of, but in a truly transformative way.He came across a platform for education, that will eventually give him a career. When Joe first heard about blockchain, he was bewildered and enamored at the same time. This curiosity would fuel a strong desire in him to learn more, to be familiar with the field and to explore its manifest possibilities. This would push him to educate himself furiously about blockchain technology. He learned about programming languages, he invested his time in reading about Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s manifesto. He watched all of Andreas Antonopoulos\u2019 videos and kept up to date with anything and everything blockchain. Like a butterfly emerging out of his cocoon, Joe had a second lease in life.This could be your story. This could be anybody\u2019s story.

The new technology gives access to a lot more computing power than we have ever had before which could also be used for cracking the security systems of Bitcoin and the likes: At the CES 2018 it could be seen that this new kind of processor is not a thing of the future anymore, but its development is rapidly making progress (Intel has just announced a \u2018major breakthrough\u2019). IOTA is striving to be the new base layer for the whole Internet of Things (IoT), a whole new ecosystem with millions and billions of connected devices and transactions\u200a\u2014\u200aof course, such a network must be safe from attacks, also from attacks from Quantum Computers. I shall argue that IOTA\u200a\u2014\u200ain contrast to Bitcoin and the likes- is using an underlying architecture which makes it safe from malicious attacks carried out by Quantum computers.1. What you need to\u00a0knowNote: The goal here is to explain the process by means of easy words, so I have to skip some deep and confusing technicalities.Bitcoin uses a public ledger to store its data on. It packs all of the data of a specific time period into one so-called block. What this block also carries is a so-called \u201chash\u201d of the previous block: a mathematical function which turns data into a set of specific length, normally a long string of random numbers and letters (\u201ca003c86b3e1038\u2026.\u201d). In order to prevent users from spending the same Bitcoin multiple times, there is a so-called timestamp which is also added to each transaction and stored in the block. And then there is another number called the nonce.Block = Hash of the previous block + transactions / timestamps + nonceA miner checks the transactions which are about to be sent through the network if they are valid (by comparing if all the hashes and values make sense). If they are valid, he grabs the transactions into a block and hashes the whole thing twice using a very famous and secure algorithm called SHA-256. By doing this, a new hash is created and this hash must be smaller than a certain target value in order for the block to be published as the new block of the blockchain. The only value which can be changed by the miner is the nonce, so if the hash is not smaller than the target value, the miner must try another number. This is a lot of work in terms of calculations and is rewarded by Bitcoins once you find the nonce which verifies the block: All of this together is called mining, which you might have heard of\u00a0:-). By the way some food for thought:According to a research conducted by a U.K.-based energy comparison tariff service called PowerCompare, the average electricity used to mine bitcoin this year has surpassed the annual energy usage of some 159 countries\u00a0. [\u2026] A single bitcoin transaction consumes enough energy to power the average household for an entire month.(link)https://www.supportsages.com/bitcoin-mining/2a) Risk of 51%-attackNow here\u2019s the kicker: Because every miner packs one individual transaction into the block (the one which will send him his hopefully rewarded bitcoins), each miner\u2019s hashingproblem is individual. Which means that theoretically two miners can find a solution to their problem at the same time, the result would be two mined blocks. The Bitcoin protocol\u2019s rule here is to only accept the one which has been worked on more. So far, so good.But what happens if miners come together in mining pools and share their mined bitcoins because everybody is working on it, like in a team (which is what is happening) and they have such powerful PCs that they represent more than 50% of the computational power of the network? Then it \u201c[could] spend bitcoins twice, by deleting transactions so they are never incorporated into the blockchain. The [rest of the miners] are none the wiser because they have no oversight of the mining process. (MIT technology review)\u201d So with that much computational power the whole mining system could break down!So far, this has never happened because it would need a whole lot of people to come together and put all of their computational power together\u200a\u2014\u200abut what would happen if you used one or more Quantum Computer to mine Bitcoins?According to MIT experts the answer is that this would not really be a danger (at least not for the next 10 years) because the clockspeeds of the quantum processors are not (yet) high enough to keep up with today\u2019s most powerful mining machines from Nvidia and the likes.2b) Risk of calculating the private\u00a0keyOf course, the Bitcoin protocol wants to ensure that every Bitcoin can only be spent by its owner. Every wallet has a secret private key (so to speak the password to gain access to the bitcoin account) and public key which is easily generated from the private key and is published to the network (the hash of this key is the wallet address!): So basically you could say one is the password and one is the wallet address.What you can do is to use a signature which shows others that you really have the private key for this account without sharing your password/secret key. This technology is called \u201celliptic curve signature scheme\u201d (Such a signature identified IOTA\u2019s Come-from-Beyond as the creator of NXT)So you can easily create a public key from the private key and prove your ownership by means of the above-mentioned scheme\u200a\u2014\u200abut not vice versa! Even with our fastest computers today, this is not possible because the encryption method is strong enough. However,[\u2026] with a quantum computer, it is easy.And that\u2019s how quantum computers pose a significant risk to Bitcoin. \u201cThe elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027,\u201d say Aggarwal and co.Indeed, quantum computers pose a similar risk to all encryption schemes that use a similar technology, which includes many common forms of encryption. MIT technology reviewThis would make it possible for a Quantum Computer to calculate the private key = password of any account once the wallet address/public key is known (if you want to dig deeper, the keyword is Shor\u2019s algorithm.3. IOTAAs opposed to Bitcoin, IOTA does not use the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) but hash-based signatures thus not only making the protocol resistant against by Quantum Computers but also simpler and faster for signing and verifying transactions.IOTA is quantum-secure because of its usage of Winternitz signatures:The signature is derived from parts of the private key (Lamport-Diffie-scheme)The best summary I could come up with is the following:For this kind of signature one generates random data for each case of having a \u20180\u2019 or a \u20181\u2019 representing a single bit of the message. This is the private key. The public key represents the hashed version for each of the random data blocks. To sign a message, the private key data for each bit is revealed, depending on the single message bit being \u20180\u2019 or \u20181\u2019. A verifier can calculate the hashes and compare them to the public key. Here one notices that generating a second signature would tell more about the private key and allow an attacker to forge further signatures. Therefore a single key pair must only be used once. To improve performance and reduce space requirements, Merkle proposed the Winternitz OTS (One-time-signatures), named after Robert Winternitz. The basic idea of the Winternitz OTS is to sign several bits at once.As for IOTA, this is\u200a\u2014\u200asimply speaking- the reason, why you should not use the same address for sending IOTAs twice because each time a part of the private key is revealed; using the same address more than once would make it attackable even with today\u2019s methods.However, IOTA is still being developed and improved\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the main aspects is its focus on ternary (instead of binary) hardware, i.e. developing a chip which can handle the cryptographic calculations as fast as possible. Of course, this also needs a software-solution which takes ternary logic into account. Since there is nothing on the market which could be used, it had to be invented by some really bright people: the IOTA developers!IOTA\u2019s ternary (again, NOT binary as above!) hash-function is called CURL-P (P = Prototype). At the moment, this is being reviewed/audited by one of the worlds most renowned security audit firms (which makes sense because it\u2019s entirely new technology which is supposed to handle tomorrow\u2019s billion-transaction-IoT-network). To cite the IOTA-foundation,CURL is \u201cbased on well-studied sponge construction invented by the Keccak creators (SHA-3) and strictly conforms to all requirements described in their official paper.\u201dBecause it cannot be used without a complete and successful security audit, security precautions have been undertaken by using a NIST standard Keccak (SHA-3) algorithm for signing: since the IOTA network is not yet running on ternary hardware, there needs to be a software function which converses information from binary to ternary; this hashing function is called Kerl (=Keccak-384).OutlookAs can be seen, quantum computing provides a real danger to the security of Bitcoin (and also its derivate) accounts because of the elliptic curve cryptography and its shortcomings in this context. IOTA has nothing to fear from this due to its choice of hash-based signatures.At the moment, IOTA is not yet running on full speed because the calculations have to go through a software-conversion (KERL). In the future, this will be done by IoT-tailored microprocessors:This means that even small devices in the Fog/Edge of the network will be fully capable of carrying out their own hashing for hundreds/thousands of transactions per second locally without the need to outsource it. With hardware support the fundamental limit of IOTA\u2019s scaling will be the laws of physics themselves. I.E how fast radio waves/photons can communicate data. It\u2019s important to note that this hardware component does not add any extra cost either in price or size of the chip to the manufacturer and will be entirely open source. (David Sonstebo, IOTA Co-founder)I hope this helped you a bit to understand a) why IOTA is such a great and special undertaking and b) why IOTA is (despite its already huge success) still only in the beginning when it comes to its actual capabilities in combination with the hardware\u2026 And remember: All this will be done at a fraction of the energy costs (compared to Bitcoin and the likes) and without any fees!If you want to, I would be happy about a little donation\u00a0;-):IOTA: KGOZYHJRYVDBSXTUSECYJVEBLDVYFKCAKAWTPTCKXMBNOWNVRDRHRVSJNIVOQUFRODFPXWYSGROKRWKRZWJZTJOHSX", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "Elliot Wave prediction for bitcoin price move from\u00a0here", "author_name": "DK", "link": "https://medium.com/@dennyk/elliot-wave-prediction-for-bitcoin-price-move-from-here-1e27009d2bb3?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 29, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "2.1K", "content": "Elliot Wave prediction for bitcoin price move from\u00a0hereDKBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 29, 2017This is to follow up with my earlier price prediction posts. In my last one I said that bitcoin would first correct to at least $6,600 (2/3 of my targets were hit, down to as low as $6,000) to complete wave 4 and then start a wave 5 that \u201ccould take prices well above $10,000\u201d).As this is precisely what happened I am now updating my scenario. Please note that I would not really assign more than a 66% probability to this one as I have a hard time to see bitcoin correct this much at this point in time. Though perhaps that is exactly the reason why it is likely to happen (after all I am just human and I suffer from the same behavioral biases as all of us).Current situationLong TermShort TermAs you can (hopefully) see on the charts, wave 5 is in full force. I actually think we are in the process of the bubble really taking off, very similar to what happened in the Nasdaq 100 at the end of 1999. It then rose another 100% in very short time before it crashed. In the crypto world \u201ca very short time\u201d could well just be a few days or weeks. As this move started at about $8,300 it could mean that this wave ends above $15,000. To be honest\u200a\u2014\u200aI have no idea how high it will rise, but I can see that the sell order books on most exchanges are practically empty. So every time the price takes a \u201cround number\u201d hurdle, it can easily shoot up another $500\u2013800 without much resistance.OutlookWherever this current move ends, it is likely that it will be followed by a pronounced correction. Given it would mark the end of a 15 months bull cycle, I would expect a full A-B-C correction potentially going as low as $5,500 to $7,500. It is unlikely that such a move would happen without a catalyst, but I can see the following three possibilities for that:a) Euphoria around the launch of Futures culminates when they actually launch on CME, potentially sending the price up 25% or so on that day and then giving people enough reasons to sell in droves. Alternatively in this same bucket any kind of issues around the final authorization for CME Futures trading (note they will launch \u201cpending regulatory approval\u201d) could be a more negative catalystb) The ICO bubble bursting on harsh new SEC regulation or even the SEC bringing numerous cases at the same time and some founders facing jail if they cannot reimburse investorsc) The Tether construct blowing up in the face of a few exchanges. Other people have written enough about this topic but I can see almost no scenario in which the US government tolerates a company with known human actors to deal with their currency in this way, while I do not believe for a second that USDT \u201cbought\u201d for bitcoin when these are sold on an exchange actually get converted into real USD. There probably already are 5 USDT per actual USD that Tether may or may not have on an undisclosed bank account. A crash in USDT price would hurt quite a few exchanges. I even think today it should not trade higher than $0.2 per USDT\u2026So in summary, I think we are about to see a higher high on btc than anyone would have thought possible, but at this point in the rally I would be extremely cautious with new positions and the above is my best guess as to where we are going from here. It does remain just a personal opinion and a guess.Finally, the usual important disclaimer: This is not investment advice, this is my personal and not my professional opinion.

It helps Bitcoin be more useful as a day to day currency.3) How does it\u00a0work?The Lightning Network is a system of smart contracts built on top of the base Bitcoin blockchain that allows for fast, cheap payments directly between two parties. In order to achieve these fast and cheap transactions, the following steps are taken:A multi-signature wallet which holds some amount of bitcoin (provided by at least one of both parties) is set upThe wallet address is then saved to the public Bitcoin blockchain including a balance sheet (smart contract) that proves how much of this bitcoin deposits belongs to whomAfter this payment channel is set up once, it is possible for these two parties to conduct an unlimited amount of transactions without ever touching the information stored on the blockchainWith each transaction, both parties sign an updated balance sheet in order to always reflect how much of the bitcoin stored in the multi-sig wallet belongs to whomThe updated balance sheet is not uploaded to the blockchain but rather both parties keep a copy of itWhenever there is a dispute or the payment channel is closed, both parties can use the most recent mutually signed balance sheet to pay out their share of the multi-sig walletThis all sounds very cumbersome, but in fact for the end-user hardly any additional effort is needed to conduct Lightning payments, all of the above will happen automatically in the background.The Lightning Network\u2019s use of payment channels effectively allows users to transact with each other directly rather than broadcasting their business to the entire world (aka public blockchain). By tracking their payments between each other on their own, the two parties are able to avoid expensive and time-consuming interactions with the blockchain. If there is some sort of dispute regarding balances on the Lightning Network, the most recent balance sheet provided by either of the two parties will decide how the funds in the multi-sig wallet are split up.To better understand how the Lightning Network works, we recommend watching this short video:4) Do I need to open new payment channels for every new party I want to transact\u00a0with?No, the Lightning Network is (thus its name), constructed as a network. Meaning although Alice might not yet have an open payment channel with Dave, Alice is indirectly connected with Dave via Bob, or even using multiple steps in between. With the Lightning Network, users are able to transact with anyone who is connected to their network of payment channels through multiple hops. In theory, everyone should be connected to everyone else through the network via only few nodes. People are also incentivised running these connecting nodes through (small) fees that are paid out every time a transaction uses one of their connections. Early results from the testnet implementation of the Lightning Network confirm that a sufficiently decentralized network indeed can be created.The architecture of the Lightning network is still trustless (because it is based on smart contracts) and will always make sure that the funds will reach their destination through intermediaries, or issue a refund if there is no indirect path to the destination possible.Source: https://coincenter.org/entry/what-is-the-lightning-networkBob and Carol function as \u201cnodes\u201d on the network. Nodes on the Lightning Network are in some ways analogous to miners on the Bitcoin network. They function as the servers that process the transactions on the network in a decentralized manner. Like miners, they do not have control over the funds they help move. Bob cannot steal Alice\u2019s funds, as he will only receive the sender\u2019s incoming payment if he has already sent the outgoing payment to the recipient.5) BenefitsTiny payments are possible: Since fees are proportional to the payment amount, you can pay a fraction of a cent; accounting is even done in thousandths of a satoshi.Payments are settled instantly: The money is sent in the time it takes to cross the network to your destination and back, typically a fraction of a second.Improved privacy: Not every transaction is stored on the public blockchain, only once when the payment chanel is eventually closed and the balance is paid out to both parties6) ShortcomingsPeer failures: If one of the peers is unresponsive, users might have to wait for hours to close a payment channel and resend the funds via an alternative routeNo Offline Payments: Users can\u2019t pay someone who is not onlineNot ideal for large payments: Even though a route via various payment channels might exist, the funds in the peers multi-sig wallets might not be sufficient to transfer large fundsCentralization: The Lightning Network might encourages centralization in payment hubs (similar to miner centralization)7) When will Lightning Network be launched?Currently, there is a Proof-of-Concept implementation running on the Bitcoin Testnet and even an experimental implementation on the Bitcoin Mainnet. So everybody can try out the Lightning Network and even set up their own Lightning Node already today. A date when the Lightning Network will be widely launched on the Bitcoin Mainnet with integrations into the major wallets is not yet set, but chances are high it will be sometime this year.Update March 16th: Lightning Labs just announced a new mainnet release of their implementation of the Lightning Network.", "responses": "8"}, {"title": "Why the Price of Bitcoin Doesn't\u00a0Matter", "author_name": "Beautyon", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/why-the-price-of-bitcoin-doesnt-matter-155e8400557b?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 11, 2018", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "3K", "content": "Why the Price of Bitcoin Doesn't\u00a0MatterBeautyonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 11, 2018Bitcoin is a very new technology, even though the concept that it brings to life is decades old. The double spending problem has been solved; this means that it is possible to use a digital certificate to stand in the place of money and be sure that no one else can spend that certificate other than you as long as you hold it. This is an unprecedented paradigm shift, the implications of which are not yet fully understood, and for which the tools do not yet exist to fully take advantage of this new idea.This new technology requires some new thinking when it comes to developing businesses that are built upon it. In the same way that the pioneer providers of email did not correctly understand the service they were selling for many years, new and correct thinking about Bitcoin is needed, and will emerge, so that it reaches its full potential and becomes ubiquitous.The original Hotmail InterfaceHotmail used familiar technologies (the browser, email) to create a better way of accessing and delivering email; the idea of using an email client like Outlook Express has been superseded by web interfaces and email \u2018in the cloud\u2019 that provides many advantages over a dedicated client with your mail in your own local storage.Bitcoin, which will transform the way you transfer money, needs to be understood on its own terms, and not just as an online form of money. Thinking about Bitcoin as money is as absurd as thinking about email as another form of sending letters by post; one not only replaces the other but it profoundly changes the way people send and consume messages. It is not a simple substitution or one dimensional improvement of an existing idea or service.As I have explained previously, Bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin is a protocol. If you treat it in this way, with the correct assumptions, you can start the process of putting Bitcoin in a proper context, allowing you to make rational suggestions about the sort of services that might be profitable based on it.Every part of Bitcoin is text. It is always text, and never at any point ceases to be text. This is a fact, and as text, it is protected under the free speech provisions of the constitutions of civilized nations with guaranteed, irrevocable rights.If Bitcoin is a protocol and not money, then setting up currency exchanges that mimic real world money, stock and commodity exchanges to trade in it is not the sole means of discovering its price. You would not set up an email exchange to discover the value of email services, and the same thing applies to Bitcoin.Staying with this train of thought, when you type in an email on your Gmail account, you are inputting your \u2018letter\u2019. You press send, it goes through your ISP, over the internets, into the ISP of your recipient and then it is outputted on your recipient\u2019s machine. The same is true of Bitcoin; you input money on one end through a service and then send the Bitcoin to your recipient, without an intermediary to handle the transfer. Once Bitcoin does its job of moving your value across the globe to its recipient it needs to be \u2018read out\u2019, i.e. turned back into money, in the same way that your letter is displayed to its recipient in an email.In the email scenario, once the transfer happens and the email you have received conveys its information to you, it has no use other than to be a record of the information that was sent (accounting), and you archive that information. Bitcoin does this accounting on the block chain for you, and a good service built on it will store extended transaction details for you locally, but what you need to have as the recipient of Bitcoin is services or goods not Bitcoin itself.Bitcoin\u2019s true nature is as an instant way to pay (despite not being money) anywhere in the world. It is not an investment, and holding on to it in the hopes that it will become valuable is like holding on to an email or a PDF in the hopes it will be come valuable in the future; it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Of course, you can hold on to Bitcoin and watch its value go up, and its value will go up, but you need to have guts to weather the violent waves of selling and buying as the transition to an all Bitcoin economy gets under way. Remember also, that businesses that have a need to store Bitcoin need to be concerned about its value if their models are open ended and are exposed to the market. \u201cClosed Circuit Bitcoin\u201d models have control over everything and never need to worry about prices at exchanges. They can do all their business moving an unlimited amount of fiat with just a few Bitcoin.Despite the fact that you can\u2019t double spend them and each one is unique, Bitcoins have no inherent value, unlike a book or any physical object. They cannot appreciate in value. Mistaken thinking about Bitcoin has spread because it behaves like money, due to the fact it cannot be double spent. Misrepresentation of Bitcoin\u2019s true nature has masked Bitcoin\u2019s dual nature of being digital and not double spendable.Razzles. They start as a candy, and then end as a gum. Before you chew them, which are they? A candy, or a\u00a0gum?Bitcoin is digital, with all the qualities of information that make information non scarce. It sits in a new place that oscillates between the goods of the physical world and the infinitely abundant digital world of information, belonging exclusively to the digital world but having the characteristics of both. This is why it has been widely misunderstood and why a new approach is needed to design businesses around it.All of this goes some way to explain why the price of buying Bitcoins at the exchanges doesn\u2019t matter for the consumer. If the cost of buying a Bitcoin goes to 1\u00a2 This doesn't change the amount of money that comes out at the other end of a transfer. As long as you redeem your Bitcoin immediately after the transfer into either goods or currency, the same value comes out at the other end no matter what you paid for the Bitcoin when you started the process.Think about it this way. Let us suppose that you want to send a long text file to another person. You can either send it as it is, or you can compress it with zip. The size of a document file when it is zipped can be up to 87% smaller than the original. When we transpose this idea to Bitcoin, the compression ratio is the price of Bitcoin at an exchange. If a Bitcoin is $100, and you want to buy something from someone in India for $100 you need to buy 1 Bitcoin to get that $100 to India. If the price of Bitcoin is 1\u00a2 then you need 10,000 Bitcoin to send $100 dollars to India. These would be expressed as compression ratios of 1:1 and 10,000:1 respectively.The same $100 value is sent to India, whether you use 10,000 or 1 Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoins is irrelevant to the value that is being transmitted, in the same way that zip files do not \u2018care\u2019 what is inside them; Bitcoin and zip are dumb protocols that do a job. As long as the value of Bitcoins does not go to zero, it will have the same utility as if the value were very \u2018high\u2019.Bearing all of this in mind, it\u2019s clear that new services to facilitate the rapid, frictionless conversion into and out of Bitcoin are needed to allow it to function in a manner that is true to its nature.The current business models of exchanges are not addressing Bitcoin\u2019s nature correctly. They are using the Twentieth Century model of stock, commodity and currency exchanges and superimposing this onto Bitcoin. Interfacing with these exchanges is non-trivial, and for the ordinary user a daunting prospect. In some cases, you have to wait up to seven days to receive a transfer of your fiat currency after it has been cashed out of your account from Bitcoins. Whilst this is not a fault of the exchanges, it represents a very real impediment to Bitcoin acting in its nature and providing its complete value.Imagine this; you receive an email from across the world, and are notified of the fact by being displayed the subject line in your browser. You then apply to your ISP to have this email delivered to you, and you have to wait seven days for it to arrive in your physical mail box.The very idea is completely absurd, and yet, this is exactly what is happening with Bitcoin, for no technical reason whatsoever.It is clear that there needs to be a re-think of the services that are growing around Bitcoin, along with a re-think of what the true nature of Bitcoin is. Rethinking services is a normal part of entrepreneurialism and we should expect business models to fail and early entrants to fall by the wayside as the ceaseless iterations and pivoting progress.Bearing all of this in mind, focussing on the price of Bitcoin at exchanges using a business model that is inappropriate for this new software simply is not rational; its like putting a methane breathing canary in a mine full of oxygen breathing humans as a detector. The bird dies even though nothing is wrong with the air; the miners rush to evacuate, leaving the exposed gold seams behind, thinking that they are all about to be wiped out, when all is actually fine.Day traders speculating on Bitcoin from home cause the price to oscillate. Its an artificial signal that has nothing to do with demand for Bitcoin and its circulation as an economic tool to facilitate commerce.Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it are here to stay. As the number of people downloading the client and using it increases, like Hotmail, it will eventually reach critical mass and then spread exponentially through the internet. When that happens, the correct business models will spontaneously emerge, as they will become obvious, in the same way that Hotmail, Gmail, Facebook, cellular phones and instant messaging seem like second nature.In the future. I imagine that very few people will speculate on the value of Bitcoin, because even though that might be possible, and even profitable, there will be more money to be made in providing easy to use Bitcoin services that take full advantages of what Bitcoin is.One thing is for sure; speed will be of the essence in any future Bitcoin business model. The startups that provide instant satisfaction on both ends of the transaction are the ones that are going to succeed. Even though the volatility of the price of Bitcoin is bound to stabilise, since it has no use in and of itself, getting back to money or goods instantly will be a sought after characteristic of any business built on Bitcoin.The needs of Bitcoin businesses provide many challenges in terms of performance, security and new thinking. Out of these challenges will come new practices and software that we can only just imagine as they come over the horizon.Finally, when there is no more fiat, and the chaotic transition zone between fiat and Bitcoin has been abolished, then everything will be priced in Bitcoin, and there will be no volatility, because no one uses anything other than Bitcoin to buy or sell. If you know any chemistry, this will be like a reaction\u2019s reagents reaching equilibrium; you can shake it and stir it all you like; the reaction is over, and you\u2019re left with the inert product. Right now, compared to the amount of fiat in the world, Bitcoin can expand and contract very rapidly over a large range, because it is small in volume. It can expand to what for many is an unimaginably high price, and then shrink down again. As it gets bigger and accumulates more mass (its price expressed in fiat), these fluctuations will become smaller and smaller. Through all of this, Bitcoin remains exactly the same; it is its users that are publishing numbers as a signal to react upon.", "responses": "14"}, {"title": "Jack Bogle: Avoid Bitcoin Like The\u00a0Plague", "author_name": "Darius Foroux", "link": "https://medium.com/@dariusforoux/jack-bogle-avoid-bitcoin-like-the-plague-3ce0cc07ae98?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 19, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "1.5K", "content": "Jack Bogle: Avoid Bitcoin Like The\u00a0PlagueDarius ForouxBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 19, 2018You can\u2019t escape them.

It\u2019s so easy that everyone can do it. But is that really the case?I must be honest, when you hear all the stories of people who made so much money in a short while, you get curious.

If you had bought the currency just before the boom, you would end up with more than 2,000% return within a year.It\u2019s an attractive investment, right? Wrong. \u201cInvesting\u201d in Bitcoin is not investing at all. It\u2019s speculation. According to Benjamin Graham, the difference between investing and speculating is straightforward. It has everything to do with risk as Graham writes:\u201cFor investment, the future is essentially something to be guarded against rather than to be profited from\u2026. Speculation, on the other hand, may always properly\u200a\u2014\u200aand often soundly\u200a\u2014\u200aderive its basis and its justification from prospective developments that differ from past performance.\u201d (emphasis mine)An investment is always supported by value. Stocks are supported by earnings or dividend. Bonds have coupon rates.Speculation is different. Like Graham writes, that\u2019s when you buy something with the sole purpose of selling it at a higher rate in the future. And that\u2019s how Jack Bogle, who\u2019s called a \u201chero\u201d to the average investor by Warren Buffett, recently described Bitcoin:\u201cThere is nothing that supports the Bitcoin except the hope that you can sell it to somebody for more than you paid for\u00a0it.\u201dIn the same interview, he also says you should avoid Bitcoin like the plague. He has a good point. Hope is generally not a good strategy. And there\u2019s nothing that supports Bitcoin but ideals\u2014nothing tangible.The funny thing is that Bitcoin supporters say, \u201cWe\u2019re not speculating!\u201d They are. They are just backing up their beliefs. It\u2019s a common cognitive bias.But here\u2019s the thing: There\u2019s nothing wrong with speculation. You can do anything you want with your hard earned money. Just don\u2019t expect to get rich with Bitcoin. Graham says that \u201cOutright speculation is neither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the pocketbook.\u201dOne thing we, normal folks, must realize is that it\u2019s not that easy to make a quick buck. Yes, the stories of the Bitcoin millionaires are real. And it\u2019s well deserved. But you and I also both know that when something sounds too good to be true\u2014it is.I\u2019ve always been interested in investing in the stock market. When I started more than a decade ago, I just did what I thought was right. That means I watched financial news on TV, read articles on some popular websites, talked to friends, and made investment decisions based on that.Naturally, I lost money. So for the past few years, I\u2019ve been reading a lot about how to do it \u201cright.\u201d I must say that there is no absolute right or wrong way to invest. But when I talk about the right way of investing, I talk about NOT losing money\u2014and having a long-term perspective.One thing I learned the hard way is that it\u2019s difficult to make a lot of money in a short period. But at the same time, it\u2019s also not that difficult to build serious wealth over a longer period.My father started his first business at age 50, and 90% of his current wealth was generated in the last seven years. And he literally started from zero.The same idea is true for every other wealthy person that I personally know\u2014no one became rich in a day.

And also don\u2019t overestimate the possibility of becoming wealthy over a long time.When you follow the path that intelligent investors like Graham, Buffett, and Bogle, have laid out, you will become wealthy.But that takes time.

Fees are high, confirmation times are slow. Anonymity and privacy could be better. Smart contract capabilities are basically non-existent. In certain features, or even in as a whole, competing products like Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, or other Bitcoin forks, are simply better at delivering utility to users.Low Hanging Fruit Plucked by CompetitorsThere were quick fixes (not without tradeoffs) that may have made Bitcoin more usable in the short term. These were implemented by competing forks like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, and include changes like increased block size, SegWit2x, and reduced block confirmation times. It would appear as though Bitcoin developers sat idly while others picked up the slack, and let value flow out into these forks.Here Come\u2019s Lightning \u26a1The Lightning Network is a proposed system built on top of Bitcoin that would let people instantaneously send/receive payments and reduce transaction fees by keeping them off the main network. It helps Bitcoin be more useful as a day to day currency.A video explaining how lightning worksI expect mining consortiums to be against Lightning, as it reduces fees and congestion from the main network, which is how they make their money. However, the best part about lightning is that it does not rely on the support of miners. Running a lightning node is a pure software play, and only requires capital in the form of \u201cstaking\u201d Bitcoin to help facilitate transactions. Lightning nodes can collect fees for doing this. So we can expect that new players outside of mining pools will contribute capital and provide service to this network layer. This arguably helps take power away from miners and is a decentralizing force for Bitcoin, a positive side effect. If miners don\u2019t like it, they can try to fork off and create a new cryptocurrency, but they will likely lose to a network that delivers improvements like Lightning does.Bitcoin forks, your days are numbered\u2026The Lighting system can technically be adapted to any cryptocurrency since it\u2019s just a layer built on blockchain. However, if lightning ends up delivering on its promises, then what purpose does Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash serve? Even if those forks implement their own lightning networks, Bitcoin has the most users and dollars behind it, and could absorb those ecosystems back into itself.Litecoin founder Charlie Lee had this to say about Lightning:\u201cBut some people say LN [Lightning Network] on Bitcoin will kill any reason to use Litecoin. If people can do instantaneous transactions on Bitcoin, why would they use Litecoin? My gut feel is that this is not the case. Even with LN, Bitcoin still cannot service every person in the world. I think the calculation was that at 1MB blocks, LN and SegWit on Bitcoin can service 500M users. LN nodes will charge a fee for LN txns going through them and that fee will be relative to the Bitcoin network fee. So Bitcoin LN txns will be more expensive than Litecoin LN txns. It may make economic sense for a LN txn to go via Litecoin and back to Bitcoin to get the cheapest rate. Lightning makes this possible because it allows the two LN to be interoperable. I don\u2019t know that this use case will be economical or not, but we won\u2019t know until both LNs are built and running.\u201cIn the near term, Charlie\u2019s own conclusions are not a good sign. His affirmation of LN servicing 500m people sounds like Litecoin will be worthless until network capacity is reached and scale becomes a problem again. Keep in mind Charlie also sold all his Litecoin as a matter of solving personal conflict of interest. I think Charlie has good intentions, but it is somewhat concerning when a founder is no longer financially incentivized by the success of their product. I suspect Charlie\u2019s knowledge of Lightning and its impending deployment, coupled with the recent price surge of Litecoin, may have influenced his decision to sell.ConclusionThe deployment of Lightning will be the biggest change to Bitcoin ever. If it works, it reintroduces Bitcoin as a usable daily currency, unhindered by stuck transactions and high fees. This is exciting for the adoption of cryptocurrencies as puts it back on track as a replacement for fiat. Lightning is still in beta with no hard date for deadline, but it is expected to be ready in 2018.

Read on\u200a\u2014\u200athere\u2019s plenty for both bulls and bears alikeSource: ShutterstockBitcoin is a bubble, a tulip, a magic bean factory. That\u2019s all you hear over and over again from various pundits on traditional media outlets or in the comment sections on any of the latest stories. Sometimes it goes a step further and is called a fraud or a Ponzi scheme. It\u2019s for drug dealers and murderers. Who else remembers Silk Road and Alpha Bay?Today we\u2019ll venture to the other side of the story. What will cause the Bitcoin bubble to pop? Will it be another Mt. Gox? Will it be stricter regulations? Will it be affiliation with the dark web and markets? How about sovereign governments outlawing it as their economies are undermined? Today, we go to the dark side of the moon.This article is available in video. The video is scripted and is a concise version of the article below with many pictures of headlines from the hyperlinks in this article to give a better understanding of what is happening. If you enjoy this content, please consider subscribing. Hope you all enjoy!Mt. Gox: Quick Recap (Skip if familiar)Most of you know about the collapse of Mt. Gox in 2014. It was the largest cryptocurrency exchange in 2013, at one point handling over 70% of all Bitcoin volume. However, starting in March 2013, it began facing some major issues. FinCen released a statement that said bitcoin exchanges were money transmitters, therefore requiring them to register and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) laws. This, in part, caused the value of Bitcoin to plummet as concerns over regulations grew.Source: CoinDeskMark Karpeles, the man in charge of Mt. Gox, told everyone not to worry as they were in full compliance with AML laws. However, it wouldn\u2019t be until 2 months later that Mt. Gox registered with FinCen. In the meanwhile, Mt. Gox\u2019s only payment processor, Dwolla, terminated their relationship with Mt. Gox due to a number of account seizures by FinCen. You could no longer withdraw your US dollars, which caused the price of Bitcoin on the exchange to skyrocket. People were buying bitcoin with their USD and then withdrawing from the exchange, causing a significant decline in volume throughout the rest of 2013.Source: bitcoinity.orgThe final nail in the coffin came with the hack that stole approximately $500m worth of bitcoin in 2014, driving people to protest outside the exchange\u2019s headquarters in Tokyo. Ultimately, Mt. Gox had to declare bankruptcy which led to the longest bear market we\u2019ve seen in Bitcoin yet. All in all, bitcoin declined from its $1,200 highs in December 2013 all the way down to below $200 in January 2015.Source: CoinMarketCap.comCatalyst One: The Next Mt.\u00a0GoxThe purpose of this history lesson is to drive parallels to the world\u2019s current largest bitcoin exchange, Bitfinex. Of the ~$5.3 billion in cryptocurrency trading volume over the past 24 hours (Sept. 13th), $616m of that volume came from Bitfinex, or approximately 12% of all trading volume. Like Mt. Gox, Bitfinex was hacked last year in August. However, the lost funds were significantly less at around $72m.The hack affected random customers, many of which lost their entire account balances. As a result, Bitfinex made the controversial decision to reduce ALL customers\u2019 accounts by 36% to pay for the hack and to help spread the losses between all customers instead of having a select few lose their entire balance. To make up for the 36% \u201chaircut,\u201d Bitfinex issued out BFX tokens. These acted as debt instruments that Bitfinex claimed they owed their customers and would redeem once they could afford to.They subsequently allowed customers to trade these BFX tokens on the exchange so that customers could price them in their own accord based off the potential risk Bitfinex might never pay them back (akin to junk bonds). They traded around 40\u201360 cents on the dollar. In the end, Bitfinex redeemed all these outstanding tokens for $1 each, making good on their \u201cdebt.\u201dHowever, one astute observer named \u201cBitCrypto\u2019d\u201d saw that as Bitfinex redeemed these BFX tokens, another company called Tether Holdings was issuing an equally large amount of a cryptocurrency called Tether. Tether is a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, meaning that for each Tether issued, there is one US dollar in reserves backing it. The company will redeem any Tether for US dollars and vice versa. The primary purpose of Tether is to replace fiat currencies on exchanges due to the complications related to US banking and accepting fiat. Bitfinex has a majority stake in Tether Holdings.This observer thought it was possible that perhaps as investors deposited US dollars to Tether Holdings for Tether, those US dollars, rather than being placed in reserves, were funneled through Bitfinex to pay off the BFX tokens. It\u2019s a rather elaborate ruse that is only backed by circumstantial evidence. But it\u2019s not as farfetched as it may initially sound.Source: Bitfinexed\u2019s TwitterTether Holdings did not release audits for its reserves until a week ago, and the furthest those audits go back is March 31st. The majority of BFX tokens were conveniently paid off right after on April 3rd. In addition, both Bitfinex and Tether began facing significant banking issues once Wells Fargo decided to suspend international wire transfers to their Taiwanese banks. This also happened, conveniently, towards the end of March / beginning of April. Bitfinex began refusing fiat deposits and withdrawals, similar to what happened with Mt. Gox, leading to a premium for Bitcoin on the exchange over others.SourceIn response to the events, Tether Holdings released a statement where they said any international wire transfers would be rejected and returned back to the sender. In addition, they stated that until they are able to resolve their money transfer channel concerns, they did not expect the volume of outstanding Tether to increase dramatically. However, this graph illustrates the exact opposite occurred:Blue line = Market Cap, or amount issued. It exceeds $400 million now, as opposed to roughly $55 million at the time of the announcementIn their last update, Tether Holdings justifies these increases being as a result of their institutional customers. Additional Tether are being issued to accommodate these customers\u2019 demands, yet we know that few if any Tether are ever redeemed as you can see the supply has never gone down by any sizable amount. How believable is it that everyone is in a rush to deposit their fiat for Tether at a company facing banking issues, yet no one wants to redeem those tokens for US dollars?Tether Holdings claims they will be releasing an audit in the \u201ccoming weeks or months\u201d that will clear the air and audit their holdings all the way back to the beginning of 2017. It might be a legitimate operation; no one knows. But here\u2019s what matters for Bitcoin investors: The collapse of Tether due to fraud will likely lead to the collapse of Bitfinex, which will cause ~10\u201315% of the daily volume in the cryptocurrency market to just vanish. That isn\u2019t even including the significant amount of volume Tether has on other exchanges.Unlike Mt. Gox, which was ruined by pure stupidity, this particular exchange would be ruined by fraud which is much more serious. Hence, the PR surrounding this event would likely be far worse than it was for Mt. Gox. The domino effect would almost certainly lead to a colossal loss in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Therefore, it is critical to watch both Tether and Bitfinex closely.Fortunately, of all the possible catalysts to lead to a pop, this one is the least likely. As I mentioned before, all the evidence is circumstantial. However, there are quite a few coincidences that are hard to justify as happenstance. In addition, there are a number of other factors about Bitfinex that I place in the \u201cshady\u201d column. These include:The freezes in Bitcoin trading last JuneThe inconsistent claims between employees and Phil Potters as to how large the equity stake in Tether Holdings is (employees\u200a\u2014\u200a20%, Phil Potters\u200a\u2014\u200aMajority stake)The anonymity of the team behind Bitfinex\u200a\u2014\u200aCSO, Phil Potters, couldn\u2019t even answer who is in charge$75k fine from US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) last year for \u201coffering illegal off-exchange financed retail commodity transactions in bitcoin\u00a0\u2026 and failing to register as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM)\u201dRefusing all US customers towards the beginning of AugustOverall, I would stay away from Bitfinex and Tether like the plague and encourage investors to keep up with these two entities in case we see another Mt. Gox level event.Catalyst Two: Global Crackdown on\u00a0ICOsSource: CoinDeskRecently we saw China impose a temporary ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs). These are akin to IPOs, except there are significantly fewer steps involved to get funded. Developers can often raise substantial capital off of a strong white paper alone, without the need to illustrate proof of concept.As you can imagine, this leads to situations where the developers \u201ctake the money and run.\u201d Or they receive such an abundance in funding that they don\u2019t know how to adequately utilize it all. One report says that up to 10% of ICO funding goes straight into the hands of criminals. These criminals phish investors for their funds in most situations, but have also been known to hack or take advantage of exploits as well to steal funds.This year, ICO funding outpaced early-stage VC funding which put it on the radar of not only institutional investors, but also governments around the world. Right now the regulatory picture is loose, but we are seeing more and more news that suggests that perhaps a crackdown might be in the cards soon. Below I summarize some of the key stances on ICOs globally.Note: The most important information from this section is included in a graphic below\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can skip to this to get a quick overview if you don\u2019t want details on each nation independently.SwitzerlandKnown as the world\u2019s oldest neutral country, Switzerland is also the epicenter for ICOs. Several of the highest grossing ICOs have been launched in the country due to its relaxed stance on cryptocurrencies. Here, cryptocurrencies are considered assets rather than securities. Note that this is one of the most important distinctions in regulations as many more rules are imposed on securities and more protections are put in place for investors.Switzerland houses the prime hub for crypto, a small city named Zug just south of Zurich. Dubbed \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d after \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d it hosts some of the biggest names in crypto including giants like Ethereum, Bitcoin Suisse, Shapeshift, and many more. Crypto companies operating here don\u2019t need any special licenses as they do in, say, New York. Zug is a highly pro business location and the government seems keen to work with startups as much as possible.Crypto Valley Association, a consortium of multiple large companies that fills a similar role as incubators do in Silicon Valley, recently issued a statement warning about the lack of \u201ctraditional support structures\u201d in ICOs. I would encourage everyone to read this statement as it encapsulates all of the current issues with ICOs.What\u2019s interesting is that the representative of the world\u2019s epicenter for ICOs is warning investors about the lack of security, documentation, and overall level of professionalism in token launches. While the overall goal of the statement is to increase awareness and illustrate good faith for working with the Swiss government, it is worth noting that even the world\u2019s most welcoming hub for crypto acknowledges the current Wild West of ICOs.SingaporeAlthough not as large a hub for cryptocurrencies as Switzerland, there have been some large ICOs based in the small, wealthy country. Cryptocurrencies are considered assets rather than securities here in most cases. As such, they are generally left unregulated.However, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) made a statement at the beginning of August clarifying their position on ICOs. They state that tokens which demonstrate properties similar to securities (such as ownership stakes) \u201cwould be required to lodge and register a prospectus with MAS prior to the offer[ing] of such tokens.\u201d Therefore, whether or not a token is a security must be decided on a case-by-case basis.United KingdomToken issuers are operating on their own interpretation of the law. According to a report by fintech research firm Autonomous NEXT, the UK offers a regulatory sandbox for companies to test out new projects. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is in charge of regulations for cryptocurrencies in the UK, recently warned consumers in yet another statement that looks quite similar to the one issued by the Crypto Valley Association.This statement, in addition to warning consumers, makes clear that the FCA does not regulate the majority of ICOs. As such, there is a possibility for crackdown in the future especially when you consider the language used in the statement. Yet again, there is emphasis on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis for deciding whether or not a token is a security.United StatesPerhaps the best known piece of regulation in the US is New York\u2019s \u201cBitLicense.\u201d The creation of this license was sparked by the demise of Silk Road and then accelerated with the collapse of Mt. Gox. It was referred to as the \u201cGreat Bitcoin Exodus\u201d as many firms discontinued operations in the \u201ccapital of the world.\u201d However, this is not the most important piece of regulation in the US.Recently, the SEC made some of the most important comments in history related to token issuances. In their response to the DAO incident, the SEC set out to state that some tokens fit the definition of a security while others don\u2019t. The distinction of what is a security and what is not is determined by the age old Howey test. Again, the common theme here is that whether or not a token is a security is to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Up until this point, most cryptocurrencies have been treated as commodities.CanadaThe US neighbor has found that the majority of token sales are securities, and hence this is a less friendly environment. However, it never was a booming place for ICOs in the first place. Still, this is some of the clearest language yet we\u2019ve seen from a country so it is worth noting.South KoreaYet another recent report released that states that the digital currency task force in South Korea will \u201cpunish initial coin offerings that raise funds in the form of stock issuance using digital currencies permitted in some countries, including Switzerland, for violating the capital market act.\u201d The same report states that it is too soon to identify cryptocurrencies as currencies or financial products. However, it does appear that yet again, those which exhibit properties similar to a security will be punished if they are not appropriately filed as such.RussiaThe central bank of Russia also recently issued a warning (In Russian\u200a\u2014\u200aparaphrase here) for consumers related to the dangers of ICOs. There are mixed signals coming from Russia that make it an uncertain environment overall, but in general it is not considered friendly.ChinaAs you all know, China recently banned ICOs. Several reports are coming out now saying that the ban will be temporary as licenses for the industry are drafted. Note that China has been in a state of constant flux with cryptocurrencies, so it would not be a huge surprise to see this be a pause rather than a permanent ban.Hong KongYet again, another statement made recently warning that most tokens are securities.Country Overview (Skip to\u00a0Here)In order to make life a bit easier, I\u2019ve created a timeline of the recent statements by all the different countries related to ICOs:Update: While writing this article, Thailand also released a similar statement claiming many tokens are securities.As you can see, the regulatory scene around ICOs is heating up quickly. We are seeing more and more nations give their opinion on whether or not tokens should be viewed as securities or assets. In general, the consensus seems to be that they are securities (for what it\u2019s worth, that\u2019s how I view them too). Why the sudden interest? The chart below illustrates why:Source: CoinSchedule.comOverall, it seems like we\u2019re headed to an ICO market that will face much more substantial regulation soon. ICOs of the future may require registry with the appropriate regulatory agency, a prospectus, and will likely become limited to accredited investors. Even Waves, a platform that prides itself on making the token launch process as easy as possible, recently released a blog calling for a global advisory committee that can evaluate token sales in order to help retail investors.The major cryptocurrencies impacted by the health of the ICO market include Ethereum, NEO, Waves and many others. However, Ethereum is the most important of these due to its sheer size. At the time of writing this, Ethereum is currently valued at approximately 40% of Bitcoin\u2019s market cap. If we see the payment channels for ICOs dry up due to regulatory agencies deeming them as securities, it could lead to a sharp decline in Ethereum that brings the market down with it.Ironically, you can also argue that the exact opposite could happen too. Filecoin recently raised the most of any ICO in history, estimated at around $257m. The kicker is that the team decided to do it the \u201cright\u201d way and only invited accredited investors for the token sale. In addition, they also put significant effort into being SEC compliant through the proposal of the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), inspired by Y Combinator\u2019s Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE). The idea here is to comply with Regulation D, hence attempt to dodge some of the greater complications that come with the full-blown \u201csecurity\u201d definition. Time will tell which of these two sides will win.

You\u2019ve all seen the headlines related to BTC China shutting down. Some sources are claiming that this will extend to all Bitcoin exchanges in China. If you look at the reports by the WSJ, Bloomberg, and Caixin, they all use language that suggests all exchanges will be shut down in some capacity (read update at top of this section). And if you look at the declines in Bitcoin, you\u2019ll notice that the declines in the three major Chinese exchanges (Okcoin, Huobi, & BTC China) are nearly identical despite only one of them making an announcement:Source: Cryptowat.chTherefore, the market is pricing in that all major cryptocurrency exchanges in China will be closed. Bitcoin declined over 20% on the news, so this is a clear example of how removing gateways to crypto from fiat currencies is one of the largest investing risks. China\u2019s crackdown on exchanges may not kill the market by itself given only 13% of trading volumes are made using the Yuan, but it could be the beginning.The real concern is whether or not this is the first step by sovereignties to shutdown cryptocurrencies as a whole. They may not be able to shutdown the cryptocurrencies themselves, but they can slaughter any chances of mass adoption if they remove the transfer channels between fiat and crypto. What would happen if the United States barred GDAX and Gemini from conducting exchange?Many people champion this as the greatest risk to cryptocurrencies. However, China has always been the odd one out. Their borders are capitally controlled, they censor the internet through TCP packet monitoring, they\u2019ve outlawed VPNs, and the list goes on and on. Is it reasonable to believe other countries will follow this extremist government? Still, since China seemed to lead the charge in the crackdown on ICOs, there is the possibility that China will also lead the charge on stricter regulations for exchanges.Source: BitcoinChartsWhile China is a significant portion of the market, they are nowhere near as influential as Japan and the US are. This is important because Japan has an exceptionally friendly environment towards cryptocurrencies, being one of the first major countries to welcome them with open arms. The two major US fiat-to-crypto exchanges, GDAX and Gemini, both have FDIC insurance and each have their own benefits that shield them from a crackdown. Coinbase, which owns GDAX, has recently raised $100m in a Series D funding round that values the company at $1.6 billion and adds legitimacy to the business. Gemini is backed by the Winklevoss brothers who have strong relationships with regulators and continue to help develop the space by working on getting a Bitcoin ETF (COIN) approved.As such, I do not see the principal markets removing the gateways to cryptocurrencies from fiat. While I do expect regulations to tighten on exchanges, this is the natural evolution of cryptocurrencies and will increase their legitimacy. Do not look at China as an example of how other countries will behave. Ask yourself honestly if that has ever been a good idea. Bitcoin will need to be hit by more than just China for the \u201cbubble\u201d to pop, but it is worth noting that any headlines of increased regulations on exchanges in Japan or the US could lead to further downward spirals in price. As such, keep an eye out for statements by the FSA and SEC.Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust: Buy or\u00a0ShortLet\u2019s shift directions for a moment here and discuss the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). For those of you unfamiliar, this is the open-ended fund that invests in Bitcoin and each share represents 0.09242821 BTC. Because the fund can be purchased through more traditional means and can be used in an IRA, they trade at a significant premium over net asset value (NAV). At the time of writing, each share is worth $518.38 which values Bitcoin at $5,608.46 or roughly a 68% premium at the time of close on Sept 14th trading. This is much lower than the 101% premium the last time I wrote about GBTC.Source: YChartsOkay so, the premium has decelerated quite a bit. Should you buy it now? No, probably not. First of all, there are way too many headline risks surrounding Bitcoin at the moment. What happens when Huobi or Okcoin announce they will be closing their doors as well? I am writing this on Thursday and the current word is that they will be meeting with regulators today (Friday). It\u2019ll be all over CNBC, WSJ, Seeking Alpha, Forbes, and any other publication you can possibly imagine. You can bet Andrew Left is drinking champagne right now. But what\u2019s interesting about GBTC is that it gives you an opportunity to effectively leverage your position if Bitcoin bounces back, which I suspect it will. Continuing the tradition from my previous article where I discussed sell conditions, here I will be offering buy conditions:1. Bitcoin\u2019s Price hits $2,700 and premium is below 75%2. Premium to NAV falls to 40% while Bitcoin is below $3,250Unlike my previous article, where I provided conditions for both price directions, I do not recommend buying GBTC if Bitcoin accelerates in the next week or two. The only such scenario where I imagine Bitcoin will do so is if we don\u2019t see news from Huobi / Okcoin or if the news is better than expected. I would give it at least a week or two to shake out headline risks from China before buying if Bitcoin goes to the upside. I\u2019ll likely post an update to my thoughts if such an event occurs. I would never short GBTC barring an absurd premium (150% or higher). The reward does not even come close to outweighing the risks.Wrapping It All\u00a0UpDid you survive until the end here? If so, congratulations! Our tour of the dark side of the moon is over and I can take you back to the bright side. Bitcoin is a strong long-term investment for anyone who understands what it offers and its perception by the greater markets currently. There are many institutional investors waiting on the sidelines for moments like this to pick it up cheaply. That dry powder will start getting deployed in bulk at around $2,700 if Bitcoin goes that low.However, it is always crucial to be mindful of the risks associated with any investment. In this article, we covered the three that I perceive to be the greatest threat to Bitcoin\u2019s long-term future. These three catalysts are:1. The collapse of Bitfinex and Tether as a result of fraud.2. Capital inflows drying up for ICOs as funding channels become constricted through regulations, leading to a significant market decline led by Ethereum.3. Blocking of fiat gateways that enable cryptocurrency exchanges to operate, effectively cutting crypto off from the real worldI can\u2019t provide much counterargument to the first catalyst. Even though it\u2019s more akin to a conspiracy theory than anything else, I don\u2019t see strong evidence to the contrary. As such, I am monitoring the Bitfinex & Tether situation closely. However, the other two catalysts have some strong counterarguments that we briefly discussed and which I will likely go into more detail on in the future:1. Increased regulations could lead to a boom in ICO funding as it adds legitimacy and attracts wealthier investors who provide the bulk of funding anyway, as evidenced by Filecoin\u2019s ICO raising record breaking levels of capital.2. While China is the obvious headline here, Japan is still pro-cryptocurrency and has the highest volumes in the world. The US has added legitimacy to its exchanges through its association with the Winklevoss brothers, FDIC insurance, and sizable seed funding rounds by venture capitalists.Still here?

But I did not seriously study bitcoin until August 2013. And within 24 hours I realized what it was, looked at a chart, saw a huge head shoulders pattern developing and could not buy enough fast enough.I rushed to open a Coinbase account but since I had no money when the ACH hit my bank account the first 10 bitcoin purchase was covered by a cash advance on my credit card.But that\u2019s not all. I have a rule never to give out investment advice. But this was an exception. I was hooked and recommended to all my family, friends, and business associates to buy 10 bitcoin and simply sock them away. Forget about them for ten years and buy more as a savings program. Invest $1,000.00 with the potential of million dollar gains.In many cases I would send a fractional amount of bitcoin.\u00a0.25 or\u00a0.1 or\u00a0.01 bitcoin just to encourage friends and family and suppliers to get started.This is a common story for us not so early, early adopters.All to no avail.Only one of my sons made a small purchase of bitcoin. The other sons I simply made a small gift or in one case purchased a motorcycle with bitcoin. But all purchased a home with, of course, a heavy mortgage. Going against the trend is not an easy thing to do. (Interestingly, I met a man from Argentina at the Latin American Bitcoin Conference in Bogota who proudly told me his son had sold his condo in 2016 and rented a small apartment in order to buy bitcoin and could now purchase 10\u201320 condos if he so desired. Wow! What kahunas!)My suppliers were another matter. I literally begged contractors to accept bitcoin. A few did. And all but my accountant sold out with a small gain. Frankly, I had completely forgotten I had paid the accountant a $1,000.00 invoice with 4.5 bitcoin with instructions not to sell the bitcoin until I got the call this past October.You know the call. \u201cHey Ugly Old Goat, this is your accountant. Thank you so much for making me take bitcoin and telling me not to sell it! I followed your advice. Again, thank you so much!\u201d A friend for life. I just paid tax on the biggest income of my life and my accountant\u2019s invoice was less than half of what it was in 2013. Go figure.Not to mention all the calls in November and December from those I gifted \u201cHey Ugly that $20 bitcoin you gave me that is now worth $1800! I didn\u2019t buy any more like you said! What should I do now?\u201d I heard from at least a dozen old friends, some I had not spoken to in years!I suddenly remembered why I never gave investment advice before and why I will never give investment advice again. It is a wasted effort. Few, if any, people will follow the advice and when you are right you get the calls, \u201cHey Ugly Old Goat what should I do now?\u201dWell, fortunately I did not recommend buying in November or December. And, in fact, I was actively cashing in a substantial amounts of my btc holdings to acquire a few assets I long desired. But now what?As a successful trader the one thing I know is I don\u2019t know where the market is going. But for some reason few understand this. They somehow believe I am some kind of magical guru who can forecast the bitcoin market. And this is also the garbage you get in nearly every market chat group which is why I no longer give any of them the time of day. And I really can\u2019t blame the chat group participants because they are simply emulating the canardish displays of delusional drivel by YouTube stars who foolishly claim such knowledge.Nothing can be further from the truth. I have no idea if bitcoin is going to $1500 or $30,000 in 2018 or both! The game is to be prepared regardless of what happens. And limit the amount of risk taken on any given trade or equity swing to no more than 5% of my hodlings. In my last article I outlined how important it is to have the ability to blow out of bad trade with a loss and a smile on your face. If you do not have a smile of contentment when you take a loss you are over-trading. Pure and simple.And for this reason 95% of the trading participants in the bitcoin market should not be there. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I love you. We love you. Without your repeated failures I, and other professionals, could not eat your lunch.This Ugly Old Goat loves to eat rekts. Especially in a highly leveraged derivative world like what is offered on Bitmex. It is a professionals market and if you do not know what you are doing you are best advised to stay away.From trading that is, but not from bitcoin. Bitcoin is unconfiscatable and that is its unique intrinsic value. The new assets I have acquired can all be taken by the powers that be. Bitcoin is uniquely different and hence valuable.THE FIVE PERCENTERS AND THE SOUND MONEY TRANSITIONSo how do we best advise the new bitcoin arrivals who are eager to enter the market? Those who should be entering the market to participate in the global sound money transition but don\u2019t know where to begin? Well, my first task is to get you into bitcoin and bitcoin alone. And that can be a very difficult since 95%+ of the information on the bitcoin and cryptos space are scams and millions are spent to lead you into these scams.But there are what I call the 5 percenters. And for the most part we all know each other. Tone Vays, Jimmy Song, World Crypto Network, The Bitcoin Meister, Trace Mayer, any and all Bitcoin core developers, Samson Mow, WhalePanda, Tuur Deemester to name a few and this is by no means inclusive. My apologies to those I have left out. There are thousands of us and we can usually recognize one another within minutes of a conversation, a post or even a response to a tweet.And within this 5% there are impostors of the worst kind (wolves in sheep clothing) who try and sometimes successfully invade 5 percenter space with the right sounding spiel for bitcoin, only to lead lambs to slaughter while lining while their pockets from their own ICO or altcoin that\u2019s promoted as \u201cbetter than bitcoin!\u201dThe crypto space is 95% scams promising riches, while the 5 percenters rarely make such claims. 5%ers outline the potential rewards but emphasize the risk and technology while down playing the promise of wealth. (Translate: they are honest.)Historically, 80\u201390% retrenchment from the highs has happened before. In 2015 bitcoin traded below $200 after reaching a peak of over $1,300 in 2013. So a retrenchment to under $2000 can hardly be discounted. (This is not a prediction. It is simply a fact. A fact that all wise bitcoin hodlers consider. ) Bitcoin is a risky business. And those of us who have been around the block emphasize this fact. We generally emphasize the downside, not the upside.THE COMING PERFECT STORMA collapse in the crypto space has been long anticipated. And by crypto space I am talking about altcoins and ICO scams that are coming under increasing scrutiny and offer nothing of value but to enrich the issuers and promoters. When these scams are finally unmasked for what they really are it could have a short-term devastating effect on bitcoin. By the same token (no pun intended) this same unmasking will reveal to all the underlying value of bitcoin. And due to this near perfect storm of crypto scams collapse combined with promising new bitcoin innovation, volatility and price swings will likely be violent and pronounced in 2018 and beyond. Yes, a price swing below $2000 and over $30,000 are both possible and the wise hodler keeps this in mind. It is simply a fact that this is the current state of our global economies awash in the tsunami of fiat paper money. It is the nature of the beast.Further, there are some hodlers who have made long term fiat commitments in November, December, January, February based a bitcoin price of $7,500 and higher which sets up the real possibility a long grinding bear market shaking out hodlers who have switched from being strong hodlers to weak hodlers with fiat payments due 3 months, 6 months, 12 months or even 18 months down the road. They have essentially put their bitcoin at risk and a sell-off under $2000 cannot be discounted to shake out over-extended hodlers. (Again, this is not a prediction. It is simply a fact that a wise hodler must ask, \u201cCan I weather a perfect storm and take advantage of such a situation if it presents itself?\u201d)Success is not a matter of luck. You have no luck if you cannot play the game. Those who maintain a position to play the game will eventually get lucky. And the amount of luck relies heavily on the strategies you develop now. That is the purpose of this series of articles. To help you develop the winning entrance and exit bitcoin strategiesSo just how can we guide the newbie through these stormy waters and potential minefields? How do we guide our business friends, employees and fellow successful entrepreneurs through a possible slow grinding bear market and/or coming violent tidal waves of paper fiat and eventual hyper-bitcoinization? The answer is lies with bitcoin dollar cost averaging.The Power of Bitcoin Dollar Cost AveragingDollar cost averaging is simply the magic that happens when you purchase a fixed dollar amount of an asset at specific intervals over a period of time.And the results duplicate and even outperforms the portfolio of seasoned traders so long as the underlying asset fundamentals remain in place.By definition you will buy the greatest amount of the underlying asset at the lows and by hodling your results will match and even outperform the most seasoned traders. And this is accomplished without the risk and inherent dangers taken by speculators who perform the noble task of providing market liquidity that as an investor and entrepreneur we need to buy and sell (translate: do business) both locally and globally.To illustrate, the tables below shows the results of dollar cost averaging with the very worst timing starting at the bitcoin peak in January 2014 and peak in December 2017. Please note this table is edited to reflect the most recent prices.Above is the results of Bitcoin Dollar Cost Averaging $500 per month from the December 2014 peak. Source: http://www.coindesk.com/price/Above is the results of Bitcoin Dollar Cost Averaging $500 per month from the December 2017 peak. Source: http://www.coindesk.com/price/The first table illustrates a monthly purchase of $500.00 on the 15th of the month beginning on January 15, 2014. The second table illustrates a monthly purchase beginning December 15, 2017. This is based on a 6% monthly saving rate on a household income of $100,000 per year.Please note this illustration is based on the same principle of money management outlined Blowing Out At the Bottom With Smile.Blowing Out At the Bottom With a SmileFirst, let me say that I closed out all my speculative long bitcoin positions with Bitmex on the low of March 18th at\u2026medium.comThe risk is 6% of income. The total investment over 51 months is $25,500. The value on March 15, 2018 is over $410,000. The amount purchased is nearly 50 bitcoin with an average purchase price of just over $512. The maximum draw down was January 2015 with a draw down in equity of 53%+. The peak was December 2018 with unrealized equity of nearly $873,000. The result is on par with top professional bitcoin traders without exposure to the inherent risks involved with trading.Even following bitcoin crash, dollar cost averaging accomplished an unrealized equity of over $256,000 from a total investment of $32,00.00Dollar cost averaging from the December 2017 peak saved a new investor the heartache of purchasing the top of the market of over $17,000 only watch it lose 80% in value. Even with the very worst timing a total investment of $6,500 had a draw down to $2,987.92 or 54% which has improved significantly since the market stopped declining. And as of April 15, 2019 a total investment of $8,500 now stands at $7,244.69.So when should those who are looking to transition buy into bitcoin? The answer is last month, this month, next month and every month thereafter. The monetary transition remains in its infancy. The wise hodlers of today will be the fourth wave early adopters of tomorrow.My job is to spread the bitcoin message without hype, without the promise of instant riches but with convincing argument. Those with ears will hear. Those without ears cannot. The purpose of this series is limited to those who have ears to learn time tested market strategies and apply these strategies to bitcoin. Success is for the few, not the many.

In this article, I seek to show how and why Bitcoin is different than all the other altcoins that exist.How People Progress in\u00a0BitcoinHaving been involved in Bitcoin for a long time, I\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s a pattern to how people think about Bitcoins as they discover more and more of the ecosystem surrounding it. Usually, the thoughts go something like this:Wow, Bitcoin is amazing! There\u2019s a limit to how many will ever exist and significant control over my own money. How do I get some?Mining sounds really cool. That sounds like where the money is going to get made. How do I get miners and start making some Bitcoin?Mining looks really hard and difficult. I guess it\u2019s better if I just buy it. Now where can I go buy some?Awesome, now I own some Bitcoin, but what are all these other coins? Are they going to take over sometime?I want to hedge against Bitcoin self destructing somehow. Maybe I should buy some of these altcoins.I can\u2019t possibly look into every altcoin there is, there\u2019s just too many of them. How do I choose?I know, I\u2019ll just buy the most popular ones since they\u2019re probably the most likely to have any chance at all of beating Bitcoin anyway.Hmm, but the popular ones look pretty expensive. Maybe I\u2019ll buy some of these other ones that are just starting.Many people stop and stay at a particular step. For example, I know many people that have never bought Bitcoin but have simply mined all the Bitcoins they own. They\u2019ll gladly spend thousands on mining equipment but would never actually buy Bitcoin on the market. There are others that stay on the Bitcoin step and never proceed to look into altcoins. There are still others that hedge with pretty much every altcoin out there. Point is, that this pattern of looking for the best way to take advantage of this new innovation progresses in a predictable way, but different people are convinced by different things.Why People Buy\u00a0AltcoinsMostly, people get into altcoins as a way to hedge against Bitcoin. Here are some common reasons for someone to hedge with altcoins:Bitcoin may have some catastrophic failing that the altcoin is not subject to.An altcoin may have some future utility that is significantly better than Bitcoin allowing the altcoin to overtake Bitcoin.Even if Bitcoin continues to be the most valuable cryptocurrency, there may be room for altcoins to serve some other niche and hence may not be bad bets in their own right.Let\u2019s examine each reason.Bitcoin CatastropheThere are several ways in which Bitcoin could die catastrophically. The first would be a technical flaw (for example, a bug that would allow someone to steal coins). The second would be an economic flaw (for example, a code change that would instantly give 10 million coins to some entity for some reason). The third would be a consensus flaw (for example, Bitcoin splits into two roughly even coins).A technical flaw would be something like a vulnerability in the cryptography used by Bitcoin or some security vulnerability in the consensus code that could be exploited. A cryptographic vulnerability (such as a clever attack against the particular elliptical curve used in Bitcoin) would naturally extend to a lot of other coins as many use the same exact same crypto libraries. A security vulnerability would again naturally extend to a lot of other coins as many use a lot of the same code.Regardless, it\u2019s worth asking the question of what would be the consequences if something like this were to happen? First, if the vulnerability is caught early enough, most likely Bitcoin would patch and perhaps fork very quickly to reduce exposure to the vulnerability. Indeed something like this has happened before and a fork was exactly the reaction of the community.The more interesting question is what happens if the vulnerability is caught much later. Very likely, this will cause a huge drop in price, not just of Bitcoin but pretty much every other altcoin out there as confidence that cryptocurrencies in general can be trusted would be shaken. After all, how can we know an undetected vulnerability isn\u2019t in every altcoin as well?An economic flaw would be changes to the economic rules of Bitcoin itself. This has never been done nor discussed in Bitcoin. What we do know is that Bitcoin requires strong consensus for changes and changes of this nature cannot be done without support of almost all of the community as the recent scaling debate has shown. Such catastrophes are generally prevented a priori.That said, preventing technical and economic flaws requires a talented, dedicated and trustworthy development team and the risk being hedged against. Of course, the same risk exists in altcoins and it\u2019s worth pointing out that Bitcoin is one of the few cryptocurrencies that has a natural hedge against degraded development in the form of alternative clients.The final flaw is perhaps the real reason to actually hedge. The scaling debate has shown that there is at least some appetite in the community for a permanent split. There have been suggestions of doing a User-Activated Soft Fork or a consensus-busting feature being activated. Both are symptoms of the fact that Bitcoin really doesn\u2019t have a leader and isn\u2019t authoritarian. Most altcoins have a creator who acts as the de-facto benevolent dictator for their altcoin. The fact that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t is the risk. Of course, not having a benevolent dictator for life is a feature as well since there\u2019s less economic flaw risk.Future UtilityMost altcoins have some technical difference compared to Bitcoin and that is often the reason given for why people invest in them. The reasoning is that since these altcoins have much of the same utility of Bitcoin plus something else, the altcoin can be more useful than Bitcoin and thus take over.In one sense they\u2019re right. If you have a lot of the same technical properties, of course an altcoin existing in a vacuum would do about as well as or maybe even better than Bitcoin existing in a vacuum. Even if the code bases are substantially different but the economics very similar, they likely have the same effect in a vacuum.Of course, we don\u2019t live in a vacuum and the existence of Bitcoin affects the future utility. A feature shown to be useful is very likely to be adopted into Bitcoin itself in one form or another. Thus far, most features that differentiate altcoins haven\u2019t been proven to be that useful and thus haven\u2019t been added to Bitcoin.Should an altcoin show usefulness, there are a couple of ways that Bitcoin can add the same utility. First is that Bitcoin can add the feature itself if found useful enough. An example is confidential transactions which is being proposed in a sidechain to Bitcoin. Certain features, however, may conflict with Bitcoin\u2019s current use-cases. For example, Bitcoin is an excellent store of value and features that add a larger attack surface are likely not to be added without really good justification. This is where the second way to add utility to Bitcoin comes in. Entrepreneurs can add similar functionality while making a profit themselves. Given that consensus is very hard to change, the latter seems a much more likely path by which useful innovations will find their way to Bitcoin.In other words, not only do altcoins have to compete with Bitcoin itself, but they have to compete with all the entrepreneurs looking to build something on Bitcoin. Hence while hedging may make sense in some aspects, the more likely outcome is that Bitcoin in one form or another will consume other use cases nullifying any advantage than an altcoin might have.Niche UsageCertainly, many altcoins have tried to carve out niches for usage. Dogecoin, for example was built on tipping each other and transferring value, often just for the sake of transferring value. Ripple was originally conceived as a way for banks and large institutions to transfer value.The main way a niche coin makes sense is if it can do something that Bitcoin can\u2019t or won\u2019t do. What Dogecoin quickly found out is that Bitcoin tipping is just as easy. You may argue that this will be a problem again due to tx fees in Bitcoin and perhaps Dogecoin has a role to play going forward, but Dogecoin tipping was never really on-chain to begin with and neither was Bitcoin tipping (changetip was a centralized service). Should tipping come back into fashion, this is something that the Bitcoin ecosystem can easily do. Banks transferring value to each other can do that with Bitcoin.Niche usage is similar to the future utility argument except on a smaller scale and the same argument applies. Entrepreneurs have every incentive to bring similar, profitable innovations to Bitcoin given the larger user base to work with.What Makes Bitcoin DifferentThe main advantages of Bitcoin are network effect and proven security. Both are nearly insurmountable advantages.Bitcoin has a proven usage case as a store of value. It\u2019s instructive that most coins try to carve out some differentiation based on much smaller use cases, such as prediction markets, buying things completely anonymously or adding a decentralized name server.Bitcoin has a large lead as a store of value over every altcoin in having existed 8 years without failure. The security of Bitcoin has been proven far more than its much younger counterparts with usage by almost every metric exceeding that of altcoins.Further, Bitcoin is more accessible, with more exchanges, more merchants, more software and more hardware that support it. Bitcoin is far more liquid, with much larger volumes than every altcoin. Bitcoin has the largest developer ecosystem with more software and more implementations than any altcoin. Bitcoin has the most entrepreneurs creating companies around it with a lot of intellect, dedication and creativity going toward making it more useful.When you compete with Bitcoin, not only are you competing with its much larger user base, development team and mining operation, but you\u2019re also competing against the very large ecosystem of startups, open source projects and entrepreneurs.An ExampleTo make this clearer, imagine I create a coin for email spam filtering. Let\u2019s call this altcoin SpamCoin. It\u2019s an altcoin that lets you message someone only if you pay them some SpamCoin. Suppose this actually turns out to be very useful and lots of people start using it, making SpamCoin more valuable. What would happen?It\u2019s unlikely that Bitcoin would add SpamCoin\u2019s features in directly (though with sidechains, I suppose you can\u2019t even rule that out). But there is a strong possibility that some entrepreneur would create a similar service based on Bitcoin. They would have a much larger potential user base to start from and you wouldn\u2019t need SpamCoin to use it. The barrier of entry would be less, the user base more, so in the end, the new Bitcoin service would have built in network effect advantages that SpamCoin wouldn\u2019t have.That\u2019s not to say SpamCoin can\u2019t win, but it does face longer odds.ConclusionThis is not to say that altcoin investment is bad. Each investor needs to evaluate their own risk vs. reward ratio and decide whether that\u2019s a good fit for their goals. What is clear is that altcoins are actually not a great hedge against Bitcoin. Much of the same risk exists in the altcoin and much of the potential rewards consumable by Bitcoin.It\u2019s possible for an altcoin to take over Bitcoin, but it would have to show far more (present, not future) utility first and be able to grow itself to be competitive with Bitcoin\u2019s network before the Bitcoin ecosystem has a chance to add the same feature.As Bitcoin evolves, we can expect Bitcoin to grow in unexpected ways as new utility is found. Bitcoin owners can expect that its usefulness will only increase over time. In contrast, altcoin owners have substantially more risk of the coin falling into disuse.In other words, Bitcoin has already lapped the field and has the ecosystem and the resources to compete with significant advantages. Bitcoin has two things going for it that help significantly in this respect. Stability and entrepreneurship. Both far exceed that of altcoins thus far and will make catching up very challenging.Want to get curated Technical Bitcoin News?

However, many people, including some very intelligent and well-respected people in their own right, still have trouble understanding the the idea of Bitcoin and in many cases even question its value and purported utility in the world. While Bitcoin today showcases a vast body of anecdotal evidence which argues its utility or potential future utility, due to the pseudonymous nature of the blockchain as well as other factors, it is still hard to come across aggregate data which shows this behavior occurring on a consistent and measurable scale.To attempt to address this problem, I took a close look at trading volumes on the Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin trading website Localbitcoins.com (LBC). The first reason I chose LBC is because, unlike other low or no fee, frictionless exchanges, trading Bitcoin through LBC is costly. On the whole, Bitcoin trades on LBC occur at an average of 4.5% over the USD equivalent spot price globally, and the spread between ask and bid is often considerable, especially in developing countries. Secondly, also unlike other exchanges which post large crypto-to-crypto volumes, trading volume on LBC is almost exclusively fiat-to-crypto. Together, these circumstances substantiate the argument that, proportionally speaking, fewer traders are using LBC for speculative reasons in comparison to other exchanges. Additionally, because trades on the platform are denominated in over 150 fiat currencies, data pulled from it can shed light on which areas of the world Bitcoin is seeing increased volumes and which areas aren\u2019t. Lastly, because LBC is based in Finland and merely facilitates trades between two parties, it is able to sidestep the regulations of the many countries whose citizens choose to trade on the platform. Because of this, LBC is often times the platform people use when being exposed to Bitcoin for the first time, and that makes the data all the more illuminating.To be sure, there has been progress in the past to quantify this data from websites like Coin.dance, Bitcoinity, and the lesser known Anacoinda, but the accuracy and comprehensiveness was lacking, none of the data was ever broken down to show a country by country per person impact, and perhaps most importantly, none of the data was ever put against socioeconomic factors to produce evidence of utility use. My intention in writing this article is to:Provide the most comprehensive, accurate, and interpretable analysis of LBC trading volumes to date;Describe and implement a new metric to reflect the true impact Bitcoin is having in various countries;Reveal trends of said impact which argue for Bitcoin\u2019s utility by comparing it to socioeconomic indicators in those same countries.Showing USD Equivalent Volume by\u00a0CountryTo start our analysis simply, LBC traded 440,000 Bitcoins equivalent to $3.1 Billion USD in 2018. The following treemap shows a breakdown of the top 15 country volumes and their equivalent USD value last year:Hover your mouse over country names to reveal USD equivalent volume and transaction amountShowing USD equivalent Volume by Region, Over\u00a0TimeUntil now, there has been no attempt to group country volumes into regions with heuristic considerations for geography, development, and political alignment:The graph above is highly interpretable and highlights three primary trends:The amount of speculation on the platform is still considerably high, especially in certain regions;Developed countries in North America and Western Europe were the first to shows considerable volume, triggered by the bubble of late 2013, but were soon overtaken by less developed regions;Venezuela-fueled trading in South and Central America has been on a consistent uptrend, regardless of bubbles, for nearly every quarter in LBC\u2019s history.Showing Value Transferred per Economic Person Globally, Over\u00a0TimeLooking at USD equivalent value transferred alone is insufficient when attempting to understand Bitcoin\u2019s true impact in various countries. The most populous, richest, and most internet connected countries naturally overshadow the rest. To address this issue, I developed a new metric which adjusts for these factors and returns a score which I believe is the best reflection of Bitcoin\u2019s impact via LBC globally. I call it Usage per (Online) Economic-Person, or UP(O)EP:V = Volume (BTC)Pr = USD Equivalent Price on day of tradeIP = Internet Penetration of given countryPo = Population of given countryE = GDP (Purchasing Power Parity) per Capita of given countryFor each country, we take the USD equivalent value transferred and divide it across the number of people who could possibly use Bitcoin as measured by number of people with internet connectivity. We then divide that number by the purchasing-power-adjusted economic output per person to reflect the relative value in that country.In the animation below, we finally get a complete country-by-country image of usage per person globally according to LBC. The shade of each country is determined by its corresponding UP(O)EP value and is normalized on a scale between 0 and 1000 to show relative impact over the 24 quarters since LBC has come online. You can pause the animation on any quarter, zoom in on certain areas of the map, and hover over countries to see relative UP(O)EP values as well as a host of other related data:Data Considerations in Appendix: [1]There are many, many compelling stories that this animation sheds light on: the political and economic crisis in Venezuela, Russia invading Crimea and the corresponding international sanctions, China \u2018banning\u2019 Bitcoin periodically, Kenya and its M-Pesa revolution, South Africa and the MMM ponzi scheme, Sakawa and the lack of Paypal in West Africa, and Panama and its status as an offshore financial center, just to name a few. On the whole though, one can make a few general inferences:Meaningful UP(O)EP started in developed countries in late 2013 and migrated to less developed countries over time.Countries with monetary and financial restrictions, both by local governments on their own citizens as well as by the international community on those local governments, create favorable conditions for Bitcoin adoption.Adoption is regional, beginning in certain \u2018X\u2019 factor countries and spreading to neighboring jurisdictions over time.Not all countries with political and economic circumstances favorable to Bitcoin adoption have achieved it. The countries which seemed to have achieved escape velocity tend to be those which also have a minimum threshold of internet penetration, smartphone penetration, and technical literacy. Venezuela, Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana are good examples.OFAC, EU, and UN sanctioned countries like North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, and Iran have for the most part have remained on the sidelines for years, but it is uncertain if this is a result of true lack of adoption or if LBC has restricted volumes in these places at the compulsion of their own jurisdiction, Finland. Recently however, Iran has gained serious traction, and Syria, Sudan, Burma, and others have begun to see their first transactions. More clarification is desired.Some countries you might think would have higher levels of Bitcoin adoption by now such as Turkey, Argentina, and India have not achieved it. This goes to show that the issue is complex and individualized by country according to their laws, culture, and ingrained habits. Additionally, if a country already has alternative methods to achieve wealth preservation, capital flight, remittance, etc, then it may not need Bitcoin as much.Comparing Value Transferred per Economic Person to Levels of Economic Freedom Over\u00a0TimeWhile Bitcoin adoption is highly situational from country to country, the following plot shows that, over time, in one form or another, UP(O)EP values have been steadily rising in countries with determined poor levels of economic freedom, and they have been doing so at an accelerating pace:Data Considerations in Appendix: [2]In 2013, 2014, and 2015, the trend line actually showed that countries with high levels of economic freedom were trading Bitcoin more. But again, as Bitcoin knowledge dispersed to developing countries through the years, an unmistakable trend took shape. That trend suggests Bitcoin\u2019s utility is higher in countries which are economically oppressed. Still, the trend is only beginning to emerge and there are many outliers. Countries low in economic freedom and low in UP(O)EP (countries below the trend line and to the right) like Iran and Bangladesh only recently started trading and have yet to hit their stride, and countries high in economic freedom and high in UP(O)EP (countries above the line and to the left) like New Zealand and the United Kingdom likewise have their own specific factors. In the future, I will incorporate new layers of data to account for these outliers in an attempt to strengthen the fit of this data to the trend line.Data and Analysis\u00a0ConcernsIn recent years, cheaper and more user-friendly regulated exchanges in many developed countries have come online. This has caused trade volumes once primarily executed on LBC to migrate away. Correspondingly, UP(O)EP values in places like the US, EU, and Japan are likely underrepresented. As a result of this, some of the trends I\u2019ve identified would likely be weakened. While this is a valid concern, consider that many of the same countries where cheaper, more user-friendly, regulated exchanges would stand to gain the most are the same countries which, due to the ineptness or unwillingness of their own governments, still lack them. In other words, the fact that better exchanges are not allowed to exist in certain countries furthers rather than detracts from the argument that Bitcoin\u2019s utility today resides mostly in economically oppressed regions. Refer to the appendix for additional concerns regarding data and methodology [3].Final ThoughtsI believe that the collection and representation of this data serves as one of the best proofs of concept for Bitcoin to date. To be sure, this data reflects only a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem and much remains to be proven, but I hope that it may come to serve as a modicum of persuasion to those who still have their doubts. The final story in this analysis is that, in totality, nearly six years of aggregate data paint the picture that Bitcoin has utility and that its promise is beginning to be realized for the types of people Satoshi said it would.As a final takeaway, consider that in the 4th quarter of 2018, as Bitcoin price and interest seemed to hit their doldrums, 23 countries on LBC had their best quarters ever. Almost all of these countries are in the developing world. While some of these volumes may seem insignificant now, consider that less than three years ago Venezuela\u2019s volume was less than 1% of what it is now:Appendix:[1]Syria, Myanmar, the Congo, Taiwan, Namibia, and South Korea trades are not showing on the map currently. I am working on cleaning the data so that they are shown.UP(O)EP values for countries which use EUR, XAF, and XOF are understated. Additionally, the numbers shown for volume, USD equivalent, and transactions for each of these countries are actually the combined numbers for all countries using those currencies. I am working on a fix for this.XAF is the currency used by six countries in Central Africa. XOF is the currency used in 8 countries in West Africa. When either of these currencies have transactions, all of their corresponding countries show on the map, even though it is more likely that only one or two of these countries are actually transacting Bitcoin right now.Despite having known volumes, Zimbabwe and Ecuador are not shown on the map because they both use USD as their national currency and it is difficult to delineate which USD volumes are attributable to which countries. I have some ideas for this but have not implemented them yet.Maximum \u2018redness\u2019 on the map is achieved at a UP(O)EP of 275. I set it at this value because if I had set the maximum at 1000, you wouldn\u2019t be able to see the color contrast from many of the other countries. It would show Venezuela as red, 4\u20135 other countries orange, and the rest completely grey.[2]As a shortcut measure to filter out those countries which are still in their Bitcoin adoption infancy, I removed countries with less than 3000 transactions per year. This introduces some bias into the chart and I am devising another method to more objectively deal with this issue.[3]It widely understood that many users of LBC often take their trading offline once they establish a relationship with their counterparty. This suggests that volumes shown through the LBC API are only a portion of the true activity originating from it.In addition to regulated exchanges coming online in developed countries, developing countries such as Nigeria, South Africa and others have also seen Bitcoin buying alternatives emerge. Some of these alternatives are also measurable and I will be working to integrate them into my analysis over time.Despite being a P2P platform, transactions posted from LBC\u2019s API are NOT on-chain (They have their own custody system) so you can not verify them through block explorers.Data Sources:LocalBitcoins API DocumentationIndex of Economic Freedom: Promoting Economic Opportunity and Prosperity by CountryHistorical exchange rates from 1953 with graph and chartsInternet users by region and country, 2010\u20132016Lastly,If you have thoughts or concerns with my data or methodology, please reach out to me,If you are a utility user of LBC or other platforms in one of countries where Bitcoin is seeing exploding growth, please reach out to me to tell me your story.I would like to do data-driven L/S fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies for a living.

This is the first time since 2013, as I had forecast in that blog post\u200a\u2014\u200aand to be even clearer, I said that it would hit $15bn market cap this year. This happened today at $934 and when I had made the original forecast, it was about $1,000 as fewer coins were in circulation at that point, as I have detailed in this blog post.Disclaimer:Before I break down my thoughts for 2017, I wanted to point out a couple of things.I tweeted this out at the start of December:In total, Bitcoin spent less than 48 hours in the $800 zone, after trading sideways for weeks in the $700's. Apart from the usual troll tweets responding to this tweet, I also received some flattering responses here:As much as I\u2019m flattered by the attention and the emergence of nicknames such \u201cBitcoin Oracle\u201d (Thanks to TwoBitIdiot for coining it!). I do feel the need to make a point of two things, in particular.Firstly, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, and everything I say has a certain percentage chance of either occurring or not occurring\u200a\u2014\u200awe live in a probabilistic world, so when I make a call, it\u2019s because I think the outcome is highly likely, but that does not always mean it\u2019s certain.Secondly, I\u2019m a macro guy\u200a\u2014\u200abig picture focus. I don\u2019t look at the trading charts every day (I just don\u2019t have the time!) and even though I don\u2019t actively trade anymore, I do understand things like leverage, slippage and liquidity in markets quite well. I don\u2019t do technical analysis as macro factors will shift the playing field and disrupt the charts so in my opinion, they are often best used for looking back, and not forward.Most of my calls are based upon fundamentals that I observed from my working knowledge of capital flows, supply & demand, and other fundamental perspectives on economics, psychology, money, business, game theory and a host of other subjects\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding life experiences and the differences between living in South Africa and the USA (capital controls, hyperinflation leading to Zimbabwe\u2019s currency collapse, high interest rate environments, etc). If you have read my prior posts, you will find this to be the case when I lay out fundamentals for why I believe things in the Bitcoin world will play out the way I forecast or suggest. This is not wizardry or crystal ball stuff; it\u2019s just observations that I have made from analyzing lots of disparate data and information derived from multiple sources and then trying to figure it all out. And, sometimes I will be wrong.The late 2016 price surge:Bitcoin has performed particularly well over the past month, for 2 primary reasons. The first is largely due to the macro economic factors\u200a\u2014\u200ademonetization in places like India & Venezuela, geopolitical concerns over the Trump election and its impact worldwide, and most importantly, but- most misunderstood and not often cited- the recent fed rate hike which puts pressure on emerging market currencies, strengthens the dollar and in turn creates a surge in the forex/BTC trading price. This in turn creates additional foreign buying and demand for Bitcoin as a forex hedge, particularly outside the US, because the price of Bitcoin in that country is rising quickly.The second factor is that after the $800 price mark was breached, there was a hollow supply interval between $800\u200a\u2014\u200a$900 (i.e. not a lot of sellers, for various reasons which would take too long to explain in this post). This triggered an effective short squeeze and pushed the price above $900 very quickly. We will most likely find a potentially short period of consolidation around low $900's, before we start testing the 4 digit barrier, potentially with one or two mini spikes to the mid $900's and then a sell off back into the upper $800's/low $900's as the market finds its feet after skipping a beat through the $800's. There is also the year end impact of profit taking around December 31, but I don\u2019t expect it to be outside these ranges.Dollar interest rate hikes driving Bitcoin price up:As I alluded to in the previous point, the fed interest rates impact Bitcoin to a degree that most people will not grasp. This is a topic for a much longer post, so I will need to be brief here. Essentially, the higher the rates go, the higher the demand for Bitcoin will be. The divergence that you see is happening because Gold has been heavily favored by Gold bugs for historical reasons (in times of crises, etc) as the go-to commodity based store of value if an economic collapse happens, etc\u200a\u2014\u200awhich was often followed by a period of low interest rates and then inflation.Inflation is just not happening in the US, due to Quantitative Easing. As a result, Gold is still overvalued, especially if the fed now continues to raise rates, which I expect will occur. Bitcoin will rise with an interest rate hike because unlike Gold, there is further upside in the capital value of Bitcoin, so the need for some type of yield to offset it is greatly reduced.When the fed raises rates, emerging market economies have their currency devalued, which raises the effective price of Bitcoin for people in those markets, creating more equity value in their Bitcoins and driving up demand for more. This is because the price to mine a Bitcoin is largely uniform (electricity price, aside) in every country in the world and it\u2019s a commodity that trades freely across global markets\u200a\u2014\u200alabor input costs are not germane to Bitcoin, unlike Gold. If your currency devalues, it just costs you more to mine a Bitcoin or buy a Bitcoin. The market doesn\u2019t care how your currency is performing.Some would argue that Bitcoins don\u2019t provide yield similar to gold and therefore should be subject to the same price pressures that rising interest rates impact gold, but the reality is that the current market capitalization of Bitcoin is fractional to gold and so, for the time being, the expected capital appreciation of Bitcoin heavily discounts the need for a yield curve right now. This may change in the future.To expand on fed monetary policy a bit more, the world has been on a dollar based debt binge for assets and equity over the past 8 years, with record low interest rates, which partially explains NIRP in some countries (watch RealVisionTV.com for more detailed info here). When rates rise, entities (corporates or governments) have to then make interest rate payments in USD and they then have to sell local currency in order to do that, which in turn weakens the local currencies even more\u200a\u2014\u200aeffectively trying to close out a dollar short position on a regular basis. This is over and above any unwinding of carry trade positions that are no longer profitable with higher cost dollars\u200a\u2014\u200aa vicious cycle ensues. Bottom line is that rate hikes devalue foreign currencies and strengthen the dollar.This is particularly visible in countries where entities with local currency earnings have been financing dollar denominated debts without sufficient dollar based income. Bitcoin is seen to be gaining in local currency price trading pairs, which makes it far more desirable and in effect increases demand, because of upward price momentum in those currencies which creates more demand for Bitcoin.Without a doubt, Bitcoin will rise further next year. I expect to be within the $3k range by the end of next year, as I have previously forecast.I would compare the last price spike in 2013 to $1255 as being \u201cirrational exhuberance,\u201d similar to the peak of the dot.com bubble\u200a\u2014\u200aso I don\u2019t expect another one like this again, but I could be wrong. Similarly, the tech world eventually crushed those \u201cbubble\u201d highs once the technology and businesses matured and built towards higher and even more sustainable highs, post 2000. Since the previous high for Bitcoin, it has been over 3 years. A lot has changed. I spoke about this in some detail during my TEDx Talk in 2015:I will write a follow up post which expands on some of the topics above in greater detail, but for now, I will summarize my expectations for next year.What to expect in 2017 for Bitcoin:Reasonably low volatility (for Bitcoin), maybe a couple of dips here and there, but a steady pace of growth.More broader industry use cases and applications for Bitcoin. My company, Civic, is building out a Blockchain based identity platform and I\u2019m very excited about the prospects of using a public ledger for global identity management (and no, we don\u2019t store your personal info on the blockchain!).Government sponsorship or endorsement of Bitcoin related companies and more likely, government led buying of Bitcoins or investment into Bitcoin mining companies or similar.Potential government crackdowns on Bitcoin in certain countries, due to capital flight or loss of exchange controls. This will drive up the Bitcoin price in the black markets in those economies.I do expect a 2 -3x price growth overall in 2017 for the USD/BTC pair. This may result in Bitcoin prices in other currencies being up 4 -7x, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that USD/BTC pairing is what we should use as the benchmark.Segwit will be adopted to handle scaling.What NOT to expect in 2017 for Bitcoin:Parabolic growth (not 20x) (i.e. Bitcoin $10k is probably not going to happen in 2017)A hard fork. We all saw what happened with Ethereum so I would give this a 5% chance of happening.Consumer adoption\u200a\u2014\u200athis is still trailing, and I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to see mass adoption of Bitcoin as a currency of any sort by average consumers. I would still argue that Bitcoin is a commodity today, not a currency. That will change in time.Special thanks to @viviedi, Craig Montuori, Zach Herbert and Andrew DeSantis for proof reading the final draft!", "responses": "21"}, {"title": "Community Update 1 - Setting up our Long-Term Strategy", "author_name": "Bitcoin Private", "link": "https://medium.com/@bitcoinprivate/community-update-1-setting-up-our-long-term-strategy-485ab308e132?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 6, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "4K", "content": "Community Update 1 - Setting up our Long-Term StrategyBitcoin PrivateBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 6, 2018In an effort to better streamline communicating our progress (both good and bad) with our end community, we will be publishing periodic community updates. These updates will touch on both short-term and long-term goals, how we are thinking about our strategy on all fronts, any setbacks we\u2019re experiencing, and whatever else may be on the contribution team\u2019s mind moving forward. For more granular, short-term action items, check out our March Spring deliverables that we published this past Sunday.Yesterday evening we had our first post-fork strategy meeting in which we discussed the longer-term Bitcoin Private product strategy and how we should implement various forms of enhanced operational efficiency to achieve our higher level goals. These goals include, but are not limited to:Executing on value add, differentiating product features, both for our core blockchain / official wallets and for the third party payment support systems we are planningSetting up a world class marketing & partnerships programProviding the best possible frameworks for support, both from the official contribution team and the open source communityContinuing to recruit some of the best engineering talent to help bolster our blockchain and application development effortsBeing one of the only cryptocurrency initiatives to place emphasis on true inclusion, with focus on gender diversity and traditionally underrepresented groups in technology / cryptoCore blockchain:Our main focus is to ensure that network stability and performance is sustained and optimized. As we expand our development team and complete the many action items ahead, we are working toward a longer-term roadmap that will showcase unique cryptographic innovations. For example:Introducing the ability to perform shielded transactions on an Electrum server\u200a\u2014\u200athis is uniquely secure and improves performance.Wallet RPC refinements\u200a\u2014\u200awe plan to eliminate confusing shielding-related RPC calls, making it easier for users to spend in all cases.Added support for easy spending of Segwit outputs\u200a\u2014\u200acurrently it is doable, but requires some real blockchain know-how.Official Wallets:Since the mainnet launch this past Friday, we\u2019ve already made immense progress with several updates to our wallets. We\u2019ve also communicated with the Ledger development team and have begun making the necessary enhancements for full support and integration. In other news:Expect a big update to Electrum BTCP in about a week! We are merging in upstream from https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/releases/tag/3.1.0. With this, we will be upgrading our servers to Electrum Protocol v1.2, which will greatly improve startup and sync speed.We will be releasing Electrum BTCP for Android immediately thereafter.From now on, we\u2019ll have a \u2018Stable\u2019 and \u2018Pre-Release\u2019 version for all builds. The pre-release will contain brand new changes that are ready for testing; the stable build is assured to have all release tests passing.We are beginning to automate testing and introduce a CI workflow. This will be added to all of our Github repos, beginning with the wallets. We plan to use Jenkins for this.Our lead designer is working on significant improvements to the interface layout and general usability of our wallets.We are also actively working on Trezor hardware wallet support.Marketing, Support, & Public Relations Strategy:One thing that has been and continues to play a meaningful role in our progress to date is our community. In such a short period of time we have built a purely organic following of tens of thousands of followers throughout the world across various social media channels. We see our community approach as three pronged:Official marketing campaigns and messagingSupport initiative to offer users across the world the assistance they needFormal public relations partners that help bring light to our cause at a more mainstream levelWe have created things such as the Bitcoin Private Ambassador program to help create and scale deeply rooted localized communities across the world. Since implementing this program, several highly talented community managers have even found their way to helping us out on an official capacity. We will be rolling out a newly renovated version of our ambassador program throughout the month of March. Aside our official social media vehicles, this will be a key vehicle in our marketing.Another aforementioned strategy we are putting in place is one we are extremely proud of and one that very few technology / crypto organizations think about (especially early on), is our diversity and inclusion program. We\u2019ve on-boarded a head of adoption and inclusion that will assist us in making sure we attract and welcome individuals of all backgrounds and gender. For example, we will be partnering with various women in blockchain groups over the next several weeks and months to assist with boosting our social footprint and adoption, both from a community and internal contribution team standpoint.Our support system contains many layers, one of which is setup right from our website. Our live chat web support is one that very few cryptos, if any at all, employ. In addition to our chat system and state of the art knowledge base that we constantly update, we are committed to providing Bitcoin Private stakeholders across the world the support they need through our Reddit, Telegram, and Facebook channels. The ambassador program will assist with scaling this out.From a public relations standpoint, we are confident that the accomplishments we will continue to make from both a macro standpoint and with specific regard to our initiative at Bitcoin Private will attract the right media & influencer partners to chat with us about our cause. For example, just earlier today CNBC published a video infographic on Bitcoin Private, and we believe this is a testament of the worldwide, widespread interest in our mission. We are always open to getting our story out and discussing the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Feel free to contact us at press@btcprivate.org if you\u2019d like to get in touch.Consumer / Enterprise third party payments strategy:As we have mentioned in the past, one of our most important core goals is to bring Bitcoin Private to a critical mass, mainstream audience so that consumers and vendors across the world will transact in the most private manner possible. Achieving this goal goes beyond developing a strong, core foundation at the platform level.This effort will involve developing easy to use, beautiful products / product integrations for payment gateways and vendors across the world. This effort will also involve developing a specialized support team across the world to educate and assist third party partners to understand the value in Bitcoin Private and subsequently onboard them on to our product offerings.At our strategy meeting yesterday evening we discussed several payment gateways that are already ahead of most others with regard to accepting cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin; examples may include but are not limited to CoinPayments, Cointopay, Stripe, and Globee among many others. We also discussed many exceptional merchant vendors that have long blazed the trail with accepting cryptocurrencies, examples may include but are not limited to Newegg and Steam. It\u2019s important to note that working towards these types of partnerships will require time.If you\u2019re interested in what we are building and how Bitcoin Private can enhance your customer / payments experience, please reach out to us at partners@btcprivate.org.Exchange partners strategy:Although the Bitcoin Private project is less than 90 days old from the moment it was announced, we have still managed to strike important relationships with leading exchanges across the world. We are well aware that just as important our product strategy is, making Bitcoin Private as accessible as possible via exchanges is just as important.Kucoin has credited it\u2019s Bitcoin holders with Bitcoin Private and has a market open for trading Bitcoin Private, although Bitcoin Private deposits are not offered yetHitBTC is working on listing Bitcoin Private as soon as possible, expected to be in MarchTrade Satoshi is also working on listing Bitcoin Private as soon as possible, expected to be in MarchBittrex has added Bitcoin Private to it\u2019s API as it prepares the Bitcoin Private wallet to credit their Zclassic holdersWe are in conversations with several other exchanges at this timeIf you are an exchange and want to have access to the vibrant Bitcoin Private market, please email us at partners@btcprivate.org.Advisors:Now that we have launched the mainnet and have our heads slightly more above the water past fork related tasks, we are looking for community experts in the technology and cryptocurrency world to garner insights and advice from pertaining to the all of these goals we are trying to achieve.We are already working with a couple and aim to make this a priority over the next several weeks and months. If you fit this category and believe in our mission, we\u2019d love to hear from you. Please shoot us a note at partners@btcprivate.org.Closing thoughts:This was quite a long update, however, we feel we owe it to our community to be as transparent as possible as we work hard to deliver on our mission of Bitcoin Private. As always, we remind our community to only trust resources and information shared from our official website, our official Github, our official Twitter account, and this Medium account.If you would like to join our engineering team, you can apply here. If you would like to contribute on any of our marketing efforts, the best way to start is to join our ambassador program here.We are excited to continue this community driven, open source journey to bring private transactions, both P2P and commercial, to a mainstream audience.

It would change the crypto market forever.Amazon as a Tech company and everything store, is perhaps the only thing Millennials trust more than investing in cryptocurrencies. We\u2019ve now reached a point where Big Tech will race to adopt them and it could change the future of banking and payments.KAKOA ADOPTING CRYPTO IS A HUGE\u00a0SIGNALWith Kakao, South Korean\u2019s largest messaging and fintech platform getting into cryptocurrencies and Telegram approaching an ICO at lightspeed, Amazon and Facebook have to move fast to keep up. Kakao has market penetration rate of over 90 percent with a multi-app empire in South Korea, that\u2019s like the WeChat (Tencent) of China.With Bitcoin plummeting and the cryptocurrency market cap eerily at almost half of what it once was, it seems as if Bitcoin\u2019s reign as a medium of exchange appears to be coming to an end. Litecoin is most likely to take its place.While Ethereum and Ripple allow us to see the Blockchain come to life with laser-focused proprietary blockchains, hard forks and diversification means we are seeing a bifurcation of what cryptocurrencies could become. As companies like coinbase rapidly expand and Bitcoin\u2019s price does not seem to be rebounding easily above $10,000, there\u2019s a tension in the air.Amazon for many analysts, still holds the key for being the platform in the best position to adopt their use in some form. Amazon after all has demonstrated foresight in tech with Alexa smart speakers, ebooks, kindle and convenience like same-day delivery. Litecoin is the more agile Bitcoin, without the weird karma, and it\u2019s the cryptocurrency that makes the most sense for Amazon to adopt along with Stellar. Bitcoin is not scalable and as a first-mover will not likely be ever more than a kind of digital gold. 2018 should therefore be the year for Ripple and Litecoin to both make significant progress.LITECOIN WILL OVERTAKE BITCOIN SOONER THAN YOU\u00a0THINKLitecoin overtaking Bitcoin is now inevitable, and no longer a question of how, but just a matter of\u00a0when.Amazon adopting Litecoin would immediately legitimize cryptocurrency as a valid means of transactions. Bitcoin was born out of the ashes of 2008, and was the first cryptocurrency to be traded a full eight years ago in March 2010, and while it\u2019s often credited with bringing blockchain technology into the spotlight it\u2019s now widely understood more sophisticated cryptocurrencies are slowly untethering themselves from BTC\u2019s volatility and as a speculative digital asset of value.CRYPTOCURRENCIES SET TO BECOME PART OF CHAT-APPSAs more Technology companies and payment apps adopt crypto integrations, cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin have the most potential to start to have mainstream implications as a digital means of exchange and enter our lives as ubiquitous (if digital) forms of payment.Litecoin among all the cryptocurrencies might have the most potential to become a simplistic form of digital exchange.AMAZON IS LIKELY GEARING UP FOR CRYPTO INTEGRATION INTO ITS WALLET AND AMAZON\u00a0PAYLitecoin should stay in the conversation as being the cryptocurrency most likely to be picked up by Amazon. Adopting Litecoin would provide an added customer experience to Prime members and as Amazon has embarked on partnerships with Wall Street banks to open an alleged checking account with its branding, adopting an established cryptocurrency such as Litecoin could legitimize the future of the cryptocurrency market like never before.Amazon could integrate Litecoin exchanges with QR codes just like WeChat made payments so common in China they ended the reign of\u00a0cash.With the advent of LitePay in 2018, this would be the right time for Amazon to adopt it on its platform in some form of beta. LitePay is basically a Litecoin payment system that became available in 41 countries on Monday, February 26, 2018.LITE PAY MAKES LITECOIN MORE APPEALING TO RETAIL\u00a0ADOPTIONLitePay is basically the proof of concept that without intervening transfer to fiat, cryptocurrencies could be adopted faster than we previously imagined they would. If smaller merchants start to adopt LitePay, Amazon could very well swoop in and either acquire Litecoin or fully integrate it into its own wallet. What if AmazonPay had a LitePay option? This would help it compete with the likes of WalmartPay and compete directly with Apple Pay and GooglePay. GooglePay is basically the new version of Android Pay and Google Wallet.LitePay is basically a crypto to fiat intermediary that could protect tech companies who decide to adopt a cryptocurrency to add customer experiences and help onboard crypto enamored Millennials on to their platforms and services.If Amazon doesn\u2019t go the crypto route soon, there is some chance Facebook and others\u00a0will.However only Amazon\u2019s adoption of a cryptocurrency or its own altcoin would truly legitimize the Crypto Singularity since the Bitcoin hype of 2017 has died down somewhat in the first half of 2018.ASIA MORE HONEST ABOUT CRYPTO SINGULARITYThe Chinese central bank\u2019s governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, in his recent press conference basically admitted cryptocurrency not only could\u00a0, but will eventually overtake fiat currencies, in terms of usage and importance. That makes J.P. Morgan calling crypto a \u201crisk factor\u201d look pretty subdued. The Crypto price depression of early 2018 is due to regulation and a rise in fraud activities, but cannot last forever.Amazon integrating the use of cryptocurrency payments into its platform seems almost inevitable given their rise in popularity and blockchain\u2019s more significant manifestations.The most simple, seamless, most secure and cheapest forms of exchange will win. Litecoin\u2019s founder Charlie Lee last in 2017 has to quell rumors of Amazon integration once already. Litecoin obviously has many advantages over Bitcoin ever being adopted, with nows appears low to nil. Litecoin is the silver Bitcoin, with a simpler algo and 4-times the lifetime cap with faster block gen. A typical bitcoin transaction takes longer than an hour to process, with fees of around $28, that\u2019s just not going to fly on chat-apps and for digital exchanges.LITECOIN MOST LIKELY TO BE INTEGRATED INTO\u00a0AMAZONIn terms of processing times Litecoin can do around 56 per second. Litecoin also has implemented an upgrade to its blockchain known as Segregated Witness, or \u201cSegWit\u201d for short. This means Litecoin can now with SegWit added, handle more merchants and transactions, as well as improved processing speeds and lowered transaction fees.Litecoin appears to have a clear path to becoming the go-to medium of exchange over time, and Amazon\u2019s adoption of it would completely break open crypto into the Western psyche of retail transactions and utility. While Western audiences are well behind Chinese consumers in mobile commerce and mobile payments, Amazon needs to radically alter its payments to create differentiation between the fragmented payments and mobile payments market in the U.S. and Canada. Amazon adopting a some form of cryptocurrency seems highly probable. Where we stand now in 2018, Litecoin just makes the most sense.", "responses": "10"}, {"title": "Giving a twitter bot ability to predict bitcoin value based on historical data", "author_name": "Ognjen Gatalo", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/giving-a-twitter-bot-ability-to-predict-bitcoin-value-based-on-historical-data-dbe237c40430?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 24, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "1.1K", "content": "Giving a twitter bot ability to predict bitcoin value based on historical dataOgnjen GataloBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 24, 2017For some time now I\u2019ve shown interest in cryptocurrencies, and most of all predicting their rise and fall in the next few days. I\u2019ve tried some algorithms, but at the end of the day, I think that no one can really with certitude claim their rise or fall. I\u2019ve tried to focus only on one currency, and bitcoin being the leader, I decided to go with it.Disclaimer: This article will concentrate to explain the algorithm used to predict the value.I have seen that the fastest way to get the information related to bitcoin is on twitter, so I decided to create a bot, that would every 2 hours tweet the predictions of bitcoin value in the next N days. N being the number of days people request the most. So for example if 3 people requested that the bot predicts the value in the next 5 days, and 7 people requested that the bot predicts the value in the next 2 days, the bot would tweet the prediction for 2 days, because the more people requested that prediction.I quickly created a node app and after some time of searching and trying to figure out the best way to query historical data, bitcoin charts and extract useful data that could be helpful for future rise and falls, I decided that the K nearest neighbors in combination with some other algorithms is the way to go.This prediction algorithm is constructed out of next steps:Collect all of the user tweets (requests)Get the most requested day to predict forGet the current bitcoin valueFind K (10) nearest dates in the past 2 months, on which the value of bitcoin was most similar to the current valueFor every date found (call this PAST_DATE), find the value of BTC after the next N days (call this N_DAYS_AFTER_PAST_DATE)For each date, calculate the difference between the values on N_DAYS_AFTER_PAST_DATE and PAST_DATESum all of those differences and divide it by KThe result is how much did bitcoin grew in the given time span between all of PAST_DATES and N_DAYS_AFTER_PAST_DATESIf this confuses you, I will try to make it a bit clearer now.First step: Collect all of the user tweets (requests)Using the Twit module, I search the twitter api for tweets that contain \u201c@coin_instinct Predict for <number> days\u201d extract just the numbers from the tweets, and create the array of numbers.Second step: Get most requested dayWhen a prediction is tweeted, the number of days in the future to predict is stored in a black list array. The black list array contains the number of days of the past 4 predictions, that helps solve redundancy issues, and tweeting the same prediction that has already been tweeted in the past 8 hours.This function is pretty simple, it just gets the most requested number in number array. If that number already exists in blackListArr, then it returns the second most requested, and so on. If all of the requested numbers are in the blackListArr, then the bot predicts for n random days in the future.Third step: Get the current bitcoin\u00a0valueUsing the blockchain.info API, we can get the current value of bitcoin, and store it into a variableThis function will run 2 minutes after the algorithm begins the work.Fourth step: Finding the K nearest neighborsHere I won\u2019t include all of the functions, that are being called, such as querying the coindesk api, for PAST_DATES and N_DAYS_AFTER_PAST_DATE, I will just extrapolate the finding nearest neighbors based on similarities that we get. Whole project could be found on my github page, that I put at the bottom of this article.As we calculated the differences between all of the bitcoin values in the past 2 months and current bitcoin value, we need to find the dates that have the difference values closest to 0. So we first call Math.Abs on whole similarities array and then, sort the array in ascending order.From here we can easy get the top 10 dates on which the value of bitcoin was the closest to the value now.Fifth step: Get final results\u00a0arrayHere we will get the array of objects, each containing start and end property. Start property will represent the value of bitcoin on the specific day in history, and End property will represent the value of bitcoin N days after that specific day. From this data, we can get the insight in value growth or loss.The code is pretty straightforward, we go through all of the kNearest and get the data for specific dates. Store those results into an finalResults array and return it.Sixth step: Calculating the predictionAll that is left is to calculate the prediction, and we do that with the next function call.And that is it! We also need to create the cool text with all of the emojis in it, and tweet the prediction of course.ConclusionIf you are still scratching your head over something that is fine, keep in mind that these are just raw functions, extracted from a full code that you can find on my github repo: https://github.com/ognjengt/coin-instinct-bot\u00a0. Please do check it out, all of this will make much more sense.Also, this is just my approach to somehow predict the bitcoin value in the next days, and I would like to hear opinions on this approach. The predictions don\u2019t always match the correct value, but I have noticed that most of the time, the predictions are just 100, or 200 $ off. So you could say that isn\u2019t that big of a miss, especially in this crypto world, where the charts are flying up and down like crazy.Problem with this algorithm is that it just analyses the historical bitcoin data, and makes prediction out of that, so there isn\u2019t any way to detect if the value is going to drop. I\u2019m working on inserting a human factor, where I would scrape the websites for possible articles that are hinting to the bitcoin value crash, and add that to the equation.And of course the thing this article is all about. To see the twitter bot live in action you can visit this link here: https://twitter.com/coin_instinct\u00a0. Try it out and tweet to him!

In this article, I seek to show how the Bitcoin Dominance Index is inherently deceiving and why there really isn\u2019t a crisis as so many would have us believe.The ArgumentThe Bitcoin Dominance Index was put together a few years ago to show exactly how much of the entire cryptocurrency economy is dominated by Bitcoin. Recently, the Dominance Index has been dropping and many point to the scaling debate within the community as a convenient reason why.From coinmarketcap.comThe argument goes something like this. Bitcoin isn\u2019t as useful anymore as the on-chain fees are too high, therefore, people are looking at alternatives to Bitcoin. Thus, value is flowing out of Bitcoin into other currencies and this can be clearly seen in the lack of Bitcoin dominance. Users want new features and they\u2019re going to other coins to get it. If current conditions persist, then Bitcoin will eventually be overtaken by another currency such as Ethereum and Bitcoin will become the MySpace of cryptocurrency.Essentially, the argument rests on the idea that users are looking to do X with Bitcoin, but can\u2019t and therefore they\u2019re going to other coins in order to be able to do X. X can be buying coffee, utilizing a form of the lightning network, creating a smart contract, engaging in more private transactions, utilizing decentralized apps or some of the many things that other coins are purportedly better at than Bitcoin.The RebuttalThe sentiments of this argument are understandable. People are frustrated with the scaling debate, they don\u2019t like that there\u2019s conflict and would prefer progress, but let\u2019s look at the actual evidence.First, saying that Bitcoin isn\u2019t useful anymore because fees are too high is like saying that nobody goes to that restaurant anymore because it\u2019s too crowded. Bitcoin is very useful, that\u2019s why people are willing to pay an average of $0.94/tx at the time of this writing to use it. The fact that some people don\u2019t like having to pay high prices doesn\u2019t mean everyone will leave. Some may, but the fee market is self-correcting. If enough people leave, the fees come down, making Bitcoin transactions more attractive.Second, arguing that value is flowing out of Bitcoin into other currencies would make sense if Bitcoin wasn\u2019t currently near its all-time high. Price going up means that there\u2019s healthy demand for Bitcoin that outstrips supply. The only reason there\u2019s any complaining at all is because Bitcoin isn\u2019t going up as fast as other coins are, but with 500+ altcoins in existence, that\u2019s almost always going to be true of some coin. This is like saying that value is flowing out of Berkshire Hathaway while the price is going up because other stocks are going up even faster. Demand for Bitcoin has very clearly been going up the past year and it\u2019s ridiculous to dispute that because of its slower growth relative to other, much younger and more volatile coins.Third, the argument that users are going to other coins to take advantage of its features is not really backed up by evidence. How many users buy Ethereum to have enough gas to execute a smart contract vs those that don\u2019t even know how to use a wallet and just keep their balances on exchanges? How many users use Zcash\u2019s privacy features (answer: not many)? Litecoin recently got Segwit and Lightning Network, but how many people have even tried using that vs the people that are buying in anticipation of other people using it? The vast majority of the demand for these coins is speculative based on future usage and very little about current usage.About the only real current usage would be to make small-ish transactions. And perhaps, for the small portion of transactions that fit in that category, maybe some value has transferred to other coins that offer lower fees. Medium of exchange can be a legitimate reason for someone to switch to another coin, but as I\u2019ve argued before, store of value is the main reason Bitcoin has most of its value and therefore, this isn\u2019t a significant outflow.Altcoin GraveyardJust to be clear, speculating on future utility is a perfectly legitimate form of investment, but let\u2019s not mistake speculation with current utility. Speculation generally has the property that there\u2019s a pretty large risk of failure and very frankly speaking, many of these coins have a lot of risk, specifically of their features not being a great fit for the market at large.To give just a couple of examples, Namecoin at one point had close to $100M market cap back in 2013 and was at one point thought to be a solution for a decentralized domain name service among other things. Unfortunately, most people found that the idea wasn\u2019t quite as useful as thought and most domains on Namecoin are squatted and very few people use the\u00a0.bit domain that it provides.Auroracoin at one point had close to a $1 Billion market cap back in 2014 and was at one point thought to be the digital currency that would be used in Iceland. It turned out that the market cap was largely manipulated by very low liquidity and the coin quickly capsized when more became available.Manipulated Market\u00a0CapsThis brings me to another point. The market caps on a lot of these altcoins are hugely manipulated. Consider one of the original manipulated altcoins: Ripple. They premined all the coins! That is, they created all Ripples beforehand and only released them to the public a bit at a time.There\u2019s a huge amount of Ripples that are being held in reserve so that the actual float (that is, amount available to the public to trade) remains relatively small. Many premined coins do the exact same thing to manipulate not just price but their market caps. Only a small portion of the coins actually are traded while a big reserve sits on the side owned by their creators to keep the market cap of the coins high.This isn\u2019t anything new and in the stock market, stocks that play float manipulation games generally become juicy targets for short-sellers. Altcoins like Gnosis, for example only floated 5% of their coins, so ask yourself, how much of Gnosis\u2019s $115M market cap as of this writing is real?If that isn\u2019t confusing enough, also consider that many of these Altcoins are actually subcoins of Ethereum and much of the market cap may be double-counted.Thought ExperimentIf that last section was too confusing, consider this thought experiment. Suppose I make a new coin tomorrow called FoolCoin. I premine the whole thing (100,000,000 coins) and only make 10 coins available. Perhaps I create a marketing campaign and even get enough people to desire the coin that Poloniex lists it. I sell just 1 of the coins for $10. FoolCoin now has a $1 Billion market cap. The next coin, I sell for $11 and now FoolCoin has a $1.1 Billion market cap. If there\u2019s enough demand, I eventually end up selling the other 8 coins for $20 each at which point, FoolCoin now has a $2 Billion market cap.I\u2019ve just added $2 Billion dollars to the cryptocurrency market cap and have reduced Bitcoin dominance by a few percentage points. But did I really take anything out of bitcoin other than perhaps a few hundred dollars worth?The scenario I\u2019ve laid out for FoolCoin doesn\u2019t even assume the more sinister manipulation activities like wash trading, pump and dump, etc. Even without resorting to those, it\u2019s relatively easy to add a lot of market cap to the cryptocurrency index to make Bitcoin look much less dominant.ConclusionProof of Bitcoin\u2019s healthFirst, Bitcoin is very healthy. Healthier than ever in terms of price, market cap, usage, censorship resistance and pretty much every metric utility-wise. To say otherwise is to ignore the market signals.Second, altcoins are themselves getting a lot of investment, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that people are using them for their current utility. In fact, a lot of the price increase for altcoins looks like speculation on future utility, not current utility.Third, market caps of many altcoins are seriously manipulated. Many have ultra-low liquidity and actually don\u2019t have that much money invested in them, despite the large market cap. These altcoins aren\u2019t taking anything away from Bitcoin as much as they are pumping themselves up.Like with most things, Bitcoin Dominance is a very crude metric and one that\u2019s unfortunately very easy to manipulate. The recent enthusiasm for ICOs has made the manipulation even worse and continues to hide the fact that Bitcoin is doing really well. As the manipulation gets more and more obvious, expect this metric to be replaced by something more useful.Want to get curated Technical Bitcoin News?

So when I first learnt about a new blockchain called Ethereum, my immediate question wasWhy do we even need Ethereum\u200a\u2014\u200aanother blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200awhen we already have a blockchain that powers\u00a0Bitcoin?Looking for answers, the thing I quickly realized was that this was not a very accurate question.Ethereum wasn\u2019t just another blockchain, its in fact much much more than that.Ethereum is a\u00a0PlatformEthereum is a Platform. Underneath the platform is a custom-built blockchain that enables new applications to be built on top of it. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain promises that these applications will run securely forever without any censorship or downtime.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_System_(United_States)My favorite analogy to thinking about platforms is the American Interstate Highway system (or the highway system of any country, really).These highways are governed by a set of defined rules that everyone has to follow when using them. For example, getting in and out only through exits, no stopping anywhere, lane discipline and speed limits, no drunk driving etc. As long as you are following these rules, you can use the highway network to go wherever you want to go, stop at any exit you want to stop.The highways connect cities and towns and people living in them. They enable transportation and transaction of goods and services, power several businesses and over time unleash economic activity and commerce. Also, the more people use these highways, the more valuable they become. Nice!Ethereum PlatformThe Ethereum platform is a lot like a highway network, except the network in this case is made up of computers (nodes) connected securely via the internet. Ethereum, just like our highway system also has a set of rules that one can use to build and power new businesses, applications, exchanges etc.No one \u2018controls\u2019 Ethereum, just like\u00a0BitcoinThe American Interstate Network is managed and maintained by the government, which means the responsible authorities (if they wanted to) can control, limit or totally restrict access to any highway, or even multiple highways.Worse still, authorities can restrict all highways leading to a particular city, completely cutting access to it. That, in short, is the problem with centralization of authority. It leaves the majority vulnerable to the will of the minority. In this case, it requires that to enjoy the advantages of a highway system, the majority trust the minority.Ethereum is unlike the highway system in this regard. It is powered by a network of distributed computers that no one entity controls. Here, nobody can restrict access to a particular asset that belongs to you, and so there is no trusting any authority, but yourself. This system ensures that one can create apps, online businesses, contracts etc. in a completely trustless manner.If you create an asset on Ethereum, you can rest assured that you will have access to that asset securely, without any censorship or downtime. This promise of real world trustless applications is what makes the Ethereum platform so valuable.BUT wait a sec, secure and trustless apps can also be built on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, after all, the nice things that I just mentioned about Ethereum and what makes it really valuable are really functions of distributed, trustless blockchains? If so, we already have Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, why Ethereum?Well, it all comes down to who will build these distributed, trustless applications of the future, and the tools they will use to build this aspirational future.The right tools to build the\u00a0futureYou see, building a software application (distributed or not, trustless or otherwise) needs one to write code. But you perhaps knew that. But what is not always obvious is that before writing software, serious developers choose their tools, carefully. One of the most important choices they make is what programming language to use, which is in turn driven by how developer friendly the language is. Developer friendliness of a language allows coders to focus on the end product\u00a0, instead of spending time learning how to use it. It is a function of features in a programming language that help developers write better & optimized code.One such feature is loops. Loops are what makes a the computer \u2018run\u2019 a piece of code over and over again. It is a time saving maneuver, because if there were no loops and say you wanted write a software to print out all natural numbers from 1 to 100, you\u2019d have to write the same code 100 times. Not very efficient, is it?.https://www.edureka.coBottomline\u200a\u2014\u200aLoops are super important and most developers when they write software, use loops and conditions to implement complex algorithms easily.Ok, but so what?Good question. Bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain scripting language (fancy word for programming language) does not support loops.This seemingly simple downside means building even trivial and simple applications on bitcoin\u2019s blockchain can often become a research project for most developers. Its hard to focus on the end product, when something that can otherwise be done by writing 3 lines of code, takes 3 weeks. This is by far the most important reason why we haven\u2019t seen a proliferation of distributed applications on top of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.Ethereum\u2019s programming language on the other hand support loops and other \u201cTuring-Complete\u201d features alleviating a lot of these frictions. Consequently, Ethereum has the potential to, and actually does, attract more developers to build applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain.Now, the lack of Turing Completeness is a problem, but the Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language has some other structural oddities that make it hard to build certain types of systems. (again, Not impossible, but hard)UTXOsWhen I first learnt about the concept of UTXOs in bitcoin transactions, it took me a while to understand them and why they were designed the way they\u2019ve been designed. We\u2019ll get to the details in a bit but to keep things from getting too complicated, here is the key takeaway from this section\u00a0:The way bitcoins transactions actually work under the hood makes creating new applications on the Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain very complicated. And this complexity was one of key drivers that led to Ethereum\u2019s development.OK, back to\u00a0UTXOsImagine you are in Bitcoin land and say you want to send bitcoins to a friend\u200a\u2014\u200athe following layout the basic ground rules of every such bitcoin transaction.Any bitcoin amount that you send is always sent to an address, which is a public key.Any bitcoin amount you receive is locked to your receiving address\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is (usually) associated with a wallet.Any time you spend bitcoin, the amount you spend will always come from funds you previously received and have not spent.Addresses receive bitcoin, but they do not send bitcoin\u200a\u2014\u200abitcoin is sent from a wallet.But here\u2019s the thing about bitcoins: they don\u2019t exist in reality, e.g on a hard drive or on the cloud. When you look inside somebody\u2019s address, you cannot see bitcoins, or point to something and say \u201csee, there is a bitcoin\u201d.So what\u2019s in you wallet, if its not bitcoins?In your wallet are transaction records of every bitcoin that you\u2019ve ever received from anybody, and not spent yet. When somebody sends you bitcoins, these amounts are termed as outputs in Bitcoin speak. These Unspent Transaction Outputs are abbreviated as UTXOs.When somebody sends you outputs, the UTXOs in their wallet are reduced by the amount they transferred, and UTXOs in your wallet go up by the same amount.These transaction records don\u2019t mix up or add up as they come in, but are stored exactly the way they were received. In other words, if you received a transaction#1 of 2 bitcoins, another transaction#2 worth 4 bitcoin, and yet another transaction#3 worth 5 bitcoins, your wallet will show 3 separate transactions with values 2, 4 & 5 bitcoins respectively.Sure, Your wallet balance will be the sum total of all these transaction records = 11 bitcoins\u00a0, but the thing to remember is \u2192 each transaction record is stored individually.Okayy\u2026so what has that to do with the original question of bitcoin vs ethereum?The complexity involvedLets say you want to send exactly 3 bitcoins to a friend\u2019s address. No problem! you have 11 bitcoins enough to cover the transfer, right?Right. But like I mentioned, your wallet has 3 different transaction records that add up to 11 bitcoins. And the problem with bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is that it is value-blind.In other words, the scripting language has no fine grained control over the bitcoin amounts that you can withdraw to transfer to your friend. All that complexity is left to you.Here\u2019s what I mean.To send 3 bitcoins to your friend, you will first have to create a transaction and to do the followingYou will need to choose an input, from amongst transactions that you have previously received AND have not already spent.You will have to prove that these input transactions belong to youYou will have to create an output to your friend\u2019s public key or wallet address as the destination for the 3 bitcoins you\u2019d like to transferNote that you have 3 transaction records that you can reference as inputs in step 1 above (txn#1 or #2 or #3). BUT you do not have any transaction records that is EXACTLY 3 bitcoins. Instead, you have 3 transactions with values 2, 4 & 5 bitcoins.Ok, so here\u2019s the problem. The way bitcoin\u2019s scripting works, you CANNOT simply say\u00a0:\u201c Take transaction#2 (with 4 bitcoins) and send 3 out of the 4 bitcoins to my friend\u2019s address\u201dInstead, you will have to spend all 4 bitcoins that you received in transaction#2.Now because you HAVE to spend all 4 bitcoins but you only want to transfer 3 out of those to your friend, you will need to create another output transaction sending the remaining 1 bitcoin to yourself. Weird.Before we move ahead, a lot happened above, so here is a picture to bring it all together.That is how UTXOs work under the hood, and by the way they are way more complicated to implement than this explanation above.If you want to write a bitcoin wallet application\u200a\u2014\u200athe \u201csend bitcoin\u201d function that you\u2019ll write will be super complicated. Such a function will take all the UTXOs a user has available in their wallet \u2192 then choose a subset of these UTXOs as inputs to the transaction, such that the sum of these UTXOs are greater than or equal to the desired outputs of the transaction.If there are two or more subsets of UTXOs that meet this criteria then one needs to write additional logic that will somehow decide which subset to use. Clearly, too much complexity for a simple transaction, for most developers anyway.To be sure though, these limitations of the bitcoin\u2019s scripting language are due to some important reasons that bitcoin\u2019s founder Satoshi probably foresaw and some that (he/she/they) did not foresee, but those reasons are beyond the scope of this post.What is important to this discussion however is that this value blindness introduces complexity in building applications on top of the Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200ahence the need for a language/platform that better manages this complexity and therefore facilitates development of new apps. Ethereum fills that gap and therefore has seen rapid adoption.By the way, and maybe you already noticed, UTXOs have another property that makes them hard to configure. The fact that UTXOs can fundamentally assume only two states \u2192 Spent or Unspent.This binary state along with value-blindness makes it even more difficult to create multi-stage smart contracts over Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, such as an application where multiple users contribute UTXOs to an agreed upon contract, then perform some additional operations and finally based on pre defined contract rules funds are disbursed out to appropriate parties. Again, coding this seemingly simple rule based algorithm is worthy of a research challenge for most developers if they were using bitcoin\u2019s scripting language. Ethereum on the other hand scores much much better in terms of ease of implementation for such a smart contract.https://phys.org/news/2016-07-blockchainsfocusing-bitcoin-real-revolution-digital.htmlBuilding the\u00a0FutureIf blockchain technology ever reaches its potential, it will be because a lot of factors facilitated it, and amongst the most important factors will be the ability to harness the power of blockchains easily, to build new things on top of them\u200a\u2014\u200anot just by rocket-scientist level programmers but by regular programmers armed with great ideas.Today, most developers that want to develop blockchains apps struggle because there are no easy platforms that lets them build things easily, and a platform like Ethereum aims to solve just that, so everyone including non-expert programmers like myself can also build things that are powered by blockchain. That is how you build the future, and distribute it evenly.As I read Vitaliks Buterin\u2019s White-Paper introducing Ethereum, and understood the mechanics of the platform, I am convinced that the Ethereum platform is a tectonic shift in how blockchains can be tamed, and its already showing. There are several development groups already working on decentralized apps ranging from value exchange, asset registry, device discovery and things you and I cannot fathom right now.Bottomline\u00a0? If you are in the business of building products, or even if you are not\u200a\u2014\u200ayou should not miss this tectonic shift in tech. It will define how things are built in the future.

In the first week of May-2018 we had exciting news like Goldman Sachs to Open a Bitcoin Trading Operation (for me this is not an exciting news because Goldman will be selling and buying Bitcoin paper photo-copies.)Anyways, with several exciting news 10K was in sight and twitter space was full lambo, moon and rocket pictures. This is generally a time where my sell orders get executed.Tweeter was very sure over the last three weeks. Bitcoin masters and superstars claimed that, should the bitcoin break above $10,000 again, and this was all but a foregone conclusion in their view, it would be the last time investors would ever see 10K.What actually happened at the \u201cMagical\u201d 10K?\u2026And then something happened along the way. The hot hand held by BTC enthusiasts was left cold: the price dropped to the low nine thousands. Then it broke below $9,000. It would finally settle very near $8,000 by the Bitcoin Consensus Conference 2018 weekend. and then we breached below $7,500 by May 23rd\u2026and $6,100 on Jun 13th.Where and how did it\u00a0start?It all started with the Bitcoin bashing by Mr. Buffet and Mr.Bill Gates at Magical 10K.B&B Company pours a rat-poison on the Bitcoin and we got 10% Dip in 48 hours (May-05\u20132018)Saturday 9AM ET Bitcoin is at $9,990 and ready to Break 10K any momentMr. Warren Buffet Calls Bitcoin \u2018Rat Poison\u2019, again.Bitcoin drops couple of hundred and then tries to rallyDrops $500 once the news hits the channelsMr. Bill Gates decides to trash Bitcoin on CNBC squackbox Monday morningStage is all set for the cartel to take over from hereThen came MtGox, Nvidia, S.Korea and couple of plain-vanilla-dumps at a few hundred dollar\u2019s intervals close to each other.

I collect Bitcoin just like all Bitcoiners. I also feel we are going to 100K. It\u2019s just a different time zone for me. My time-frame for the moon is at least few years in the future.Mooners want to go to moon now. I want to accumulate a lot more before going to the moon. Call me a contrarian if you like. There is nothing right or wrong in the investing. There are only profits and losses.I would like to be wrong and have the profits than being right and having\u00a0losses.Before I end this post, let\u2019s enjoy this Wasu Wasu video celebration again.

This Will Be Shocking to New\u00a0Readers.Jonald FyookballBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 17, 2017The August 1st (2017) fork of Bitcoin is called Bitcoin Cash. It was announced late July on www.bitcoincash.org.The fork happened because after 4 long years, Core developers and their corporate sponsors were successful in pulling the wool over the eyes of the community.You see, Bitcoin was always supposed to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. It was intended as a permissionless network and a fast, low-fee payment system. This is what made it famous and allowed it to become a multi billion dollar asset.Unfortunately, those \u2018core\u2019 developers had other ideas and are changing Bitcoin into what is called a \u201csettlement layer\u201d, which ultimately won\u2019t be a peer to peer system any more.There\u2019s a mighty big difference between the peer to peer money we all know and love that exists today and the \u201clayered\u201d system that the \u201cBitcoin Core\u201d group envisions for the future.A HUGE difference. Like, night and day.\u201cThey\u201d Are Upset that Bitcoin Forked. Especially Because the Fork Calls Itself Bitcoin\u00a0(Cash)Bitcoin Cash may have less hashpower and a smaller network than Bitcoin, but it follows the original roadmap, the original code design, and the original vision of Bitcoin as peer-to-peer money.Bitcoin (Core) on the other hand is much more like an alt-coin with a complex, overhyped code labyrinth called SegWit\u2026 a refusal to allow Bitcoin to scale on chain as designed by Satoshi\u2026 and a roadmap that takes away the power of the people and changes Bitcoin into a platform for the banks.And no, that\u2019s not an exaggeration.So They Started the \u2018bcash\u2019 social Engineering AttackMake no mistake: this is an attack, with the same tactics they\u2019ve been using for years in trying to control public opinion. In the past, their main weapon has been censorship.This time, they want to \u201crelabel\u201d Bitcoin Cash and hope it catches on.It won\u2019t work. Even the exchanges which are sympathetic to Core are aware that playing politics here will cost them business and reputation.The Attack Is More Malicious Than You\u00a0ThinkIt\u2019s not just that they have a bunch of trolls (some paid) who go around saying \u2018blah blah bcash\u2019.They actually use their censorship at r/bitcoin and try to redirect unsuspecting users to r/bcash, which is a subreddit they control.Don\u2019t believe for one second their lies of \u201cI call it that because its an abbreviation\u201d.Nope. This is an orchestrated social engineering attack. In fact\u2026They have fake subreddits, fake twitter accounts, fake websites, you name it.Why They Are Going to All This\u00a0Trouble?It\u2019s simple: They want to disassociate Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin. They don\u2019t want to allow Bitcoin Cash to use the Bitcoin brand name.And that\u2019s completely hypocritical given the fact that the Core group has used every dirty trick in the book (censorship, corporatism, lies and stalling) to usurp the Bitcoin project to their own ends.By contrast, all Bitcoin Cash is trying to do is continue making the blocks bigger so that the peer to peer network can grow.Their Secret\u00a0HopesThey are hoping that they can remove the Bitcoin name from Bitcoin Cash.They are hoping new users won\u2019t even realize there\u2019s another version of Bitcoin.They are hoping those users won\u2019t realize that Bitcoin was originally peer to peer electronic cash (not this settlement layer that Core is pushing.)And ultimately, they are hoping people don\u2019t see that Bitcoin has changed course, and that there\u2019s a version of Bitcoin that stayed with the original formula.It\u2019s Not Going to\u00a0WorkCheap tactics like this aren\u2019t going to fool many people for long. Sorry \u201cCore\u201d.

These two words are more alike than it may seem on the surface.The definition of cash is \u201cmoney in coins or notes\u201d and \u201cmoney in any form, especially that which is immediately available\u201d. The etymological origin of the word cash is thus:1590s, \u201cmoney box;\u201d also \u201cmoney in hand, coin,\u201d from Middle French caisse \u201cmoney box\u201d (16c.), from Proven\u00e7al caissa or Italian cassa, from Latin capsa\u201dbox\u201dIn order for cash money and its value to remain \u2018immediately available\u2019, it must have the possibility to be stored privately and securely. This is why, historically, most lasting forms of cash have gravitated towards forms that are durable, so they cannot be destroyed by time, and compact\u200a\u2014\u200aso they can be easily stored in a secure environment like a vault.As a consequence, anyone who pursues the notion of a durable standard of \u2018digital cash\u2019, must also put a significant value on security. Cash that cannot be stored securely is useless, and forms of cash that have better security characteristics will, ceteris paribus, win out over cash with inferior security. India is a good example, where private gold holdings are valued at $770 billion, versus at the most $210 billion for rupee notes.Satoshi called Bitcoin \u2018cash\u2019 as well as\u00a0\u2018gold\u2019Satoshi Nakamoto called Bitcoin \u2018electronic cash\u2019 in his white paper, and later referred to it as \u201can implementation of Wei Dai\u2019s B-Money proposal [an \u2018anonymous, distributed electronic cash system\u2019] and Nick Szabo\u2019s BitGold proposal\u201d. In his emails and forum posts, he explained Bitcoin using the analogy of gold and gold mining on six different occasions (1,2,3,4,5,6).The most clear way in which Satoshi explained Bitcoin as digital gold was in a 2010 forum post:As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:- boring grey in colour- not a good conductor of electricity- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either- not useful for any practical or ornamental purposeand one special, magical property:- can be transported over a communications channelIf it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.The bridge from gold to\u00a0cashSatoshi was right in my opinion: Bitcoin can be both a secure store of value, as well as a liquid medium of exchange used for small size payments. The solution is to accept and embrace an ecosystem with division of labor, where each sector prioritizes a different part of the solution.In the case of Bitcoin, you can let one part of the ecosystem prioritize security, while the other focuses on convenience and speed. I\u2019ll let Hal Finney, the first ever person to receive a Bitcoin transaction, explain:\u201cActually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.(\u2026) Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as\u2026 well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.\u201dFinney wrote this in 2010. In my discussions with developers in 2012\u2013\u201913, this was the prevailing idea of long term scaling: specialized custodians would store bitcoins and issue easily tradable deposit tokens, just like what happened throughout history with gold banks issuing gold backed paper money\u2014only this time the users of the bills would much more easily be able to audit the reserves backing them.*And that has become our reality today. Western Bitcoin exchanges process over $80 million in Bitcoin off-chain transactions per day; Bitcoin bank Xapo processes 500,000 off-chain Bitcoin transactions daily; Bitcoin gambling site PrimeDice processes 13 million off-chain Bitcoin bets per day. And so on. Cheap, high volume Bitcoin transactions are here already\u200a\u2014\u200athough they require trust in a third party.Modular scalingLittle did we know a few years ago that Bitcoin core developers would produce something even better than an enterprise network on top of the blockchain; technology that truly eliminates the need for trusted parties to serve as middle men. I\u2019m talking about second layer solutions such as the Lightning Network, Sidechains, and MimbleWimble.Scaling software solutions in a modular way is considered good digital hygiene. Here\u2019s how Unix guru Eric Steven Raymond explains the principle:\u201cThe only way to write complex software that won\u2019t fall on its face is to hold its global complexity down\u200a\u2014\u200ato build it out of simple parts connected by well-defined interfaces, so that most problems are local and you can have some hope of upgrading a part without breaking the whole.\u201dDeveloper John Ratcliff puts it a bit more bluntly when arguing for the Bitcoin Core strategy to scaling:You do not build a networking protocol by shoving everything and the kitchen sink all into one layer; trying to solve every single problem for every single use case world wide in one massive giant glob of all encompassing code. That doesn\u2019t work! Instead, you create a series of layers; with each layer focused on solving just one part of the overall problem extremely well, extremely efficiently, and as simple as possible.To further illustrate the importance of how modularity produces functionality that stands the test of time, consider its applications in product design, construction, biology and even evolutionary psychology.ConclusionThe question whether Bitcoin ought to be digital cash or digital gold represents a false dichotomy: it can be both a secure and accessible form of money. By embracing modularity, the main Bitcoin blockchain can act as a maximally secure settlement layer, while second layer payment channels serve as pipelines for fast, high liquidity transactions.Note added on 6/6/\u201917Hal Finney\u2019s view on Bitcoin scaling may have been informed by Nick Szabo\u2019s concept of bitgold. Szabo comments in a recent article \u2018Money, blockchains, and social scalability\u2019: \u201cWhen I designed bit gold I already knew consensus did not scale to large transaction throughputs securely, so I designed it with a two-tier architecture: (1) bit gold itself, the settlement layer, and (2) Chaumian digital cash, a peripheral payment network which would provide retail payments with high transactions-per-second performance and privacy (through Chaumian blinding), but would like Visa be a trusted third party and thus require a \u201chuman blockchain\u201d of accountants, etc. to operate with integrity. The peripheral payment network can involve only small value transactions, thereby requiring much less of a human army to avoid the fate of Mt. Gox.\u201d", "responses": "11"}, {"title": "Facebook and Telegram Are Hoping to Succeed Where Bitcoin\u00a0Failed", "author_name": "The New York Times", "link": "https://medium.com/the-new-york-times/facebook-and-telegram-are-hoping-to-succeed-where-bitcoin-failed-7cfcff9a658c?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 28", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "Facebook and Telegram Are Hoping to Succeed Where Bitcoin\u00a0FailedEven as cryptocurrency prices have plunged, several big tech companies are working on their own digital tokens for use in text messaging systemsThe New York TimesBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 28Illustration: Eden\u00a0WeingartBy Nathaniel Popper and Mike Isaac", "responses": ""}, {"title": "|| About today\u2019s RBI circular\u00a0||", "author_name": "WazirX Bitcoin Exchange", "link": "https://medium.com/wazirx/about-todays-rbi-circular-1829e21cf8e0?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 5, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "2.8K", "content": "|| About today\u2019s RBI circular\u00a0||WazirX Bitcoin ExchangeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 5, 2018Namaste Tribe! Very rarely do we, as a nation, get an opportunity to participate in revolutionary technologies. These are once in a lifetime opportunities for a generation of people.Blockchain/Cryptocurrency is one such opportunity that the young generation of India has had a chance to jump early into and adopt. We\u2019ve been proud to be early adopters of cryptos as a country and we have a fighting chance at being in the forefront of this revolution.However, the announcement today mandating banks to not allow people or businesses in India to deal with cryptos may push us back in time and make us all miss this golden opportunity. Knee-jerk reactions like these are what can cause the future generation to be left behind when the rest of the world moves ahead.The very ethos of democracy is to involve the common people in critical decisions like these. Unfortunately, no one has bothered to involve any of us while deciding the fate of cryptos. There are many Indians who are not part of the government but who understand the underlying technology and it\u2019s use cases very well. We could all have helped formulate a plan that would have avoided this harsh decision.What they forget is that this is going to lead\u00a0toMassive wealth erosion of all the tax paying people who have invested their hard earned money in cryptos. The common people who diligently pay their taxes every year to the government are at the receiving end of this.This excludes India from the global crypto revolution.Thousands of Indians who may have quit their jobs because they have been earning well as crypto traders now have nowhere to go. They\u2019ll be left without jobs, without a source of income.Gullible investors will now try to buy cryptos through cash and other OTC means where they would have no buyer protection and end up falling for scams. This will also make illegal trades almost impossible to track.What can we\u00a0do?At WazirX, we\u2019re hard at work on bringing more new features, more coins and more ways for you to trade. We\u2019re going to make sure you continue to get the opportunity to trade in cryptos. We\u2019re in this for the long term and we\u2019re determined to build WazirX into the largest crypto exchange in India. It\u2019s going to be trading as usual.I would urge the Indian crypto sphere to come together and start figuring out a way to keep the crypto fire burning. We need to put our word across, we need to be heard so that the Government can take an informed decision and allow all of us to be a part of this revolution that is going to define our future.At times like these, we need to stick together and have ONE VOICE that gets loud enough that the government steps in and hears us out. We are a democracy and we shouldn\u2019t be dictated terms that we know aren\u2019t right for us.We\u2019ll keep you updated on the developments and keep you informed like we always have.

That approach fails inevitably because of the unknowable relationship between people owning Bitcoin, Bitcoin wallets, and Bitcoin addresses. This is a description of a new model of the distribution of Bitcoin wealth built on the assumption that a universal Power Law applies, and that it mirrors the distribution of global financial wealth as reported in the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2016. The Bitcoin distribution that results is tweaked manually to reflect the great mining rewards paid out in the early years to a few people, making it still less equitable than the highly inequitable financial wealth distribution. An estimate of the Bitcoin-owning population is derived from a survey of traffic to Bitcoin-related websites as reported by Alexa.com in comparison to traffic to sites of popular financial corporations that publish their user numbers.There are two parts to this essay\u200a\u2014\u200aa) why former models based on address analysis failed, and b) the new model. Scroll halfway down if you are uninterested in the first part.A. Models of Distribution of Bitcoin Wealth Analyse Wallets & Addresses Data Always\u00a0FailPrevious models of the Distribution of Bitcoin Wealth have depended on an analysis of Bitcoin wallets and Bitcoin addresses. They have all been based on the Bitcoin Rich List.Top 100 Richest Bitcoin Addresses and Bitcoin distributionSource: Bitinfocharts.comThe usual way to calculate the distribution is to say that 1% of 19,562,222 Bitcoin addresses is 195,622 addresses and, looking at the table, the 195,622'th wealthiest address is placed in the 1\u201310 Balance bracket, much closer to 10 than to 1. To make this clearer I have re-jigged the data in a Sheet:So, the address which is the 149,238'th richest contains exactly 10 Bitcoins. That address is at 0.76% in the distribution. The address at 1% is in the 1\u201310 bracket and will contain a little less than 10 Bitcoins.Some people then jump wrongly from addresses to Bitcoin holders without thinking:Paul neglects the 2 million plus users of Coinbase, Bitfinex, Kraken, Poloniex, Bittrex, Bithumb, BitFlyer (from a total of 20+ million) who own > 1 Bitcoin but share a few exchange (cold storage) addresses. His analysis is wrong, and his data sucks\u200a\u2014\u200athere are over 600,000 addresses containing > 1 BTC. (See table above, Reverse cum. column.)Coinbase stats at September 2017:I pointed out this error to Ari David Paul on Twitter. He did not acknowledge his mistake so it is fair to publish his fatuous Tweets. Addresses is not the same as people.Update:Where is Holden Caulfield when you need him? Paul just cranked up the phoniness to an 11. He is saying \u2018I am never wrong, I am just simplistic somtimes.\u2019Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors, makes the same mistake. He says there are only 300,000 holders of at least $5,000 of Bitcoin.This is another, better attempt to describe the Distribution of Bitcoin Wealth. It is produced by Dennis Porto based based on surveys and was published in Business Insider in February 2014: How Much Wealth The Top 1% Of Bitcoin Owners Have.This is a logarithmic chart, so it\u2019s a little hard to read. The blue curve meets 1% at the 50 BTC mark. (In the red circle.) Is 50 Bitcoins the mean wealth of those Top 1%, or median wealth, or the minimum wealth to qualify for the 1%? It\u2019s not clear.The Relationship Between People, Wallets, AddressesThe problem with most estimates is that they fail to account for the fact that the relationship between Person Holding Bitcoin, Wallet, and Address is a little complicated. It is not necessarily 1\u00a0: 1\u00a0: 1. That is to say, it is not true by definition that one Person has one Wallet that uses a single Bitcoin Address.For a start, a Person may hold many Bitcoin Wallets. And a Wallet can make use of many Bitcoin Addresses. (Indeed it is advisable to generate a new Address every time you use your Wallet for reasons of anonymity.) So the relationship can be 1\u00a0: Many\u00a0: Many.Exchange \u2018Wallets\u2019 are not real WalletsWhen you hold Bitcoin at an exchange such as Bitfinex you do not actually own a genuine Bitcoin Wallet as you do not own the private keys. The security for this pseudo-wallet is provided by the exchange, not by your private keys. Sending Bitcoin to an exchange, you immediately give up ownership of it. You own nothing except a non-contractual IOU from the owners of the exchange to pay you Bitcoin. It is non-contractual because you cannot have a contract with an unknown counterparty. What is Bitfinex\u2019s Company Registration id? Who owns it? Where are its accounts published?The owners of the exchange will own several genuine Wallets\u200a\u2014\u200awallets for cold storage and hot wallets for when clients request withdrawals\u2014 containing the Bitcoins of its many clients.Anyway, let us pretend the clients of the exchange own the Bitcoins which they sent to the exchange, and are now stored in the exchange\u2019s Cold Wallet. We then have this relationship\u200a\u2014\u200aMany People (millions of Bitfinex clients)\u00a0: 1 Wallet (the Exchange\u2019s cold storage Wallet)\u00a0: 1 Address. We can actually see that Wallet on the blockchain:Bitfinex Cold Wallet is Number 1 in Rich\u00a0ListBitcoin Address 3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r is the richest Bitcoin Address in the Bitcoin Rich List. It is the only Address in the Bitfinex Cold Wallet. It contains about 120,000 Bitcoin valued at $525 million, or 0.72% of all Bitcoins.The owner of Bitfinex owns the Private Keys to that Wallet so he owns the Bitcoins in the Wallet. So in fact we have the nice simple relationship 1 Person (Owner of Bitfinex )\u00a0: 1 Wallet\u00a0: 1 Address (with 120,000 Bitcoin).In conclusion, the previous model of Bitcoin distribution fails because of the fundamental flaw that there is no clear-cut and predictable relationship between Persons Owning Bitcoin, Bitcoin Wallets, and Bitcoin Addresses.B. The New Model of Bitcoin DistributionI have modelled the distribution of Bitcoin Wealth in a way that disregards Wallet and Address data entirely.AssumptionsPower Law applies to Distribution of Bitcoin Wealth.Distribution of Bitcoin Wealth exactly mirrors that of Global Wealth.25 million Bitcoin Owners.No lost Bitcoins.Model Assumption 1: Power Law Distribution AppliesA Power Law is a functional relationship between two quantities, where a change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities: one quantity varies as a power of another.The economist Pareto devoted attention to this and conceived the 80/20 rule. Pareto showed that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population; he observed that about 20% of the peapods in his garden contained 80% of the peas.Our model assumes the Power Law because it applies to so much natural life. The Power Law applies to the distribution of financial income, and of financial wealth, and of sexual wealth measured in number of partners (whether that be of Alpha lions in the African Savannah or Alpha human males in metropolitan cities), and of attention wealth measured in Twitter Followers.From Wikipedia:The distributions of a wide variety of physical, biological, and man-made phenomena approximately follow a power law over a wide range of magnitudes: these include the sizes of craters on the moon and of solar flares, the foraging pattern of various species,the sizes of activity patterns of neuronal populations,the frequencies of words in most languages, frequencies of family names, the species richness in clades of organisms,the sizes of power outages, criminal charges per convict, volcanic eruptions,and many other quantities. Few empirical distributions fit a power law for all their values, but rather follow a power law in the tail.Power law distributions look like this:Model Assumption 2: Distribution of Bitcoin Wealth mirrors that of Global Wealth, but with adjustment for concentrated mining rewards 2009\u20132011We use this assumption because, actually, why would one not make this assumption? There is one valid objection:A a result I manhandled the model slightly to skew more ownership to the richest owners of Bitcoin than was implied by the financial wealth distribution.Thankfully there is an excellent source of data on the distribution of global wealth: The Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) Global Wealth Report 2016 pages 22\u201327. And CSRI Global Wealth Databook 2016, Table 2\u20134 p. 94.I derived a Distribution of Global Wealth from that data.To be in Top 1% in Global (Fiat) Wealth, you need $770,000 Net Wealth (Gross Wealth minus Debt).Source: Blocklink.infoSource: Blocklink.infoModel Assumption 3. There are 25 million Bitcoin Owners (January 2017)I arrived at an estimate of 25 million owners (many owning Dust-like amounts) from analysis of traffic to Bitcoin-related websites, and comparing that traffic to non-crypto business sites who publish their number of users. This analysis was done in January 2017. Traffic to Bitcoin sites is much greater now (September 2017) and so there are now more Bitcoin owners than 25 million. But I don\u2019t have the time or inclination to check all those Alexa rankings again.Source: Blocklink.infoBitcoin sites get enough traffic to imply 25 m. owners of BTC. For example, in January 2017 Blockchain.info was getting similar traffic to webmoney.ru which claimed 31 m. users.Most popular Bitcoin sites (September 2017):CoinmarketcapCoinbasePoloniexBittrexFreeBitco.inBlockchain.infoTo get an idea of the volume of traffic to these Bitcoin sites, let\u2019s look at the site of Santander.co.uk, which is a (Spanish-owned) British bank which has reported that it has 14 million customers, nearly all of whom use online banking.Model Assumption 4: No Lost BitcoinsI made this assumption purely to simplify the model. It would be simply to augment the model with an assumption of Lost coins being equal to a certain positive amount.The Distribution of Ownership of\u00a0BitcoinHaving derived the distribution of Global Wealth, and the Global Ownership of Bitcoins numbers, I mapped the Wealth Distribution to derive a Bitcoin Distribution. I then skewed it a bit to make Bitcoin wealth distribution even less equitable than fiat wealth distribution to reflect rewards from early days of mining. (See how the ratio of Mean/Median is greater for the Bitcoin Distn. than the financial Distn.)Source: Blocklink.infoSource: Blocklink.info70% of Bitcoin Owners Own 2% of all Bitcoin. Who are they?Examining the Bitcoin cumulative distribution, the richest 30% of all Bitcoin owners own 98.3% of all Bitcoins. So the poorest 70% of Bitcoin owners own less than 1.7 % of all Bitcoin. It takes merely 0.153 Bitcoins to be placed in the Top 30% richest Bitcoin owners. So who are these 17.5 million people who own less than 0.153 Bitcoin? (That is about $665 at current prices.)I cannot be sure, but I suspect they are people use Bitcoin faucets. (Faucet is the American English word for tap.) They might gain them from Bitcoin Faucets like Bitco.in (.IN is the Indian state domain).This site claims to have more than 7 million registered users.The Alexa rating for Bitco.in is consistent with this claim. Indeed the traffic to this site is greater than to any other Bitcoin site excluding Coinmarketcap, Coinbase, Poloniex and Bittrex.Bitco.in is just one of thousands of such faucets.

People do not want to acknowledge that but it is a simple fact.Blockchain.info is #1Blockchain.info, a British company, has been #1 Bitcoin site for at least three years.The popularity of Blockchain.info in Japan, US, Nigeria, India and Germany\u200a\u2014\u200awith a combined population of 2 billion\u200a\u2014\u200asuggests Bitcoin might gain traction in those countries. The possible exception is the United States where the County Rank for Blockchain.info is just 4,070.Blockchain.info claims to have issued 11.5 million Wallets. In Part 2 I will demonstrate with independently sourced data that there are indeed 10\u201312 million active unique visitors to the Blockchain.info site.Blockchain.info is a remarkable company and the research suggests it will become a giant. Its founder Nicolas Cary expressed his lucid thoughts in Newsweek on 7 January 2017:In Opinion: Blockchain boss writes about why 2017 looks promising for bitcoinIt's been a year since I argued that bitcoin was too big to fail, but it has only got stronger.

Chinese Visitors are evident in this table: the three months leading up to 21 January 2017 included a great run-up in the price of Bitcoin, and many Chinese speculators likely got involved in trading at the Chinese Exchanges.Slowing Down: Negative Rankings GrowthNote the Payments companies are slowing down or going backwards.Nine to Watch:These Bitcoin companies have strong Alexa Rankings and fast growth.

Como humanos, carregamos essa leve superioridade quando pensamos sobre \u2014quase tudo\u200a\u2014\u200aoutros seres vivos. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 muitas d\u00favidas para quase ningu\u00e9m. Temos essa certeza interior de que somos seres mais evolu\u00eddos que habitam esse planeta azulado.O historiador Yuval Noah Harari, em seu livro Sapiens, sugere uma boa hip\u00f3tese sobre o que separa o Homo Sapiens do demais seres que habitam a terra.Para Harari, a diferen\u00e7a entre n\u00f3s est\u00e1 na capacidade humana de acreditar em fic\u00e7\u00f5es. Somos naturalmente capazes de acreditar em ideias abstratas e apostar caro no que elas representam.Dificilmente convencer\u00edamos um Rhinocerotidae a trocar seu dia no pasto por uma nota de R$ 100. O valor abstrato representado pelo dinheiro n\u00e3o significa nada para um rinoceronte. No entanto, como seres humanos, essa troca n\u00e3o soa apenas \u00f3bvia, mas pode chegar \u00e0 extremos impressionantes.N\u00e3o s\u00f3 confiamos que um papel marrom com uma on\u00e7a impressa vale o mesmo que comida ou roupas, como em alguns casos acreditamos que, por estar escrito num livro, podemos sacrificar o curso de nossa vida f\u00edsica pela promessa da felicidade eterna no para\u00edso.Independente da cren\u00e7a, sabemos que em hip\u00f3tese alguma voc\u00ea conseguiria convencer um pinguim a trocar o peixe que est\u00e1 comendo, pela chance de ganhar 72 peixes maiores quando morrer.Religi\u00f5es, leis, direitos humanos e tudo o que n\u00e3o \u00e9 materialmente objetivo, s\u00e3o fic\u00e7\u00f5es fruto dessa capacidade humana de criar hist\u00f3rias e acreditar em fundamentos que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o tang\u00edveis, conceitos que s\u00f3 possuem valor de acordo com a hist\u00f3ria que contamos sobre elas.Com sistemas monet\u00e1rios n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito diferente, uma nota de d\u00f3lar s\u00f3 tem valor enquanto o sistema acredita nesse valor.\u00c9 tamb\u00e9m por isso, que o pre\u00e7o final das moedas acaba oscilando. O pre\u00e7o do d\u00f3lar sobe quando o fluxo de compra aumenta, e cai quando o interesse \u00e9 reduzido. Aqui fora um cigarro n\u00e3o vale muita coisa, mas \u00e9 de impressionar o que d\u00e1 pra comprar com alguns cigarros dentro de uma penitenci\u00e1ria.As primeiras formas de dinheiro que surgiram precisavam estar vinculadas a algo f\u00edsico material. Na Sum\u00e9ria, 3000 a.C, gr\u00e3os de cevada eram usados como meio de troca para adquirir produtos. Os estoques de Sila, mais ou menos 1 litro de cevada, podiam ser trocados por \u00f3leo, cabras, alimentos e at\u00e9 escravos.O tempo passou e produtos com valor objetivo\u200a\u2014\u200agr\u00e3os podem ser consumidos, por exemplo\u200a\u2014\u200aforam dando espa\u00e7o para moedas com cada vez menos valor inerente.Da prata na Mesopot\u00e2mia, passando pelas primeiras moedas marcadas por reis, at\u00e9 as c\u00e9dulas e moedas de cupron\u00edquel como conhecemos hoje, o valor foi distanciando-se do que chamamos de lastro\u200a\u2014\u200ao equivalente em \u201criqueza f\u00edsica\u201d garantindo o dinheiro\u200a\u2014\u200ae assumindo um valor cada vez mais abstrato.At\u00e9 n\u00e3o muito tempo o total monet\u00e1rio em circula\u00e7\u00e3o era equivalente ao montante em ouro dispon\u00edvel, mas hoje a ideia de lastro j\u00e1 \u00e9 um princ\u00edpio que se perdeu.O que de fato lastreia uma moeda \u00e9 seu puro potencial\u200a\u2014\u200aabstrato\u200a\u2014\u200aecon\u00f4mico.Quando muita gente aponta que Bitcoin e todas as centenas de bitmoedas que est\u00e3o surgindo por a\u00ed n\u00e3o s\u00e3o dinheiro de verdade, est\u00e3o cometendo o erro de achar que o d\u00f3lar, o real ou a libra s\u00e3o de fato reais.O mundo \u00e9 mais confuso do que\u00a0pareceQuando ouvimos algu\u00e9m bem sucedido contando sua hist\u00f3ria, todos os pontos encaixam-se perfeitamente. \u00c9 como se tudo o que a pessoa fez, todos os movimentos, fosse parte de uma elaborada estrat\u00e9gia que s\u00f3 poderia ter o sucesso como resultado.De tr\u00e1s pra frente, podemos contar a hist\u00f3ria de uma forma que ela fa\u00e7a sentido, assim como vemos nos blockbusters de Hollywood. Uma hist\u00f3ria desconexa n\u00e3o esgota bilheterias, n\u00e3o vende livros e n\u00e3o lota audit\u00f3rios.Um exemplo recente de como contamos hist\u00f3rias na ordem inversa para tentar dar sentido aos ca\u00f3ticos acontecimentos foi a corrida presidencial dos Estados Unidos, em 2016.As previs\u00f5es sobre as chances de Donald Trump ser eleito eram as mais pessimistas. Os grandes ve\u00edculos estimavam algo pr\u00f3ximo de 1%, enquanto outros, ainda mais arrogantes, estimavam que as chances do empres\u00e1rio eram nulas, 0%.Nunca esque\u00e7a\u00a0dissoEssa mais\u00a0aindaNo dia 9 de Novembro de 2016, Donald Trump venceu a favorita Hillary Clinton na confusa elei\u00e7\u00e3o norte americana, nos ensinando uma importante li\u00e7\u00e3o sobre nossa capacidade de previs\u00e3o e an\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica. As vezes somos pegos de surpresa e aquele 1% de chance acontece.Mas como n\u00e3o sabemos lidar com a confus\u00e3o e aceitar o desconhecido, rapidamente inventamos uma hist\u00f3ria. Agora, de tr\u00e1s pra frente, a elei\u00e7\u00e3o de Trump tem uma perfeita explica\u00e7\u00e3o. Pode pesquisar. Da noite para o dia, todo mundo tinha uma boa explica\u00e7\u00e3o para algo que ningu\u00e9m acreditava ser poss\u00edvel.Criamos uma narrativa convincente para justificar algo que ningu\u00e9m de fato sabe como aconteceu.O fato \u00e9 que o mundo \u00e9 confuso e sofre influ\u00eancia de mais elementos do que nos damos conta. A incompreens\u00e3o de como as coisas s\u00e3o mais complexas do que parece nos d\u00e1 a ilus\u00e3o de que podemos prever acontecimentos.Para explicar um pouco melhor o problema da precis\u00e3o em realizar previs\u00f5es, preciso repetir o que fiz no texto sobre estar acima da m\u00e9dia e entrar numa explica\u00e7\u00e3o um pouco mais t\u00e9cnica.Para a celebra\u00e7\u00e3o de anivers\u00e1rio do rei Oscar II da Su\u00e9cia e Noruega, em 1889, foi organizada uma competi\u00e7\u00e3o de Matem\u00e1tica \u2014acho que os esportes n\u00e3o eram t\u00e3o emocionantes. O vencedor da competi\u00e7\u00e3o, que recebeu a mais alta honraria cientifica da \u00e9poca foi o matem\u00e1tico/f\u00edsico franc\u00eas Henri Poincar\u00e9.Poincar\u00e9 venceu com um texto explicando a din\u00e2mica do sistema solar, com uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o para o chamado Problema dos Tr\u00eas Corpos.O conceito \u00e9 simples: dado 3 corpos celestes, como por exemplo tr\u00eas estrelas pr\u00f3ximas, a tarefa era descrever o movimento entre elas calculando com precis\u00e3o\u200a\u2014\u200adada velocidade e posi\u00e7\u00e3o inicial\u200a\u2014\u200asua posi\u00e7\u00e3o e velocidade em qualquer ponto no futuro.Quem fez ensino m\u00e9dio deve lembrar que dois s\u00e9culos antes de Poincar\u00e9, Isaac Newton j\u00e1 havia proposto uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o para um problema\u00a0parecido, como vimos ao estudar a Lei da Gravita\u00e7\u00e3o Universal.Mas Newton nos d\u00e1 ferramentas apenas para trabalhar com dois corpos celestes, mas quando uma terceira pe\u00e7a entra em jogo, a dificuldade \u00e9 outra.O que Poincar\u00e9 demonstrou na premia\u00e7\u00e3o foi que num sistema solar simples com apenas dois corpos \u2014simplifica\u00e7\u00e3o newtoniana\u200a\u2014\u200a\u00e9 f\u00e1cil prever perfeitamente a posi\u00e7\u00e3o e velocidade dos corpos, mas adicionando um terceiro corpo, mesmo que seja pequeno, sua influ\u00eancia inicial n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 percebida, mas a longo prazo essa intera\u00e7\u00e3o produz uma influ\u00eancia desastrosa.Poincar\u00e9 \u00e9 um dos grandes respons\u00e1veis pelo que hoje conhecemos como Teoria do Caos.Para entender melhor como uma nova vari\u00e1vel pode afetar nossa capacidade de previs\u00e3o em sistemas din\u00e2micos, o matem\u00e1tico Michael Berry, em 1941, computou algumas informa\u00e7\u00f5es utilizando uma mesa de sinuca.Sabendo informa\u00e7\u00f5es b\u00e1sicas sobre a bola de sinuca em repouso, como a resist\u00eancia da superf\u00edcie da mesa e a for\u00e7a do impacto inicial, \u00e9 f\u00e1cil prever a trajet\u00f3ria na primeira tacada. A segunda tacada tem um grau de dificuldade maior, mas ainda \u00e9 poss\u00edvel.A coisa muda de figura conforme a dist\u00e2ncia da previs\u00e3o e a influ\u00eancia das vari\u00e1veis aumenta. Para prever a nona tacada, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio considerar a atra\u00e7\u00e3o gravitacional exercida por algu\u00e9m em p\u00e9 ao lado da mesa\u200a\u2014\u200aBerry usa um adulto de 75kg como base. N\u00e3o complicado o bastante, para a previs\u00e3o do 56\u00ba impacto, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio considerar literalmente todas part\u00edculas do universo.Fazer previs\u00f5es e proje\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 um neg\u00f3cio muito mais complicado do que se aceita normalmente, mas \u00e9 preciso saber matem\u00e1tica para compreender essa ideia. Aceit\u00e1-la exige compreens\u00e3o e\u00a0coragem.\u2014 Nassim Nicholas\u00a0TalebNosso costume de simplificar os eventos contando hist\u00f3rias depois que aconteceram nos traz a falsa sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que sabemos exatamente o que causou cada resultado. Essa confian\u00e7a nos faz ignorar o grau de complexidade do mundo e tudo o que pode influenciar cada\u00a0pequeno\u00a0evento, trazendo a ing\u00eanua impress\u00e3o de que podemos prever o futuro.Ainda n\u00e3o entendemos as BitmoedasA previs\u00e3o feita por economistas de que o Bitcoin \u00e9 uma bolha prestes a estourar \u00e9 feita olhando para o passado, com base no que sabemos at\u00e9 o momento sobre economia, incentivos e investimentos.\u00c9 por isso que quando bolhas reais surgem, pegam todos de surpresa. Algumas pessoas podem at\u00e9 estimar que vai acontecer, mas aqueles que direcionam as grandes decis\u00f5es econ\u00f4micas e influenciam as apostas do resto do mundo est\u00e3o sempre cegos demais repetindo os mesmos erros.Toda previs\u00e3o econ\u00f4mica sofre desse vi\u00e9s. Olhamos para o passado, fazemos compara\u00e7\u00f5es e projetamos o que podemos esperar do futuro com alguns leves ajustes. O resultado \u00e9 o que Nassim Taleb chama, em A l\u00f3gica do Cisne Negro, de problema do peru.Um peru de a\u00e7\u00e3o de gra\u00e7as \u00e9 alimentado por mil dias antes de ser abatido para as festividades. Todos os dias seu cuidador aparece milagrosamente e repete o ritual de aliment\u00e1-lo.Da perspectiva do peru, todos os dias s\u00e3o bem parecidos. Levando em considera\u00e7\u00e3o os dias que viveu, a ave consegue olhar para tr\u00e1s e dizer com precis\u00e3o estat\u00edstica que, com base no hist\u00f3rico, \u00e9 certo que seu cuidador ir\u00e1 aparecer no dia seguinte e tudo seguir\u00e1 normalmente.Nosso peru de a\u00e7\u00e3o de gra\u00e7as economista ignora os limites do seu conhecimento. Acorda no mil\u00e9simo primeiro dia confiante de que ser\u00e1 como todos os outros. Mas a motiva\u00e7\u00e3o do seu criador no dia de hoje n\u00e3o \u00e9 a de aliment\u00e1-lo.Suas previs\u00f5es deram certo at\u00e9 que uma vari\u00e1vel desconhecida surgiu.Como simples humanos, somos muito ruins em identificar os limites do nosso conhecimento. Gente famosa e que precisa soar inteligente em notici\u00e1rios e reuni\u00f5es de neg\u00f3cio trazem esse mesmo problema de uma forma ainda mais agravada, s\u00e3o p\u00e9ssimos em assumir tais limites.Qualquer pessoa que trabalhe realizando previs\u00f5es deve ser relembrado constantemente que, a medida que suas previs\u00f5es d\u00e3o certo, as chances de fragilizar o sistema pelo excesso de confian\u00e7a come\u00e7am a subir.\u201cMas em toda a minha experi\u00eancia nunca estive em nenhum acidente\u2026 de qualquer tipo digno de men\u00e7\u00e3o. S\u00f3 vi uma \u00fanica embarca\u00e7\u00e3o em perigo em todos os meus anos no mar. Nunca vi um naufr\u00e1gio nem nunca naufraguei, tampouco enfrentei qualquer contratempo que amea\u00e7asse terminar em qualquer tipo de desastre.\u201d- E. J. Smith, 1907, capit\u00e3o, RMS\u00a0TitanicAqui menciono exaustivamente economistas, j\u00e1 que s\u00e3o famosos por darem opini\u00f5es exageradas e carregadas de um alarmante excesso de confian\u00e7a. No entanto, quando falamos de bitmoedas, economistas e apaixonados cometem o mesmo erro, apenas apontando para extremos opostos.Ignore economistas\u2026O mercado de bitmoedas ainda \u00e9 um confuso para todo mundo. Como cuidadosamente ilustrei, o mundo \u00e9 muito mais confuso do que as simples vari\u00e1veis que conhecemos e temos controle.Economistas famosos precisam produzir materiais para jornais e revistas venderem. E quando n\u00e3o existe uma conclus\u00e3o definitiva sobre o assunto, mas seu trabalho \u00e9 emitir uma opini\u00e3o forte, \u00e9 preciso inventar uma hist\u00f3ria para contar.Compara\u00e7\u00f5es com a bolha das tulipas, afirma\u00e7\u00f5es de que trata-se de um esquema de Ponzi e v\u00e1rias outras an\u00e1lises confusas que existem na internet\u200a\u2014\u200alugar onde mais existe jovem confuso\u200a\u2014\u200as\u00e3o de forma geral ing\u00eanuas e precipitadas, baseadas ainda na pouca no\u00e7\u00e3o do que o futuro traz para este novo modelo de investimento.\u00c9 ineg\u00e1vel que o n\u00famero de criptomoedas que surgiram no \u00faltimo ano \u00e9 elevado. E mais ainda, que metade dos ICO evaporou deixando muita gente no preju\u00edzo.Podemos at\u00e9 dizer que lan\u00e7ar um novo ICO no mercado tem sido uma pr\u00e1tica para ganhar dinheiro f\u00e1cil, j\u00e1 que os fundadores se beneficiam da super valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o inicial. O que neste caso bem espec\u00edfico at\u00e9 poder\u00edamos comparar com um esquema de Ponzi.Mas n\u00e3o podemos comparar todas as bitmoedas, principalmente as menores e em fase inicial, com as grandes e aparentemente consolidadas, Bitcoin e Ethereum. Cada moeda deve ser considerada individualmente, tanto como forma de investimento, quanto no risco que podem trazer com base em quem desenvolve.Assim como nas moedas tradicionais e outros investimentos, as bitmoedas podem, de fato, perder todo seu valor da noite para o dia. Risco que deveria ser \u00f3bvio para qualquer pessoa que j\u00e1 pensou alguma vez sobre qualquer investimento.No entanto, quando algu\u00e9m diz que vai investir em d\u00f3lar americano ou euro, ningu\u00e9m aponta o desvalorizado d\u00f3lar do Zimbabwe, onde o montante de 175 quatrilh\u00f5es zimbabuanos chegaram a valer apenas 5 d\u00f3lares americanos, para argumentar que pode ser um neg\u00f3cio ruim.Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o comprava um fandangos com essa\u00a0notaComo no c\u00e2mbio convencional, o investimento em criptomoedas deve ser observado individualmente. Assim, n\u00e3o precisar\u00edamos ficar t\u00e3o surpresos quando o respons\u00e1vel por uma das maiores bitmoedas do mercado nos diz isso.\u2026mas n\u00e3o d\u00ea ouvidos aos apaixonadosOs apaixonados pela febre das bitmoedas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o prestam um grande favor. Suas an\u00e1lises\u200a\u2014\u200acom bem menos teoria econ\u00f4mica e muito mais interesses pessoais\u200a\u2014\u200as\u00e3o exageradamente otimistas.De an\u00e1lises gr\u00e1ficas tendenciosas, baseadas na m\u00e9dia de um per\u00edodo para afirmar que a tend\u00eancia ainda \u00e9 de alta, comparativos com gr\u00e1ficos de tend\u00eancias de valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de empresas, e outros tipos de an\u00e1lise bem ing\u00eanua. O objetivo dos apaixonados tem sido convencer as pessoas de que as Bitmoedas s\u00e3o o investimento do futuro.Grande parte das pessoas com grande poder de influ\u00eancia que advogam a favor de alguma vertente de criptomoeda, usa seu poder p\u00fablico para influenciar altas e baixas, lucrando com a expectativa de quem segue seus conselhos.Suas opini\u00f5es nem sempre s\u00e3o livres deste interesse oculto.Os grandes f\u00f3runs e comunidades sobre o assunto s\u00e3o repletos de pessoas controlando opini\u00f5es e direcionando flutua\u00e7\u00f5es em benef\u00edcio pr\u00f3prio. Gente que muitas vezes nem acredita no potencial de longo prazo, mas sabe que agora podem direcionar uma boa quantidade de pessoas e ter um bom retorno imediato.Repetindo o erro dos economistas, mas na dire\u00e7\u00e3o oposta, entusiastas ignoram os potenciais riscos e influenciam outras pessoas a fazerem o mesmo. A arrog\u00e2ncia de achar que conhece as vari\u00e1veis ocultas pode causar danos financeiros muitas vezes irremedi\u00e1veis.A expectativa de que o modelo se consolide e transforme os que chegaram primeiro em milion\u00e1rios \u00e9 um cont\u00e1gio dif\u00edcil de evitar.De compra direta, sem uma corretora como intermedi\u00e1ria, at\u00e9 minera\u00e7\u00e3o caseira, n\u00e3o \u00e9 dif\u00edcil observar cen\u00e1rios onde muito dinheiro vem sendo perdido por pura cren\u00e7a num cen\u00e1rio extremamente otimista.Assim como cada queda brusca que o Bitcoin sofre funciona como trof\u00e9u midi\u00e1tico para os economistas refor\u00e7arem suas certezas pessimistas, cada nova alta na recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do Bitcoin vira uma sequ\u00eancia de posts apaixonados, repetindo os que acreditam ainda ficar\u00e3o muito ricos.Ambos os cen\u00e1rios ignorando inclusive que transa\u00e7\u00f5es em larga escala costumam ser feitas pelas pr\u00f3prias corretoras e grandes empresas, mudando a tend\u00eancia e aquecendo o mercado para que consigam lucrar.Os apaixonados interpretam cada novo ICO, principalmente quando vindo de grandes empresas refer\u00eancia como um forte sinal de que o futuro \u00e9 positivo. Como se grandes empresas n\u00e3o fizessem decis\u00f5es ruins e n\u00e3o tentassem aproveitar tend\u00eancias de mercado em busca de lucro.Risco como b\u00fassola para\u00a0decis\u00f5esDesde o ano 2000 aconteceu algo pr\u00f3ximo de 16 sequestros \u00e0 avi\u00f5es comerciais. Incluindo os que levaram ao ataque de 11 de setembro em 2001 no World Trade Center. Ainda partindo do mesmo ano, foram realizados aproximadamente 400 milh\u00f5es de voos comerciais.Numa conta de padaria, podemos estimar que as chances de ter um avi\u00e3o sequestrado \u00e9 algo perto de 0.000004%, dez vezes menor do que as chances de ser atingido por um raio.Mesmo sabendo que as chances s\u00e3o baixas, o investimento em seguran\u00e7a nos aeroportos n\u00e3o param de crescer, nos levando a curiosa pergunta: por que algu\u00e9m investiria cada vez mais dinheiro para evitar algo que j\u00e1 \u00e9 praticamente imposs\u00edvel de acontecer?Lembre-se do problema do peru.Decis\u00f5es n\u00e3o devem ser tomadas com bases nas chances de algo ruim acontecer, mas no tamanho do impacto caso aconte\u00e7a. Como vimos com o peru de a\u00e7\u00e3o de gra\u00e7as, o Titanic, a gravidez da sua prima J\u00falia e todas as bolhas econ\u00f4micas da hist\u00f3ria, algo que possui uma chance estatisticamente nula de acontecer, ainda acontece.Quando pensamos em riscos, a forma como abordamos as quest\u00f5es muda bastante. Sabemos que eventos extremos, estes que escapam \u00e0s estat\u00edsticas, normalmente causam grandes impactos, sejam eles positivos ou negativos.Sabemos tamb\u00e9m que um avi\u00e3o sequestrado pode representar a morte de milhares de pessoas. O risco de um sequestro \u00e9 alto o suficiente para justificar o investimento. Mesmo as chances sendo praticamente nulas, o impacto caso aconte\u00e7a \u00e9 estrondoso demais tanto para as vidas perdidas, quanto para o mercado de avia\u00e7\u00e3o.A mesma vis\u00e3o baseada em riscos deve ser adotada por quem dissemina informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre investimentos em criptomoedas.Os economistas que possuem potencial de influenciar investidores e empresas com capital, devem considerar o tamanho do potencial de ganhos caso o modelo se consolide de verdade. O risco de n\u00e3o ganhar, neste caso, pode ser alto.J\u00e1 no caso dos apaixonados, que s\u00e3o grandes influentes de pequenos investidores e indiv\u00edduos que planejam pedir demiss\u00e3o, vender o carro, usar o dinheiro rescis\u00e3o e a poupan\u00e7a da filha para investir no sonho de ficar rico, o cuidado \u00e9 ainda redobrado. Para o indiv\u00edduo comum, um conselho exagerado pode significar perder tudo o que juntou na vida.Se algu\u00e9m te convidasse para viajar, dizendo que as chances de mudan\u00e7a clim\u00e1tica podem variar entre -10\u00ba e 32\u00ba Celsius na mesma semana, voc\u00ea pensaria muito bem em se assegurar para cada um dos cen\u00e1rios.No entanto, se a estimativa for uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o entre 20 \u00baC e 25 \u00baC, suas escolhas ser\u00e3o bem diferentes.Cada um dos extremos da discuss\u00e3o envolvendo criptomoedas defende um espectro bem extremo e oposto de um potencial de varia\u00e7\u00e3o para as bitmoedas. Mas assim como na varia\u00e7\u00e3o clim\u00e1tica, existe uma extens\u00e3o que n\u00e3o conseguimos prever com exatid\u00e3o.No entanto, se decidir entrar nessa viagem, \u00e9 melhor se garantir que est\u00e1 bem protegido. Caso contr\u00e1rio, pode morrer congelado ou n\u00e3o conseguir curtir o sol na praia.", "responses": "12"}, {"title": "Zebpay\u2019s update on Segwit2x\u00a0fork", "author_name": "Zebpay", "link": "https://blog.zebpay.com/zebpays-update-on-segwit2x-fork-849592bda0a6?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 1, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "1.4K", "content": "Zebpay\u2019s update on Segwit2x\u00a0forkZebpayBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 1, 2017Update on 17th November:17th Nov, Fri 7pmAt approximately 4pm, we had paused bitcoin send / receive transactions. Although the Segwit2x hard fork was cancelled, we did this as an extra precaution to protect user funds.There is no action required from your side and everything is fine\u00a0:). We have restarted the send / receive transactions.Thank you.Update on 17th November:17th Nov, Fri 4pmSegwit2x hard fork was earlier planned for today. The hard fork was called off last minute. However to be extra careful of user funds, we are going to pause bitcoin send / receive transactions in a short time for a few hours. Bitcoin buy / sell will continue normally.We shall update as soon as we restart send / receive transactions.Update on 9th November:The Segwit2x hard fork has been cancelled as of yesterday as the community reached a compromise and will continue with the 1MB block size. Users no longer need to worry about the event of a fork. We might pause operations for a few hours around the planned hard fork time if required as an extra precaution. We will update users with more information as the deadline approaches.Update on 8th November:Important dates (will update again later):15/16th November: Segwit2x hard fork12\u201324 hours before: Zebpay pauses buy / sell / send / receive bitcoins2\u20133 days or more after fork: expected time after which Zebpay will start buy / sell / send / receive bitcoin transactionsWhat is the Segwit2x fork?Segwit2x is a proposal that members of the Bitcoin community rallied behind to end the scaling debate and implement a solution that would unite the community. If the proposal is not universally supported, it will lead to a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain and split the network into two blockchains.The community is divided on the issue of increasing the blocksize. The community that backs Segwit2x plans to double the blocksize to 2MB while the community that is against the hard fork will continue with the 1MB block limit. Right now, it is uncertain if the fork is going to happen as scheduled on November 16th or if the Bitcoin community is going to reach a compromise.Our Stance on ForksOur stance on forks remains the same. Our primary focus is ensuring safety of user\u2019s funds. Secondly, we believe that our customers should benefit from forks wherever feasible. We will ensure that customers who hold Bitcoin balances with Zebpay before the fork receive their Segwit2x tokens as soon as we can technically do so.We will suspend all operations 12 hours prior to the fork in order to ensure that there are no deposits/withdrawals during the time of the fork. We will keep customers updated with more information as the date of the fork approaches. At the time of the fork, we will take a snapshot of customer\u2019s balances and we will credit customers with the equivalent balance on both the blockchains after the fork.We will wait until the network is secure after the fork and as soon as we ensure stability and security of the forks, we will re-enable services. We might take time to credit customers with the S2X tokens as we need to establish support for the new blockchain. As soon as we enable support, we will credit customers wallets with their S2X tokens automatically. We will not recover incorrectly made cross chain deposits(such as depositing S2X token in a S1X address) under any circumstances due to lack of replay protection. It is advisable for customers to leave their balances with Zebpay in order to minimize risks of loss of funds. We will strive to ensure that we keep our customers delighted and continue to uphold the trust that our customers have placed in us.For any users who want to maintain control of their funds during the split and ensure that they receive their tokens immediately after the fork, please move your coins from your Zebpay wallet to a wallet where you control your private keys.", "responses": "15"}]
