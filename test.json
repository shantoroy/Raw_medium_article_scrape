Because being able to see what the program actually does is critical when transacting on the blockchain where code is law.In this quick guide you\u2019ll learn the language basics so that you are too able to to create vyper contracts.Why VyperThe language\u2019s principals are simple:- Security: it should be designed in a way that security comes automatically when writing the smart contract without having to do extensive tests and security checks.- Language and compiler simplicity: both should strive to create simple code that is not overcomplicated with unnecessary functionality.- Auditability: the ultimate goal is to have a programming language that is simple to read by any person regardless of their experience with computers in order to give them understanding while keeping security a priority by making difficult to write bad code.That\u2019s why Vyper is limited in functions compared to Solidity where you have less restrictions in place, to help people understand the code while making it secure. Based on those 3 principals, Vyper has a unique set of features for smart contract programming:- Bounds and overflow checking: On array accesses as well as on arithmetic level. Many of the issues with traditional smart contracts written in solidity is the fact that mathematical calculations are insecure because of the EVM\u2019s natural restrictions. You can\u2019t store an endlessly large number on a uint variable because it would be abused, and miners would have to process excessive computations every time. Vyper aims to solve that by checking overflow and underflow issues when compiling.- Support for signed integers and decimal fixed-point numbers: in this programming language you can have positive and negative integers with decimals unlike Solidity where decimals are not allowed because of number rounding limitations.- Decidability: It should be possible to compute a precise upper bound for the gas consumption of any function call. In other words, every function should provide a clear indication of how much gas it consumes at any point.- Strong typing: Including support for units (e.g. timestamp, timedelta, seconds, wei, wei per second, meters per second squared). Many new types are added to Vyper to provide better readability.- Small and understandable compiler code: the compiler code is optimized as much as possible in every contract.- Limited support for pure functions: Anything marked constant is not allowed to change the state which forces developers to guarantee that the code is behaving as expected.However, to fully implement the desired goals, Vyper is limited in functionality and thus it doesn\u2019t have the following programming capabilities:- Modifiers: they are not available because they may code tedious to understand since you have to jump back and forth to the modifier definition and because developers could write misleading code with unexpected functionality.- Class inheritance: when a smart contract inherits from many others, you have to jump back and forth between them to fully understand what is going on. Also, it\u2019s another point where programmers could write misleading code that executes unexpected functionality.- Inline assembly: assembly code is not searchable since functions and variables change their names to simpler values that are harder to understand and modify.- Function overloading: it\u2019s a problematic feature where the same function with different parameters could damage users with dangerous code.- Operator overloading: another problematic feature where developers could for instance, change the + operator to a potentially dangerous function.- Recursive calling: it makes function gas costs hard to predict and it\u2019s one of the many reasons you can\u2019t fully know how much gas you need to execute every function in solidity. By removing this feature, we also remove the possibility of gas limit attacks such as the reentrancy attack.- Endless loops: such as while and for loops without restrictions. They make impossible to calculate gas limits and could be used as an attack vector.- Binary fixed point: decimal fixed point is better, because any decimal fixed point value written as a literal in code has an exact representation, whereas with binary fixed point approximations are often required (e.g. (0.2)10 = (0.001100110011\u2026)2, which needs to be truncated), leading to unintuitive results, e.g. in Python 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.1\u00a0!= 1.File structureIn Vyper you don\u2019t have to specify the version of the compiler since the best one is automatically chosen for your smart contract. You can start writing code immediately in a\u00a0.vy file or using an online compiler such as vyper.online which I recommend to help you with debugging and compiling quickly as you develop.VariablesVyper has a wider variety of types of variables because they want to improve readability as much as possible. Therefore, what\u2019s better than a descriptive type of variable?In Vyper you start with the variable name, then a colon and the variable type with the visibility. Variable\u2019s visibility is the same as in solidity and you specify them like so:myVariableName: public(uint256)As you can see, you start with the variable\u2019s name and then you declare the type without a semicolon at the end since this is a python-based language.Variables in Vyper can either be private or public. Public means that anybody can access that variable including external contracts and private means that the variable can only be modified internally in this contract. To make a variable public, use the keyword public before the type and to make it private, just use the type without the public keyword.myVariableName: public(uint256) # A public variablemySecondVariable: uint256 # A private variableRemember that each smart contract needs to be setup in a single file so it\u2019s independent. These are state variables that get declared at the top of the contract. Note that you can\u2019t give a value to the variable when defining the type of the state variables.Following are the types of variables available in vyper:- uints: unsigned-integers which just like in solidity, can only be positive numbers. In vyper you only have the 256-bit version so all your unsigned-integers must be declared as uint256 including the number at the end instead of just uint. For example:myNumber: uint256- ints: signed-integers. These integers can be either positive or negative and as such, can only hold up to 128 bits of data so all your ints will be int128. Additionally, you can use the min(x, y) and max(x, y) functions with integers for making quick calculations. For example:myNumber: int128- booleans: they can either be true or false. You specify them with the bool keyword. For example:isValid: boolWhen dealing with if statements and conditions using Booleans you have several operators that you need to know such as:x not y: Logical negation. Instead of using the\u00a0! symbol in front of the boolean, you use the not keyword.x and y: Logical conjunction instead of using the usual && symbol.x or y: Logical disjunction instead of the usual || symbol.- decimals: this new type of variable stores a number with a precision of 10 decimal places between -2**127 and (2**127\u20131). Remember that in order to compare numerical variables, they must be of the same type i.e. both numbers have to be decimals. For example:myDecimalNumber: decimal- addresses: just like in solidity, a variable that contains an Ethereum address in hexadecimal notation with a leading 0x marker. For example:myAddress: addressNote that you can retrieve the balance contained in an address with the balance member variable:myAddress.balance- bytes: bytes store pieces of text in hexadecimal format. You can either use bytes32 or a custom bytes size. The larger it is, the longer text you\u2019ll be able to store inside with some clear limitations based on the gas limits. Basically they are strings with limited length. Fixed-size byte arrays can hold strings with equal or fewer characters than the maximum length of the byte array. For instance:username: public(bytes32)myArticle: bytes[1000]The variable myArticle will be able to store a string of up to 1000 characters while the username will be able to store a 32-character text. Custom-size byte arrays have several interesting functions that you\u2019ll often use when dealing with large strings:len(x): returns the length of the string.sha3(): returns the keccak256 hash as bytes32 of the string.concat(x,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.) concatenates multiple byte texts into one.slice(x, start=y, len=z): to cut a string into a shorter piece. Starts at y with the length z.Those are the main variable types available in vyper. After that, you have personalized unit types based on decimals, uints and ints. These are new types that you can freely create to improve the readability of your code by using custom words. Vyper has 3 unit types built in:- timestamp and timedelta: both measure time in seconds so 1 unit of this type is 1 second. Timestamp represents a point of time i.e. a specific date while timedelta contains the number of seconds. For instance:whenThisWasDone: timestampexpirationTime: timedeltaThey measure time and are based on the uint256 type.- wei_value: a measure of ether in the smallest unit, the wei which is one 18th part of 1 ether. Again, based on the uint256 type so it has the same limitations regarding positive-only numbers. For instance:amountSpent: wei_valueAlternatively, you can create your own custom unit types for improving your code\u2019s readability. Here\u2019s how it would look like:units: {   centimeter: \u201ccentimeter\u201d,   km: \u201ckilometer\u201d}Define them at the top of the file. You\u2019ll then be able to use them with a conversion parameter being either uint256, int128 or decimal. For instance:myCustomMeasure: uint256(centimeter)distanceFromMars: decimal(km)Those variables will store the same numerical values as simple uints or decimals, but they now have a specific unit type that give them a deeper meaning that improves readability to the external programmer.ArraysArrays in Vyper are pretty much the same thing as in Solidity. They are called lists since that\u2019s the official python terminology but in my opinion, it\u2019s just easier to call them arrays. You can create multidimensional arrays and simple arrays with square brackets however they all must be fixed with a limited size set beforehand. For instance:# An array of uintsmyNumbers: public(uint256[10])# A multidimensional array of addressesmyAddresses: address[10][20]# An array of 30 texts of 1000 characters eachmyArticles: public(bytes[1000][30])To add elements to your fixed-size arrays, you\u2019ll often have a counter of the latest modified index so that you can update it:myNumbers[3] = 25# With a counter variable it would look like thismyNumbers[latestNumberIndex] = 25# Set multiple valuesmyNumbers = [1, 4, 7, 3, 2, 9, 1, 3, 0, 9]# Get the value of a specific indexreturn myNumbers[4]Remember that arrays have 4 useful functions to get the length, calculate the hash, concatenate arrays and to slice them as previously seen in the bytes type definition.StructsStructs are pretty straightforward. You define them like in solidity but with python\u2019s syntax so it will look like this:# Create a structstruct Tree:   age: timestamp   name: bytes32# Create the struct instance variable (inside a function only)myTrees: Tree[10]# Initialize the struct (inside a function only)myTrees[0] = Tree({12, \u201cMy own tree\u201d})# Accessing a value (inside a function only)myTrees[0].timestamp = 19182They are great for creating objects that store complex types of data.MappingsMappings work the same way as in solidity. They just store endless amounts of variables in hash tables that can be retrieved with the index type. You can only declare them as state variables and modify them inside functions. Here\u2019s the syntax:myMapping: map(int128, bool)# To access a value (can only be done inside functions)myMapping[28] = TrueThat\u2019s all about Vyper\u2019s variables. You now know how to use them and how to define them. Let\u2019s take a look at functions and to fully understand a smart contract\u2019s structure.EventsEvents in vyper are pretty straightforward:# Event definitionMyEvent: event({from: indexed(address), amount: uint256})# Calling the event inside a functionlog.MyEvent(msg.sender, 10)As you can see, the event is similar to how you create it on solidity. You can use the keyword indexed to make that parameter searchable inside the blockchain\u2019s past events. Then, you can execute it with the function log.<yourEvent>().Note that they must be defined at the top of the file before the state variables and functions.FunctionsFunctions in vyper are similar to those on solidity but with python syntax. You still have to specify the visibility, the return values and the parameters. Here\u2019s how a function in vyper looks like:@publicdef sumTwoNumbers(numberA: uint256, numberB: uint256) -> uint256:   return numberA + numberThe return value is indicated with the arrow syntax -> instead of using the returns() keyword compared to solidity and the visibility is indicated using decorators which are just special keywords on top of the function.Functions in vyper can either be public or private. Public means that anybody can access and execute the function while private means that it can only be executed by the contract itself, just like internal functions in solidity.You can also add the @payable decorator to be able to receive funds with the function call. For instance:FundsReceived: event({amount: wei_value})@public@payabledef receiveFunds():   log.FundsReceived(msg.value)When a function is payable, you can access the ether received with msg.value.To read of modify state variables inside functions, you must use the self keyword. Here\u2019s how it looks like:myNumber: uint256@publicdef exampleFunction():   self.myNumber = 3If you don\u2019t, the compiler will think that you want to access the local variable with that name which makes the use of underscores before the variable naming unnecessary for function parameters compared to solidity where you must use underscores to update state variables easily.The constructorThe constructor is just like in python. Use the __init__ function to setup initial variables or execute internal mechanisms when the contract is deployed. For instance:@publicdef __init__():   # Do something here when the contract is deployedObviously, the constructor can\u2019t return any value, so it makes no sense to provide a return value to it.The fallback\u00a0functionThis function is the one being executed when you send a transaction to the contract without specifying the function that you want to call, basically when making ether transfers to the contract. Here\u2019s how it looks like in vyper:@public@payabledef __default__():   # Do something when receiving a transferDocumenting your functions with\u00a0NatSpecThe NatSpec documentation is a simple way to explain what your functions are supposed to do. It\u2019s important that you use to facility the understanding of your code for future developers and to improve it in the longer term. Here\u2019s how it looks like:@publicdef addNumbers(numberA: int128, numberB: int128) -> int128:   \"\"\"   @author Merunas Grincalaitis   @notice Adds 2 given integers and returns the result   @dev Works with either positive and negative numbers   @param numberA The first number to add   @param numberB The second number to add   @return int128 The number resulting after the addition   \"\"\"   return numberA + numberBAs you can see, you have several parameters to describe your functions. @notice is the one used to explain what the function is supposed to do for external readers. Be as concise and clear as possible. @param and @author describe the parameters of the function and the function\u2019s creator.And @dev is for giving additional information for coders to help understand some internal logic that may be irrelevant to the end users.SummaryThat\u2019s about it!

Unless someone forks over money, you can\u2019t count them as a customer.How many times have you gotten someone to \u201cpledge\u201d that they\u2019ll be a customer only to have them come up with an excuse later on why they won\u2019t be.But charging is hard especially when your beta users are people you want to keep happy\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes they could be your close friends. Sometimes it could be an influencer that you don\u2019t want to offend or a business relationship that you don\u2019t want to lose.Whatever the reason, it\u2019s hard to come out and say, \u201ccan you give me money?\u201d when you have an unproven product or even just an idea.It was something I struggled with for a long, long time, but I finally cracked the code with my latest startup, VYPER, which is a SaaS startup with tools for growth hackers to grow their email list. We successfully took a few pre-orders and validated the idea before the product was even ready.It\u2019s especially difficult for SaaS entrepreneurs because the outside world feels that since our service is digital it should be easy to give out free accounts (they never factor in hosting, AWS, customer service, dev costs, and the time we\u2019ve just spent helping you get on-boarded).So HOW do you actually charge your early customers without coming off as a douchebag?First off, you should make a clear distinction between 2 groups of beta\u00a0users.There are some beta users who basically are just doing you a favor and aren\u2019t really getting much out of your software at all. For these guys I generally don\u2019t pay attention to them and don\u2019t actively try to collect money from them.There are beta users who are actively using the platform and seem to be getting a lot of value from it.You want to be focusing on group 2.How to go for the ask, politely.Pre-development stage: Use Celery to take pre-orders, make sure the customer has purchase intent.When you go looking for pre-orders, be very specific. After you give your pitch, say \u201cis this something you want, and what would you pay for it?\u201dIf you get a yes, then send them a Celery page which asks for their money. This app make it really easy to start accepting pre-orders, and your customer won\u2019t get charged until you have a product. Make sure you emphasize this point with your customer, especially if you still have 6\u201312 months of development left.Another point of emphasis is that you want to let them know there is a reason why you\u2019re asking for their CC. It\u2019s not to take their money and run, but you need enough commitments so that you know this is an idea worth developing, because it\u2019s going to take a lot of your time.Also let your customer know they\u2019re getting a great deal for being an early customer. I recommend giving each of these customers a lifetime account so you don\u2019t have to worry about porting that user in as a monthly subscriber when the time comes.Know that you\u2019re going to get a ton of flakes at this stage. People are gonna give you every excuse in the book to not pay you. But you NEED this pre-validation to know whether this is a software idea that you can really pursue.Noah Kagan, the CEO of SumoMe and AppSumo, says you should be able to get 3 paying customers within 48 hours to validate your idea. That might not be possible for everyone, but I\u2019d say give yourself a month to get 3 pre-orders, BEFORE you start coding up your next SaaS app. This will both give you a nice little deadline while also testing the market and seeing if this is something that people actually want. It\u2019s better to lose a month of pre-validation then 6 months coding up your solution to absolute crickets.You\u2019re likely going to get a few people that are right on the cusp of wanting to pay for your software, but they want to see it in action first. Don\u2019t worry, keep these people in your sales queue and hit them up back when you have your early working prototype.How do you even GET people to talk to for pre-orders?Go to events where your target customer might reside and talk to everyone. Don\u2019t ask for the sale right there, just get a meeting.Ask in Facebook groups & Slack chats if \u201canyone is having trouble with X\u201d then add those people as friends. Then explain your solution to them.Basically your pre-orders is all about RELATIONSHIPS. Even before you start your email list, start build relationships now!Of course having an email list obviously helps, the more people that know you, the more people that you could potentially market to.Working prototype stage (beta testing): Be upfront. Tell them you\u2019re trying to validate your idea and you need their money. At the same time, hand-hold them and provide a lot of free value through your time.Those people that were wishy washy at the pre-development stage, here\u2019s where you can wow them and get them into your app.It\u2019s important that you show your app for free first. Mention that you want to show them exactly how your software works and really guide them through it 1-on-1.Let them know transparently that you want their honest feedback about whether they would purchase your software, and if they wouldn\u2019t that\u2019s totally cool.After your user has been inside your app, you can kind of see whether they\u2019ve gotten on-boarded and have gotten value from your software. The key here is now that someone has gotten on-boarded and really like your app, they\u2019re gonna WANT to pay you.Give them a discount for being your friends/early customers. We did this for a couple of our early beta users and they all were cool with paying a substantially discounted price for access to our app.This is good when your early beta users are all people that are fairly close to you, like friends and acquaintances.Another approach: Put up a paywall after X amount of months and let your beta users know.The early version of our software didn\u2019t have any paywall. Eventually we added the paywall and made it so that users had to pay in order to access certain features of our software. When that happens you should email your beta customers and let them know that you\u2019re finally charging for the product and they can get a discount.This is more effective when you have a good number of beta users who aren\u2019t necessarily your friends. This not only activates your current free beta users to pay for your product, but it also does it in a way where your beta users feel good about getting a discount.How do you respond when they ask for your software for\u00a0free?One issue that I faced when I ended up charging some close friends was they asked me, \u201chey dude, can you hook me up with a free account?\u201dBut my script that I came up with was basically this:Tell them we\u2019re in the process of business validation, and we need people to pay for the service so we know that it\u2019s something to continue with.But at the same time, you\u2019d like to give them a highly discounted lifetime account so they don\u2019t have to pay monthly fees for this.Lastly, if they really make a big deal out of it and don\u2019t want to pay for it, then just give it to them for free.For me, I chose to give some accounts for free because these were literally my best buds and I didn\u2019t think it was really worth fussing over.ConclusionThere\u2019s basically a general formula to the madness here.Give a reason why you need to take their money.Give them an offer.These 2 steps are both incredibly important because it frames the ask in the right way for your customer. Instead of thinking, \u201cOh, he\u2019s such a jerk for asking me to pay, even though I did XY and Z for them!\u201d your early user now thinks, \u201cCool, I\u2019m getting to support this entrepreneur while also getting a discount.

Multiple smart contract languages are at the bleeding edge of innovation in competition to become mainstream.

Also, Vyper\u2019s syntax resembles Python.\u201cVyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine\u00a0(EVM)\u201dLanguage Goals of\u00a0VyperSimplicity\u200a\u2014\u200aVyper focuses on simplicity and maximizes the chances of writing error-free code.

That's why Vyper encourages building one-page smart contracts. Code readability provides for better code audibility.Vyper Vs.\u00a0SolidityVyper\u2019s goals as a language are different than those of Solidity. To achieve simplicity, readability, and audibility, Vyper doesn\u2019t include some of Solidity\u2019s features such as Modifiers and Inheritance. In addition, Vyper also doesn\u2019t include:Function overloadingOperator overloading (Solidity also doesn't support it as of 17 Jan 2018)Recursive callingInfinite-length loopsInline assemblyBinary fixed pointVyper scarifies all of the above to achieve it's design goals. However, Vyper does provide some interesting features\u00a0:Bounds and overflow checking: On array accesses as well as on arithmetic level, which improves performance and increases reliability and security.Support for signed integers and decimal fixed point numbersDecidability: It should be possible to compute a precise upper bound for the gas consumption of any function call.Strong typing: Including support for units (e.g. timestamp, timedelta, seconds, wei, wei per second, meters per second squared).Small and understandable compiler codeLimited support for pure functions: Anything marked constant is not allowed to change the state.Among the above, decidability is a very important feature which you can use to estimate your upper bound of gas usage. This can help in gas optimization, which is a very important part of a smart contract platform.Installing VyperLet\u2019s get to it and install Vyper now. If you are running MacOS, check instructions here (I am running Ubuntu 16.10).Note- Vyper is in active development, so don\u2019t lose patience if you get installation errors. \ud83d\ude03Install Pythonsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install python3.6sudo apt-get install python3-devCreate Virtual EnvironmentIf you have worked with Python before then you must know about Virtual Python environment. It is strongly recommended to install Vyper in a Virtual Python environment.To create a new virtual environment for Vyper run the following commands:sudo apt install virtualenvvirtualenv -p python3.6 --no-site-packages ~/vyper-venvsource ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateYou must still be in the Virtual environment\u2026 now let\u2019s install Vyper:git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.gitcd vypermakemake testIf everything went fine, then first thank to Byte God \ud83d\ude03 and compile an example contract:vyper examples/crowdfund.vyThere are many examples in the example folder of the installation directory. We\u2019ll be going deeper into Vyper usage in future articles, so remember to hit subscribe below!Truffle with VyperTruffle 5 launched recently and it includes Vyper support. So let's upgrade to latest version and provide a Vyper example Box (Truffle boxes, remember?):npm uninstall -g trufflenpm install truffle Now let\u2019s download our vyper-exmaple Truffle Box. Run the command below in an empty repository:truffle unbox vyper-exampleLet\u2019s run our first Vyper Contract. Get into the vyper-example directory and open truffle console:cd vyper-exampletruffle developNow let\u2019s compile our contract and deploy:compilemigrate Now let\u2019s see our first Vyper smart contact:stored_data: uint256@publicdef set(new_value : uint256):    self.stored_data = new_value@public@constantdef get() -> uint256:    return self.stored_dataIt\u2019s a very basic Vyper smart contract, which is simply storing a state variable in stored_data and two public get and set method. @public tells that the method is public, and @constant is a sort of pure modifier in Solidity which tells that method doesn't change any state. Let's test our smart contact on the same Truffle console:VyperStorage.deployed().then((token) => {contract = token;})contract.set(1)contract.get(0)Deploy To MainNet using\u00a0QuikNodeNow let\u2019s deploy our smart contract on MainNet using our own QuikNode. First, we have to install HDWalletProvider to handle the transaction signing as well as the connection to the Ethereum network.$ npm install truffle-hdwallet-providerNext, in truffle.js we have to setup our wallet provider (using QuikNode Web3 URL):var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");var mnemonic = \"YOUR_MEMONICS\"; // use a funded walletmodule.exports = {    networks: {        development: {            host: \"127.0.0.1\",            port: 7545,            network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id        },        kovan: {            provider: function() {                return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://mistakenly-smart-jay.quiknode.io/86d9e35e-8cdb-47ad-80a4-84f9e9537afa/C0_tKUunhUc0rM_i1HMxHA==/\")            },            network_id: 42        }    }};That\u2019s it, you ran and deployed your first Vyper smart contract using truffle!In future blogs, we will go more in-depth about the Vyper language and building more complex smart contracts.Awesome Vyper\u00a0\ud83d\udc0dVyper is an experimental language but the community is quite active and building interesting tools (check the full list here).

He\u2019s a dork and actually really into feedback, and happy to help you form the best questions for your own surveys.Getting feedback from users is so important for any startup or website, as it helps achieve the following goals:Increasing trustFinding points of confusion in the siteIncreasing revenue / conversionLearning what\u2019s missingImproving site copyNot everyone is great at coming up with quality user feedback questions to ask in a survey, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s intimidating and confusing sometimes. I get that.I run userinput.io, which provides on-demand feedback on websites and business ideas, so I\u2019ve seen a LOT of questions asked. Sometimes when I look over orders that come through (out of curiosity or to spot-check the feedback), I cringe at the bad questions that I see. But the golden questions, those can really help you improve.Six crucial user feedback questions1) What do you think this site\u00a0offers?This question is similar to the \u201cfive second blink test\u201d where you have someone glance at a site quickly, then tell you what it\u2019s about. If it\u2019s not clear right away, then you need to change something. Or a lot of things.By asking what the site offers, you\u2019re no longer assuming that the offer of the site is clear, and you\u2019re testing to see if a regular visitor \u201cgets it\u201d right away. And you\u2019ll be surprised of the confusion that can come out of this question.If you\u2019re on the right track with your copywriting and how you present everything, 90+% of respondents will understand what your site\u2019s about.But pay attention to everyone who doesn\u2019t understand the offer and pour over what they say.What are they misinterpreting? What was unclear? What led them to the inaccurate idea of the offer?Presenting your offer as clearly and simply (and enticingly) as possible is so important for conversion, and keeping people on your site. You of course totally understand your offer, but it\u2019s vital to step back and have other people try to explain your own offer to see where your site falls short.2) Do you trust this site? Why or why\u00a0not?I don\u2019t like yes or no questions for surveys, but the second question here of \u201cwhy or why not\u201d makes it all worthwhile. Trust is such a huge factor in site activity, bounce rate, conversion, time on site, checkout, everything.This gets back to the point about the offer above. You of course trust your site. You trust yourself! You\u2019re not some scammer scumbag, you\u2019re a legit person with a legit site. Obviously!But do visitors trust your site?Maybe it\u2019s the overall design. I ran feedback on one of my own sites the other day, and one reviewer said they didn\u2019t trust my site because the design \u201clooked a bit out-dated.\u201d Trust is fickle. People are fickle. The design isn\u2019t that outdated in my opinion, of course. The site is built on a tremendously popular Wordpress plugin. But that one reviewer thought it looked out-dated, and maybe he\u2019s right, maybe it\u2019s not as elegant and modern as it could be. And that could affect him converting and being a customer.They\u2019ll pick up on other stuff, good and bad. Those who do trust your site will say \u201cI see the padlock in the address bar, I like that\u201d or \u201cYeah it looks professional and your team page has pictures and I like that a lot.\u201dOr maybe they will say \u201cNo way, it looks like a pyramid scheme\u201d but they\u2019ll explain why. And the why is the crucial part that you can learn from and execute on and come up with a plan to improve with.You\u2019re too blind to your own design, so you have to ask others, unbiased others, to tell you why your site is trustworthy. Or not.3) If you had a magic wand, how would you improve the\u00a0site?This is a straight up customer discovery question, one that would be used more in the context of \u201cIf you had a magic wand, how would you make international travel easier?\u201d or whatever, in the process of trying to figure out what problem to solve with a new idea or startup.But the question is gold for site feedback too. Some people laugh at this question, because it\u2019s kinda corny. But it\u2019s gold, Jerry, gold!The great thing about the \u201cmagic wand\u201d question is that it gives reviewers free reign to dream, and say whatever they want. Their gears will turn, and it\u2019ll turn yours too. Some of the responses may not be possible (\u201cMake it free!!\u201d) but you\u2019ll get ideas for new features and different approaches.When I ran a survey on my other business, which is a screen printing company, I ran it specifically on the page for bands who want custom shirts, and there were lots of fairly common answers like \u201cmore images\u201d and \u201cmore testimonials\u201d, but two respondents gave me a couple great ideas, including that I should push our graphic design services more, which I hadn\u2019t thought to do, and combine them with the band offer more clearly.A magic wand can lead to a lot of new ideas.4) What confused you most about this\u00a0site?There\u2019s a recurring theme here, but your own site can\u2019t confuse you because you built it. You\u2019re too wrapped up in it.Is the pricing confusing? Listen to your reviewers and learn how to change it.Is the offer confusing? Learn why.Do they not understand why a certain feature is there? Or why they would want it?Maybe the offer is confusing because of how it\u2019s laid out. (A reviewer for my site told me to frame the information in a table format instead, to make it easier to digest.)How long does your process take? What happens first? What are the overall steps in the process?Maybe they don\u2019t understand how to check out, or get started, or order.You totally understand your site. Your visitors may not. Find out why, and then fix it.5) What is the site\u00a0missing?What\u2019s not there, that the visitors think should be there? Another variation of this question that I like is \u201cWhat did you expect to see here, that isn\u2019t here?\u201dThese questions let people tell you what they would expect to see on a site like yours. Maybe it\u2019s testimonials. Maybe it\u2019s social proof. Or images of the team. Or a clearer offer. Or probably it\u2019s something very specific to your site, so I can\u2019t even imagine what it would be, and list it as an example.Answers to this question can also lead you onto what could be included in order to help improve conversion.6) What is your least favorite thing about the\u00a0site?I also sometimes run the question \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite thing about the site?\u201d because it\u2019s nice to see what people really like, but honestly, negative feedback is better than positive, so you need to find out what people don\u2019t like, and if you\u2019re lucky, you might find someone who really shreds your site, so that you get a list of a ton of things that should be improved.\u201cEverything looks great, no complaints\u201d is worthless feedback. They need to find something they don\u2019t like. And they\u2019ll let you know, whether it\u2019s your color scheme or logo or how you wrote the copy. I\u2019ve had people shred the popups on my sites before, ranting about how annoying they are. You won\u2019t know until you ask.I mentioned improving site copy above, but none of the questions relate. So what questions cover that? It\u2019s more about using the verbiage that the reviewers use, and you can also explore their fears with feedback questions, by asking things like \u201cWhat\u2019s the hardest thing about X?\u201d Pour over what they really say, and then use their own words in your copy. Speak to their needs and concerns.I was running feedback on that band merch page, and one reviewer said this in an answer \u201cWe were afraid of spending a lot of money and then being stuck with a bunch of merchandise since there is often a high minimum order\u201d when asked about ordering shirts before. There\u2019s actually a lot there for me to use in the site copy, by saying that my solution of fundraising with shirts helps avoid spending a lot upfront and getting stuck with shirts that no one wants. And I also learned to emphasize our relatively low minimum order too.Four awful questions that should be\u00a0avoidedWhat not to ask and how not to ask it. When you\u2019re getting feedback, you need it to be valuable, insightful and actionable. There are ways to shape questions to make them bear more fruit. And there are also ways to shape questions to make them rotten.Here are some tips to avoid bad questions.Awful: Would you buy/use\u00a0this?This is an awful question for a couple of reasons, one major reason being that you never want to ask a \u201cyes/no\u201d question because you want way more than \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d as an answer. You want detail and depth and an explanation. \u201cYes/no\u201d limits you right from the beginning, and screws up your potential for learning something that matters. \u201cYes I would buy this\u201d is nice to feel like you\u2019re on the right track, but it\u2019s still too limiting, and you also don\u2019t know WHY they would buy it. If you\u2019re going to ask a question like this, make it a two part question with \u201cwhy or why not?\u201d added on, for the real valuable info.The other reason it\u2019s a lousy question is that people taking surveys may be within your target market, and they may be within your audience, but you can\u2019t count on them to be your customers. I believe payment is validation, but this is not the time to see if they would pay.That being said, there is plenty of value to \u201cWould you use this? Why or why not?\u201d which removes the payment question, and lets you gauge the desirability of the offer, and also find out what features make it desirable and more importantly what keeps people from wanting it.A customer ran this question on an app she\u2019s working on the other day, and I reviewed her answers. It was pretty polarized, with some people hating the idea, and some people loving the idea. She ran the good version of the question with the \u201cwhy or why not\u201d part, and got tons of feedback on what people liked and what they extremely disliked on the idea.Asking \u201cwhy or why not?\u201d makes the feedback valuable. But don\u2019t just ask a \u201cyes/no\u201d question.Awful: Do you like this\u00a0website?Again, not valuable enough. A \u201cyes\u201d is flattering, but you don\u2019t know why they like it. A \u201cno\u201d is meaningless because you\u2019re just going to be bummed they didn\u2019t like your site and you have no idea what they disliked and how you can improve it.There are better versions of this answer:\u201cWhat do you like most about this site?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think of the branding, design and appearance of this site?\u201d \u201cWhat do you dislike most about this site?\u201dAny of those questions will give you helpful feedback, way more helpful than a binary response with no clarification.Awful: How would you rate this website on a scale from 1 to\u00a010?I am not a fan of Net Promoter Score or any system like it because it has no depth and detail and because it\u2019s not actionable at all.If someone gives your site a \u201c1\u201d, whatever. If they give it a \u201c10\u201d, whatever. Did you learn anything from those numbers? Sort of but not really. You don\u2019t know why they gave it a 1, or a 10, or anything in between. You have no actionable feedback here, so you can\u2019t take action. See the previous question and ask something that you can actually learn from.Awful: What would you pay for\u00a0this?Again, these survey takes may be within your target demographic, but they\u2019re not customers or leads or in your sales funnel or anything. They\u2019re just taking a survey.Well, I take that back a little bit. If you were suave enough to get someone on your mailing list / waiting list to take a survey about your startup / idea / business, then they are in fact a potential customer. But it\u2019s really hard to talk someone from a waiting list into taking a survey, at least in my experience. You gotta bribe them somehow. Or develop personal relationships with them a bit, and ask questions one by one, not so much in a survey format.But the main reason this question sucks it that people who are getting paid a small amount of money to take a survey are not probably in a position to buy your service or product anyway. By the nature of paid surveys, those taking the survey may skew towards having less income or at least less disposable income.I quit asking this question a while ago when doing customer discovery surveys, after guys said they wouldn\u2019t pay anything, or just some really small amount for an online dating related startup I had, while customers would pay $39 or even $149 for the services.These surveys can be great to explore ideas, validate needs, and improve your website by easily learning the weak areas. They\u2019re insightful and easy, and I love them. The formation of the question is key, so spend time giving them thought.Also, make sure the questions are clear, and not at all misleading. I\u2019ve seen customers run a survey question (and I\u2019ve done it myself) where the question was not written very clearly, and it really affected the answers. You can end up getting feedback that isn\u2019t at all about what you asked, if your question is unclear.That\u2019s it. I hope this was helpful.What would you rate this article on a scale from 1 to 10?Just kidding. That question is garbage.Check out userinput.io to learn how to improve your website or idea today.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "5 Cold Email Templates To Warm Up Your List Or\u00a0Prospect", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/5-cold-email-templates-to-warm-up-your-list-or-prospect-1b4f4bb84f1a?source=search_post---------6", "post_date": "Nov 6, 2017", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "110", "content": "5 Cold Email Templates To Warm Up Your List Or\u00a0ProspectVYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 6, 2017Communication is key when is comes to selling, on boarding, retaining and running a successful business.But, how do you get someone to listen to what you have to say when their email inbox is overflowing, they have a long to do list and know you are going to ask them for something.We teamed up with our friends over at Find That Email to bring you 5 extremely affective hacks that will help you engage with cold leads or warm up a cold email list!Here is a hypothetical scenario. Say, you\u2019ve lost your wallet and you need money to get a bus ticket. Which technique do you think will work better with strangers?Scenario 1You walk up to a strangerAnd say \u201cHey, I need money for the bus\u201d.Scenario 2You walk up to a strangerAnd say \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going? Sorry to bother you, I\u2019m in a bit of a pickle and you seem like a genuinely decent person and that is why I\u2019m asking you. So this is the situation\u2026 \u201dWhich attempt do you think will work out better?It\u2019s definitely the latter.Staying ColdA lot of email marketers have in fact chosen the first route.They don\u2019t put their heart into it, they don\u2019t do their homework and they want quick results. A lot of outreach folk also do not segment their audience or truly understand their audience\u2019s pain.This is why cold email outreach has got a reputation of being a difficult channel to get business from.Without the initial hard work, the people you reach out to will remain cold.When they don\u2019t get the results, they start complaining and they spell doom for the entire Industry. They usually write a post about how Email Marketing is dead because it didn\u2019t work for them.Warming things upAnd over the years, in an attempt to be professional, a lot of cold emailers have stuck to a script and have completely avoided any informal talk. You should know how important informal talk is. One of the reasons languages were developed was because of people\u2019s need to gossip.If you stick to your robotic script, it\u2019s going to go nowhere. Here is an example of a chat conversation with a potential customer. We got talking about cities and the world and after a long conversation, a rapport was built.I\u2019m not saying, fake the rapport. Be genuine. And don\u2019t be a robot. You don\u2019t have to become Facebook buddies with every customer. But it helps to form a bond.So at Find That Email, we use a few techniques for warming up a lead during outreach. Here are some ideas that you could use.5 Ways to Go From Cold to\u00a0HOT!Idea #1\u00a0: You are part of our same Facebook group.Have you ever been in a situation, where you were interacting with a stranger and they happen to mention that they are from the same city as yours and your interest in them piqued?There\u2019s something about being from the same tribe or group that warms people up immediately.It\u2019s the same thing with marketing, when you mention that you are from a particular Linkedin or Facebook group that they are part of and that is why you are reaching out to them, It immediately makes them at ease.Here is a sample idea.Hey Joe,I\u2019m John Doe from Sweet Candy Tech. I see you are part of the SAAS Hacks group. It\u2019s a great group isn\u2019t it? Considering both of us are in the same group, I\u2019ve made a tiny assumption that we we might be interested in the same things\u2026This is something we have constantly used at Find That Email with a good amount of success.Idea #2\u00a0: Common Friends with the Rock.This actually requires a common friend.It\u2019s pretty easy to make common friends. A few people on Linkedin do accept requests from strangers that they\u2019ve interacted with a total of zero times. This is not a good common friend.Here are a few techniques to make good common friends.Ask your existing friends to introduce you to people you want to knowMeet, interact, exchange ideas with people in events and meetups. Keep in touch with them on Social Media. They become your connections.There are a few high quality facebook groups which put out posts like \u201cIntroduce yourself and share your Linkedin and connect with other people on the group\u201d. Take advantage of this and reach out to people you would like in your network. That\u2019s another way of adding more contacts.So when you make connections with 10 people and they have an average of 450 people in their contacts. That\u2019s 4500 people you could possibly reach and use the common connection card.So now if you have a common friend, ask them to introduce you. Simple. Getting introductions is the best way to do partnerships and will probably the best way for a very long time.Idea #3\u00a0: The Event CardThis is a situational based warming up technique, but it works nevertheless.Say you are attending an event and you are aware of your prospect attending the event as well. You can set-up a meeting at the booth, by mailing them before the event.Hey <Name of the person>,I\u2019m Joe from Supertronics. I see you\u2019re going to be attending the SaasX event this August. I have a few interesting ideas to share with you about <topic>. Would you be interested in a chat?The other is, mailing them after an event is over and when you did not meet them.Hey <Name of the person>,I\u2019m Joe from Supertronics. I know you had attended the SaasX even this August and I wanted to come to your booth to say hi and discuss a few ideas, but I missed you by a whisker because I had an emergency. Would you be willing to chat?Idea #4\u00a0: Doing Research and Getting FeedbackA smart technique that you could use to warm up your potential lead is to ask for feedback for your research.An example would be\u00a0:Find That Email is an email finding tool and say we decide to write an article about how lead generation companies can get better at getting the accurate emails and the issues companies have with lead generation companies.You can ask a potential lead their opinion on lead generation companies and how these companies can improve their service.A lot of folk will have opinions, especially if they are the right target audience and they will give you advice and tips. This is your in and you can start a conversation around the tools they use and so on.Hey Tim,This is Jody from Forest Fire Inc. You seem to be an accomplished sales representative based on your profile and I reached out to you for advice. I\u2019m writing an article on <topic>, can I have your opinion and and suggestions to improve <topic>.Idea #5\u00a0: I\u2019m a FanIn many cases, the people you are reaching out to have written content and are maybe influencers.One of the ways you can warm them up is by telling them that you\u2019ve read their content and have already shared it on your social media and to your followers.Considering you\u2019ve already done something for them, many people will treat your cold email with a bit more of warmth.I loved your article so much, I\u2019ve already shared it to my followers on Social Media and to people on my mailing list. It was AMAZING.Another way to warm up the lead is to find the Influencer that they really like. Look at their twitter, social media and find the person that they are big fans of and share a similar interest as well.Finding common ground with people is the fastest way to get people to like you.Finally I\u2019ve found a fan of <Influencer Name>, who is a bigger fan than me. I love his ideas. Which strategy that <Influencer> suggested was your favorite?Just to make things clear. These ideas aren\u2019t the only things that should be in the Email. Your email should encompassa solid introductiona reason for reaching outa strong value propositiona call to actionand your warming messageWrapping it up!You need to turn on your charm when it comes to cold emails.If you put your thinking cap on, you can come up with various ways to warm up your prospects in a cold email.Get on your experiment mode and find your technique.Also, one technique isn\u2019t guaranteed to work with everybody. You should know your audience and use the right strategy.

Because if you just join 30 groups and just spam your contest, you\u2019re going to get banned faster than you can say, \u201cEnter my contest!\u201dHere\u2019s a detailed explanation on how to do it WITHOUT getting banned. A lot of credit to Kim of RunnerCrate, who used this tactic very successfully for her giveaway.Step 1: Find the Group and Make Sure it\u2019s\u00a0ActiveThere\u2019s no point in posting in groups where the spammers have taken over. Find an active, legitimate group in your niche where people are actually helping each other. Don\u2019t go for the groups where you see a bunch of people just posting links without much discussion, as these groups have gone to sh*t.The simple way to do it is search for a keyword, for example, \u201crunners\u201d and then click on the groups tab.Step 2: Post &\u00a0EngageBefore you just post your giveaway, make sure you post & engage heavily with the members. This step needs to be done a week or so before your giveaway, so you can build some good karma in the community. Be super helpful and eager and show that you\u2019re going to be a valued member of the community.This goes a long way to impressing the admins. Don\u2019t post any of your links at ALL during your first week or two, because admins can see that a mile away.Step 3: Find the Admin, Befriend\u00a0ThemAgain, here\u2019s a gif showing you how to find the admins of the group. Again this is from Kim\u2019s RunnerCrate blog.Take some time to get to know the admins. Most of the time, these guys are sharing a lot of content in their own groups. Try and engage with them if you can. Make it known that you\u2019re a real person, not just some bot trying to spam Facebook groups.Aaron Janx, a podcaster, uses groups extremely effectively. To befriend admins he does a public thank you to them. Here\u2019s an example of how he thanks the admin of the Screw the 9\u20135 Facebook group, Jill Stanton.Notice how in the post he never linked to his own content, but linked to the content of the group owners. Admins love this because it\u2019s a testimonial to their work. You bet that Aaron now has free reign inside that Facebook group to subtly promote his own stuff. He also wrote a very long note in the Facebook group instead of a simple thank you. This kind of \u201csucking up\u201d is key to making the admins love you.Step 4: Ask the Admins to Share for You, with an IncentiveIt\u2019s 10x more powerful if the admin themselves shares your contest or giveaway.If you REALLY want them to share it for you, I recommend giving them some kind of free gift as a bribe. Kim from RunnerCrate offered up free boxes in exchange for having them post her contest. It can work without the bribe if you ask nicely, but for the larger Facebook groups, this tactic could be a game changer for you.And there you have it. That\u2019s how you work the Facebook groups and get your contest shared without being spammy.Ready to create your contest and start sharing it in Facebook\u00a0groups?Get a free account at VYPER!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to Use Content Upgrades to Increase Your Content Marketing Opt-ins by\u00a060%", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-use-content-upgrades-to-increase-your-content-marketing-opt-ins-by-60-a3572c662f26?source=search_post---------9", "post_date": "Dec 13, 2016", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "2", "content": "How to Use Content Upgrades to Increase Your Content Marketing Opt-ins by\u00a060%VYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 13, 2016What You Are About To\u00a0Learn:What content upgrades areWhy content upgrades are better than popupsStep by Step guide on how to create / use content upgradesBonus lists and resources on content marketingWhat the \u201cF\u201d are Content\u00a0UpgradesSo you know collecting emails on your blog is important but struggling to make ends meet!

Look for startups that got 200+ upvotes. You can search by \u201ctopics\u201d to find similar startups.Make a list of the hunters that submitted those products, with a spreadsheet, and find their email addresses.

The other half is getting them to the eyeballs of the right people. The VYPER blog has been increasing at a rate of 77% growth month over month, and one of the main reasons is because we\u2019ve started writing more content while promoting it in the right places.Here\u2019s a checklist that I personally use during my blog planning, creation, and promotion phase.Free Bonus Download: Grab the post checklist as a PDF! and reference it at your convenience!Phase 1:\u00a0PlanningWhat topic should I write about?Some marketers tell you to check BuzzSumo to find relevant topics or search for relevant SEO terms before you start writing. I disagree. I think the best content comes from personal experience and writing from the heart, not from finding topics from these sites. What do I know about getting articles that work? My last online magazine (Amped Asia) to over 4 million monthly pageviews. Granted, it\u2019s a little bit different now that I\u2019m writing for a SaaS company rather than an entertainment magazine, but a lot of the same principles for good writing applies.So instead of writing your next piece for the search engines or to fit in with what\u2019s hot, why not think one step ahead? What are people NOT talking about and can you start a discussion around it? What are people saying and is there a way you can disagree with them or form a counter-point? (Like what I just did here). You CAN use BuzzSumo, but make sure you\u2019re using to to find inspiration, not to just copy the top-most shared content.What\u2019s the goal of this piece and how will I accomplish my goal?Why are you even writing this blog post? Every blogger and content marketer should have a goal in mind for their piece, and use that goal to guide how they write. If you can quantify your goal that would be best, but it\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t.For example my goals with the blog post you\u2019re reading.Add 100 people to our subscriber list.Exercise my writing skills with long form content.Show off VYPER\u2019s new content upgrades tool.Find content that resonates with the audiences at GrowthHackers / Inbound.And how am I going to accomplish my goal?I\u2019m going to link to a content upgrade, one of the best ways to promote a blog post.I\u2019m going to make this piece over 2,500 words long.The tool is displayed prominently within the article and linked to.Goes hand in hand with #2, but I\u2019m making this piece very long-form and detailed.Is this topic something that I can write extensively in and something I have actual knowledge of?Blogging is great, but most bloggers are just rehashing content that they read elsewhere. But the best articles on the web are ones written with authenticity and voice. For example, even when Noah Kagan writes about something I might not be super interested in (like last week his newsletter was about how he had dinner with 2 people at his house\u2026 weird I know) I still read it because I just like him as a writer. Same with Neville Medhora (copywriting), Rob Walling (SaaS), and certain other influencers.So with that in mind, you want to make sure the topic you\u2019re writing about isn\u2019t just something you researched just for the article. You want to make sure you\u2019ve had personal experience. Case studies do super well because they show numbers and evidence that a certain tactic works.Once I know my content, can I fit it into any keywords for SEO?Now once you\u2019ve got a topic in mind, you should look into fitting SEO keywords into your article rather than the other way around. Don\u2019t force it though. You want the article to still come off natural. With the latest Google updates, it\u2019s much better to write a quality piece rather than write a piece with the aim of stuffing keywords into the article. HOWEVER, if you can naturally fit keywords into your article then do it.Can I mention any tools or resources in my post?For me, I look to include as many tools or resources into any post that I write. This allows me to potentially connect with the creator of that tool or get some friendly back and forth going.But really this helps you do 2 things.Directly you can get Tweets or shares by the company you mentioned. Some of them will even be shouting your praises at the top of their lungs.You build rapport and possibly a relationship with the creator of the tool/resource. You never know when this might be useful in the future.Free Bonus Download: Grab the post checklist as a PDF! and reference it at your convenience!Phase 2:\u00a0CreationWrite a first draft. Wait a day to look it over.Write your first draft, but wait before you publish. I like to wait a day before I publish the article.Can I link to any previously written content?The more links you have to other articles in your blog bank, the more traffic you\u2019re going to eventually get. This is magnified when you re-purpose the same content for LinkedIn, Medium, etc.How can I 10x the value of this content?This is something I\u2019m doing more and more on the VYPER blog. Long-form content and huge guides are always your best bet because these rank well for SEO keywords and they get shared if they\u2019re especially epic. It\u2019s much harder to write long-form content, but if you can do it, you\u2019re going to have a huge advantage. That\u2019s why blogs like Grow and Convert have been killing it with content\u200a\u2014\u200athe owner Benji is willing to write INSANE amounts of in-depth content backed by data.This stage is really the make or break point for your content. Average writers stop before they 10x their content.In a world where there is a lot of content getting passed around and not much content that\u2019s actually good, it takes the extra mile to have your content really stick with your audience. So when you think of it in that perspective, it\u2019s not hard to make content marketing work, you just need to be within the 1\u20132% that really goes that extra mile with your writing.Create a content upgrade for my piece of content.A content upgrade is a blog-specific lead magnet that is very closely related to the blog post. You can simply create a PDF version of your blog post and use that as a content upgrade. I like to add bonus content to my blog post and then combine my post + the bonus content into one PDF download.I use our in-house tool, VYPER Content Upgrades, to deliver the lead magnet and show a popup that asks for the email address. When you have a blog that has multiple content upgrades, this tool is very powerful to make it easier to setup multiple lead magnets on your blog. With providers like Mailchimp, you can only send a default \u201cwelcome\u201d email. That makes it hard to do content upgrades unless you\u2019re going to link to every single content upgrade inside that welcome email. Then you run into the problem of your reader getting the same welcome email multiple times when they find new content upgrades on your website. It gets messy. VYPER content upgrades handles this all for you AND incentivizes your reader to share the content upgrade in order to get bonus content.Where can I add numbers / evidence?People love proof. This is the reason why Nate Silver\u2019s blog FiveThirtyEight has been taking off despite talking about a topic (sports) that we don\u2019t always associate with hard evidence and numbers (he also talks about politics, but I mainly go on there for sports). It\u2019s such a smart blog because he backs up everything with charts and numbers, and he\u2019s really become the talk of the town in the sports blogging world. It\u2019s completely different from the coverage on places like ESPN and Bleacher Report.Re-think your headline.If your headline is something like \u201cThe Guide to Social Media Marketing\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athen scrap that sh*t and come up with something new. Make it exciting, make it lively, make it fresh. I like Neville Medhora\u2019s blog on copywriting for tips on this.My iteration for the headline for this blog post wasThe Ultimate Blog Promotion ChecklistThe Blog Promotion Checklist that Grew Our Traffic 77% (added numbers)The \u201c4-Phase\u201d Blog Promotion Checklist That Grows Our Traffic 77% Every Month (added a word with quotes to add intrigue)Phase 3: PromotionSend it to your newsletter, and ask them to share it with their friends.Activate your current audience to read your post and share it with their friends, thereby spreading your content virally.Did I mention anyone in the blog post? If so, contact them, tweet them, etc.Like I\u2019ve said already, cold outreach to the people in the blog post can help you get comments, get views, and get engagement. Ideally you\u2019ll want these people to share it with their networks.Re-purpose for Medium.Medium has an official plugin for this. I haven\u2019t cracked the code on Medium yet, so I\u2019ll probably follow-up this blog post with more when I figure out how to use Medium properly. This is one of the growth channels I\u2019m currently looking into.Re-purpose for LinkedIn.Great for posts that are business oriented. I don\u2019t think too much about this channel, I just get about 20\u201350 hits per article by re-posting it here. Great because it\u2019s native content so LinkedIn helps give it a boost. Great when you have thousands of connections on LinkedIn that might be reading your content.Re-purpose for RedditReddit loves self-posts, which means don\u2019t just link to your blog post from Reddit (most subs consider that to be blog spam). Instead make a \u201cself post\u201d which is basically your blog post rewritten as a Reddit post. Remember how earlier I told you to link to other posts in your blog? Well here\u2019s where that comes in handy.Tip: Use Reddit converter to easily transform a blog post into Reddit formatting.Also read our other article on promoting via Reddit.Add it to my library on Recurpost (you can also use MeetEdgar) so my post keeps getting in my share queue.Typically I share 2\u20134 pieces of content per day on my multiple Twitter followings and Facebook pages. Recurpost also posts it into my Facebook group.Post it up in various Slack chats.There\u2019s communities for many topics nowadays. Most Slack chats have a channel or two for self-promotion. Post them in here when you have a new blog post. Here\u2019s a good list of Slack groups you can join.Post in various Facebook groups (if it\u2019s allowed).This is powerful if you can swing it. Most Facebook groups disallow posting content, but if you\u2019re friends with the admins you can usually swing it. Here\u2019s a blog post where I talk more about posting within Facebook groups.Post it on Hacker News.Still trying to get this one to work. Sometimes I get 1k+ visits, sometimes 50\u2013100. Either way it\u2019s free traffic so there\u2019s no reason NOT to post it up here. And you don\u2019t have to be tech-focused for this to work. My friend Bemmu Soponen uses Hacker News to get a lot of traffic to his subscription candy service, Candy Japan. Here\u2019s a post he made that got tons of traffic and shares.Post it in relevant other communities.Depending on your niche, you might have communities where you can post your content. For startups/marketing I post to GrowthHackers.com and Inbound.org as well as Hacker News and Reddit.Share on my personal Facebook.Seems like a no-brainer, but just share it on networks you have access to, like your own personal Facebook.Email link roundups.There\u2019s a new type of newsletter out these days which contain purely links to other sites. Find link roundups in your niche and try to get your post listed in those roundups.Put it into Triberr.My co-founder worked on this tactic, but Triberr is basically a community where you can share other people\u2019s posts and they\u2019ll share yours. Traffic exchange type site, but it works within niches like entrepreneurship, startups, etc. So you\u2019ll end up getting some relevant shares.Promote it on Quuu promote.If you want to put any budget into it, Quuu promote is great if you fit within their categories.Get on Twitter and tweet your post to relevant users.I use automation tool Audiense to automatically send a tweet when someone follows me. Usually it says something like, \u201cHey I just wrote this new blog post on X, would you give me your thoughts? Thanks!\u201d (In fact you might be reading this blog post because you got my Tweet).Phase 4: Evaluate (Months\u00a0Later)If this all seems like hard work, it is! In fact it\u2019s hella hard, which is why most people don\u2019t do it.Anything that\u2019s ever been worthwhile has never been easy.That\u2019s also why IF you do decide to write amazing long-form content, you will end up reaping the rewards of it.Don\u2019t get discouraged!The first few times you post are not going to get you anywhere.But let\u2019s say you\u2019re reading this article a few months later after you\u2019ve already published a couple posts. It\u2019s not too late to re-purpose those posts and keep the benefit going.Find the posts that have gotten the most traction.Find the posts on your site that have done the best for you as a blogger. We use Google Analytics and search by landing page.Add these posts to an autoresponder for new subscribers.We use Drip to automatically send new subscribers a sequence of posts consisting of our best quality posts.Repurpose content into SlideShares.This is something that takes a while to do, which is why it\u2019s in the bonus phase. Wait until your content has died down a bit then turn it into a powerpoint slide for SlideShare. It\u2019s slow at first, but over time you can get 100s of views. I\u2019m working on this tactic currently, and my first SlideShare has gotten 71 views. Not great, but it\u2019s better than nothing and I\u2019m pretty sure it will scale as time goes on.Combine blog posts to create a killer lead magnet & then promote your lead magnet.I combined multiple blog posts in the past and turned it into one large lead magnet.Then I promoted this heavily over all the channels I just talked about. This was a tactic I did heavily at my last startup PhotoWhoa, which was a daily deals site for photographers.It was great because I didn\u2019t have to write new content, but I still got a lot of new emails. In fact we grew our email list by around 400 emails using this tactic.Here\u2019s an example lead magnet we made by combining a bunch of articles.In ConclusionContent marketing and blogging isn\u2019t just spray and pray.

It\u2019s never been easier to get an eCommerce store up and running. All someone needs is a Shopify store, Ali Express account, and the Oberlo plugin. Of course, this is the super simple version of setting up a store but you know what I mean. It\u2019s a lot easier than 10 years ago!Retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2021 (in billion U.S. dollars)(that\u2019s a lot of moola for the 12 million e-commerce stores active online according to lemonstand.com)It may be easier to create an eCommerce store these days but it\u2019s harder than ever to make your store stand out. Whether it be a drop shipped, handmade or custom manufactured product, the rules of marketing are all the same.It\u2019s fricken hard to win over someone\u2019s trust and convince them your product is the best and they should buy it from you.So why are some eCommerce store successful and other not?I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have see behind the scenes of dozens of eCommerce stores (successful and not), some doing over $100k in a day others at $100/day. The traits are similar for all the most successful store though.So, if you\u2019re involved with an eCommerce store and looking to scale, improve your ROI or position your store for a huge exit sale, make sure you these fundamentals tick off. There\u2019s 1 in particular that I\u2019m going to share some stats and figures on so you can replicate the same success.Most of the time a good eCommerce store will have.A niche that the owner or team understands in depth and is passionate aboutA great product (even better one that solves a time consuming or expensive problem)A website that converts 4\u20136% (depending on your average order value and product)Over 60% profit margin (Rev\u200a\u2014\u200aCOGS = Profit)A strong marketing team executing successful campaigns (people don\u2019t just \u201cfind\u201d you)Of course, there\u2019s a lot more that goes into this but these are some good places to start and if you can nail these 5 things, you will more than likely have a profitable eCommerce store.This article is going to focus on number 5\u200a\u2014\u200ahow to execute successful marketing campaigns to grow your revenue, email list, and customer touch points (social media).There are multiple channels, tactics, and campaigns you can use likeContent MarketingEmail MarketingPaid AdvertisingViral Marketing / Growth HackingBut I know you\u2019re probably going to want the easiest and fastest results so we\u2019re going to focus on Viral Contest Marketing.WTF is that?A contest is when a brand offers a prize in exchange for the opportunity to contact all the entrants and request actions from them.Once a person enters the contest, the brand then asks them to complete actions to earn extra entries into the contest. The more entries someone has, the higher the chance of them winning is.This incentivization includes referring others, sharing the brands content and completing any other actions that are important to the brand.Here\u2019s an example contest\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://vyper.io/c/199Here\u2019s an example leaderboard contest\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://vyper.io/c/756Case Study, Stats & Results!The case study is going to focus on the company Brevite. Which is a backpack company created specifically for photographers.The PrizeMavic DroneBackpack for PhotographersRemember, the closer aligned your prize is your target markets interests, desires and wants, the more successful your contest will be.You want people to really want to win your prize so they are willing to share the contest, refer others and complete tasks that the brand sents.What the brand requested from entrantsEmail addressA follow on social mediaShare content (retweet, Facebook share, re-gram etc)Doesn\u2019t seem like a lot but, boy was it a LOT for this eCommerce store!Brevite Viral Contest MetricsInvestment: $3k (prize, ads etc.)Campaign length: 15 daysSign up conversion rate: ~65%Email GrowthStarting email list: 1,700Emails gathered: 41,000Emails harvested: 36,000 (after cleaning list)Around $0.08 an email address (clean emails)Social Media Growth6,300 followers on Instagram3,079 followers on Twitter4,954 page likes on FacebookThese stats do not even take into account the follow-up sales from all of these collected emails.Not many case studies will go into this amount of depth, so we want to thank Brevite for sharing their numbers.So now you know what the contest results were but how did they do it?The next section is going into how you can get similar results.Basic Contest Promotion Strategies:Choose a really good prize that aligns with your target audience.Share the contest constantly on social channels & in groups.Add the contest to your website. (use a banner or VYPER\u2019s CTA chat feature\u200a\u2014\u200aexample)Email your list multiple times.Send email updates on the contest (examples below)Announce the launch of contestFirst week, announce top 5 entrant scoresHalfway, new prizes addedNew bonus entry addedDouble points on all bonus entries for the next 48 hours7 days to go, keep sharing & collecting entries48 hours, time is running out24 hours, last chance contest endingSubmit to giveaway directories\u200a\u2014\u200aList HereDesign really good share images so when all the entrants in the contest share it to earn entries others are interested.Advanced Contest Promotion Strategies:If you\u2019re partnering up, get the other company to share your contest.their social mediatheir social channelsadd to their websiteCreate a YouTube video on how to do something, a product review or unboxing then link to your contest.Get influences to share the giveaway.You can purchase a shout outCall in a favor from friends, family or co-workersPitch that they have a high chance to win the contest due to their large audience.Buy ads on Reddit, Facebook, Instagram etcBonus Tip\u200a\u2014\u200aIncentivize people who enter your contest by giving them additional contest entries for liking, sharing and commenting on your ads. This increases your ad quality score due to high engagement and will generate better results.Pay or partner up with a publication or niche authorities. Get them to share your contest with their (usually cost is a CPM, CPC or Cost per lead):Email listFacebook groupSlack groupForumAnswer Quora questions on your niche and link to your contest.E.g. Brevite could answer questions about drones and link to their contest to win one.These strategies for promoting a contest are all optional.You can choose to do all of them, one of them or even none of them, either way when you start your contest, remember you get out what you put in!So, the more work you put into promoting a contest the better the results are going to be!You can run a contest and just tell your direct audience and they will refer their friends, family, and co-workers. The contest will still get some good results but the more people you put your contest in front of, the better your results will be.So, if you\u2019re looking for a new, innovative way to collect emails, get more followers and build your business, head over to VYPER!Have a contest of your own?

It\u2019s a place where you can get a lot of traffic for nothing except your time. Reddit gets 150 MILLION pageviews per month, so needless to say you can get TONS of free traffic.At the same time, Reddit is one of those places where self-promotion is very frowned upon. Any kind of marketing is frowned upon unless you put a VERY detailed and delicate touch to your posts. If you learn how to do that, you can promote your stuff without getting your posts deleted and without getting banned.I\u2019ve gotten my stuff deleted many times in the past. I can\u2019t even tell you how many times I\u2019ve gotten messages like the one below.If you\u2019re new to Reddit, you need to first familiarize yourself with the platform. This is probably one of the harder parts of promoting with this channel because it\u2019s like its own society with its own rules and markup language and lingo. This article by Mashable gives a great overview, so please take a read and learn the ins and outs of the platform before you try to utilize it.And note that Reddit is a LONG TERM channel. It\u2019s not something you can just do quickly. So don\u2019t expect to master Reddit marketing overnight just like you can\u2019t master Facebook ads overnight. Any channel that is worth it will be a channel that requires hard work, dedication, and a lot of trial and error.But once you\u2019ve become an adopted member of its society, you can really leverage it for tons of traffic. Here\u2019s a quick step-by-step rundown of how to make it work.1. Spend a whole month just posting on subreddits related to your niche, get 50+\u00a0karma.There\u2019s a subreddit for every topic. A lot of times there are multiple subreddits. Find the ones related to your brand and start getting as active as possible. Look for subreddits with over 50,000 members, as these will get you the most bang for your buck. If your niche doesn\u2019t have any of these subreddits, then just look for the ones that are as active as possible.You need to get some karma so Reddit knows you\u2019re not just on there to plug your thing and leave. Karma happens when you contribute meaningfully to discussions on the platform and it\u2019s a very organic thing. So don\u2019t just go on there and post one-word answers. You need to provide as much value as possible. What I like to do is to go into subreddits where I know a lot about the topic (like /r/entrepreneur) and just answer all the questions with deep meaningful answers.I\u2019ve read a lot of posts on the web that karma doesn\u2019t matter. Actually it does. The more karma you have the more legitimate your account seems and it\u2019ll prevent users from posting stuff saying you just came in here to spam your link and then leave.So DO try to get some karma, however, you don\u2019t need thousands of karma to make it work. Once you\u2019ve got some karma, maybe like 30\u201350ish karma, you\u2019re ready to actually promote your stuff.Also note that during this time there should not be a HINT of marketing at all in your posts. Just contribute as much as possible to the community and really learn the ins and outs of every subreddit. Note the patterns of what gets upvoted to the top, what gets downvotes, what elicits a negative reaction, and what elicits a positive reaction.2. Befriend mods/admins with an incentive, then ask them to post for\u00a0you.Go to the mod list which appears in every subreddit (usually appears in the bottom right corner of every subreddit). Direct message some of the guys on there and tell them that you\u2019ve been an active member and ask VERY NICELY if you can promote.Remember, it\u2019s all about positioning. Something like the following should do the trick.Hey ___,I\u2019ve been active on the subreddit for a while now, and it\u2019s been a blast. The community here really supports each other, which is rad.Before I just post something that\u2019s a little bit promotional, I wanted to ask you if it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a giveaway of my brand <XXX> and it\u2019s super relevant to the <XXX> subreddit. If it\u2019s okay with you, would you mind if I posted it? Wanted to get the okay from you first because I hate blatant spam myself.Anyways, it\u2019s been a blast contributing to this subreddit and I look forward to more awesome discussions.For an old e-commerce company I founded and sold, Winter Lotus, our team became friends with the moderator of /r/streetwear and even became a customer at his store in order to solidify our relationship. Best $50 ever sent. He posted our site on the sidebar and that generated tons of traffic for us.Getting mods to post FOR YOU works really well because the subreddit trusts them and their post is worth 10x of your own post. After the first email, you should ask them post your contest for you, and say that you\u2019re willing to give the mod a prize in return for this. Here\u2019s a sample message you could send:Awesome! You rock. Before I post it though, I was wondering if you were open to posting it for me in exchange for a copy of the prize yourself? The community trusts your word so much more, so I\u2019d be happy to give you a lifetime pro version of VYPER in exchange for that endorsement from you. Our contest can be found here: http://vyper.io/c/63. If you can\u2019t get mods to post for you, then you\u2019ll have to do it yourself.There\u2019s always a chance you\u2019re going to get deleted, so make sure what you\u2019re posting isn\u2019t violating subreddit rules. Some subreddits (like /r/startups) are super strict about self promotion so I try to do as little of it as possible in those groups. Instead I find groups that are more lenient with their policy.Here\u2019s an example of what you could post:This worked because for a couple months, Winter Lotus had been extremely active on the reddit subreddit and the community was very aware of them.Below is an example from BeardBrand, who promoted their contest on Reddit and got really good feedback. They used Imgur to host their contest image and then posted contest details in the description of the image and in the comment.4. Get upvotes from friends, but don\u2019t overdo\u00a0it.Make sure you have a group of friends that will upvote your post right after you post it. Without an initial bump right after posting, it becomes hard for your post to make the front page. Upvoting rings are discouraged on reddit, so don\u2019t do it on a mass scale, but it\u2019s pretty common practice to get a few of your friends to upvote your post right after you\u2019ve made it.Other TipsEach subreddit responds to different things. I noticed /r/entrepreneur really likes long case studies. I noticed /r/startups doesn\u2019t like blog spam, so if I ever post there I always post the entire contents of my blog with links out to other content. Some subreddits only like images through imgur. The list goes on.If you get no traction on your posts, STUDY the top posts in your subreddit. See exactly what they\u2019re doing and try to replicate it. This is why I know that case studies work for /r/entrepreneurMake sure you\u2019re keeping track of time vs reward. This is why I advise you to focus on the bigger subreddits to really gain traction within their community and befriend the community heads. On the other hand, you can do more of a \u201cspray and pray\u201d approach to smaller subreddits because it then becomes a quantity over quality approach. Expect to get some posts deleted, but continue being as genuine as possible and you\u2019ll get a few posts to stick (especially in less strict subreddits).", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Case Study: How a Viral Leaderboard Contest Generated 7k B2B Leads & 8k Social Followers", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/case-study-how-a-viral-leaderboard-contest-generated-7k-b2b-leads-8k-social-followers-1b90b7da27cf?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 22, 2017", "readtime": "11 min read", "upvotes": "1", "content": "Case Study: How a Viral Leaderboard Contest Generated 7k B2B Leads & 8k Social FollowersVYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 22, 2017Summary\u200a\u2014\u200aThis post is going to give you all the information/tasks you need to run a successful viral leaderboard contest to collect a ton of high-quality email leads and grow your social following faster than any other marketing strategy.We were told time and time again that SaaS and B2B are two things that don\u2019t mix when it comes to running contests and giveaways, heck those two things don\u2019t work using most marketing strategies.Contests and giveaway campaigns have been super successful for our eCommerce clients and users but using them for B2B and SaaS companies was like pulling teeth. The excitement, engagement and viral lift were just not present for these types of businesses.So we looked back on all our B2B marketing efforts and made a list of strategies for growing email lists. We highlighted a few of them and the issues we ran into.These were a few strategies we tried.Content marketing / blogging (too slow)Guest blogging and podcasts (way too time intense)Webinars (too much time investment and setup cost, people wanted fast results)Direct response lead gen ads on Adwords, Facebook, Twitter etc. (too expensive)Cold emailing (super boring and time-consuming)We tried all of the above methods at some point in our B2B digital marketing journey but never really found the sweet spot in quality, cost and quantity.So we thought, F**K it, lets build our own badass contest that works better than any other acquisition strategy, does what we want and makes the customer as happy as the brand/business owner. EASY, YEAH!Here is the link to the viral leaderboard contest we created\u200a\u2014\u200avisit contest (btw it is closed so you can\u2019t enter but you can see the landing page and how it worked and generated over 7k emails for us).Download: Our key takeaways and learnings from running this viral leaderboard contest!The birth of the Leaderboard ContestWe took everything we knew about viral + contests + acquisition and growth and put it all into 1 viral leaderboard contest tool! This took a fricken long time but we got there and once we build the beta version it was time to test!Below are all the details from our test contest that generated these listed results within 20 days! Not bad\u00a0;)Results from our test leaderboard contest:Emails Collected 7,000+Instagram Followers gained 850+Facebook Group Growth 350+ (we started at ground 0 pretty much)New Twitter Followers 3,000+New Pinterest followers 2,500+New YouTube Subscribers 550 (we were not expecting this!)To be honest we were a little disappointed as we had set a goal of acquiring 10k emails from this contest, this was factoring in 20\u201330% of those emails being spam or unusable.Once the contest ended, we ran the exported list though www.edq.com and discovered that only 12% of the emails were rubbish. SUCCESS! Not as bad as we had thought.We have seen some B2C niches collect a ton more emails but had 20\u201330% of them be spam so we were pretty happy with this.Not only did the leaderboard contest limit spam but it had a super high email engagement rate when we sent out contest updates like \u201chalf way\u201d and \u201cending soon\u201d notifications!Reflecting on the above we learned that our leaderboard was able to collect quality emails due to the engagement, cheater detection and nature of the contest prizes! Consider this when choosing a service to use for your contests (quality over quantity if possible)!A few things we learned from our test contest80/20 rules applies, we collected 80 of our emails in the last week.Engagement and competitiveness is awesome. By adding the entrant\u2019s avatar, number of points and leaderboard rank we were able to get people visiting their thankyou/share/dashboard page multiple times throughout the contest.Offer something epic but not too epic. We had a lot of people question if our contest was real due to the size of the prize. It is super important to make your prizes relevant to the crowd you want to attract.Support, support, support. Make sure you take the time to answer questions from entrants and the better the relationship the more they will share your contest.Our Facebook group was the most active it had ever been during the contest. Use these group settings to create a community and build relationships!By using a number of prize redemption options we were able to involve everyone who entered our contest. We offered prizes for top 5 leaderboard rankings, number of points collected (prize received after collecting 150 entry points) and random winner draw (anyone could win, even last place has a chance!).We wish we had launched the contest with the random winner reward. We only introduced it half way through the contest and I think we lost a lot of early entrants who did not want to compete for top spot!How We Did ItThe easiest way to explain this is to break it down into steps. This was for our SaaS company so is probably a little more complicated/harder that your usual eCommerce or content website.IdeationPrize/Reward (partners)Building the contestPromotionFollow-upYou can jump to any section that you may be at but I suggest you read through all the steps to make the most of your contest marketing campaign. Learn from our mistakes, it will save you a ton of time and money\u00a0;)Step ONE\u200a\u2014\u200aIdeationThis is pretty much what we discussed above, most companies go through a stage of considering/arguing what the best marketing tactic for them is. This can be in any of the forms listed at the start of this post, I \u2018m sure there are also more options!We obviously went with viral contests as our marketing strategy to grow our email list and social accounts.Next, we had to think:Who do we want to attract?What do those people like?Where do they hangout?We identified our target marketing and then came up with a number of prizes to get people interested in entering our contest. Our magic offer was lifetime subscriptions to other complimentary SaaS products, what business owner doesn\u2019t love FREE lifetime subscriptions?We then broke down the prizes into:Rank 1st, 2nd and top 5 (highest value, hard to achieve)Number of entry points collected (lowest value, easy to achieve)Random Draw (medium value, requires luck to achieve)Once we had the reward tiers planned out we focused on finding products to offer for these tiers.Step TWO\u200a\u2014\u200aPrize/Reward (partners)There are a few options when it comes to what to offer. The main prize is usually the product of the company or something complimentary that they purchase as an investment to the contest.E.g.\u00a0A gym might offer a membership or a year\u2019s worth of protein powder.\u00a0Or an online shoe retailer might offer 1 pair of shoes or a running magazine subscription.We decided to go the other way and find the top companies our target market wanted to use. For example, we wanted to get the interest of people who used Clickfunnels, MeetEdgar, MixMax, PipeDrive and a few other SaaS subscriptions.People will have a ton of articles and BS published on automating the outreach but if you just spend the time building the relationship and genuinely offering value, you don\u2019t need the automation for what we were doing.Take the time in selection and crafting your emails and your close rate will be 100x higher than any automation you can do.Out of all the people we contacted to partner with for this contest about 80% of them said yes.Here is the email we used to propose the leaderboard contest partnership.Once you have a relationship with the people you want to partner with it becomes a lot easier to promote and get feedback on your contest. Plus the benefit to this was also the follow-up partnerships in the form of joint deals, case studies and cross promotions.Of course we used a few tools in this process to remind us to follow up and keep organized. We aren\u2019t super hero\u2019s!Tools\u200a\u2014\u200aMixMax, Google Sheets, Rapportive Chrome extensionStep THREE\u200a\u2014\u200aBuilding giveawayNow that we had a number of partners to help buff up our prize pool, our contest was looking pretty good. We had enough partners on board to fill out all our reward tiers and make them pretty impressive.The next step was the setup of the actual contest. Since we used our own tool VYPER the actual build out of the contest was super quick.A few things to note when creating your contest:Always create separate sharing images for each social channel, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest all need their own sizing.Set an appropriate time frame and make sure you include some solid T&C\u2019s. Between 2\u20136 weeks are good contest lengths. Evergreen contests are also amazing but we will go into that another day!Make the prizes super obvious so people know what they can win and remind people how to win. E.g. On the contest page include a subtitle like \u201cFill in your name, email and start sharing to collect points to win!\u201d.Use images and video when possible. Most people hate reading or do not have time to do it. Use images, dot points, video and anything else you can to make the message faster and easier to understand! (I know, you are probably thinking what a hypocrite. He is making me read a 2,000+ word case study but telling me not use a lot of text!)Add your GA, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and any other code or tracking tags to your contest. You want that data! It is just as important as the email address!Here is a quick video tutorial on how to build a leaderboard contest:As I mentioned before, this part of your contest is actually one of the easiest. Just make sure to cross off the basics.We also designed and built VYPER with conversion optimized in mind so the templates have been built to get you the best conversion rates!Step FOUR\u200a\u2014\u200aPromotionThis is a make or break step! Promoting your contest is just as important as creating it. A good prize and traffic source is key for generating tons of emails and new followers.FREE Download: 17 ways to promote your contest to make it go viral!Let\u2019s break it down by days so you can see exactly what we did:Day 1\u20133Promoted the shit out of it to personal networks (friends, colleges & family) first.Publish a blog post announcing the launch of the contest.Post to all of your own social channels every 2\u20133 days. Tag your partners if possible to spread some love.Posted in Facebook groups (ask the admins first, here is a post on that).Post in other communities like Slack, inbound.org, growthhacker.com etc.Post within niche specific forums (Warrior Forum, Sitepoint and Blackhat World are a few for B2B).Submit your contest to appropriate giveaway sites, popular one is the sub-reddit /giveaways.Run ads to get the ball rolling, remember that the leaderboard is viral so it has a snowball effect so you need to start strong. A few common networks are Facebook (easiest), LinkedIn (most expensive), Reddit (hardest), Twitter (most effective for B2B).Day 3\u20135Work with you partners, get them to share the contest on social and to their newsletter/email list if possible. We tried to get all partners to do this so there would be a benefit for everyone, the cross exposure was fantastic and all partners were exposed to new potential customers.Try and get featured on other people\u2019s blogs and industry leading websites (PR).Reach out to content curators that may be interested in sharing the contest with their audience.Day 5\u201310Send out reminder emails for entrants to keep sharing (we did halfway point and a few days before contest ended but you could send more).Repost to some of those communities if possible to give an update on the contest. For example, we introduced some new partner\u2019s half way through. Which allowed us to resubmit and update a lot of our original promotion channels.Stay engaged with support and updates on the contest to people who have entered. (Make sure to add your contact details (support email) somewhere on your thank you page)Follow up with partners to see if they have posted to social or send out an email to their audience.Day 10\u201320You are nearly there, keep going.Support and questions (a lot of this came through our website live chat as mentioned before).Keep posting to your own social channels.Send out an email to everyone who has entered. Announce that they have 1 more week to collect points to win the grand prize.By this stage, the viral leaderboard contest should be doing most of the work for you. You should now have enough entrants referring others to keep those new emails and social follows rolling in!Step FIVE\u200a\u2014\u200aFollow UpThis step is one of the most important, you need to do a few things here to finish strong.Thank everyone for entering.Provide one final piece of value (we offered exclusive offers to our partner tools).Thank your partners.Send your winners their prizes and connect them to the contest partners if needed. Try and do this as soon as possible!Use all your leads by entering them into a value add email drip or send them further follow up offers.We found that our list was extremely engaged as we had some huge open and click through rates on our contest updates and follow up series around 40\u201350% as you saw above on the contest update emails.We also tied this into the launch of our viral leaderboard contest tool which everyone had seen a live demo of now. This really helped spread the awareness of our product launch!Final TakeawaysWe learnt a ton about SaaS and B2B acquisition from this test. We did see a lower volume of entrants compared to other B2C contests that we had run in the past but our final B2B list was much more engaged and of higher quality. Hard to say if this was due to the niche or if it was to do with the higher engaged leaderboard contest type\u200a\u2014\u200ai\u2019m going with the latter\u00a0;).If you are to only remember one thing from this case study it should be:Plan out your marketing campaign and identify what your goal is, if it is email leads and brand exposure consider viral leaderboard contests as they worked a lot better for us in terms of cost and scalability compared to other strategies.Let us know if you have any questions about this campaign, here is a link to the viral leaderboard contest demo and here you can try it out on our free trial.Here is also a link to all our YouTube videos which show you how to setup contests in under 10min!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "3 Unusual Hacks to Grow Your Email List to 7500 in 30\u00a0Days!", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/3-unusual-hacks-to-grow-your-email-list-to-7500-in-30-days-3d38d4574f0a?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 28, 2017", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "1", "content": "3 Unusual Hacks to Grow Your Email List to 7500 in 30\u00a0Days!VYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 28, 2017Summary\u200a\u2014\u200aAre you the average marketer or the guy working smarter not harder? Well Carlos from Pourfection Coffee decided to be the latter and share his story of collecting 7,500 emails using a VYPER leaderboard contest. He sent this post to us to publish as he was so excited with the results he just wanted to share it with others.A lion and a cheater make a\u00a0betOne day a lion and a cheater were hanging out. They were both so fed up with hunting zebras, and both knew there had to be an easier way to eat.So they decided to make a bet to see which one could capture the most zebras.Both got to work immediately.The lion frantically searched for the finest grass the savannah had to offer. He then put signs up at all the watering holes promoting discounts on fresh green grass at the lion\u2019s den for the first 50 zebras. The result?750 ZEBRAS FOR HIM AND HIS PRIDE TO EAT!A feat that was unheard of.Meanwhile the Cheater decided to take a smarter approach. He decided that he should giveaway all the finest grass in his inventory for FREE.All you had to do to win was to be present at his cave at the time he announced the winner.But the catch was, if a zebra bought a friend, they would get an extra entry point to the grass contest, which increased the chances of them winning all the grass!The result of the cheetah\u2019s campaign?\u2026 7,500 ZEBRAS!!!10X the lion\u2019s campaign! He had so much zebra that he and his pack never went hungry again and had enough to give back to the hyenas.The lion was furious and accused him of being a cheetah! Ba Dum Tisss! (Sorry I had to)So what does this dumb story actually mean to you and your business?It means that if you\u2019re just beginning or looking to inject growth into your email list you can go about it one of two ways.Use a traditional method: Create a lead magnet, run ads to your site, get people to download said lead magnet, hope they find value and share it.Give them an offer they would be stupid to refuse and incentivize them to share it like mad men using VYPER\u2019s Leaderboard contest for example.We at XFection decided the latter and went from literally less than 100 subscribers to 0ver 7,500 engaged subscribers in 30 days! All while increasing our social media accounts by 1500%.If option 2 sounds a bit more appealing to you, good, keep reading. We are going to give you all of our secrets.WARNING: Following the contents of this article will make your competitors accuse you of being a cheetah. (Ok seriously last time)1. Twitter Growth\u00a0Hack!Here\u2019s what you do:Use the social media automated features to work for you by adding hashtags in the Twitter Snippet.When people Tweet from the backend of the contest to gain points these hashtags will allow your message to trend.So whenever users on Twitter search #starbucks, or #coffee the likelihood our Twitter page and contest would be discovered increases.The post looked as follows.

How to leveraged thumbnail images to work for\u00a0you!We already knew that people were going to be sharing our post left and right, so we were proactive to use this to our advantage to maximize the amount of attention it would gain.We did this by using an attention grabbing image. (See above Twitter post)Everything from the red coffee cup and text, to the girl sitting on top of the cup, the image stands out!And the results show for it.Just on Twitter, we gained 1,353 follows about a 1500% improvement.Talk about powerful\u2026Although this traffic is good and you can control it; it isn\u2019t YOUR traffic.This is why transferring this traffic into real emails so you own the traffic FOREVER is so important.And this brings me to my next point.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aTwitter and Pinterest do not limit your images to 20% text unlike Facebook so take advantage of that.3. Influencing Instagram Influencers\u2026 Influentially\u2026This is the magic bullet that took our list from 1,000 emails to 5,000 pretty much overnight.This hack probably takes the most amount of work, but trust me, it\u2019s completely WORTH IT!Here\u2019s the #1 key to influencers \ud83d\udc49 PROVIDE VALUE!It sounds simple because it is!Yet, too many people reach out to influencers expecting the world for doing nothing in return.Sometimes you can simply offer a sample of your product or some swag. In most cases people are going to want you to Venmo them or send gift cards.$10 Starbucks gift card for exposure to 15k coffee lovers? Yes please!Our steps were as follows:1. Find AccountsCoffee related pages with appropriate number of followers (ours were 5K\u200a\u2014\u200a100k) were our bread and butter. Anything less wasn\u2019t worth our time and anything over 100K was out of budget. Side note here\u200a\u2014\u200aengagement is critical!You don\u2019t want to waste your time and money on accounts that don\u2019t get the eyeballs. You want at least 10% of engagement to follower count.2. Direct MessageOnce you find a page with good followers and engagement you need to DM them and say something along the lines of:\u201cHey _____, \u2764\ufe0f your posts! We are a nootropic coffee creamer company and are giving away a year\u2019s supply of coffee to a couple of lucky people\u2026.

I worked so hard to get them there and I just don\u2019t want to annoy them or lose them\u201d.That\u2019s one of the most popular questions I\u2019ve gotten about email marketing ever since I started CopyMonk.It\u2019s a valid concern, of course.You don\u2019t want to ruin your relationship with your subscribers and burn out your list, especially since it\u2019s the lifeblood of your business.So the usual advice to avoid this is to limit the number of emails that you send and only send an email when you have some sort of sale going.However, there\u2019s a better way.It\u2019s totally possible to send out send out an email to your list every single day with a link to your product without being pushy or salesy.In fact, your subscribers will love you even more for doing so.You just need to know how to do it the right way by writing \u201cCopyMonk-Style\u201d emails. And one of the core principles of writing CopyMonk-style emails is the 90/10 rule.What Is The 90/10\u00a0Rule?The most important part of email marketing is to find a way to be a \u201cwelcomed guest\u201d in your subscribers inbox.With everyone\u2019s inbox so flooded these days, mostly with promotional offers, it\u2019s hard to stand out. Heck, many people even have 2 email addresses. One for \u201cspam\u201d and one for personal use.If you just write emails like everyone else, you\u2019ll be hated\u2026 or even worse, ignored.So what you want to do is create the expectation that all of your emails are worthwhile to open. And you do that by following the 90/10 rule.Without rambling on about it, the 90/10 rule is about the basic format of your emails as well as you email strategy.You want the majority of your emails to be 90% content and 10% promotional. You also want 90% of all the emails you send to follow this 90/10 rule, with the other 10% being purely promotional.Of course, it doesn\u2019t need to literally be 90/10. It can be 80/20 or even 95/5. The point is, you\u2019re delivering content while just mentioning your product when it\u2019s relevant in every email.The Catch? \u201cHow-To\u201d Content Will Kill Your\u00a0Results!I had to write this section because it\u2019s the biggest mistake people make once they finally \u201cget\u201d the whole 90/10 rule thing.You see, while the 90 in the 90/10 rule does mean 90% content\u2026 it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s all 100% educational, how-to content.If you\u2019re only sending an email a week or less, then that\u2019s fine. In that situation, you\u2019ll probably be best suited to hit them hard with actionable value.But if you\u2019re going to write emails at a higher frequency, like you should be if you want to maximize your results, you\u2019re not going to get away with traditional \u201chow-to\u201d content.Why?Because traditional \u201chow-to\u201d content is actually boring. Sure, your list will love it for the first 2 weeks, but then they\u2019ll start ignoring it.It\u2019s like that boring teacher back in highschool.He\u2019s super smart and will teach you a ton of stuff, but within 15 minutes of class starting, you\u2019re already in the perfect position to take a power nap.However, an exciting teacher will be the complete opposite. Yea, you\u2019ll learn all of the same stuff in the same time span. But this time, you\u2019re awake, attentive, and probably even enjoying yourself a bit.You see, content itself is not valuable.Only the experience of consuming and using that content is valuable.So instead of writing just boring \u201chow-to\u201d content all the time, what you want to do is to start writing \u201cinfotainment-style\u201d content.That\u2019s when you combine both educational content with entertainment so that it\u2019s easier and more enjoyable to consume.Kind of like when people put cheese on their broccoli. It just makes the experience a lot better than if it was just the broccoli.The Easy Way To Write Highly Valuable, \u201cInfotainment-Style\u201d Email\u00a0ContentThousands of years ago, before writing was invented, we used to share information in a particular way.This particular form of communication was used to pass down all sorts of important information including things like morals, religion, culture, and more.It was ideal since it was so easy to remember things this way and was naturally captivating to anyone who listened to it. In fact, you can say we\u2019ve been hard-wired to both consume and share information this way.Best of all, it works with everyone.So what is this mysterious way to share information?Stories.See what I did there?The best way to write \u201cinfotainment-style\u201d content for your list is by educating people by telling them a story that contains the valuable content within it. Not only that, but stories also make the content seem more valuable than it would normally seem like, but that\u2019s a story for another day.For today, I want to direct you to particular type of story\u2026 personal stories.While there are a ton of ways to write stories, the easiest and fastest way to get started is by writing about personal stories that relate to the content you\u2019re really trying to get across.For example, lets say I\u2019m selling sports supplements.I could just write emails about the 5 reasons why whey protein is so important for muscle recovery and muscle building. However, that\u2019s a bit boring.Instead, it would be a lot better to talk about the last time I was struggling to build muscle and a bodybuilder at the gym told me that the reason I wasn\u2019t getting results was because I wasn\u2019t consuming enough protein.Then from there, I could go on about how I asked this guy why it mattered and how I confirmed advice after scowering the web to see if he was right.THEN I would talk about the 5 reasons the guy talked about.As you can see, writing emails this way is a lot more interesting as you\u2019re not relying on boring content. If fact, everything that you teach with a personal story will automatically become interesting.How To Effectively Sell Your Product In The Last 10% Of Your\u00a0EmailSo here we are, the most important part of your email.Fortunately, if you did everything else right, this is also the easiest part of your email.That\u2019s because you\u2019re not hard-selling anything. Instead, you\u2019re going to use the same tactic David Ogilvy, probably the most popular advertiser ever, used to sell billions of dollars worth of products.You see, David Ogilvy is considered the father of \u201csoft-selling\u201d.What\u2019s that? Well, that\u2019s basically when you sell something without pushing it. Almost always, it\u2019s just a mention of your relevant product or service.The most famous example of this was with the house ads David Ogilvy wrote to promote his ad agency, Ogilvy & Mather. They were wildly successful leading, so they led to lots of copycat ads.If you notice the very bottom right of his ad, he talks about Ogilvy & Mather, but doesn\u2019t pressure you into becoming a client.In fact, in his case, he doesn\u2019t sell you on it at all. He says the only ones who gain access to all his other great content are his clients.So if you liked his ad, then you would naturally want to become a client to find out more.Now, in the case of your email, we\u2019re not going to be so \u201csoft\u201d about it either. You\u2019re still selling your product. The difference is that you want to tell people why they should buy your product in just a couple of sentences.Anymore then that is too hard and anything less then that is not hard enough. You want to be in that \u201cgoldilocks\u201d area during this part of your email.Do this every email and your list will never mind it. In fact, they\u2019ll probably love you for it since you\u2019re making it easy for them to buy something if they\u2019re interested.An Example Of The 90/10 Rule In Action From CopyMonk\u00a0DailySince this whole 90/10 rule is probably new to you, it would be best to actually see a real example of this.So I\u2019m going to show you 1 example from CopyMonk daily, which is my daily email marketing newsletter for business owners.Notice how I use story to ultimately teach something and then pivot into a sale without ever being pushy or salesy.Check this out:In this email, I\u2019m talking about what happened in a particular episode of Nathan For You. You can read the email for all the details, but realize how you don\u2019t see me teach anything until I\u2019ve given it context by talking about the show.Then, I end the email with a call to action to my product.In this case, I\u2019m connecting my educational content with something I teach inside my course, This builds curiosity and leads to an easy and non-spammy transition from content to promotion.Like I said, this is my daily newsletter. So I write emails like this to my list every single day. Yet, even though I sell in every email, people love getting my emails.ConclusionMost business owners suck at email marketing.Fortunately, if you follow the advice in this article, you\u2019ll be a lot better off. Not only will you sell more products, but you\u2019ll also build a deep relationship with your list at the same time.Now that\u2019s what you call a win-win.With that said, If you want a 100% free, 1-page checklist that summarizes my entire CopyMonk methodology to writing emails, then click here.Danavir is the founder of CopyMonk, where he helps business owners double their sales with email marketing.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How to Generate More Revenue (Not Just Leads) With Viral\u00a0Contests", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-generate-more-revenue-not-just-leads-with-viral-contests-f941034366c0?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 5, 2017", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "1", "content": "How to Generate More Revenue (Not Just Leads) With Viral\u00a0ContestsVYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 5, 2017There\u2019s a misconception people have about viral contests\u200a\u2014\u200athey believe that these contests can only be used for lead generation.Well, I\u2019m here to shatter that notion and tell you that our clients have been making tons of revenue during their viral contest by implementing a few key strategies.And while you can create several different types of viral contests (like viral sweepstakes or viral leaderboards), we\u2019ll focus on the viral leaderboard because it\u2019s new and it\u2019s been getting incredible results for our clients.So what is the viral leaderboard?It\u2019s a type of contest where your users will climb a \u201cleaderboard\u201d in order to win prizes. They climb the leaderboard by getting points, namely through referring others to the contest or by following you on social media. So for example, your contestant might get 25 points for following you on Instagram.If that\u2019s a bit confusing, try signing up for our demo leaderboard here.What are the benefits of a viral leaderboard?Generate cheap leads\u200a\u2014\u200aThe cost to get someone\u2019s attention and acquire an email address is constantly increasing. Depending on the industry, you can be paying between $3\u20135 an email. Using contests rewards users for giving you that information as well as incentivizes them to refer others. We\u2019ve seen leads come very cheaply with viral contests.Build a larger social following\u200a\u2014\u200aYou don\u2019t wanna be paying for fake followers. The viral leaderboard makes it easy to generate a larger social following by incentivizing the follow in exchange for extra \u201cpoints\u201d in the contest. In fact, we used a viral leaderboard contest to add 550 new YouTube subscribers, one of the hardest networks to build followers on.Increase sales volume\u200a\u2014\u200aContests are not just for acquiring email addresses. You can also use them to drive more sales on time of entry using unique coupon offers as well as nurture those leads into customers. On average it takes 2\u20134 brand interactions before a purchase is considered.Increase brand awareness\u200a\u2014\u200aNothing works better than word of mouth. Using contests is a great way to get a large amount of exposure for your brand. As entrants share your contest with friends and family they \u201cendorsing\u201d you brand and essentially recommend you to their friends and family to check out.Build audiences for advertising (Facebook custom audiences & lookalikes)\u200a\u2014\u200aFacebook is now one of the best marketing channels the web has to offer. If can be expensive and hard to get started though. Facebook will then go and find the people who are most alike to that list for you to then serve ads to.One of the first things you MUST think about when you create your leaderboard, is what prize structure you want to offer. An optimized prize structure can make or break your contest.How to use a tiered rewards system to maximize your\u00a0resultsIt is a good idea to offer multiple ways for entrants to be rewarded. This keeps people engaged and helps keep them motivated to continue sharing your contest. There are 3 main reward types that are most common.Placement rewards\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is when a contest rewards the entrants that performed the best. For example \u201c1st place wins a $500 Swiss watch or Top 5 entrants win a $100 watch stand.\u201d This is the CRUX of your leaderboard. Get people competing to get the top rewards.Points rewards\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is when a contest rewards entrants for reaching a certain number of points. For example \u201cunlock a 20% OFF entire store voucher when you reach 200 points.\u201d This one is important because even if the new user is super far away from the top of the leaderboard, they\u2019re still incentivized to get points.Random draw rewards\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is a more generic reward type and this is just a winner chosen at random. Adding a random draw just gives even more incentive to your entrant to share the contest and get more points.So now you can see there are a few different ways to get people involved in your contest. The most important part is to make your contestants feel good, give them points, reward them and congratulate them.Setting Up Multiple RewardsFrontend Rewards DisplayLittle do they know you are warming them up for your ultimate monetization strategy.BONUS Checklist\u200a\u2014\u200a6 Common Success Factors From Over 10 Viral Contests!

Use the wording \u201cget a promo card\u201d or something similar. Then send an email with an image of a fancy card with the coupon code on it instead. This increases the perceived value of the coupon. (Make them feel like they won something special).** We recommend giving them a smaller reward as a \u201cpoint reward\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200alike $10\u200a\u2014\u200awhen they reach 100 points. We found $10 \u201cpromo cards\u201d work really really well VS a $10 off discount. Just think about it\u200a\u2014\u200awhen was the last time you threw away a gift card and when was the last time you threw away a \u201c$10 off coupon?\u201d You NEVER throw away gift cards! However, you forget about or throw away discount codes all the time.Remind your contestants to share to get more points\u200a\u2014\u200aSend them a sequence of follow-up emails to get them to keep sharing the contest in order to get more points. Hit them also through social media. The more people you collect the bigger the follow-up email paycheck will be.Make a super high discount for people that reach a really high number of points\u200a\u2014\u200aFor example say a user gets 100 points per referral. Give them an 80% discount if they get to 10,000 entries. Getting emails of 100 people will probably worth that amount of money. Remember at the end you will be doing a follow-up email trying to convert all these people.Contest follow up email\u200a\u2014\u200aAt the end of the contest you can send out an email thanking everyone for entering, and that the winners have been drawn. Also put together a special deal for entrants only like a custom coupon code or a \u201cbuy 1 get 1 free\u201d deal. We wrote a blog post just on this topic here.Educational email sequence\u200a\u2014\u200aYou may be selling a higher ticket item, so ease your way into the sale by sending 2\u20133 value-add educational emails first. You could start off with a few emails on why they need your product. Highlight that they entered the original contest for a reason, they already wanted your product. It might just take a few more convincing emails to convert them.Company update emails\u200a\u2014\u200aNow that you have the contest entrants\u2019 emails, send them an update when you have news about your latest products.Gift/purchase idea emails\u200a\u2014\u200aIf you contest was not a good fit for a direct sales, suggest that they purchase for their parents / friends!Holiday deals emails\u200a\u2014\u200aIf your product is seasonal, now you have a huge list to alert every time New Years, Christmas, Mother\u2019s Day, etc comes around! Start off your high season strong with a warmed up audience that already knows about you and your product.Birthday offer emails\u200a\u2014\u200aSince you can collect more data for a contestant to enter why not ask their DOB, so when their birthday comes up you send them a special offer. They can either claim it as a gift to themselves or share it with someone who will buy it for them\u00a0;)For a more in-depth article on maximizing your email revenue, click here.tl:dr\u200a\u2014\u200aTips on how to monetize your viral contests:Use unique coupons for that contest onlyFollow-up emails asking your contestants to share, being specific HELPSChoose relevant prizes to your target audience (You want to attract the right crowd)Add consolation prizes (so everyone wins)Increase the perceived value as much as possible (what does not cost you a lot of money but is very valuable to others).

People love a free book (and knowledge!) so a book giveaway contest was a great way to engage people.This also ensures them a steady flow of intellectual content to their email inboxes, and getting that intellectual content is basically why they signed up to enter the contest in the first place.We found Vyper via Product Hunt and the giveaway setup was super easy!The promotion strategy we used for your giveawayThe only promotion we did was announcing the book giveaway through all of our social media channels as well as our already-existing email list.Having sent out an announcement out through our current email list sounds counterintuitive but we thought maybe the existing subscribers might forward to friends, or even want to enter themselves and then post the contest on their own social media channels to obtain more entries and get discovered by friends.Having sent out an announcement out through our current email list sounds counterintuitive but we thought maybe the existing subscribers might forward to friends, or even want to enter themselves and then post the contest on their own social media channels to obtain more entries and get discovered by friends.We really didn\u2019t have to do much promotion or our giveaway at all!The before and after results (use as many images as possible, people love them and can share them) traffic leads sales inquiries etcWe ran the giveaway for a limited time using the VYPER countdown timer and saw a 125% increase in our email entire email list size from a single giveaway.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "How Foundr Magazine 2x\u2019d Their Email Acquisition Goal Using\u00a0VYPER", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-foundr-magazine-2xd-their-email-acquisition-goal-using-vyper-e5eac4885fb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 19, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "1", "content": "How Foundr Magazine 2x\u2019d Their Email Acquisition Goal Using\u00a0VYPERVYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 19, 2018Building an email list is always a top priority when it comes to building an audience/business online.

[Here]1.Why did you decide to run a\u00a0contest?We were launching a new training product and wanted to run a competition to build some excitement, anticipation, and ideally a great list of people who would be interested in the new course.Build some hype outside of our e-mail list. People can get overwhelmed with email marketing. I loved the idea that a competition allowed people to buy-in to the idea. They want to get involved and so I was hoping to get people highly engaged through a competition.Wanted to get at least another 5,000 emails onto our list that were interested in the new training.2. What expectations, KPI\u2019s and goals did you have/set for your\u00a0contest?It was hard to guess. In my head, I wanted to get at least 5,000 emails, ideally 10,000.We didn\u2019t even realize that VYPER was going to increase other areas of our business like social followers/engagement and website traffic/engagment.3. What was your proudest achievement from the campaign?For us, it would have been the engagement on a blog post. It received over 500 comments and remains one of the most popular we have ever published.This help build exposure on the post, traffic to the website and social validation through mass engagement stats! Looks great when people now naturally find the blog post.4. What alternative marketing campaigns have you tried that didn\u2019t\u00a0work?Tried other competition software that didn\u2019t have the same \u201ccustom\u201d elements as VYPER.In fact, overall they weren\u2019t as customizable and we just couldn\u2019t create such a strong result.5.

We need to do them more often.It\u2019s great to have different levels that people can unlock and trigger some rewards to keep them motivated.It\u2019s most useful, practical and powerful when designed around your goals. For example, as you taught me, having people engage on specific content. Like a Facebook dark post, or a blog post, or building up social media channels.They take effort, and you need to be excited yourself for your audience to care and get excited.Make the prize as insanely awesome as you can.7.

What would you do next time you ran a\u00a0contest?Probably same again, and make some better social media assets to promote the competition.The image used to share your contest is very important. Thousands of people are going to be sharing it across their social channels so it needs to look good!9. How did you promote your contest and what worked the best for\u00a0you?Through our email list primarily as the seed audience and then announced on our social channels.

Writer Ian Chandler emailed me after I wrote the original Reddit strategies article, and he said he could had some counters to my ideas. I invited him to get on our blog post to share his strategies.So let\u2019s hear it for Ian Chandler!Using Reddit as a marketing tactic is tricky. Few sites are as unrelenting as Reddit is. Make one wrong move, and you\u2019ll be ridiculed, or even worse, banned.But Reddit can be a potent source for brand attention. If you can get on the good side of the hivemind (more on that in a moment), it\u2019s like winning the lottery. You\u2019ll get a bunch of free publicity and tons of customers out of it.The other day, I read VYPER\u2019s post on Reddit promotion. As a narrative marketer who uses Reddit for networking, traffic, and other professional means, I thoroughly enjoyed it and reached out to Kevin with my own perspective. He asked me to share it with you, and I couldn\u2019t deny.I\u2019ve been using Reddit consistently to get brand fans, and I have to reiterate what Kevin said in his post\u200a\u2014\u200aReddit is a long term channel. Slow and steady wins the race here. But once you\u2019ve provided value and built trust, Reddit marketing becomes extremely effective.Promoting on Reddit the right way is tricky, so it\u2019s important to not screw up. Here are my 5 best tips for marketing on Reddit.Download: The Quick Guide to Reddit Promotion: Get all the content from this blog post as well as extra bonuses in this awesome PDF guide. FREE!1) Create immense\u00a0value.Redditors don\u2019t want to see rehashed info. They want long, in-depth guides that offer an authoritative take on a subject. Tell your readers why you\u2019re qualified to post on the subject, and then hit them with a few thousand words of detail. Of course, this depends on the niche you\u2019re in, but in many niches, a 3k-4k word guide performs amazingly.It\u2019s even better if you create a post just for Reddit instead of reposting an article from your blog. Redditors love this because that means the content was created with them in mind. In other words, they\u2019re not being subjected to blog spam. If you repost an article, make sure to post the full text and only include a link at the bottom of the article. You\u2019ll appeal to Reddit\u2019s better nature, and your chances of getting traffic are much higher.And don\u2019t create any fluff, either. The average Redditor has an unparalleled bullshit detector. They\u2019ll know if you\u2019re spinning or summarizing. Instead, just provide straight-up value. Write it not to get upvoted, but to help people. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll succeed.In fact, I wholeheartedly believe that value should be at the core of your entire marketing strategy. If you\u2019re not giving away too much value, you\u2019re not standing out from your competition. Be the brand in your niche that is synonymous with value, no matter what you\u2019re doing.(Editor\u2019s note\u200a\u2014\u200aIf you want to repost your entire blog post onto Reddit, use Reddit converter to make it easy!)2) Spend more time answering questions and giving advice than\u00a0posting.Posting without commenting on other threads is one of the best ways to piss off Redditors. If you\u2019re doing nothing but plugging your site, people will get tired of you almost immediately.Instead, spend most of your time commenting on others\u2019 threads. By doing so, you\u2019re building yourself up as an authority within the subreddit. You\u2019re giving others your advice from experience, which is of high value on Reddit. If you only post sparingly, you\u2019ll find your post will get a better reception. That\u2019s because people will recognize you from the community, and they\u2019ll associate you with high-quality advice.Don\u2019t skimp on your comments\u200a\u2014\u200abe as thorough as possible. Don\u2019t be afraid to leave a long comment, and make sure to continue the dialogue with anyone who replies.3) Leverage the hivemind.Reddit stands out from most other social platforms because of one unique tendency: the hivemind. This is essentially groupthink, wherein the masses tend to echo an early response.For example, if a new thread has no upvotes, a Redditor will probably want to downvote it without even reading it. Likewise, if a new thread has three upvotes, then that same Redditor will probably want to check it out. To get a better understanding of how hivemind works, check out this fantastic article from Popular Mechanics.You might be tempted to skew the initial vote count in your favor, but don\u2019t. It\u2019s important to use Reddit honestly and avoid underhanded tactics like buying upvotes. If you do, chances are you\u2019ll get called out on it sooner than later. Like I\u2019ve mentioned, the average Redditor has an always-on, hyper-aware bullshit detector.Instead, find ways to leverage this hivemind. See what kinds of topics get largely upvoted, and then contribute definitive guides to those topics. You can also use the hivemind to connect with Redditors. If Redditors on a certain subreddit respond to a certain idea or writing tone, then use that in your next post. As Kevin mentioned in his post, take a while to observe your subreddit of choice, and find out what makes it tick.4) For the daring\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t link to/mentioning your\u00a0site.This sounds crazy at first, but it\u2019s entirely possible to get lots of traffic without even mentioning your site. There are a few reasons why:1) When you don\u2019t link to or mention your site, Redditors won\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being marketed to, and that\u2019s crucial. In fact, by not mentioning your site, Redditors will want to know it.2) If the content is good enough, people will message you and ask you.3) Sometimes, people might even hunt down your site and link it themselves. I\u2019ve seen this happen many times.This is an especially powerful technique because it\u2019s so direct and organic. It\u2019s risky and has its downsides, but it should earn a place in anyone\u2019s Reddit strategy.5) Don\u2019t ask friends for\u00a0help.There was only one tip from the last VYPER post on Reddit that I didn\u2019t fully gel with. It was tip number 4: getting upvotes from friends.As Kevin pointed out, upvoting rings are frowned upon, but the problem here is that the line between an upvoting ring and a few friends helping you out is really hazy. I\u2019d err on the side of caution here, but that\u2019s just me.Play By Reddit\u2019s RulesIf you take one piece of advice from this entire article, let it be this: Play by Reddit\u2019s rules. When you\u2019re posting, you\u2019re jumping into a raucous playground where the cool kids rule. To have even a small chance at being cool yourself, you have to play by their rules. It\u2019s part hazing, part scientific observation.Make sure you check out the reddiquette and follow each subreddit\u2019s rule. Do those two simple things when using Reddit, and your experience will improve by several orders of magnitude.Don\u2019t try to use Reddit to achieve marketing goals. Instead, give people tons of value, and encourage an open conversation about your brand. When done right, Reddit marketing is one of the most organic, effective ways to spread the word about your business.Download: The Quick Guide to Reddit Promotion: Get all the content from this blog post as well as extra bonuses in this awesome PDF guide.

Because, let\u2019s be honest it is a pain in the ass migrating once you are locked in with all of your lists, email drips and logic set up.Below are a few points to consider when choosing who to sign up with. Choosing the best email provider is hard as everyone needs something different. There is no right or wrong answer but hopefully this post will make the right choice for you, more obvious!What to look for when finding the best email\u00a0providerLong term price\u200a\u2014\u200aSome plans might start out cheap but what happens when you start killing your lead-gen strategies and you list forms to a few hundred, thousand or hundreds of thousands. That free sign up account might have been good when you had 100 subscribers but once you hit 10K the price skyrockets.Deliverability\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat is the standard or reputation of the provider you are considering. Ask around how people\u2019s deliverability is with that company. We know Mailchimp has very strict policies on what type of content can be sent through their servers while Aweber has been known to let more \u2018spammy\u2019 emails pass through.Your technical skill level\u200a\u2014\u200aIf you can\u2019t code in HTML and CSS and don\u2019t plan to hire a developer right out of the gates, make sure you go with a provider who provides templates, drag and drop design or some other non technical solutions to build your emails. Remember that branding and personalization of emails is super important.What is your purpose?\u200a\u2014\u200aThe reason to send an email to a list is endless but make sure your email service provider specializes in what you need. For example are you an online store trying sell physical products? Are you a SaaS company? Are you a blogger pushing affiliate offers? All of these types of online businesses have email providers that specialize in that need!Segmentation?\u200a\u2014\u200aWhen you start out you will probably think \u201cfu*k it I am putting all my leads into 1 list\u201d. Then 6month later you will be like \u201cfu*k, I wish I hadn\u2019t put all my leads in 1 list\u201d. So make sure you choose a provider that can segment lists the way you need them.A list can be segmented in many ways:Number of opensNumber of clicksNumber of purchases or average order valuegender or agelocationhere are 27 other ways as wellNow that you have the knowledge to make a good decision. Here are a few we\u00a0like.Klaviyo\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is THE provider to go with if you\u2019re in e-commerce. They connect directly to your Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce store (and many others) and automatically segment out everything for you. So if you wanted to do cross-sells (send an automated recommendation email to people who purchase X item), it\u2019s built into the platform. Abandon cart functionality is also built right in.The interface is very user friendly and they have a 14 day trial so always worth setting up an account and sending out some test emails to yourself to see if you like it. Also the entry level version is free. Keep all of the points above in mind while test services.Tip: If you\u2019re in e-commerce, just go with Klaviyo and make tons of $.Drip\u200a\u2014\u200aIs a lightweight but super powerful email provider, their strongest advantage is their drip logic functionality & marketing automation features. They allow you to create pretty complete email chains based on behaviors of your customs (opened this, clicked on that etc). Their workflows function allows you to create complex decision trees depending on the actions of your user. We use Drip to power our SaaS app, VYPER. It\u2019s really great for SaaS because you can track certain actions in your app and add tags to your specific customer. As a developer, Drip is great because you can take advantage of some really killer functionality.One of their weaknesses is that they don\u2019t have a drag & drop email template builder, so you\u2019re pretty much stuck with very plain templates. That\u2019s actually shown to be great for deliverability, but it\u2019s not the best if you\u2019re an e-commerce company.Since their acquisition, Drip has rolled out a starter package for 100 emails at only $1 per month. That\u2019s not as cheap as Mailchimp\u2019s 2,000 free starter package, but you\u2019re getting much stronger functionality with Drip.Tip: If your email list requires complex decision trees (like a SaaS app might), then Drip was built for you.ConvertKit\u200a\u2014\u200aIs email marketing automation for bloggers. They\u2019ve decided to focus primarily on writers & bloggers, and their feature set makes it easy for bloggers & content writers to attract new leads. For example, one nifty feature is that if your reader has already been subscribed to your list, the ConvertKit form shows your Facebook like button or some other code instead.But the real reason you want to go with ConvertKit is because it\u2019s VERY simple to understand and gets you email automation without a huge learning curve. Click triggers allow you to tag certain customers so you can send email directly to those customers, or it can move certain customers to different sequences.You don\u2019t have some of the complex functionality as Drip, but this makes it really easy for the blogger to start using it. And for 99% of bloggers, ConvertKit is enough to get started because you\u2019re not dealing with the decision trees you might be with a SaaS (for example, readers of a blog don\u2019t usually have to login and get onboarded to an app\u200a\u2014\u200athese kinds of complex actions are best handled within Drip).And for bloggers, your emails are going to be primarily content, not images, so ConvertKit is fine for you. ConvertKit doesn\u2019t have a fancy template builder, so be prepared to send plain text looking emails.Tip: If you\u2019re a blogger, ConvertKit gets you a leg up from Campaign Monitor and Mailchimp with some powerful segmentation and tagging features.Campaign Monitor\u200a\u2014\u200aIs a service that that a lot of agencies or resellers use as they have integrated a white label account pretty successfully. On top of this they also have a pretty good selection of templated emails and a/b split testing of emails. To me they compete head to head with Mailchimp because they\u2019re cheaper and have basic functionality, but aren\u2019t as advanced as the options above.They\u2019re starting to add some e-commerce functionality, but it\u2019s still in beta, and nowhere near as sophisticated as Klaviyo\u2019s.These guys are a good option if you plan to have clients that will also need to send out their own branded emails.Tip: They\u2019re a slightly better version of Mailchimp that doesn\u2019t have a free tier.Mailchimp\u200a\u2014\u200aOne of the most popular email provider services due to it\u2019s free account up to 2,000 subscribers. Even though these guys start out cheap the cost starts to mount once you grow. They definitely work the price back in further down the line.Having said that these guys have been around FOREVER so they know what they are doing with a/b testing, good email tracking, ok list segmentation and great design templates. One thing to watch out for is, if you are an affiliate this service provider is pretty strict on affiliate links so be careful!Overall Mailchimp is a provider that does a lot of things decently, although they\u2019re not a standout in any category. If you have more specialized needs, we recommend an ESP that is more suited for your particular market.Tip: If you just need a general newsletter, you don\u2019t need advanced functionality, or you\u2019re starting out, Mailchimp is a good option for you. Once you have to start paying for Mailchimp (past their free tier) it\u2019s best to move to a more sophisticated ESP.SummaryHopefully after reading this you are much more knowledgable on what you need to look for to find the best email provider for YOU. People will make recommendations based on their affiliate links and what not but you just need to take a step back and think of that provider offers everything I need?If you have a provider you are doing that you think should be mentioned on this list, let us know in the comments and we can add it!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "What is a Viral Giveaway?", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-set-up-a-viral-giveaway-3def75525ad4?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 13, 2016", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "1", "content": "What is a Viral Giveaway?VYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 13, 2016Every business needs sales to survive but unfortunately it is getting harder and harder to convince people to buy a product the first time they see it or visit your website. True direct response is getting harder, especially for companies in SaaS where the product might take a long time to explain. To go from the first exposure to the sale usually requires 4\u20137 touch points.One solution to this is using viral giveaways, which are used to incentive the behavior of sharing and increasing the exposure of your brand to get that introductory touch point with little effort.A viral giveaway works like this:John has a shoe store and wants to giveaway a pair of shoes to incentivize people to sign up to his email list so he can send them deals every week.Sam signs up and enters his email to get 1 entry to win the shoes.On the confirmation page Sam is given a custom link to share with his friends and family, on social or via email for example.When Sam\u2019s friends or family sign up to also win the shoes through his custom link he will get additional entries.As you can see above the methods allow for 1 entrant to refer a whole lot more people.Why You Should Run a Viral\u00a0GiveawayThe cost per lead is super low (we have seen them as low as $0.05 per email).Using the right giveaway prize can draw in super targeted leads.The entrant is incentivized to share their email and the company gets cheap leads, win win.This strategy can be evergreen, some companies run a monthly giveaway and the giveaway page generates more and more authority month after month.With the use of paid media this strategy is easy to scale.Giveaway Traps to\u00a0AvoidGiving away prizes not relevant to your niche.Not promoting the giveaway. First 2\u20133 weeks need WORK!Being too self promotional when promoting.How to Set Up a Viral\u00a0GiveawayChoose a prize that is relevantThis is extremely important and we see first time giveaway users choose prizes that do not make sense. For example a dentistry giving away an iPad. The prize needs to be complimentary to what you sell so your giveaway entries are aligned with your business and can be converted at a later date. Read more about choosing the right prize here.Plan your outreachThis step is extremely important. You will need to email other influencers and ask for their help in promoting your giveaway. It is usually best to send this out to your industry friends and remember that the favor will be reciprocal.Leverage your current audience.Just because you already have someone\u2019s email, doesn\u2019t mean you can not leverage this person further. Your email list and social media are a great place to start. If you have a segmented list of passionate super fans email them separately with a more person message (these are the guys that will make or break a giveaway). Even though you already have your email lists\u2019 emails, they are likely to know others just like them who they can share the giveaway with.LaunchThis is the easiest step, hit the launch button, send out all your outreach emails, post to all of your social media and blast your email list. All of these steps have been pre planned so shouldn\u2019t take too long.Manage your entriesAs the giveaway builds momentum, check-in on the types of emails you are getting. Look at the source referring most traffic and find other sites or influencers like that to reach out to.Continue to promoteIt is a good idea to start with a media spend on your giveaway. This gets the ball rolling and shows your giveaway to the right audience from the get go. The trick is to aim for a low CPC and use pixels or goals to track the sign ups a paid media channel is driving. We usually start out by publishing some ads on Facebook, Stumble, LinkedIn, Reddit and Twitter.Sooo ready to take the next\u00a0step?Create your giveaway at VYPER.

Google\u2019s algorithm can tell when a reader is having a good or bad experience on your site, and if you write like a keyword stuffing bot, Google will penalize you (most likely because readers will bounce quickly).Sometimes \u201cweirder\u201d sounding phrases are searched more. For example, \u201centrepreneurial conference\u201d was searched more than \u201cconference for startups\u201d according to Ahrefs.Do your keyword research (using tools like ahrefs, google keyword planner, longtail pro) before you decide to optimize for a phrase that you \u201cthought\u201d was going to be more popular.Text optimization is more important than image optimization for ranking.12 Principles Of Viral Content by Nadya\u00a0KhojaInfographics, especially ones that cite popular culture, tend to go viralEspecially if you show data in a more interesting format.

He acquired the business from Sujan Patel, another well-known marketer in the digital marketing space. Before being the head honcho at Single Grain, he was the marketing lead for Treehouse, one of the most well-known companies in the tech education space.He also owns Growth Everywhere, now one of my favorite podcasts in the startup growth space. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed listening to all his interviews with some of the top entrepreneurs in the world.YOUR LINK TEXTNote: This article was originally published on HYPERLUSH, and has been republished here with permission.We got a chance to interview Eric about one of his favorite topics, content marketing. It\u2019s one of the most effective ways to build up a loyal audience, and it\u2019s an extremely good way to build up an email list.What was the challenge coming into Single Grain after working in a company like Treehouse?It\u2019s a completely different company. With Single Grain, we don\u2019t necessarily have anything groundbreaking. We\u2019re a digital marketing agency just like tons of agencies out there. With Treehouse, we had a great team and a great product and we were on the cutting edge of the education space. Our team at Single Grain is also a different team\u200a\u2014\u200awe have a lot of smart people at Single Grain but they\u2019re mostly junior marketers. It was unlike Treehouse where we had the A-class team with people from places like Stanford & Google. So it\u2019s a different challenge.Let\u2019s get into content marketing. How does one even get started?There\u2019s one really important thing that people forget. You have to write for yourself. Write what speaks to you and then go for you. If it\u2019s not interesting for you then you\u2019re not going to help anyone. As Mark Cuban said, \u201cYou try to please everyone, you please no one.\u201dAlso you just gotta keep writing. At the beginning you\u2019re going to see very little returns. It\u2019s a delayed gratification. It\u2019s like compound interest. Over time you\u2019ll see your traffic grow. You\u2019ll see your email list grow.Do you write with SEO in mind?It\u2019s very helpful to understand SEO, but you don\u2019t want to make your writing very robotic by including X amount of keywords in the title or article. It\u2019s important to get traction in your article first and then you can go back and tweak things for SEO purposes.Bottom line: learn the basics of SEO, but don\u2019t worry about over optimization.You have two properties, Single Grain and Growth Everywhere. What\u2019s the purpose of this?I intended to start Growth Everywhere just to give back. When I made it two years ago, I just wanted to make it helpful. But Growth Everywhere does help us send people into our marketing funnels for Single Grain. (Single Grain being the marketing company and Growth Everywhere being just a content blog/podcast for startup growth). We do find that Growth Everywhere brings in our best clients, because they are high value customers who understand more than the average customer and they see the value of what we provide. So in that sense, yes, Growth Everywhere is a great channel for us to find customers for Single Grain.Can you give us traffic numbers for your two properties?Across the board we\u2019re getting around 80,000 unique visitors. About 5% of our audience turns into newsletter subscribers, so we\u2019re getting about 4,000 per month.Wow, that\u2019s pretty high. How are you getting 5% of your readers into newsletter subscribers?I highly recommend ConversionXL for more conversion tips. But our welcome mat from SumoMe is converting super well\u200a\u2014\u200aat around 10%. We also have lead magnets that do really well, around 5%.Sumo Me Welcome MatWhat\u2019s doing REALLY well is we have article-specific lead magnets that convert up to 10\u201315%, or commonly called \u201ccontent upgrades.\u201d(Editor\u2019s note, to learn more about content upgrades, check out this post by Backlinko).Did you do A/B testing? And at what point does someone need to do A/B testing?Yes we definitely A/B tested our offers. So generally we tested the actual offers, not the color of the button or something like that.As far as when you should start A/B testing, I have an arbitrary number, 10k uniques. If you don\u2019t have that many yet, then you have much need for A/B testing. And you also have a lot more issues that will take more precedent.You have a site-wide lead magnet called 29 Growth Hacking Quick Wins. How did you come up with this and why did you think it would be a compelling lead magnet?Yeah so the content of that e-book was mostly created by Mattan Griffel of One Month. We were at a conference together and I really liked the content he put together. So I approached him to do the design and he said yes so we created the e-book together.For our audience it was just a no-brainer. If they could get just one good tip from the e-book then it\u2019s worth it for them. We put this lead magnet up on our welcome mat and also throughout our website and it\u2019s been converting a lot better than what was on there before.What\u2019s converting best for you? Welcome mat? Popup? Exit popup?The Welcome Mat by far. So it converts around 10%. We also have an exit popup but it only converts at 1%. I have no idea about the psychology behind it, but the Welcome Mat is just doing so much better. I\u2019d definitely test it out.(Editor\u2019s note: SumoMe themselves have reported similar data. That their Welcome Mat does a lot better than any other pop-up or optin form).How do you promote your content?We find communities that we can post our content to\u200a\u2014\u200aplaces like Growth Hackers and Inbound.org. There\u2019s also Reddit and Hacker News. Then we had our team upvote the content as well. That gave our initial boost of traffic. Then we also interviewed influencers who sent us traffic.Combine that with a mailing list and you slowly end up growing your list and audience pretty quickly.For the people who are having trouble converting their traffic to email subscribers, what should they do?You have to go back to the drawing board and ask yourself if your content is actually good. In general, it\u2019s mostly people who want to take shortcuts and be lazy. When you\u2019re creating content you have to provide value. If it doesn\u2019t provide value then you won\u2019t convert traffic.So take a really deep, hard look at your content and ask yourself if the value you\u2019re providing is actually good. In the past I\u2019ve honestly said \u201cno\u201d to this many times. It\u2019s a learning process. You have to continually create more and more content and figure out what content resonates and what content falls flat.How can we get feedback to see if our content is good or not?Start with friends and family first. Facebook ads can help you see if people want to look at your content. Just look and see which ads get the highest CTR so you can see what people are clicking on and what they like.The great part about this strategy is not only do you get to see what content converts well, but now you can pixel your audience with the FB pixel. Once you have that FB pixel on your site, you can now retarget that audience so they can buy an offer from your site, maybe a cheap offer. Then you can bring them deeper into your funnel and purchase more higher value products.I highly recommend DigitalMarketer.com for more insights on Facebook ads strategy and growth in general.Thanks so much for all the insights Eric!To learn more about Eric Siu, check him out at:Growth EverywhereSingle GrainTwitter", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/the-best-growth-hackers-in-the-world-arent-necessarily-going-around-teaching-their-skills-211112585c27?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 20, 2016", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "1", "content": "VYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 20, 2016Vincent Dignan: An Underground Growth Hacker\u2019s Tactics to Getting Free TrafficThe best growth hackers in the world aren\u2019t necessarily going around teaching their skills.

The best growth hackers experiment relentlessly to get ahead of the curve, and then exploit the hacks ruthlessly before they\u2019re found out.But we got an exclusive with Vincent to talk about a few of the tactics that are still working now, and how he creatively uses Twitter and other channels to get free targeted traffic for his clients and his own projects.You went from being broke and on welfare 4 years ago, now you\u2019re giving growth hacking talks, how did you gain those skills in that time?Yeah at the time, around 2012, I was homeless living with an ex-girlfriend. I didn\u2019t have my own place and was living off her.My ex told me I needed to go do something. So I decided to make an online magazine since I enjoyed writing and figured I wouldn\u2019t make money blogging off Tumblr. Within 6 months the magazine had 350,000 visitors per month. Within a year it had a million. We raised about $250,000 and got into the Techstars accelerator program. Soon later after that I was giving talks.Wow, amazing. But it sounds like you had no knowledge of the digital world before this. So how did you get up to 350,000 visitors so fast?One of the things I believe is you should learn from one of the best. At the time I wanted to start an online magazine so I talked with a girl who worked for a successful magazine and got advice from her. She told me just get as much traffic as you can\u200a\u2014\u200athe rest will fall into place.So the first thing I did was call every University in the country and told them we were building the coolest magazine in the world and would you like to be apart of it. So in essence it was user generated content but we had editors to make the content look good. But the idea is to generate as many articles as possible.Then our strategy was to hit up as many people as possible\u200a\u2014\u200asend it through news sites, social communities like Reddit, send it to large publications, send it to people via social media. Our articles got picked up by places like the Huffington Post and other sites like that, which drove massive traffic.We also growth hacked our way with Twitter and got tons of traffic that way (editor\u2019s note, we\u2019ll talk more about Twitter later on in the article).Another thing we did was we used a widget called Zergnet that was essentially a traffic exchange. Every time we send them 1 visitor they send us 2 back. So that was extremely good.You eventually made the transition from PlanetIvy to a growth hacking consultancy called Magnific, why?We got a lot of offers from other companies to learn how we were doing what we were doing. All the stuff we learned growing our Twitter, growing our traffic, that\u2019s stuff that companies wanted. The offers were too good to pass up. It made sense at that point to turn Planet Ivy into our own agency, Magnific.Another main reason for the transition\u200a\u2014\u200awhen we started in 2012, it was easier to get advertising dollars from publishing. Even with a lot of traffic, an ad-supported website is getting harder to do, especially now with Facebook dominating online advertising. Now Facebook has such a monopoly on traffic that most publications just can\u2019t compete with that kind of targeting and reach.At the same time I still work on side projects just to keep myself interested while I\u2019m helping clients grow their businesses. Secret Sauce, my book has been my biggest project this year. We wanted to create something for the people that can\u2019t afford our services, which cost thousands of dollars. I also created a Facebook group called \u201ctraffic and copy,\u201d which now has a few thousand people.You have a book on Kickstarter that was recently funded successfully (to the tune of $80k+). What was your marketing process for getting sales off Kickstarter?We first compiled a list of several different marketing channels then we arranged them from easiest to hardest.The list looked something like this:Compile a list of people we know and let them know about the book\u200a\u2014\u200aLinkedin contacts, Twitter, email contacts.Accelerators and coworking spaces that I\u2019ve talked at, I asked them to send things out to their newsletter. These all have pretty good newsletters that are tech/startup focused.Hacker News\u200a\u2014\u200awe couldn\u2019t do this channel as well.Posts on Reddit did really well\u200a\u2014\u200aself posts. (Editor\u2019s note: Use Reddit converter to convert your blogs into self posts formatted for Reddit).Posting in Facebook groups.Interviewed on about 8 podcasts, get them to do interviews like this one.Reached out to some influencers to try and get referrals, although this didn\u2019t help as much.Did talks throughout America during the launch.Our pre-existing mailing list.My partner Austin wrote a Medium article that got a lot of traffic.Then send them to a queueing system, we used Queue At to do this. You got a free chapter of the book if you signed up. This queue system asked you to share the book\u2019s landing page in exchange for moving up the queue. As you moved up the queue you could get free webinars, free consultancies, free blog posts about your company, etc. This was definitely the key to the whole thing since it gave us a lot of viral shares.Then we launched and we made about $15,000 from the first day, and now over $80,000 from Kickstarter.You\u2019ve done a lot of growth hacking around Twitter. Can you share the basics about how you use Twitter for traffic?First of all I signed up several different accounts. I recommend beginners to start with 4 accounts\u200a\u2014\u200ayou could do it like @company_name, @company_help, @company_usa, @company_country\u200a\u2014\u200asomething like that.Then make sure you\u2019re tweeting a LOT. I tweet on all my accounts every 30 minutes. Twitter isn\u2019t like Facebook. You need repetition to get your content out there.I have an intern Tweeting for me.I don\u2019t use automation currently, but in the past I\u2019ve used Audiense to automate the replies.I follow people with certain attributes. Currently this isn\u2019t automated because my intern does it, although there are tools like Follow Liker that can do that for you.Find a conference going on in your niche and follow those people. They\u2019re super active so they tend to follow back.Don\u2019t follow more than 500 people a day & unfollow more than 400 people a day.Don\u2019t send more than 250 tweets a day.I post and find interesting content.How did you start getting a lot of speaking engagements? That\u2019s sort of a growth hack in itself isn\u2019t it?Yeah I was randomly asked to talk at an accelerator and they were going to pay me for it. From there it was just by referral. Someone there wanted me to talk at another place, and then so on and so forth.One other thing I did to get speaking engagements was just hit up the organizer to various startup meetups in my area (through Meetups.com), give them a deck I had on growth hacking, and do a cold email asking if I could speak.You mention on your site that forums are where you learn real growth hacks. What forums do you go on?BlackHatWorld.com. It\u2019s black hat but they have a lot of amazing tactics on there.The thing with blackhat, of course, is that the hacks don\u2019t really last, but they\u2019ll be doing stuff that gets them tons of traffic for a time, until Google finds out and destroys it. So you can\u2019t make a real business out of it, but you can get some temporary wins from Blackhat.However, the site itself has actually tons of really good advice that\u2019s not Blackhat, so I recommend people checking it out.What\u2019s a last growth hack you want to share with our audience?The key really is knowing that there are tools out there for anything. A lot of stuff can be automated and a lot of knowledge and info can be scraped.CharlieApp\u200a\u2014\u200aFinds anyone\u2019s info.Audiense\u200a\u2014\u200aAutomated Twitter/Instagram mentions and scrape Twitter/Instagram for certain keywords.Email Hunter\u200a\u2014\u200aFind email addresses.Depending on what you\u2019re trying to achieve, there\u2019s going to be a way for you to reach people without spending a lot of time or money.Check out more of Vincent Dignan:His book Secret Sauce on IndieGogoVincentDignan.comMagnific agencyTwitterOriginally published at vyper.io on August 20, 2016.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "10 Brilliant B2B Facebook Ads Deconstructed", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/10-brilliant-b2b-facebook-ads-deconstructed-fa0c8e693084?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 14, 2016", "readtime": "11 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "10 Brilliant B2B Facebook Ads DeconstructedVYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 14, 2016How do online businesses get more customers?

It is loosely defined as a generating growth from less effort by working smart and creative, not hard.We created a list of 13 innovative ways to leverage viral contest leaderboards will help you become an elite growth hacker. Each of these hacks will help you get more traffic, leads, sales and brand awareness.Contests, giveaways, sweepstakes and whatever else you can name them have become a key growth hacking acquisition strategy in a lot of online businesses. Customers are getting smarter and harder to market to. You\u2019ll need to innovate your marketing strategies in order to reach them, and the viral leaderboard contest can help.Do you need\u2026?More trafficMore leadsMore salesMore awarenessOf course you do! Keep reading to find out how viral contests do it.Basics of a contestRewarding someone for entering their information and completing an action (like referring a friend).A lot of contests are based on a points system. E.g. do X and get Y number of points. These points then rank the entrants in a leaderboard.The more tempting you make this offering the easier the acquisition of will be.Great offer + great audience = viral contest!So lets drive in and take a look at all the ways people are growth hacking their way to more leads, traffic and sales using viral leaderboard contests.1. Social follower contestEveryone knows that a large social following is almost a prerequisite for online business validation. We also know that the value of a Facebook follower is decreasing. So instead of paying thousands of dollars building your social following, you can launch a contest and ask users to follow your social media pages.By rewarding extra points for entrants to follow your page, you will have a large following in no time.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aMake sure what you are giving away is aligned with your business so that your entrants are focused to your niche. If you\u2019re giving away a $500 cash reward, the chances are you will get a pretty general following that probably doesn\u2019t care about your company. If you are in the golf niche and offer the latest golf clubs, chances are your entrants are going to be more targeted.2. Email lead contestEmails are a vital part to most business, it\u2019s a direct contact with your customer is always a great starting point no matter what you are selling (products, content or services). Using gamification in the form of a points system sparks the competitiveness in humans.This email collection contest is the easiest to execute on and it pretty much rewards entrants with more points every time they refer a new person to your contest. Awards are given to people with the most points.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aGiving multiple prizes helps to make your contest even more competitive. A lot of people don\u2019t think they can win 1st place if the winner is too far ahead, but if there are enough consolation prizes to make it interesting, they\u2019re more likely to participate.3. Joint venture contestMake your contest more interesting and valuable by introducing a complementary brand, product to partner. This will give you more to offer in terms of prizes as well as help in the promotion and marketing of your contest.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aTry using influencers to promote your contest. You are able to leverage their audience as well as use them as a validator that your contest is worth entering. People are much more likely to take a recommendation from a friend, family member, colleague or influencer than the brand itself!For example, one of our clients, Fatburger, teamed up with Wal Mart to do a joint giveaway, which lended the brand a lot of social validation.4. Waiting listWaiting is never fun but turn a negative into a positive with a waiting list contest. Promote a page that announces the release of XX (whatever people are waiting for) and have people sign up for the waiting list. Once they are signed up they can then see where they are in line!You can incentives people to move up the line by referring others to the list, get them to follow your social media or get them to complete custom actions like watch a video, join a Facebook group or complete a quiz!This is great for keeping your brand in the spotlight and building hype before your release or launch date.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aMake sure you send out a reminder close to when you are ready to open the doors to your waiting list to get them excited again. This is also a great time to reward everyone on the list with a gift (discount, free item, bonus content etc).5. Product launchSimilar to the contest above but more focused on the release of a product. Since this is a product it allows you to get a little more creative with your rewards. For example, if you were releasing a new product (e.g. a power bank) you could give the top 10 entrants a free power bank and anyone who reached 5000 pints 50% off!This incentivizes people to collect more points by sharing your contest, following your social accounts or completing custom actions you set!TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aThe better you make the grand prize the more people will want to share your contest to get points. We suggest running this about 30 days prior to your release date. Once you get to your release date you should have a huge list of emails to market to as well!6. Course launchThis one is pretty self-explanatory after the prior contest type. Use all the same principles but for your course. You can offer free course chapters, lifetime access or 1on1 training sessions as rewards in your launch contest.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aTry and run a few friends through your course first to get feedback and get some testimonials to use on the course launch page. This will validate the course and make the prize of wining more enticing.7. Evergreen funnelThis is one of people\u2019s favorite contest types as it is a constant stream of leads. A contest is set up to run constantly rewarding winners every week/month or quarter. The idea of this is to keep a constant steam of traffic running to this contest page to keep it alive. Here is an example of how we run an evergreen contest\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://vyper.io/c/199TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aAdd a link to your evergreen costed from a website popup/tab, Facebook page tab, Instagram bio, include it in your email prospecting drip and even in your paid acquisition.8. Product / Facebook Page ReviewsGetting positive product reviews is a fantastic way to improve your conversion rate. People love seeing validation on a product they are about to purchase. You can use a custom contest entry to incentivize a product review.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aIt\u2019s best to do this only for people who have actually bought your product, otherwise it\u2019s unethical. You can make this more legitimate by making the custom entry question the receipt number of their purchase or their email they used at time of purchase.9. Survey/Quiz ContestGetting customers/browsers feedback can be tricky but we still do it as it is some of the most important information we can obtain to grow our business. Leverage contest to incentivize that feedback, everyone needs a little motivation. Reward points on completing aLeverage contests to incentivize that feedback, everyone needs a little motivation. Reward points on completing a Google form or completing a single answer question (see below), it will help them get closer to winning the contest and get you your much-needed data.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aThe feedback can be on your website design, product, industry, information about them to help you build personas on the people who are interested in your brand. Also think about sweetening the deal by having a discount code at the end of the contest. This also drives a few sales as well\u00a0;)10. Crowd Sourcing (Kickstarter)Everyone seems to be crowed souring something these days, a trip around the world, a new business venture or new product. But how do you make yours stand out? The hardest part about crowed sourcing is getting eyeballs on your project.Use a contest to generate hype, drive traffic, collect emails and build audiences. You can award people who back your project, share it, watch your product video & more. The possibilities are endless.You can also run a contest before even launching your Kickstart so that when you launch you already have an email list to market to.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aTier your contest rewards similar to ho you would for a Kickstarter. Once a contestant gets X amount of points they get Y. Also make sure you have some low entry rewards to keep people motivated. E.g. get 10% OFF when you reach 500 points.11. Social Proof Contest (get cheap likes, shares & comments)This is one of the most powerful but underutilized features of contests. The ability to incentivize someone to like, share and comment on a Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn post is worth hundreds if not thousands of dollars.Not only does this make your post look extremely popular but you can pin this to the top of your page so when people visit your page it looks like you have some serious engagement. Social engagement is like word of mouth, e.g. \u201cJack liked this so I should too\u201d.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aUse this tactic on your Facebook ads to get better quality scores and make your ads look more authoritative. A combination of leaderboard contest + lots of social validation + Facebook ads is a slam dunk for growth!12. Video engagement contest (YouTube & GB)YouTube is a huge opportunity that is extremely hard to break into, there are hundreds of minutes of video uploaded every 60 seconds so how do you make your videos stand above the rest? You game the algorithms by incentivizing comments, likes, and subscribers on your videos.Nothing moves you up the search results in YouTube faster than comment engagement so make sure you also reply to those comments as well to get some conversations started.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aIn the custom entry of your leaderboard contest ask a question instead of just asking entrants to thumbs up your YouTube video. E.g. For 100 points, watch this YouTube video and ask 1 question in the comments\u201d. This will make the comments seem a little more organic!13. Create custom audiences for FacebookNot enough people use custom audiences on Facebook for hyper-targeted campaigns. Once you please a pixel on the contest landing page and thank you page your can start building an audience in Facebook. With this audience you can push specific offers to that targeted audience or create \u201clook-a-like\u201d audiences to find people similar to those who entered your contest.TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aonce your contest ends, run a Facebook campaign with the messaging. \u201cThanks for entering our contest, sorry you didn\u2019t win but we don\u2019t want you to miss out. So here is a 50% off coupon code that is valid for the next 48 hours\u201d. The ROI on this campaign will be through the roof!So by now, your brain should be buzzing with new ideas on how you can use VYPER\u2019s Leaderboard Contests to grow your business. We have seen time and time again engagement and share-ability take a campaign from 0\u2013100 very quickly.

If everyone shares, it inevitably benefits everyone involved.If no one shares, no one benefits so pick good partners and have a series of emails ready to send your partners. Include copy and images for them to use for their social posts and emails to make it super easy for them to do.Add our Google Analytics code to our contest page to get more campaign insights.10.

This is quite a daunting task when there is little momentum or acquisition infrastructure in place.What expectations and goals did you have/set for your contest?\u00a0We are generally aiming to get 3,000+ email subscribers from a viral contest of this nature and to send the subscribers and offer which will convert them into customers.What other marketing campaigns have you tried but didn\u2019t work?\u00a0We have tried using Gleam.io & Matire App which are great tools in their own right, but found that conversion and virality were higher when using VYPER.Contest example\u00a0results:Justin Bieber Tickets ContestEmails: 8,178+Social followers: 5,000+Customers: 100+ app downloadsSocial media mentions increased exponentially.Evil Energy ContestEmails: 6,594+Social followers: 3,000+Traffic increase: 1,000+ website clicks during contest periodWhat are the top 5 things you learned from running a contest?\u00a0We\u2019ve setup and promoted a lot of these contests.

The more entries you have, the bigger the effect of a follow up email will be.What would you do next time you ran a contest?Send big email blasts to pre-existing lists as soon as the contest launches.Drive traffic through mass tweeting at relevant people.Get as much PR and influencer shoutouts to the campaign as possible. PR has been a great way to get high quality leads.Ask for feedback on the contest page from customers & others before launching.Use the new custom entries tools to get more information from entrants.How did you promote your contest and what worked the best for you?\u00a0We\u2019ve promoted and cross-promoted contests on lots of different channels. We try to promote through as many channels as possible simultaneously to get the contest going.Once you get momentum the contest really starts to accelerate!What has worked the best:Email a solid pre-subscribed list (+Get others to email it out for you)\u200a\u2014\u200aWe\u2019ve found email to be a really good source of signups, especially if they\u2019re already on your list. Cold email generally gets much lower conversion rates than emailing a subscribed list.Twitter\u200a\u2014\u200aWe build networks of 10+ Twitter accounts, build nice followers and send tweets and DM\u2019s to the followers telling them about the contest.Instagram\u200a\u2014\u200aWe\u2019ve built niche accounts and DM the followers to tell them about the contest. It works ok, but if you start sending too much traffic from too many accounts via DM\u2019s the accounts can get shut down or suspended.LinkedIn\u200a\u2014\u200aBuilding up networks of connections and telling them about the contest via direct message and published pulse blog posts.Paid traffic via Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram etc.\u200a\u2014\u200aWe see an opportunity with viral contests to reduce CPA by sending ads to VYPER\u2019s contest landing pages, collecting Facebook pixels for retargeting all the people who land on the page (and those who sign up), and also trying to convert them with an opt-in bribe as soon as they sign up for the contest.Facebook Groups\u200a\u2014\u200aWe\u2019ve tried a lot of stuff with Facebook groups. Where we\u2019ve had most success is building relationships with the people who own the groups and getting them to post the link into the group as they already have authority there.PR\u200a\u2014\u200aWe\u2019ve also found that high quality PR can boost the number of high quality relevant signups.Competition directories\u200a\u2014\u200aQuality of entrants drops from this source but it\u2019s a good way to get the word out to a lot of people quickly.About the Agency\u00a0Digital Growth are an international Growth Agency focused on building social media audiences on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn & Instagram.

Most are too focused on the technical or they go too copy heavy to make any real impact. That is why marketers are encouraged to adopt a technique that has been used for centuries to entertain, educate, and inform. Storytelling is a powerful marketing tool that can make your landing pages stand out and get noticed.A good story is often remembered more clearly than mere facts. So, if you can weave a good tale, even the most technical of brands might find the secret to maximum conversions. Here are a few tips you can use on your landing pages that will bring your brand\u2019s story to life.Determine the Story\u2019s PurposeWhat are you trying to accomplish with your landing page? That answer should be provided before any storytelling is developed. You should have a clear ending in mind before you begin, in other words, and it all begins with a goal.Are you trying to entice a purchase or a subscription? This goal should be written down and looked at often so that the story always stays on track.What\u2019s the Problem?Prospects click on your landing page because some promise enticed them. They may have clicked an ad that promised to make their job easier. They may have clicked a Facebook post or clicked a link in an ebook that swore their lives could be simpler. Now they have landed on your landing page with hopes of finding this ease-of-life you\u2019ve assured.Just as you have written down the goal of the landing page, write down the prospect\u2019s problem. This is the issue that will be top-of-mind as the reader engages with your story. That is why every line must address that problem as well as its solution\u200a\u2014\u200ain some fashion.Start Your Story with a Striking TitleYour titles can\u2019t just be good. They have to be like coiled vipers, lashing out and Striking readers, forcing them to pay attention. This type of title:Speaks to the prospects\u2019 problem. (Client Onboarding Just Got Easier & Less Expensive)Tells the prospect that a story is forthcoming. (How One Business Owner Expanded His Business in 4 Months!)Makes a promise. (Join This Business Owner Who Expanded His Enterprise in Less Than Six-Months!)Gives facts & figures. (How One Business Owner Increased Sales By 154% in Four Months!)Gets Personal. (Stop the Frustration of Client Onboarding. Finally, an Easier Solution that Costs Less!)Uses a combination of tactics. (Client Onboarding Success Secrets. 85% Faster Results and Ease-of-Use for Frustrated HR Reps)Use Simple LanguageNothing will take a reader out of a story faster than using a convoluted word that doesn\u2019t belong. Instead of saying, \u201cSusan passed the required standardization procedures that ensured her knowledge of the material was commensurate\u2026\u201d which could cause your reader to doze off, say, \u201cSusan passed all the required tests, and now has the knowledge she needs\u2026\u201dIn other words, avoid jargon and speak as though you were telling this story to a friend. And never use a long word when a short one will do.Who is Your Subject?A good story needs a protagonist; someone we can root for. Some examples might be:The owner of the company describing how he/she came across the secrets to the organization\u2019s success. (Tim didn\u2019t know at the time, but the algorithm he developed has helped 4,506 small businesses save more money with better personnel and fewer liability issues.)A client who has a success story to tell. (John expanded his boat rental business, opened a new location, and recently hired twenty new staff members.)Third-parties who have decided to work with the organization. (A corporate leasing agency chose to team up with a B2B SEO firm, for instance, because of the SEO\u2019s values, culture, and methods with which they do business.)Get to the PointThe average person spends 8 hours per day consuming various types of media. To get your brand noticed, your landing pages have to hook the reader instantly. There\u2019s no time to waste. \u201cOnce upon a time\u2026\u201d isn\u2019t going to cut it and long drawn out introductions won\u2019t either.Instead, take a page from an actual master of writing, Kurt Vonnegut, that teaches you to start as close to the end of your story as possible.Did your service help a client expand his boat rental business ten-fold in the past year? Think about why that would be interesting to a prospect.If the prospect is a business owner who also wants to expand, describe all the benefits the client now experiences with the newly developed business.For instance, \u201cJohn Weaver started the year with one struggling boat rental business and too much inventory he couldn\u2019t quite move. Within four months, John cleared through his inventory, expanded his business, and opened a second location on the other side of town.\u201dIn this way, you are enticing your audience by helping them enjoy the fruits of John\u2019s labor. The reader can put him/herself in John\u2019s shoes, and will start to imagine it would be like to experience that sweet, sweet success.Keep Your Organization Out of ItPeople reading your landing pages don\u2019t care about your organization, how it got started, and who works there; at least not yet. Right now, the reader is focused on how you can solve his or her problem.When writing a story on your landing pages, put the focus all on the ideal prospects. Speak to that person and make him or her feel the emotional pain caused by this ever-present problem. Maybe it\u2019s frustration or anger, or regret for doing things the hard way for so many years. Eventually, you will mention the solution to the prospects\u2019 problem, which will represent the easier way of doing things. First, you need to create an emotional bond.Some excellent ways to personalize your stories so that they more deeply resonate with your target market is to use job titles, photographs of people engaged in similar job roles, quotes from others in the industry, and by using lots of \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d to drive your copy home.Give Your Clients the Storytelling Duties for a ChangeYou don\u2019t always have to be the one telling the story. Empowering stories told from the viewpoint of clients helps to build that strong emotional bond you\u2019re striving for. The best way to do this is to have the client tell his or her story in person or on a recording. Face-to-face Skype or Google Hangout interviews work well also. No matter which medium is used, record the client\u2019s story, transcribe the words, and convert the juiciest parts into powerful landing page copy that gets your prospects excited about your offerings.When using testimonials, pair them with relevant blocks of copy. For instance, if your landing page is discussing how easy your software is to use, that\u2019s an excellent place to drop a testimonial where one of your clients raves about ease-of-use.In this sense, testimonials act as exclamation points that highlight the exciting bits of your story.Be Relentless with Your EditingKurt Vonnegut gave another interesting tidbit marketers would be keen to follow. He said that every sentence of your story should do one of two things\u200a\u2014\u200areveal something about your character or advance the action.As a landing page marketer, your job is to ensure every line of your story either aligns with your title or pertains to the reader\u2019s problem. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s nothing but noise and should be removed at all costs.Format So the Story FlowsKeep in mind that people will be reading your landing pages on small screens. Not all of them, but enough that make it wise to format for mobile first.Formatting tips include:Short, simple sentences, and concise paragraphs with a good bit of space in between.Bolded subheaders that continue the story as the landing page progresses. Your reader should be able to get a gist of what the page contains just by reading the sub-headers alone.Use numbered and bulleted lists wherever possible to make content more digestible.Front load your sentences so that the main idea is early on, and so readers don\u2019t have to read every single word to get by.Your CTA Isn\u2019t the Story\u2019s End. It\u2019s the CliffhangerYour landing page told the story, now your CTA is a way for your prospects\u2019 to create their own stories. Make this part of your call-to-action language. For instance, \u201cDo you want to expand your business like John? Get in touch by filling out the form below and see how John did it.\u201dOr, \u201cStop banging your head against the wall and discover the solution that will save you time, money, and constant frustration. Click the button below and find out how to put this stress-free solution into action starting today!\u201d\u00a0ConclusionA properly constructed landing page can do wonders for a brand\u2019s bottom line. Sadly, too few brands use storytelling, which is a powerful technique for remaining on your prospects\u2019 minds. You now have the ins and outs of storytelling for landing pages which should have a significant impact on your B2B audience.Author Bio: Ryan Gould is the Vice President of Strategy and Marketing Services at Elevation Marketing, a B2B marketing agency.

Optimizing for purchase conversions can be very difficult at first, but a lead capture campaign is easier to set up and you can get much more value out of it right from the get go.Why do email lead capture campaigns work?You\u2019re going for a much easier conversion (getting their email address), so your advertising dollars don\u2019t go to waste trying to convert for purchases.It\u2019s much easier to setup, and there\u2019s not as much optimization required as you would need if you\u2019re trying to get purchase conversions.Once you have the leads, you can use the Facebook pixel cookie to retarget your customers, which is the #1 most profitable Facebook ads campaign you can run.Emails can be used to build up your audience even when you don\u2019t have a product to target them with. (Great for future product launches.)You offer some kind of valuable freebie that builds brand relationship with your target customer.What are the cons of an email lead capture campaign?You need a strong email marketing drip sequence to activate that customer to purchase.It\u2019s a 2-part conversion, so you need to have your funnel right, otherwise your ads will still be unprofitable.If you can get the purchase with your ads without lead capture, this brings in more direct revenue and it\u2019s easier to measure.Basically if you can get a profitable purchase campaign going, lead capture is a secondary campaign you can run alongside your purchase campaign, but it should be relegated to only a fraction of your budget at this point. (However, if you can\u2019t get a profitable purchase campaign, then the lead capture campaign is king).Let\u2019s get\u00a0started.What you will learn:How to setup your offer (viral giveaway or lead magnet).How to set up your Facebook ecosystem (pixels, audiences and accounts).How to setup the best Facebook prospecting campaign to get your giveaway generating leads straight out of the gates (starting the snowball). The more momentum you can build the more emails you will generate from your giveaway.How to use Facebook remarketing ads to turn those new visitors into customers and start generating a ROI before your giveaway even ends.Setting up your\u00a0offerOption 1: Viral Contest + Lead Magnet Combo using VYPERViral contest are like snowballs, once they start rolling they get bigger and bigger and become unstoppable customer acquisition machines!This helps make your lead-gen campaign 2x more profitable, as each lead you acquire via Facebook ads can turn into 1.5 leads on average.Haven\u2019t created a contest yet? Sign up for a VYPER account to immediately to kick start your viral marketing strategy.VYPER also has built in lead magnet delivery (or we call them opt-in bribes).Option 2: Alternatively, you can setup a solo lead magnet.Don\u2019t want to start a giveaway? Awwww.If you just want to offer a solo lead magnet, like a PDF or a coupon, you can do that with tools like Unbounce.This requires a bit of work as you\u2019ll need to design a lead magnet, create your landing page, etc. You can also use a tool like Beacon to create your lead magnets.We highly recommend doing a viral giveaway as it\u2019s pretty cheap/easy to setup and you\u2019re going to get the most signups from this.Basics: Setting up Facebook CorrectlyYou will need to start off with a few basics. The bare minimum you need is a Facebook personal account and a personal ad account BUT we highly suggest following the below steps for setting up your Facebook ecosystem properly by using a Facebook Business account.Below is a list of things you need to do right now:Login to your personal Facebook profile, pretty much everyone has one of these.Get a Facebook business account to get your sh*t organized, create a business account, a few benefits to this type of account is:Add multiple users,Manage multiple ad accounts,Manage multiple Facebook pages,Create multiple Pixels (you can also share these with other accounts as there is 1 pixel ID per ad account)Create product catalogs (used for dynamic product ads)Better Audiences and insights controlHere is an overview of the Facebook business account if you need more convincingCreate a Facebook ad account which is super easy to add within your new Facebook business account manager. You can also easily add your billing information to your ad account once it is set up. Facebook restricts your ad spend to start with and you have to work your way up from a $25 credit limit. They trust NO ONE!If you run into trouble with any of this set up, Facebook has a great support portal that not too many people know about this portal, so the response times are good. You can contact Facebook reps through live chat or email.IMPORTANT: Using\u00a0pixelsThe reason why Facebook is such a great marketing channel is the use of their Pixels and being able to optimize ads to a specific goal (Pixel\u200a\u2014\u200aie. the signup success page of our giveaway).WTF is a pixel?\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a snippet of code that is added to a website page that collects information on the users that views/visits the page. This information is then sent back to Facebook so you can build audiences, track conversions and create look-a-like audiences.Using pixels in your marketing mix is important because we can set ads to optimize to these pixels. Again, in a nutshell, this tells Facebook who to serve our ads to and target people who are most likely to achieve our goal and convert (i.e. get to our signup success page of our giveaway).Pixel breakdown:Below we will go into how to add pixels to our giveaway so don\u2019t worry if this is sounding complicated at the moment, it is super easy!Overview: Facebook Ads ExplainedYou will want to either use the Facebook Ads Manager (basic) or the Facebook Power Editor (advanced) to set up your ads, these are the two different methods for launching ads on Facebook.Power Editor ProsSearch functionality for ads and bulk editingNo BS when setting up adsAdding UTM tags and pixels is easySetting up dynamic product adsCreating canvas adsPower Editor ConsVery hard to gauge ad performance and metricsHorrible for optimizing adsYou kind of have to know what you are doing to use this platformEasy to make mistakesAd Manager ProsEasy UX and definitely a smaller learning curveMuch better metric and optimization selectionFiltering data functions are awesome (age, demo, placement etc.)Very visual for ad creation and steps users through the setupAd Manager ConsSlows down your computer a lot when trying to do too much at onceLoads data slowlyHaving to make bulk edits is hardSo now you should know if you need to use Power Editor or Ads Manager, a lot of people get these two confused. They do the exact same thing (create ads) but just in different ways. I do suggest using power editor to create ads then ads manager to optimize ads.Choosing your ad type:Click ads\u200a\u2014\u200athis ad is for 1200x628 size images, there is plenty of space to visually show a CTA on one side of the image and a lifestyle or product on the other. This is one of the most common ad types.Carousel ads\u200a\u2014\u200athese ads are a lot more creative, they are usually have the advantage of being able to relay more information to web users as these ads have multiple images, headlines and descriptions.Canvas ads\u200a\u2014\u200athis is a relatively new one and helps you create a \u201cmicro landing page\u201d within the Facebook platform. This can be a great way to educate your leads before sending them to your actual website.Creating Your Contest Ad CampaignsWe\u2019re assuming that you took our advice and decided to make a contest for your lead capture campaign. GREAT! If you didn\u2019t and you decided to use a lead magnet, that\u2019s fine as well, but replace the words \u201cgiveaway\u201d or \u201ccontest\u201d with \u201clead magnet.\u201dOnward\u2026We are going to go over 2 campaigns that you need to set up when running your giveaway. The first is to capture the interest of people who will be most likely to enter your giveaway and the second is to re-engage those who have entered your giveaway or shown interest in it.1. The Contest PostWe need get our contest out there and seen by the world. So the best way to do that is to create a high quality ad that has a good Click Through Rate (CTR) and is optimized to the (lead) pixel we are going to place on the contest entered success page.Quick guide on how to set these pixels up in VYPER (note, you must have the PRO account for tracking pixels to be allowed).Create/login to your Facebook Ad accountAdd the Facebook pixels to your contest page. This can be done on the settings step when creating your giveaway. We are placing the \u201cPageView\u201d (all pages) and \u201cLead\u201d (thank you page) pixel.\u00a0NOTE\u200a\u2014\u200aif you are already using the pageview pixel simply rename the pixel. Change \u201cfbq(\u2018track\u2019, \u201cPageView\u201d); to fbq(\u2018track\u2019, \u201cContestPage\u201d);.Create your Ad. We are using the carousel ad to show off all the products that we are giving away. The CTR is usually better on these ads as you can provide more information before paying Facebook for the click through to your contest page. Meaning you can validate the user/click better.Create a list of your competitors. This will help target people who are already interested in what you sell (product or information).\u00a0E.g. We ran a giveaway for HumbleBody.com (hemp based skincare products) so we collected a list of other organic skin care brands.Create your campaign, I use the following naming convention to keep my campaigns descriptive and organized\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cleads / contest / competitors\u201d. This helps define our campaign \u201cconversion goal / content type / targeting type\u201d and I also use the UTM builder and the camping name to see the traffic in Google Analytics.\u00a0Below is an example of the link that I would use in my ads.Source = facebookMedium = cpcCampaign = leads / contest / competitorsCreate your ad sets, I usually break these out into the interest group or placement. For Humble Body we create 6 ad sets making the interest different in each ad set.Decl\u00e9orOlivellaJuaraTata Harper Skin Care\u2026\u2026.. and a few othersFor the bidding strategy set a lifetime budget and automatically optimized to your offsite conversion pixel (Lead). A lifetime budget is easier to manage and Facebook\u2019s optimization algorithms are not forced to spend your full daily budget which prevents you from wasting money! Once you have run a few campaigns you can then switch to daily budgets.Now you are ready to launch your ad campaign. Make sure your ads are set to run only while the giveaway is accepting entries so set the ad end date 1 day before your giveaway end date.2. The Contest Remarketing CampaignNow that you know that people want your product (they visited your contest page) you can set up some remarketing ads to engage these people again. Returning visitors are 7x times more likely to complete a conversion goal than a first time visitor.Quick guide on how to set these up:Create your custom audience from the PageView pixel we placed above. I usually break out my audiences into 10 or 15 day increments from when someone visited. So my audience naming convention would be\u200a\u2014\u200aPageView (15), PageView (30) and PageView (180).Go to your audience page in Facebook manager and choose create audience. You can find this page from the mega dropdown, click on the \u201caudience\u201d menu item.Create a new audience using the website traffic tab. These are the best audiences to create as they automatically update as more people visit the page unlike uploaded lists that need to be constantly uploaded to stay relevant and up to date.Create a custom combination audience. Using custom combinations allows you to include and exclude certain traffic so this can be a very powerful tool.Choose the event for traffic conditions. We use the event instead of the URL as this is a more accurate method of collecting data on our website visitors.Select the pixel \u201cPageView\u201d if you want the audience to be even more targeted you can choose the \u201cLead\u201d pixel that we placed above, this smaller audience will serve ads to the people who have opted-into your giveaway.Create your campaign I use the name \u201cretargeting / contest visitors / female\u201d. I like to create a male and female campaign so I can optimize by gender. This means pausing ads and ad sets that are not performing well (CPA or CTR too high).Create your ad sets, I usually break these out into the time periods mentioned above so for example \u201c0\u201315 / contest visitor / mobile\u201d and \u201c0\u201315 / contest visitor / desktop\u201dCreate an ad that has a special value proposition for people who have already visited your contest or page. For example we offered a 10% discount for our remarketing campaign.\u00a0E.g. Still looking for that perfect \u201cxxxx\u201d, come back and get 10% off your first order with the coupon code \u201cxxxx\u201d.Once you have created the Audiences and ads you are ready to go live and start making some money!So there you have it, the killer combination of Facebook ads and giveaways. This tactic works for bringing in new visitors to your website through the incentive of the giveaway as well as recapture those visitors with an incentivised remarketing ad.With this tactic you can collect emails and generate sales from new prospects.Tips for\u00a0FacebookWhen creating your ads test 3\u20134 images and text variations to see which ad combinations get the best conversion and clickthrough rates. You can then pause the ads that are not performing well to save some cash.Aim to have an audiences that has at least 1000+ people in it as the minimum Facebook daily budget is $5/day. You want your audiences to be target but still have enough people in them so that your ads run at a reasonable frequency (e.g. we do not want 1 person to see our ad 10 times in a day).Optimize your ads to the Facebook pixels. Facebook do a pretty good job at automatically optimizing your ads for the best ROI. It is worth setting some benchmarks though as you can\u2019t simply do whatever Facebook says. See how much your are paying for the below are compare to industry benchmarks:Lead (aim for $1\u20134 for a basic email sign up)Click through (aim for a CTR above 0.5%)Cost per click (aim for a CPC under $3)Note that all of these metrics will depend on the type of industry and niche you are in.Pause ads that have no conversions (Leads) and a high spend. This is why we separate out the interest groups, gender and days since a visitor hit your website. You will probably find your product is best suited to a certain gender, interest and that the 0\u201315 day period since visiting your website perform better than others.BONUS\u200a\u2014\u200aIf you want to utilize your Facebook pixels for more than just your giveaway check out some of the options below how on to install the pixels across your entire website.Here is the Facebook guide to setting up pixels on your website, if this is a little too much we suggest using a plugin within your CMS.Essentially you need to place the \u201cPageView\u201d pixel in the header template of your website, you will need the Facebook Chrome browser extension to see if the pixel is firing correctly.Here are guides to adding pixels to the most popular CMS\u2019s:Wordpress (setup guide)ShopfyMagentoThe pixels I like to add to my website are:PageView (we can also create custom pixels for contest pages)Lead (used for giveaways, email capture tools etc.)AddToCart (used for abandoned cart)InitiateCheckout (used for abandon checkout)Purchase (make sure you have dynamic checkout values on this pixel)The first two were the pixels we used in our giveaway settings.If you have any questions about this strategy please leave a comment below are I will personally answer it for you!

Also, we submitted the giveaway to few sweepstakes and giveaway sites as well.Sending the giveaway to our existing email list may sound counterintuitive, but we were sure that we\u2019d get a fair amount of referral traffic. We knew they would want to enter themselves and will post the contest on their own social media channels to get entries. They\u2019d also share the contest with their friends through email as they\u2019d want more referral points.Key TakeawayMake sure you include a lot of information in your giveaway landing page.Promote your giveaway to your own list first as these people probably know similar people who would be in your target audience.Aim for a high value prize pools, Photo", "responses": ""}, {"title": "6 Ways to Improve Your Website Popup Conversion Rate", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/6-ways-to-improve-your-website-popup-conversion-rate-efa47e3f104d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 15, 2017", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "6 Ways to Improve Your Website Popup Conversion RateVYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 15, 2017SummaryEasy, actionable steps to improve your website popup. More emails mean more traffic which means more sales!This short but detailed guide will require you to stop and think about your user for a second then really build and deliver something that will add value to them.Value, not annoyance is the key to a successful popup!Why You Need To Update Your Website\u00a0PopupsA very common question that many website and business owners ask is \u201cHow to I grow my email list without spending money on advertising or annoying my visitors\u201d.The good news is, there are hundreds of ways to do this, but we are going to go over the most important one.Using website popups are one of the most common and effective ways to turn a website visitor into an email subscriber.Over the years, the results and methods of collecting emails has become harder and more advanced. Website users are becoming a lot more protective of their email address and to be honest they should be. There are more emails being sent than ever and the internet is full of spam!There are also now ad blockers, Google penalties and privacy concerns to overcome.At this point, you\u2019re probably thinking that using popups to collect emails sounds too hard, you can\u2019t beat Google!Don\u2019t Give Up, This Is Why You Still Need\u00a0PopupsHaving worked with many clients to grow their business, time and time again we see that the more successful ones have good email lists.Email is the one audience you can OWN.It is by far one of the most effective ways to generate sales, traffic to your website and engagement. No matter how many people say email is dying we are yet to see another source be as consistent, personal or advanced as email.The conversion rate and profit per user is still higher than most other channels and there is no large controlling entities that are going to change the rules on you overnight.For example, YouTubers lost all their revenue overnight as Google changed the T&C\u2019s for displaying ads on videos or how Facebook or AdWords can shut down your account at any moment if you do something that is not to their liking.An email list you can take with you, you get plenty of warning if you are starting to annoy people and they are recoverable. A banned Facebook account is not.6 Ways To Improve Your Website\u00a0PopupSo, let\u2019s get into the valuable stuff now that you know why building an email list is so important. You may already have a popup or form that is collecting you emails but I bet you still want more?Below is a list of small tweaks you can make to your website popups to improve their conversion rates.1. Frequency and cookie\u00a0lengthMake sure that you are using a service that does not show your pop up again after the user has subscribed.Generally, you want to wait 24\u201348 hours before showing your pop up again to someone who did not opt-in. If someone has signed up, you never want to show them the same popup again as the popup has done its job.2. TimingYour popup needs to show at the right time to avoid annoying your visitors. When will this pop up be relevant to them, when is the right time to ask for their email?Immediately?After they read some content?After they view a product?When they\u2019re about to leave?You want to make sure you are adding value first then asking your visitor for something in return.Most of the time we suggest people set their popup when a user is intending to leave. This makes sure to show the popup to everyone but also only shows it once the visitor has finished doing what they came to do.Also, the exit intent popup can be a way to make visitors stay longer.E.g. If a pop up offered a discount on signup that user may sign up then go back to browsing your website to use the coupon. You have then re-engaged that browser instead of them leaving. Potentially even turned them into a customer.If you were to show that popup at the start of the browsing experience you would by saying you are already willing to discount your product before they have even looked at it.Other methods we would suggest are 80% of page scroll or around 10 seconds on site as a study by Quicksprout.com showed this to have the highest conversion rate.They also tested exit intent as a trigger and found that it increased conversions by 46%.In short, if you have the option to use \u201cexit intent\u201d as a popup trigger, USE it!3. DeviceYou need to show your popup on the correct device. Stop and go through your website on mobile and desktop as a first-time user.Go on, take a second to go and do that now.If the popup was annoying or hard to opt-into on mobile, consider removing your popup from visitors on mobile.A few common reasons to remove you popup from mobile are:website is slow to load on mobileyou have too much text on the popupyou have too many form fieldsyour popup conflicts with share button or website functionalityGoogle is going to start to penalize websites with popups on mobileThe signup process needs to take less than 10 seconds for a visitor to complete.4. User experienceImprove the experience of the popup, make it easy to signup or close. Limit the amount of required fields (name and email) and have a large close option or a \u201cno thanks\u201d option.A trick here is to have the \u201cno thanks\u201d option make them second guess not signing up. E.g. if we ran a coffee website my popup could say:Pop up pitch\u200a\u2014\u200a6 barista approved coffee making tips for better brewing at home!CTA to signup\u200a\u2014\u200aSend me the tipsCTA to close\u200a\u2014\u200aNo thanks, I like horrible coffee5. The\u00a0OfferUsing \u201csignup for website updates\u201d is a terrible offer. Please don\u2019t use that!People may be interested in your brand and want updates but using this super boring offer is a sure way to decrease your conversion rate.People usually respond better to:IncentivizationGamificationYou need to either incentivize someone to take action or entertain them. So now you are wondering how the \u201cF\u201d do I do that with a pop up?See the gamified popup example we created below (VYPER shameless plug).Ways to incentivize someone to join your mailing listOffer knowledge (courses, ebook, case studies)Offer solutions (guides, free service or tool)Offer a way to save time (templates, lists)Offer a way to save money (coupons)Ways to gamifyThink outside the box, how can this experience be fun for the userSee the example above6. The Copy &\u00a0VoiceThis aspect of your pop up is the one that varies the most from business to business. You need to ask yourself a few things about your website visitors.What are common phases they use (industry lingo)?What is the voice/tone (serious, funny, laid back)?How to include a call to action (sign up vs send me the tips)?How aggressive can you make the pitch (buy now vs learn more)?What are their pain points?What solutions are they looking for?Do they respond to saving time or money more?One of the best ways to really understand your customer is to build a persona of your ideal customer or website visitor.Do some research and find out what the best age, gender, income status etc is and then that will also help you answer the above questions.Once you understand your user it is much easier to write copy that will resonate with them.SummaryNow that you have all the knowledge to build an awesome popup. Take some time to think and really breakdown your current website popup.Some of these tips will take less than 15min to execute but return better results forever.Do you use popups on your website?

I\u2019m going to guess and say growth is in the top 3!If not, well done, you\u2019re doing better than 99% of businesses wishing they had more/faster growth.This post is a list of the most creative marketing ideas we\u2019ve seen customers of VYPER implement and get amazing results from. Whether it be growing their email list, video engagement, social channels. app store rankings or hacking their Facebook ad engagement. This stuff is gold!Idea 1\u200a\u2014\u200aUser Generated Content Through InstagramEveryone can see a stock or brand photo/image from a mile away! You\u2019re not fooling anyone. A little growth hack around this is using user-generated content in your emails, ads and on your website.The trick is getting this user-generated content without spending a ton of money or hours asking for it, following up and dealing with Dropbox links.The easy way to automate this and get a ton of user-generated content!Step 1\u200a\u2014\u200aCreate an evergreen contest that is part of your purchase email drip (triggers after someone purchases from you). Make sure the customer gets this email containing your contest after they have received their product.Step 2\u200a\u2014\u200aChoose a prize e.g. $500 gift card, 50% off your next order or a free/complimentary product.Step 3\u200a\u2014\u200aCreate a contest that requires people to upload a photo to Instagram, the photo has guidelines like (it has to be you using the product). If you do not want people to upload it to Instagram you can also choose the direct upload bonus entry, the Instagram entry just gets you a little bonus social impressions!(Selection of bonus entries for your contest. Choose \u201cpost a photo to IG\u201d or \u201cUpload an Image\u201d)Step 4\u200a\u2014\u200aWatch those entries roll in! Here\u2019s an example of the contest if you want to take a look.Idea 2\u200a\u2014\u200aHack the Facebook Relevancy Ad\u00a0ScoreFacebook\u2019s all the rage, but unfortunately, like all good things, the effectiveness is decreasing every year.Organic reach is dropping, engagement is dropping and CPA\u2019s (cost per acquisition) are increasing!What do you do when things like this happen? Innovate and find ways to \u201cgame\u201d the system, that\u2019s exactly what this marketing tactic is about.So what do you do!Step 1\u200a\u2014\u200aCreate a contest with the bonus entry of liking, commenting and sharing a Facebook post you create. Make sure this post that you create is adding value and has a soft sales pitch in it, like an educational video with a discount and link to the purchase page in the text area (we will want to turn this into an ad later).Here\u2019s and Example contest.Make sure to ask people to do all three actions. You can ask them from 1 bonus entry or make a separate bouns entry for each engagement type.Step 2\u200a\u2014\u200aRun and promote the contest. Add it to your website, email your list, run some ads etc. Over the duration of this contest, you will start to collect hundreds of social engagements.Step 3\u200a\u2014\u200aWhen you have enough social engagement, a good number is 100+ likes, comments, and shares, turn that post into an ad.Step 4\u200a\u2014\u200aScale this Facebook post to the audiences you want to target and benefit from the higher CTR\u2019s, engagement rates and relevancy scores. By using this method you can show social proof and build engagement for free.By having more social proof, your ad becomes \u201cscroll stopping\u201d, people are much more likely to stop and notice your post if it has hundreds of likes compared to a brand new ad with nothing.Idea 3\u200a\u2014\u200aCheat YouTube EngagementYouTube is one of the most under-utilized platforms there is. A lot of people don\u2019t realize this but it\u2019s actually the 2nd biggest search engine. Yes, Google owns everything!It\u2019s a fantastic place to upload all your video content; branding videos, tutorials, how to videos, testimonials, product launches, webinar replays and more. You should be uploading and organizing all the content you can on this channel.One of the best ways to prove authority is to have videos with lots of views, thumbs up and comments. Organically this is not easy, you have to get lucky, work really hard at engaging viewers or wait a super long time before you get anything impressive.The hack for this is to incentivize these actions using your contest. Not only are you collecting leads but why not put those leads to work.Step 1\u200a\u2014\u200aSet up your contest, set a reward, pick a contest type (flash contest or an evergreen contest which is when you pick 1 winner a month or week). Example.Step 2\u200a\u2014\u200aAdd your bonus entries for YouTube, you can also do this for Vimeo or other video content directories!Step 3\u200a\u2014\u200aAdd that contest to your checkout page, email drips, social channels or website.Idea 4\u200a\u2014\u200aEvergreen ContestThis is one of the easiest ways to keep your social accounts growing and your existing customers, followers and leads feeling special.See an example evergreen contest that we actually use and is live\u200a\u2014\u200aHEREThis is the example banner we also use in our emails and on social to get people to enter our evergreen contest. Make your images stand out, explain what the prize is and if you can, the value of it to them!A few reasons why you would want to use this marketing strategy.It\u2019s a great addition to your email drips for leads and customers. Keeps them excited to open your emails.It keeps your social channels growing (followers, shares etc).You have a constant stream of new leads into your funnel and they are referring others just like themselves.You can get people to constantly be sharing your content (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, any channel).You can change up the bonus actions every month depending on what your monthly goals are (One month we wanted to incentivize signups to our webinar, the next we wanted to grow our YouTube video views).This also gives you a great landing page to promote when you sponsor events, speak at events, guest appearances on podcasts, run joint promotions & email blasts as well as provide influencers with something to promote that people can actually benefit from instead of just asking for a sale.The beautiful thing is that when you send people to this evergreen contest, it looks like you\u2019re doing them a favor by offering something for free. But you are actually collecting their email as well as incentivizing them to complete a whole list of actions.Just look at all the things we made you do in our monthly contest above.Here\u2019s the email we added to an email drip to re-engage people who have created a VYPER account but not activated a paid plan. We know they are interested so maybe a free product will incentivize them to come back to our website.It also squeezes a bit of value out of them if they go and complete all the bonus actions of following us on social, sharing our content and leaving us a review.More ways to promote the evergreen contest:Add it to more email drips (leads, free trials, customers etc)Add to your website & blog/postsUse as a content upgrade on your blogShare on podcasts or at events etc.Add to your payment confirmation page or emailsAdd to your lead form or popup confirmation pageShare with affiliates & influencers as marketing materialPut it in your email signatureAdd to all your social profiles (also make a post and pin it to the top of your page/feed)Having this asset in your marketing toolkit gives you an asset that provides value and is easily shared and managed. Once you create the contest, just draw a winner and move the end date one month back on the last day of every month.Idea 5\u200a\u2014\u200aGet to the Top of the Podcast\u00a0ChartsPodcasting is now a great awareness and authority building channel. Not only do you produce a TON of content but it\u2019s now very doable with the advancements in recording and self-publishing.You can create an educational or interview style podcasts to build an audience of listeners to then one day sell to (I know that sounds bad but that\u2019s the point of the podcast. Give value, get sales in return).I\u2019ve personally been on a few podcasts now (open guest requests hint hint) but the one thing that always comes up is how to market your podcast and get more reviews to increase your ranking in the iTunes store (the most common one, there are others like Twitch etc).A great way to do this is\u2026. You guessed it, incentivize it.This works really well for the launch of a podcast, two podcasts that I guest spoke on LaunchPeer and The Social Media Growth Show used a contest to grow their listeners/subscribers and game the podcast charts early on to appear in the top podcasts for business.The way they did this was using a launch contest.You can see the contest was giving away a prize that would attract the right people (marketers and business owners). These were the people that LaunchPeer wanted to listen to their Podcast.This contest generated 13 five star reviews (probably more by now as I wrote this while the contest was running), a bunch of social shares and YouTube subscribers within the first few days of launch getting it ranked high in the iTunes podcast charts.Below are a few of the bonus entries that this company used to get people engaged with their new podcast. The goal is to get your new podcast in as many social feeds as possible and collect as many subscribers and reviews within the first week as possible.The early signs of traction are rewarded with higher placement in the iTunes store and even the possibility of being featured at the top of your category, remember to choose a sub-category to increase your chances.For example, instead of choosing Business, choose Business -> eCommerce as your primary category.Here\u2019s also a great post on how to get to the top of the iTunes podcast charts.In summary, it all comes down to sending engaged traffic that\u2019s subscribing, reviewing and downloading your podcast. All of that is possible through your launch contest\u00a0;)Idea 6\u200a\u2014\u200aIncentivize App DownloadsWhat determines the success of an app? Downloads, daily and monthly active users usually. Revenue comes into play once you have these things in place (there\u2019re always exceptions but this is a general growth cycle for a mobile app.)For the revenue to happen you need the downloads, this is the first step and the direct response conversion goal to optimize to.Paying for downloads and installs can get expansive $3\u201315 CPA\u2019s are common depending on your industry, For example, an install on a free game is going to have a way cheaper CPA than a paid finance app.A little hack we have seen VYPER customers using to cut their CPA\u2019s is including the app download from iOS and Play Store in their contest.We recently added a templated bonus entry for this due to demand for app contests. Not only that but you can also use the entries to incentivize other actions to improve your app marketing efforts. Example.Leave a star ratingLeave a comment reviewShare the app launch on TwitterShare your app download page on FacebookThe list goes on as these are customizable actions you can create.What Next? It\u2019s your turn!This week, go and implement at least one of these marketing strategies. You do not have to use VYPER, you can manually recreate these same viral campaigns (it\u2019s just a little harder, we make your life easier at VYPER \ud83d\ude01)I\u2019m sure your head is filled with ideas at this point and hopefully, some of these hacks will give you some actionable tasks to better market your product, app or service.If you have any questions or hacks to add, leave them in the comments below!", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Compelling + Relevant = Good Giveaways", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/compelling-relevant-good-giveaways-2e85e9cb81b2?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 18, 2016", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "Compelling + Relevant = Good GiveawaysVYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 18, 2016Quick post today.So I happened to listen to two really good interviews today, and I was pleasantly surprised that both interviewees talked about viral giveaways as part of their promotional strategy.The first one was an interview with Josh Payne on Mixergy. In the interview he spoke about how StackSocial used giveaways to build a $10m+ empire without touching any outside funding (they raised $800,000 but never used any of it).I got one really great line from this interview. Payne said for giveaways to work, you should offer something that\u2019s compelling + relevant. That\u2019s a really good way to put it. One of the biggest issues I see from giveaways that don\u2019t succeed is that they don\u2019t fit with one or the other\u200a\u2014\u200aeven worse if they don\u2019t meet both.But finding that balance that can be tough. Giving away something that\u2019s not super relevant will hurt the quality of your leads. Giving away something that\u2019s really compelling might end up being too expensive. The tough part to giveaways is finding that balance. We wrote a series of blog posts that attack this topic (check out the blog posts re: the funnels).He also mentioned that he gives away free products. That\u2019s another feature built into the pro version of VYPER called \u201copt-in bribes\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awe give you the ability to give away free stuff to people who won\u2019t even win.The second interview was with The Drip Club founders on the Growth Everywhere podcast, where they talked about giving away 6-figures worth of retail value through giveaways and how much it helped build up their brand.The big takeaway from this interview was that you can giveaway 6-figures of stuff without actually having to pay for any of it. This is done by building up your brand. Once you have a big brand, companies are willing to give you free stuff.If you\u2019re looking to start your next giveaway, why not try VYPER?", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Case Study: How Biostrap 4x\u2019d Their Popup Conversion Rate & Collected 25k Emails in 2\u00a0Months", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/case-study-how-biostrap-4xd-their-popup-conversion-rate-collected-25k-emails-in-2-months-4cfea868656e?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 22, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "Case Study: How Biostrap 4x\u2019d Their Popup Conversion Rate & Collected 25k Emails in 2\u00a0MonthsVYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 22, 2018Summary\u200a\u2014\u200aBiostrap recently switched over to the Interactive Popups tool and had some pretty awesome results to share. So we compiled a quick Q&A session to see what really moved the needle.30% of this website\u2019s revenue comes from email so you can imagine how even a small % increase email opt-in conversion rate could snowball into huge profits.1. Why did you add a popup to your\u00a0website?Across all our user acquisition channels, we were sending lots of top of funnel traffic during the busiest shopping months of November and December.We added a popup to capture emails on our landing pages to make the most of this traffic. Email is one of the most import acquisition channels for us as we sell a higher priced item so conversion on the first touch point is lower than cheaper eCommerce sites.It usually takes a number of brand interactions to get the conversion.

The time might just be right to start contemplating your own content marketing campaigns for the festive season.The cost to advertise over November and December increased by 2\u20133x so be prepared and avoid some of these common holiday marketing mistakes.Customers are likely to spend a staggering 80+ billion dollars in the US alone come the holidays, and most online stores see a spike in traffic as soon as the weather turns chilly (United States).And while there are certain industries that are certainly better suited to holiday campaigns (take the example of John Lewis), that\u2019s not saying you can\u2019t do something special this season and spread some holiday cheer.However, while getting into the festive mood can do you no actual harm, there are certain things you should avoid\u200a\u2014\u200aso as not to find yourself standing alone under a mistletoe with no customers in sight.Here\u2019s our list of Christmas holiday marketing mistakes\u200a\u2014\u200ados and don\u2019ts!SourceDon\u2019t sell:\u00a0giveDespite the above-listed enormous earning potential, and even though many a shopper will naturally associate the word \u201cChristmas\u201d with the word \u201cdiscount\u201d, the holiday season is not a time for hardball pitches and forced sales.It is the season of giving, after all, so your focus should shift to providing useful and shareable freebies, rather than coming up with the best way to outmaneuver your competition in terms of discount percentages.Freebies are a great lead generation tool even in the dead of summer, and they can go a lot further in terms of brand awareness and customer satisfaction during the end of the year frenzy.Come up with a lead or link generating a piece of content (either a video, an e-book, perhaps a case study or even an infographic) that you will specifically promote during the run-up to Christmas.It does not necessarily have to be Christmas themed itself (after all, evergreen content tends to provide a higher ROI than seasonal content), but packaging it up as a seasonal gift can go a long way in terms of promoting it.Don\u2019t be a Grinch: publish and leverage holiday\u00a0contentEven if you are not a huge fan of the holidays, or if you are not planning to publish any Christmas-themed content, don\u2019t be the one who refuses to engage in the festivities. No one likes a Grinch, and dampening others\u2019 spirits is not the best way to win people over.The holiday season is an incredible time to take advantage of user-generated content, which will all likely be seasonally themed.Start up a bit of a competition on your social media requesting the best pictures of gingerbread cookies or Christmas decorations (or anything else that is both festive and in line with your brand and product) and share and promote the best ones.Reward a particularly inventive creation with yet another freebie (in the form of a discount or actual product) without announcing you will do so. Your followers will appreciate the thoughtfulness.Bear in mind that these types of promotions can get hectic and very competitive. Be prepared to set out clear rules and even face some backlash even if you have not done anything \u201cwrong\u201d.Don\u2019t recycle: be\u00a0originalSome companies do Christmas exceptionally well. And even if your particular industry does not lend itself to over the top holiday campaigns, and you are sorely tempted to take a leaf out of someone else\u2019s book and recreate their ten-year-old campaign: don\u2019t.Customers tend to remember beloved holiday campaigns, and you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they call you out for being a copycat. You can\u2019t reinvent Santa or the reindeer anyway.All you need to do is find a unique angle that represents your brand\u2019s identity and sprinkle some glitter over it.Focus on the main elements of the Christmas season: spreading joy, giving, selflessness. Or even on some other running themes, like snow, nutmeg, gingerbread or even Christmas lights.You don\u2019t have to invent a brand new content marketing campaign that will only run for a month or two. Try to figure out how you can add these elements into the campaigns you are already running to give them a unique twist.Don\u2019t assume it\u2019s business as\u00a0usualWhile the holidays are undoubtedly a season of joy, they are also a season of mounting frustration. Don\u2019t expect your customers to behave as they do on any other day of the week.First of all, take into account the heightened stress levels, the shortened timespans they have to get things done, the fact that they are literally swimming in advertising every single day, and you will understand why they might be a little less patient and forgiving than usual.Do all that you can to provide a port in the storm: make your content lightweight and lighthearted, focus on the positive, and don\u2019t lose your own temper.The content you provide at this time of year can more specifically focus on the pain point solving variety. You\u2019ll notice the subtle difference it makes in your engagement rates.Also, make sure that your customer service and communication teams are ready to go: no matter how you are promoting your content, you will be chatting to all sorts of seasonally stressed individuals. And if your campaigns run well, you can expect a surge in inquiries and purchases.Don\u2019t forget to be prepared for them in every department.Don\u2019t pass up corny copywriting opportunities: leverage the spirit of the\u00a0seasonAdding holiday buzzwords to your blog titles and email subject lines is not going to cut it. If you are not going to put a red cap on and get into the festive mood, don\u2019t falsely represent your content as being holiday themed.If you are going to mention the holidays in your titles, do make sure the actual content is to some extent similarly themed as well.A lot of campaigns package ordinary subjects (like the five best ways to drive more leads through guest posting) into something with a Christmas flare (like the five lessons we can learn from Santa Clause to improve our outreach campaigns).You can easily borrow motifs and themes from holiday books, movies or even carols, and apply them to your regular content producing subjects.If it feels too forced, or if you are simply not the kind of company that would produce such content, don\u2019t try to emulate a false holiday cheer. You will come off as phoney, and that will not fly well with your readers.Don\u2019t forget the Christmas cardsFailing to send out Christmas cards would be a huge mistake. All your leads and customers would surely appreciate a nice card celebrating the season.Don\u2019t turn it into a discount code or sales pitch either, which is what most companies tend to do. By all means, offer a discount code or do a seasonal sale, but don\u2019t put it in the Christmas card.Just stick to the good wishes, and return to marketing when the holidays are over. That way, you will be perceived as less of a corporation and more of a human entity.Mailchimp recently opened up the feature to start sending direct physical mail via a postcard, CRAZY I know!Don\u2019t wait until the last\u00a0minuteWhichever route you choose: going all in and producing a holiday advent content calendar, with a new piece of Christmas-related content for every single day of the month, or laying low and nodding on while the festive season is over, you need to prepare on time.If you are going to do something seasonal, make sure you start early. While late summer might not seem the right time to get into a holiday mood, the end of October would be just the right time to start brainstorming ideas and toying with different concepts.If you wait until December, everyone else\u2019s campaigns will already have started, and you will be forced to play catchup.Set out a time when you will start working on the holiday content in advance, and see how your ideas evolve over time.That way, you will both be able to track what your competition is doing (or not doing) and come up with your own take on this Christmas season.Good Luck!Even if you are not the biggest fan of the holidays, joining in on all the festive fun is the surest way to reach new leads and customers, and engage with the following you already have.Be a little bit less serious, and try to forget about conversion statistics and all those other metrics you keep focusing on throughout the year.If the main goal of your Christmas campaign is to sell, and that remains your only focus, you will be losing out on a lot.There\u2019s a reason why storytelling is huge in marketing: consumers like to connect with a brand before they purchase from it, and Christmas time is the perfect time to establish and strengthen this relationship.Feature post author: Anita Sambol is a content strategist and graphic designer at Point Visible digital marketing agency.

All you are doing is rewarding a few entries into your contest for doing so instead of having to pay Facebook for an engagement campaign.PRO TIP\u200a\u2014\u200achose a post that you are running ads to. This will increase the engagement on your paid post and get you a better relevancy score as well as improve your CPM which should lead to lower conversion rates and higher click-through rates.Here are some Facebook ad results from a recent client that used this technique.

They chose a popular post and got people to read the post, comment and share it. It is now the most commented on a blog post with some of the highest shares and traffic numbers.For the question, ask them what their main takeaway was from the blog post. Or you can ask them, \u201cwhat was the blog post about\u201d.PRO TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aBy asking for feedback on the post you can also relay this to the content team to see what people thought about the post.

Just create the question and drop the link to your Eventbrite or Facebook event and get people to register.PRO TIP\u200a\u2014\u200aoffer some sort of bonuses if they actually attend, this will make sure that people do not just signup and not attend. A few users of VYPER have run a contest and then said they will announce the winner at the event.6\u200a\u2014\u200aSign up for our webinar/web summitThis one is a little more scalable than a physical event and we had the company \u201cLaunch Summit\u201d execute on this custom entry perfectly.

Pew Pew Tactical is a firearm learning resource blog that focuses on the complete newbie to create a friendly learning environment.Why did PewPewTactical.com decide to run a\u00a0contest?We decided to run a contest mainly because we were seeing competitors running them to great success. Doing some research and asking fellow entrepreneurs led me to try out VYPER as our platform due to their social sharing tools.We are also in a niche that is restricted on paid channels such as Facebook and Google ad networks. This was another organic lead generation option.What other marketing campaigns have you tried but didn\u2019t\u00a0work?The best comparison would be against our content upgrade run through Sumo popups for a shooting target PDF in return for an email address.

But why use interactive content in the first place? What\u2019s so great about it?As it turns out, interactive content is the future of marketing. And I\u2019m not talking about just contests\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m talking about everything. Marketing itself is becoming more and more interactive every day. Contests are a piece of the puzzle, and it\u2019s time to look at the big picture.This Is Your Brain on InteractionFor decades, marketing has created passive users. How many times have you seen the same ad over and over again? Maybe there\u2019s something unique about it, but ultimately it\u2019s just an ad. You\u2019re passive while watching it. You don\u2019t get to experience the brand.That\u2019s been changing recently thanks to interactive content. Interactive content is any kind of content that allows the user to directly participate. Contests, quizzes, games, and surveys are just a few examples.Interactive content is getting so big because marketers are figuring out that users want to experience a brand first-hand. When marketing collides with the real world, users get a completely new experience.A great example is how Reebok advertised their new shoes in Stockholm. A speed cam was mounted on a small outdoor kiosk. Anyone who ran faster than 17kph won a free pair of shoes. This was no ordinary ad; this was an experience that transformed ordinary passersby into runners.Those people who interacted with the ad came away with a one-of-a-kind memory. The interaction led to something bigger (the ability to break away from the day and have fun), and that left a lasting impression.Interaction is a way of transforming your users. The reason that people love grandiose stories is because most people live rather plain lives. Many are unsatisfied with their life. Stories give them a way to escape, and directly participating in a story is even more cathartic. Compare this to passively viewing an ad, which seems pathetically weak compared to the interaction.Marketing needs disruption. It needs a future that\u2019s free of clickbait ads and spammy email marketing. We\u2019re living in an age of value, and we need to be giving our users the best experience ever. Interaction is a great way of doing that.Creating InteractionInteraction comes in all shapes and sizes, but it\u2019s not a one size fits all scenario. Different forms of interaction will work with different brands. For example, it would be comical if a law firm started using Snapchat. It\u2019s key to identify the types of interactive content that work well with your brand.Interaction is created whenever your user has the opportunity to participate in your brand. This includes social networks, comment sections, and interactive media (contests, quizzes, etc.). This isn\u2019t an all-inclusive list, however, as there are constantly new ways to interact with users. But for this article, we\u2019ll focus on these three areas.Interaction on social\u00a0networksSocial networks are probably what you think of when you hear \u201cinteraction\u201d and \u201cusers.\u201d Many people have several social network accounts, which also means that they have more opportunities to participate.But this is where most brands go wrong. They think that the inherent capabilities of social networks (liking, commenting, sharing) are interactive enough. And they\u2019re dead wrong. The abilities to like, comment, and share are great, but to truly stand out, you need to use these as a means to an end, not the end itself.For instance, if someone is scrolling through their Twitter feed and sees a Promoted Tweet, they might feel a bit jaded about it, especially if it\u2019s a thinly veiled sales tactic like a coupon code with a description that resembles a meme.But imagine if someone\u2019s scrolling through Twitter and sees what looks like the first sentence of a book. It\u2019s a Promoted Tweet, all right, but it\u2019s strange. If they click more, they discover a micro-story about your brand. It might not translate into a sale, but it has a much better chance than a traditional ad.This is just one example\u200a\u2014\u200asocial networks are ideal places to experiment with interactive content. Take advantage of their social capabilities, and use them to create standout interactionInteraction in comment\u00a0sectionsThis seems pretty straightforward, but so many brands do it wrong. How many times have you seen comment sections with no participation from the brand? Generally, brands only respond when people complain.But when brands devote time to responding to users\u2019 comments, both good and bad, it creates an interesting dialogue. Most people still see brands as faceless entities, so by responding, you\u2019re giving your brand a friendly face. You\u2019re bridging the gap between brand and consumer, and that\u2019s something the consumer will always appreciate.Or you can think outside the box. We\u2019ll use the example of creating a short story on Twitter. What if you created a short story in comment sections? Readers could follow your latest post to get updates on the story. Obviously this isn\u2019t for every brand, but it\u2019s an interesting thought experiment that should get you thinking about what you can do with \u201cordinary\u201d tools.Interactive mediaHere\u2019s where it gets really interesting. Interactive media like contests and quizzes are fully user-based. The user gets to choose their own adventure, so to speak, and participate in the brand. This is a new phenomenon, but the rising popularity of interactive media shows that it really works, and it\u2019s powerful.Interactive media can also create new leads from thin air. It sounds magical, but it\u2019s 100% true. Say someone stumbles upon your site and finds a fun quiz. They take it and then get an offer to sign up for more content like that. If they enjoyed the quiz, they\u2019ll likely sign up.And contests are perfect for lead generation because everyone wants to win, and they want to be notified if they win. It\u2019s almost unfair how powerful these techniques are.Of course, you have to consistently produce amazing content. If someone signs up for a contest and gets only boring sales emails from you, they\u2019re going to unsubscribe. But if you keep producing interesting, relevant content (both interactive and traditional), you\u2019ll have a much better retention rate.Giving up the\u00a0powerIf you remember one thing from this article, let it be this. When you\u2019re creating interactive experiences (or doing any sort of marketing, for that matter), give the power over to the user. Don\u2019t try to sell to people\u200a\u2014\u200agive them an adventure that happens within the world of your brand.Those people who interacted with the Reebok ad didn\u2019t feel like they were being sold to. They felt like they were taking part in something fun. That should be your goal with interactive content. Give up the power, and you might be surprised at the results.Ian Chandler is a narrative marketer and writer based in Ohio. He helps businesses leverage the power of story at Narrative Marketers.

One of the main ones being the Snapchat duplicate \u201cInstagram Stories\u201d which has surpassed Snap usage.This feature within Instagram has allowed brands to deliver more interesting and up to date content.Like all \u201corganic\u201d social media, there are some catches. Your content does not get seen by everyone and you need to follow the below guidelines to maximize the effectiveness of this channel.On a daily basis, more than 300 million users can be found on Instagram\u2019s Stories feature, which begs the question, if your business isn\u2019t using it, why not? According to the Instagram blog, users spend on average at least 24 minutes a day on the site.Need more convincing? How about this little factoid from Instagram? One out of five stories gets a direct message.That\u2019s a pretty solid reason to consider upping your Instagram game by using this feature.In this post, we\u2019re going to look at how you can use Stories to effectively boost interaction and sales.This infographic goes into more detail about how some of the world\u2019s leading brands have put this feature to use.Source Katka PavlickovaWhat Is the Instagram Stories\u00a0Feature?It\u2019s pretty simple. You post a short video to your feed. The video can be about whatever you like\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can even shoot it directly off your phone, straight from the Instagram app. You\u2019ve got fifteen seconds, so make it count.All you need to do is to tap the camera icon while the app is open and then choose the type of content.You can choose between:Live: This allows you to post as you\u2019re filming. People can comment while you\u2019re busy broadcasting, and you\u2019ll have the option to post it to Stories when you\u2019re done. This is a good option if you know what you\u2019re going to say and that you can control the environment you\u2019re shooting in.Normal: Here you\u2019ll choose\u200a\u2014\u200aone tap and you take a photo, holding it down will allow you to film a video.Boomerang: Not sure what to film but have a good GIF to share? Boomerang mode creates GIFs that loop for up to three seconds.Superzoom: This feature is a lens that keeps zooming closer to the subject. It\u2019s good for a big reveal. Have fun with this by adding an awesome soundtrack as well.Rewind: This is more of a fun lens as the video gets filmed in reverse, but it can also make for a change if you\u2019ve been posting the same thing over and over again.Stop Motion: This is great for a bunch of product shots. Stop Motion creates a video out of still shots. So instead of people having to click through to the next photo, this lens creates a slideshow, as it were.Hands Free: Not everyone wants to shoot immediately when they pick up the phone. Maybe you want to position it differently, or focus on another area. Just make sure that you have something you can rest your phone on so the picture will remain in focus and the phone won\u2019t shake. When you\u2019re ready to shoot, say, \u201cAction.\u201dAnd\u2026 We are sure that Instagram will be adding more options as well.Then just shoot your video and post. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to add a description, location, stickers, etc., before the post goes live.That\u2019s all there is to it. The post will stay live on the site for 24 hours and then happily move off into internet oblivion never to be seen again. Which is a big advantage when you want to build a loyal following, or when you want to test out new ideas.What About Hashtags?You should be using hashtags\u200a\u2014\u200asparingly. Make sure they\u2019re as relevant as possible to your content and limit the number of hashtags you use. How many is best?Here\u2019s a quick clue: the answer is not as many as possible. You can add up to thirty in total, but according to Statista, between two and five is the magic number.They got this figure from a study based on 200,000 Facebook posts, which while not the same channel, still provides a good indication of what to expect from Insta.Think of it this way, every extra hashtag you add decreases the likelihood of engagement from users interacting with the post.Stickers Aren\u2019t for Business, Surely?Oh, but they are. Stickers are a fun way to help your video stand out from the rest. Even if it\u2019s something as simple as a smile sticker, it adds an extra element of fun to your video.This channel is not all about serious business posts, so take advantage of that.There are tons to choose from\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can add a special holiday sticker, or even just a day of the week sticker. Have fun with this one, and your followers will as well.Set the\u00a0LocationYou can use a sticker that shows your location. This is useful because people looking for Stories relating to the particular area will be able to see a group of posts about the location.Your post could be among them, and it\u2019s a great way to drive local traffic to your door.Want Quick Engagement?Why not set up a poll? This is an excellent way to get your followers involved and to discover if people really are interacting with your content.Use the Poll sticker and choose your questions carefully. Ideally, you want answers to be outside the standard yes or no response.Allow the Sharing of\u00a0StoriesThis one may seem self-evident, but if you want better engagement than just people liking your posts, you\u2019ll need to go to your Story Settings and enable sharing.That way, people can send your story via direct message.You\u2019ll get extra views without even trying.Consider Adding Some\u00a0WritingThis can be easily done to add some text to the video. All you need to do is to hit the Pen icon on the screen once you\u2019ve finished filming.This could be a great way to add content to your website, like a list of ingredients, etc.Find a Related Instagram AccountWhy not share the love with another Instagrammer? Tagging them before posting means that they get a shout out, and hopefully, they\u2019ll return the favor at a later stage.This is also a simple way to make sure that someone you want to shout out to knows you\u2019ve done it. They\u2019ll get a notification on their feed.Check on Who Has Watched Your\u00a0StoryIf you click on the \u201cYour Story\u201d button on the home screen, all you have to do is to swipe up to see who has viewed the content.It\u2019s a good idea to do this from time to time, and to check out those accounts as well, so that you can keep track of who your main audience is.Keep an eye out for repeat visitors as this can be a good way to tell that you\u2019re posting content that people like. After all, if they didn\u2019t like it, they would hardly keep coming back, would they?This is also a way to keep track of which Stories worked out to be the most popular.Take the Time to Center Stickers and\u00a0TextThe center of your screen is prime real estate, so put the most important information there. If you don\u2019t center your text, you run the risk of some of it being cut off when people are scrolling through.Don\u2019t forget that Insta adds information to the bottom of the screen, like your account name and when the story was posted. Don\u2019t let that drown out the info.Add a SoundtrackSource Namroud GorguisYes, most people will watch your story without the sound on. But there are going to be those who don\u2019t mute it.Consider adding music to help reinforce the images on the screen and set the mood.I Don\u2019t Want All That Effort to Go to\u00a0WasteGot a video that you\u2019re really happy with? One you\u2019ve spent some time producing that you don\u2019t want to head off into the sunset after twenty-four hours? Then click on your story, and then the \u201cHighlight\u201d button.You\u2019ll have to rename the file, but once you\u2019ve done this, it will feature on your business\u2019s profile page.Aim to Be on the Explore\u00a0PageIf you can get your post onto the \u201cExplore\u201d page, you can boost views significantly. The way to do this is by assigning the right hashtags and encouraging engagement.This is not the same as the Popular page on the site. Each person\u2019s Explore page is populated with content based on what they have liked and commented on before.Want Some Simple Ideas to Get\u00a0Started?Of course, most readers at this point will have decided that the Stories feature is a good bet for businesses.

These followers should be willing to spread the word about you, whilst gaining some form of value for themselves in the process of doing so.Here are a few of the best blockchain marketing steps to get started in growing your own community:1. Understand your product and find your\u00a0brandBefore anything else, make sure you understand your own product and value proposition better than anyone else.This may seem superfluous, but it\u2019s critical for you to dive deep into your business\u2019s own fundamentals.What are your (assumed) value propositions, and have you validated these?Have you found your product/market fit?Does your product need blockchain or its own cryptocurrency?If so, are you planning to use a security token, utility token, or otherwise?Although it\u2019s difficult to understand these things early on in your company\u2019s journey, having these fundamentals in place will help you define your brand before you put lots of effort into marketing your blockchain project.This means that once you do start building your community, you\u2019ll have a head start and a competitive advantage because you won\u2019t be needing to change your product\u2019s messaging somewhere along the way.At this stage, focus on your story and narrative from the customer\u2019s point of view.Slapping the words \u2018decentralised\u2019 and \u2018blockchain\u2019 onto every part of your product messaging doesn\u2019t work like it may have used to.Focus on the solutions that your product provides to your users: how does it make aspects of their lives easier, or how does it save them money?2. Find a way to connect with your ideal community membersWho could benefit from your product the most, or who would it interest the most from an investment point of view?Take the necessary time to do research on this, and remember that the blockchain communities congregate in different and new channels all over the world and the web.Initially, you\u2019d like to check out existing communities, perhaps even for competing products, and build up some relationship with them.Blockchain enthusiasts specifically hang out on community platforms like Reddit, Telegram, Discord, and Slack.Start conversations!This phase shouldn\u2019t be about marketing your product or your brand to large audiences, it should be about having real, honest conversations with people that might be interested in what you have to offer.Find out exactly how your product or service could be beneficial to them.Humility is key throughout this process.Chances are that the people you\u2019re talking to have been in the space for longer than you have and that they\u2019re discerning and critical of \u201cjust another blockchain marketing message\u201d.FREE Guide: Start leveraging Facebook Groups for super targeted traffic! [Download Here]3. Make community buy-in worthwhileThis is really about giving back to your community: providing them with a real and tangible value which they can benefit from, without necessarily asking for anything in return.For example, provide them with useful content. There will hopefully be something about your product or service that\u2019s tied to knowledge only you possess.Share that knowledge.Educate your community with insightful content related to how your product works or how you envision the blockchain space to develop, also, what\u2019s in it for them? Make sure that you provide value when you ask someone to commit 20 minutes to read your content.Again, keep this within the confines of your expertise, at least in the beginning.There are enough people out there with general, sweeping statements about blockchain and cryptocurrencies.Keep your insights specific to the things in which you\u2019re an expert, and grow from there. Credibility is key when it comes to marketing your blockchain project.Apart from providing your community with content, you could allow them to participate in contests, or you could provide them with early access to certain components of your product.Be creative, and always ask for feedback. Keep finding new ways to provide value and keep your community engaged.4. Find out what your community likesWhen following the above three steps, you\u2019ll hopefully find the right balance between taking your time to build valuable relationships and moving at a fast speed in order to quickly get your product to market.At the same time, you would hopefully have learned about the types of values and rewards that your community benefits from.If your product has a utility token, does it benefit your users to reward them early with the tokens that they\u2019ll be using on your platform?Perhaps an airdrop might be a good choice for you?Perhaps the contest you ran via your social channels showed significant traction?Whatever it is that showed the most results, make sure to hone in on it when scaling up your marketing efforts and building out your campaigns. These are the key selling points to get people to back your blockchain project.Try and avoid the shiny object syndrome. What works once will more than likely work again.5. Amplify reach through a viral\u00a0contestOnce you\u2019ve established your initial community and figured out what type of value they\u2019re interested in, you\u2019ll need to engage and scale this community.This is where we found VYPER to be a very useful tool in our blockchain marketing campaign.We used it to facilitate viral contests (also known as an airdrop, bounty or token offering etc), which are able to vastly amplify the reach of your audience size and engagement.In practical terms, this consists of rewarding people for taking part in certain actions, such as sharing certain posts on social media or creating custom content around your product/brand through channels such as Youtube and Medium.Case Study: Vyper to boost\u00a0viralityAt Spike, we have successfully used VYPER to make certain blockchain campaigns go viral. Here\u2019s an example and a few steps on how we did it.Getting a person to promote and share your project is a pretty big ask.Essentially, what you\u2019re asking is for the person to put his reputation on the line for you.This is why, normally, it is a bad idea to ask for referrals straight in the awareness phase of your marketing campaign.On average, a B2C customer needs a minimum of 8 interactions before he/she is convinced to buy from you.It wouldn\u2019t make sense to start with such a big request after the second customer interaction right?This is why a fully mapped out pirate funnel is important to follow throughout your blockchain marketing campaign.The Pirate Funnel is a useful customer-lifecycle framework invented by Dave McClure. It is used to map out and optimize your marketing funnel.Essentially, for every product that you\u2019re trying to sell, the objective is to funnel them through a similar journey.If you\u2019re not familiar with it, the funnel looks as follows:Awareness \u2192 Acquisition \u2192 Activation \u2192 Retention \u2192 Referral \u2192 Revenue.The order is flexible and can be rearranged, depending on the nature of your product or service.The pirate funnel serves as a solid framework and is the ideal basis for creating a flowchart for your specific business.Example:Step 2: Determine the objectives and key results\u00a0(OKRs)Setting objectives for the team is an effective way of later measuring the outcomes and results of your campaign.In the case of a viral campaign, your OKRs can be (for example):Objective 1: To build a large and highly engaged communityKey Result: 20,000 Telegram members in the community before start date of pre-saleKey Result: 40.000 participants in referral/bounty programKey result: 10,000 Twitter followers + 10,000 Facebook likes + 5,000 Youtube subscribersKey result: Project x appeared in at least 10 tech or crypto publications before start of crowdsaleKey result: Project x has been reviewed by or ran an AMA with at least 5 influencers before start crowdsale.The main question then becomes:Based on the above defined OKRs, how can we leverage VYPER to get to these key results?Through VYPER, you can reward your community with points for certain social actions.Based on the above set OKRs, there are at least three key results we can achieve by using VYPER.Step 3: Set up a rewards programThis is going to be one of the most important parts of your blockchain marketing campaign.We\u2019re going to reward the community for joining our Telegram group, liking our Facebook page, following us on Twitter and subscribing to your YouTube channel.You need to choose bonus actions that are relevant to your project. Some examples we used below. Each bonus action is rewarded with points (+8).But how are you going to get 20k people to join your Telegram group when you currently have an email list of just over 1k people?This is when the referral marketing feature comes into play.Step 4: Implement a referral programThe best part about VYPER is that, instead of just rewarding your community for single actions, you can also reward them for referring their friends & colleagues.You can do this using their landing page builder, embed it on your own landing page or add the widget to your site.This means that if your community likes your product and brand, and the reward structure (or perceived reward structure) of a campaign is spot on, you\u2019ll get your community promoting your blockchain project for you.A referral = when someone who enters your contest shares their referral link with friends or co-workers and they sign up.A reward = collect 100 points by referring others and completing bonus actions to get X number of tokens.How to make a project go\u00a0viral?At this point, we\u2019re using artificial virality to grow our product reach. With virality, you look at the Viral Coefficient and try to optimize that.The viral coefficient is simply \u201dthe number of new users an existing user generates\u201d.The difference between organic and artificial virality is that artificial virality incentivizes the sharing through a tool (VYPER), whereas organic virality is when your product\u2019s success is based on the network effect.This means that your product has been built for users to organically share it with their peers (think Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter).More information can be found in this article about the viral coefficient.The difference between the rewards mentioned earlier on and the referral is that the social actions are limited.Users can only like your Facebook page or follow your Twitter account once, while they can invite an unlimited amount of friends to your contest.This key difference is important to understand.While people are more likely to follow you on Twitter than referring your project to their friends (remember, they risk their reputation to refer friends to your project), they are also wired to win a game or contest.When entering a leaderboard contest, for example, participants might not be planning on referring their friends straight away.They first start with following you on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, but soon find out there is no other way to go up the leaderboard than by referring their friends.After having done these multiple micro conversions (actions that lead users to your target conversion) and seeing their place on the leaderboard, they are more likely to promote your project through referrals.Next to that, by rewarding the referral action with, for example, 5x the points of normal social actions, you further stimulate virality.So at this point, you will likely have your community competing against each other for our prizes.If your campaign setup is spot on, and you have a positive and high enough viral coefficient, you will go viral in a natural way.For example, when you start with 100 participants and they all invite 12 friends per week on average, of which 4 eventually sign up (viral coefficient of 4), that will result in 25.600 participants by the end of the month.(conversion rate % is so high as we used an embed contest option which does not count the page views, only the conversion within VYPER.You can choose to run a contest on a VYPER landing page, your own or a website widget.).Here are some more tips for marketing your blockchain project:Make sure your prizes provide a high-enough incentive and resonate with your audience.We generally always opt for a leaderboard contest as opposed to a non-leaderboard structure, as this incentivizes continuous sharing by participants to obtain the first place and win the main prize.Think, what would your ideal customer/audience do anything to get? What has a high enough value for them to share your project?Create engaging content urging viewers to participate or share.Make sure that the content you create looks nice, and that it facilitates easy sharing.Design a good looking contest, share images and make sure the social pages you\u2019re trying to build look good and have some engagement and recent posts.Leverage urgency and social proofAlways toggle on the use of social proof and urgency. For example, add a time limit to your campaign to ensure that participants join sooner rather than later.Have the social proof feature enabled to show potential signups that people are entering.Think of relevant entriesWhat content do you want to get shared? What are the most relevant channels that you want to grow? This could mean more reward weighting for Youtube video productions rather than Medium articles, for example.Amplify awareness through adsPromote the contest yourself. Let the world know that you\u2019re going viral. If executed correctly, you\u2019ll witness a snowball effect.Leverage your contest to build social proof on your ads to improve your CPA, CPC\u2019s and CPM\u2019s. Here\u2019s a guide on how to do that.To sum it all\u00a0up:Growing your community starts with trust.With a strong idea and vision in place, and by finding the right balance between passion and humility, you\u2019ll be able to excite potential new users and investors.When you offer your community real value and adopt a \u201cgiving back\u201d attitude, community growth comes naturally.About Spike:Authors: Pascal van Steen, Gino Taselaar & Erich Rickens, Spike | Blockchain marketing agencySpike is a growth marketing agency driven to facilitate the widespread adoption of emerging technologies, most notably within the domains of Blockchain, Fintech, and Proptech startups.By constantly applying data-driven and agile workflows, we\u2019re able to swiftly implement growth strategies, focusing on quick wins in the short term, whilst upholding the outcome of long-term growth and user adoption, depending on the nature of your product.

You had a better chance of becoming a movie star or an astronaut. (Fun fact, in my research I found out that it\u2019s easier to become a movie star than to become an astronaut!)Yet the entire country was ready to win, despite how improbable it was (yes, even I spent $5 on lottery tickets).That\u2019s the power of contests.Humans are emotional creatures. Even in the face of great odds, we will try to achieve the unachievable. We will dream the unbelievable.The thought when someone sees a contest isn\u2019t \u201cOh, I\u2019ll never be able to win\u201d it\u2019s \u201cOh, why not. Anyone could get lucky.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0When you combine contests with email lead generation, you create an amazing machine that could help you gain hundreds if not thousands of email addresses.

That was a great tool 2 years ago, but now it\u2019s dated and not even supported anymore.Here at VYPER we saw an opportunity to come into the market and innovate on the idea of viral contests.This is how we did it:We took ALL the features of KingSumo giveaways, and added:Opt-in bribes which increased conversions by 26% (learn more).Automatic cheating detection.Customizable landing page that fits your site\u2019s look & feel.Conversion-optimized template that we\u2019ve A/B tested like crazy (including positions of buttons & more).World class support that will help you set up your contest.And we\u2019re constantly adding new features (new templates coming soon).Ready to create your first contest?", "responses": ""}, {"title": "The 4 Contest Email Follow-ups that Get You Viral\u00a0Growth", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/the-4-contest-email-follow-ups-that-get-you-viral-growth-6235c29814?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 23, 2016", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "The 4 Contest Email Follow-ups that Get You Viral\u00a0GrowthVYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 23, 2016When you create your first contest through VYPER, it\u2019s not just going to be set it and forget it. You have to do a little bit of creative positioning to get your contestants sharing your contest. This sequence activates your current & new audience to enter & share your contest.Note that this sequence assumes you\u2019re running a contest for 2 weeks.

You can also take it a step further, by incentivizing your contestants to share your contest in order to get the bribe (this functionality is built into VYPER).The purpose of this email is to remind your audience that this option is there, and that they must share your contest in order to unlock the opt-in bribe.Bryan Harris of VideoFruit employed a similar method for his contest.

Fist jumping on a mattress with a wine glass, second the option to adopt/support a Koala in need. This shows the quality of the product and also adds an emotional pull towards the band.They are calling out \u201ccouples\u201d and probably targeting people in a relationship. Always try and align your targeting with you ad messaging (vice versa).What they did wrongThey could have added a lot more to the text area, no everyone wants to watch a video.They did not add a link in the text area, this is a lost CTA opportunity.Facebook Ad 2\u200a\u2014\u200aLululemon MenLink\u200a\u2014\u200aLive PostWhat they did RightGreat use of the carousel ad format showing the product in \u201cproduct + lifestyle\u201d shots.Did a good job at featuring the same model in multiple locations using the jacket for multiple use case scenarios.They mentioned features on each slide, makes users want to scroll through.What they did wrongAgain the text areas were underutilized, add a link to the product, features about the product, pricing, sale opportunity, limited stock, the collection (e.g. winter).They should have made use of the carousel card description area. Even if it is just the price or the brand name, this is an easy way to include some extra information.Facebook Ad 3\u200a\u2014\u200aArcadia\u00a0PowerLink\u200a\u2014\u200aLive PostWhat they did RightGreat use of incentivization. Instead of getting into a pricing war with competitors they are adding extra value. Since this was a new product at the time and trending this added a lot of perceived value.Explained how \u201ceasy\u201d it was to get the Google Home Mini.What they did wrongNot clear what the ad is about, the image could have been more focused on the core product as opposed as a lifestyle shot of the bonus product.The title is cut off, make sure you stay within these limits otherwise people can not get the full message.Needed to use paragraphs in the text area to split up the text a little more and make it more \u201creadable\u201dShould have included a CTA in the text either to a link or click on the CTA button of the ad.Facebook Ad 4\u200a\u2014\u200aMasterClassLink\u200a\u2014\u200aLive PostWhat they did RightAwesome use of celebrity endorsement, this is extremely powerful when socially validating the quality of a product. Who doesn\u2019t want to be taught how to cook like Gordon or play basketball like Curry.This is a gifting ad but cold quite easily be a prospecting ad as well. The benefit of the gifting ad is that you have multiple friends that come to mind with each \u201cskill\u201d being taught. Much better than using a single image ad.What they did wrongCould have split the text into 2 sentences. First explaining why this is a good gift idea. Then secondly explaining the quality of the gift.Could have added special pricing for a gift subscription and made it a limited offer.Could have turned this into a BOGO. Buy a subscription for a friend and get 6 months free for yourself.FREE Guide: What we learned from spending $100 million on Facebook ads! [Download Here]Facebook Ad 5\u200a\u2014\u200aJumpcutLink\u200a\u2014\u200aLive PostWhat they did RightThis is a personal ad that looks very organic. This would be fantastic for remarketing if they were already familiar with who this is.Great use of the creative size. This ad is using a very tall ratio which will take up the whole screen.They have added captions to help people who do not have sound enabled.Have created scarcity around the closing time for the sale.Cleverly they are only giving away 12 months instead of a lifetime account.What they did wrongDid not include the value of the course while it was not on sale. E.g. \u201cthis course usually costs over $699 a year but if you enroll before 11:59pm PST you can get it for only %97 (that\u2019s 96% OFF the regular price)\u201dThey should have tried to get the link above the \u201cview more\u201d cut off. This would have improved CPC and CTR.Facebook Ad 6\u200a\u2014\u200aMighty\u00a0AudioLink\u200a\u2014\u200aLive PostWhat they did RightThis is a great example of leveraging another brand to make your product more authoritative.Great use of a collaboration offer and using the brands\u2019 logos in the image help demonstrate the partnership as well.If they were targeting people interest in Spotify they would have been able to get instant recognition and trust from that audience.Very clear function and value proposition.What they did wrongCould have added a list of all the times you would want to use Spotify without a phone. This would have helped people connect with the ad. You want to generate that \u201cyeah.. me too\u201d feeling.This ad would not have looked very organic in the Facebook newsfeed. Using a lifestyle shot with a smaller logo and product feature might have made this a little less \u201cad\u201d looking.Facebook Ad 7\u200a\u2014\u200aMama\u00a0HomeLink\u200a\u2014\u200aLive PostWhat they did RightThis ad is a fantastic demonstration of what the product does. It gives a lot of examples, clear explanation of how it works and what it does. Even better they do this quickly.the copy is using emojis to break it up.They are using arrows to the CTA as well as telling people where to click.Calling out free shipping as another advantage.What they did wrongThe first frame shouldn\u2019t have been a pregnant lady, it should have been an example of their most popular demo or use. E.g. leg waxing or a nose pore cleaning.They might have been able to use a shorter link, this would have taken up less space on mobile ads.They did not mention the price. This would have been a good split test but using the price in the ad can prep visitors to buy.Facebook Ad 8\u200a\u2014\u200aPatagoniaLink\u200a\u2014\u200aLive PostWhat they did RightFantastic image creative, showing items that all make up an outfit.They are appealing to people who value social/corporate responsibility. This probably aligns with their target market/ideal persona. They could also target interest groups that include charities, sustainability etc.Great explainer of the process they use to make their product, this also increases the perceived value of this product.What they did wrongThe text needs to be formatted so that it is easier to read. Use of emojis, symbols or paragraphs would have helped get the point across easier.They could have also included a link in the text.If they had a short video on the process this would have done better in terms of capturing peoples attention, then tagging products in on video or even remarketing people who watch over 50% of the video.Facebook Ad 9\u200a\u2014\u200aMentorboxLink\u200a\u2014\u200aLive PostWhat they did RightAgain, great use of the tall video takes up the whole screen on mobile. On a desktop you get the blurred buffer on each side but it is a small price to pay to take up so much real estate in the feed.Got to 3 million views, this must have cost a LOT of money considering their engagement is so low.Organic looking post.What they did wrongNo captions on this is a huge conversion killer. Especially because the video size is optimized for video as well. Facebook has auto-translate as well as\u00a0.srt file uploads.Very little information and no link in the text area.The backdrop should have been all books so the video creative was balanced and people would focus on the speaker instead of the cars on the highway in the bottom left. Make sure you set up 1 focal point in your videos.Facebook Ad 10\u200a\u2014\u200aMooLink\u200a\u2014\u200aLive PostWhat they did RightUsing Press or Customer quotes are a great way to build trust and social validation.Using a \u201cunique\u201d image + product placement.Out of most peoples control but having a verified page helps, ask your Facebook rep if you are eligible!!!!Offering a discount, if this was a remarketing campaign to push me over the edge to complete my purchase.What they did wrongThey could have made the image more engaging. E.g. used an impressive design on the business cards, use a unique shape or fabric to show of the customizability of the service.Included more benefits of the product under the quote in the text area. It was great adding the quote but then what\u2026.. why is the product such high quality? how do they create a good first impression?As you can see there are many aspects that go into making a successful ad. The key take aways are.Make your ads stand out by being unique.Use a creative image or video sizes (square or 4:5 ratio)A lot can be done in the text area, use emojis, links, paragraphs, CAPS, lines, arrows. Whatever you can to make the text easy to read, entertaining and educational.Make sure your ad engages, teaches or entertains.

I also condensed these down a little to only include the most important information.Please, note I did not go to all presentations so I\u2019m sure there were a lot of things I missed but these where the big impact talks I saw!Brendan Yell\u200a\u2014\u200aDirector at Sendgrid\u00a0Email is still one of the top converting acquisition channels and Brendan shared some great stats they have collected from the users of SendGrid.3 words in the subject line for cold emails usually perform the best.As a company, you need to figure out what your overall CPA (cost per acquisition) is to know how much you can spend on ads to build your email list.Map out your exact funnel. Where do people first hear about you? when do they signup to your list? when do they convert?Content discoveryEmail sign upHow many ads do they seeDo they watch video contentWhen do they convertAb test 1 thing at a time. It is easy to get carried away with testing but the best thing to do is choose 1 thing at a time to A/B split test.Use segmentation to get personal. Just using their first name is not good enough. You need to segment and really understand at talk to that customer\u2019s pain point. Some easy segmentations are:How often they use your productHow long they have been using your productLead or customerHappy customer or notAim to deliver emails that are timely, relevant, personal, regional.Instead of having unsubscribed, use email frequency adjustment options send daily, weekly, monthly etc.More email marketing tactics and advice hereNavin Danapal\u200a\u2014\u200aSOSV China Accelerator\u00a0Was super excited to see this talk as I find the Chineses and Indian markets to be the up and coming. Not only do they have huge populations but the countries middle class is growing unlike the shrinking ones in the United States, Australia, and Europe.The next large market to service is China with 1 trillion eCommerce spend a year now.This market is lacking in saas and marketing products to feed this huge online economy.China is a lot harder for startups to work with. One big deterrent is having to potentially hand over your product source code to the Chinese government.WeChat pay integration is one of the top payment processors in the country, that along with AliPay from AliExpress.15 trillion mobile payments of which 50% are conducted through AliPay, think of it as an alternative to Stripe.WeChat has differentiated from a \u201cregular\u201d chat app as it is a building back with a huge collection and marketplace of apps.

In my personal opinion, it\u2019s a bit of everything, improve all of these 1% a week to keep growing.AcquisitionConversion rateRetentionJust spend 1 hour a week looking at your analytics and come up with 1 change to A/B test. Week after week you will get improvements.Talk to your customersWhy do you like our product?Why do you use our product?How did you find out product?What don\u2019t you like about our product?Focus on the customer. They are also people, so treat them like that, not a number. Too many people in marketing are not paying attention to the feedback they get from customers.Make something people like to use. Most people use up to 700 products a year. Make yours\u2019s the one they come back to time and time again.Aim for someone to use your product just 1\u20132 times a week.Andrew Lindsay\u200a\u2014\u200aBusiness Development at Hubspot\u00a0There are some huge case studies that show how partnership marketing has helped propel companies from 0 to 100 very quickly.Take Google partnering with Google back in the day. Without Yahoo, Google would arguably not be what it is today!Partnership marketing should be a consideration if you are starting a company and looking for growth options.You do need to be careful and understand the return on your time for managing these as they are extremely time-consuming.Work out what the potential customers and value of a customer from the partnership will result in.Avoid \u201cBarney Partnerships\u201dBoth parties have to benefit, for example.Hubspot partners with sales agencies to provide customers with \u201cdone for your services\u201dBill.com partners with Chase baking to provide invoicing services to its business banking customers.VYPER partners with a content marketing agency to offer a \u201cdone for you service\u201d so we can focus on the product.Credit card companies partner up with advertising platforms to provide targeting audiences (coming to an end but good while it lasted).Thank about complimentary services or products that you could partner with.Work out what\u2019s in it for both sides of the deal.Proceed if it makes sense!Steve Rader\u200a\u2014\u200aCollaborative Innovation at NASA\u00a0It was very interesting to see such a large company getting involved in a \u201cstartup\u201d conference but I was pleasantly surprised!Sometimes not even NASA can solve the problem at hand.We now have access to huge pools of people that are just as talented if not more than the employees of large companies like NASA, Google Facebook etc.Larger companies can leverage these people using competitions and bounties.By offering a reward for solving an issue, you are able to get the problem in front of more than just your direct team. You can draw upon millions of people\u2019s knowledge.The harder the problem that needs to be solved the larger the bounty.How can you use collaborative problem-solving in your business?The workforce is moving toward a contractor dominant environment and this is one way to take advantage of that.Much more innovation can come from collaboration than most companies think.Don\u2019t be scared to share your problems, ideas or struggles with outside parties. A lot of the time they will have already solved those issues and can save you a lot of time or money.Checklist and guide on how you can run a contest to grow your business.Jack Paxton\u200a\u2014\u200aCo-Founder VYPER\u00a0A few bonus tips on top of my talk on scaling with Facebook ads, viral marketing and how we started VYPER.Marketing fundamentalsAdjust the levers you control (offer/website experience, ad creative, targeting)Take your total revenue and divide it by the number of customers you have to work out a rough average LTV.Figure out your cost of goods.LTV\u200a\u2014\u200a(desired profit + Gogs) = your target cost per acquisitionHow to create better creativeTest long vs short videos (short usually better for ads, longer better on website/blog)Grab attention first 3 secondsAdd text captions (most vidoe is watched muted)Storytelling in your video helps conversionsHave a CTA within 30sec of videoHow to run better adsUse dark postsOptimize with delivery breakdown stats (placement, age, region etc)Test 2\u20133 creative firstCopy is not as important as creative so put more testing emphasis on thisStart targeting wide then narrow inAim for an audience size of 2\u20134 million on FacebookUse split testing featureWebsite improvement hacksMake sure visitors can understand what your business is and does in 30secGet shows a CTA within 30 secondsBe able to explain your business in 15 wordsWhat can the business do for the customerFREE Guide: Scale your business with Facebook Ads using this guide [Download]Hopefully, this quick 10min read has saved you hours if not days.

I\u2019d like to share some practical tips you can implement to increase your email open rate, click through rate and actually get more cash in your bank account. Yeah that\u2019s a pretty big aim\u00a0:DThe tips get more advanced as the article progresses. The last tip, which I\u2019ve never seen shared before in a blog post, will benefit you most if you\u2019re already established online with an email list (be that an E-commerce store owner, a blogger, software founder or whatever).Let\u2019s get started!1. How to Structure Your\u00a0EmailForm follows function; The phrase was initially coined by the architect Louis Sullivan and is based on the principle that the shape of a structure should be determined by its function.You can and should apply the same logic to writing your sales emails, because, each part of your email has a specific purpose.Everything starts with your subject line.The job of the subject line, and nowadays the first line of your copy, is to get your customer to open the email. And you guessed it, the job of the copy is to get the reader to click on the link.You\u2019re not making a sale, that\u2019s the purpose of the sales page.2. Embedding Links: The Magic\u00a0NumberGood email copy is structured to give your reader multiple opportunities to take the action you desire (in this case getting them to click on you link). The more links you use, up to a point, the higher your click through rate.You can see the results in the graph below from research Campaign Monitor did when they analysed click through rates from 500 million emails.Yet just placing the same link multiple times in your copy isn\u2019t going to significantly increase your click through rate.Click through rate vs number of links. Research by Campaign Monitor.Think of your email copy as a story. There\u2019s a beginning, a middle and an end. At each stage of the copy you are trying to get your reader to click on the link and leave the story.You\u2019ll need to use different arguments to achieve this.For example: you can open your pitch by appealing to a person\u2019s curiosity, follow it up with a list of benefits they\u2019d get by clicking on the link and end the email by highlighting the urgency of completing the action. Check out the example email above to see what I mean.3. How to Get Those\u00a0ClicksThere are certain places in your sales copy where dropping a link just works. Embed your link after a list of bullet points that summarise the benefits of the product you are selling or after a product testimonial for example.Finally you\u2019ve got the postscript (which happens to be the second most clicked link in an email).To get those brain cells bubbling here\u2019s a list of six different ways you can use a postscript to generate sales.Images and buttons are proven ways to get additional clicks and increase your click through rates. The case for using a button in your email copy as a call to action is pretty clear cut.You\u2019ll find dozens of case studies, like this one, that show a jump, in this case 28%, in click through rate when using a button as your main call to action over a text link.An example of the A/B test ran by Wistia. In this example they saw a 24.83% increase in click through rate for the video thumbnail over the image.Another obvious way to use images in your email sales copy is creating a video thumbnail (obviously there should be a video to watch on the sales page).When Wistia tested video thumbnails in emails compared to regular images they saw a 25% jump in their click through rate.Another important variable to test that will have a huge impact on your success is subject lines. Check out this list of the best performing subject lines to use in your net campaign.4. Create a CliffhangerThink of your favorite TV series. How did it end last week? I bet there was some unfinished business awaiting a resolution in the next episode.Now think about how you run your email marketing campaigns. Do your readers have anything to look forward to next week?You should be constantly playing with your reader\u2019s emotions, think flirtatious girlfriend rather than American Psycho, to generate sales or increase click through rates.Also experiment. Create expectation for your promo with a free giveaway and then add a postscript regarding upcoming offer for example.5. Never Deceive Your\u00a0AudienceObvious right? Not lying to your audience sounds like such an obvious step, but you\u2019ll be surprised how many marketers fall into this trap (often, and I include myself in this list, with the best of intentions). Yet these innocent lies, like that email you promised to send them, add up!If you say you\u2019re going to send an email to your list on a given day then send it. You mention your promotion or sale will close on a given date and time then close the offer at that time and implement that price rise that you threatened.When you don\u2019t do these things your scarcity threats become less effective and your audience will stop believing everything you say.6. Learn from a\u00a0ProThe most successful email marketer I know stopped writing \u2018original\u2019 copy four years ago. Instead he adapts email series developed and used by marketing maestros like Frank Kern and Ryan Deiss for his business.An email marketing course by one of these guys will cost cost $2,000 and up.However, if you are making money from your list already and want to take your business to the next level then these courses are worth the investment.One of the best courses I completed was The Machine by Ryan Deiss. It\u2019s well structured and guides you through the system Digital Marketer use to manage and profit from their email list across various niches.The course includes access to a half dozen turnkey email series and some rock solid theory you can apply to your business.Now I know what you might be thinking; I don\u2019t have $2k to drop on an email course. And I can relate. It\u2019s a lot of cash to invest.If you want to learn from some of the best copywriters on the cheap sign up to a bunch of different email lists from successful marketers. You\u2019ll get a ton of valuable content, it just won\u2019t be in a structured format.7. Recycle Old\u00a0ContactsGrowing your email list can feel frustrating. While you\u2019re always getting new subscribers many people already on your list stop opening your emails.Most marketers will tell you to get rid of these dud emails, because they\u2019re going to reduce your open rate, which is true. But\u2026Instead of simply deleting these contacts I recommend storing these contacts on a separate email-marketing provider. You don\u2019t need to put much effort in managing them.Every 30 days or so send a general email to these contacts; this can be a blog post, discount offer, re-engagement series or whatever.The open rate for these emails will be tiny. That\u2019s fine. You will get people re-engaging with your emails and your products though. When you do recycle these engaged customers back onto your main email list.There are no excuse for not doing this!Plenty of companies offer free trials for up to 2,000 subscribers so it doesn\u2019t need to cost you a penny.You\u2019ll get better results, and more profits, from your promotions when you send an email series.8. Flood the Inbox (occasionally)You shouldn\u2019t use this tip to often as it will burn out your list, but\u2026 When you\u2019re pushing a hot product, especially when it\u2019s a time sensitive offer, the best way to generate sales is the frequency of your emails.During an average 3\u20135 day promotion we send at least 10 segmented emails.I recommend sending a minimum of four segmented emails during a promotion. Send your first email to open the offer.Follow this up two hours later with an email to people who didn\u2019t open that first email. On the last day of the promotion send another two emails (the second one to the people who didn\u2019t open the first). And that\u2019s a minimum!To increase sales segment your list further by sending custom emails to people who opened the link to those that just opened the email (the fancy name for this is behavioral response indicators.There\u2019s a nice post by Frank Kern here that should get you thinking).Just like when you\u2019re embedding links into your email copy, you need to be using different angles to get people to open and stay engaged with your offers (you can\u2019t bludgeon a person into buying a product by repeating the same thing 10 times).Compose email series that hit different emotional triggers, like emotion, logic and urgency, to maximise your click through rate to the sales page.9. Run Your List on Two Email Service ProvidersEmail service providers like Gmail and Yahoo use complex algorithms to assign emails into different folders (like the hated spam). There are a lot of factors to consider, but one which many people overlook is the company you are using to send your emails.So first tip, choose a company that only lets you upload verified email addresses (sorry Aweber). Once you\u2019ve got that sorted, an easy way to improve your open rate and reach more customers is to host and send emails to your list from two different servers/ companies.Running your email list on two servers will help you reach more of your email list.If you do this don\u2019t send the same email twice at different times, which would look spammy. Instead create two messages with the same purpose (here\u2019s a nice article on keeping your list engaged while sending valuable content) and send them at different times to your list.This will get you extra clicks, which add up quickly when you\u2019re running a promotion!FREE BONUS\u200a\u2014\u200a7 growth hack tactices to double your websites revenue! DOWNLOADSumming It UpI know, just five tips\u2026 Believe me it\u2019s enough. Instead of heading off to the next blog post try implementing some of them. I\u2019d love to hear your feedback in the comments below.Or better yet, share some tips of your own that could benefit other marketers.That\u2019s all I have to share for the moment, but I still want to help you out. I run special offers with software startups for lifetime access to useful marketing tools to help you grow your email list and manage your online business (we ran a great campaign with VYPER earlier in the year).This is a guest post by Nico Prins, to sign up to his no BS email list head over to Launch Space.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "(Updated) How We Got on Product Hunt Without ANY Preparation & the Gobs of Money We\u00a0Made", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/updated-how-we-got-on-product-hunt-without-any-preparation-the-gobs-of-money-we-made-14826892a9dc?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 29, 2016", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "(Updated) How We Got on Product Hunt Without ANY Preparation & the Gobs of Money We\u00a0MadeVYPER Growth Hacks BlogBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 29, 2016Okay so gobs of money is a little bit of an overstatement, but Product Hunt gave us our first customers and helped us make a few thousand bucks (about $3,000 so far). Not bad!We all know what Product Hunt is right?This last weekend, VYPER was posted up on the site. We didn\u2019t plan for it to happen, but someone named Charlie Irish submitted us.Around 12pm I noticed we were getting traffic from Product Hunt after logging into Google Analytics. My first thought was, wtf? How?I went on to the site, and sure enough we were the 4th startup.My reaction was a mix of jubilation as well as horror. We had planned for a huge Product Hunt launch for a few weeks in the future, and now we lost several hours of planning time. We also had the timing of getting posted on Saturday, when the PH community was not super active. But it was time to make the best of it.I contacted my co-founder Jack and it was time to get to work.First we realized that we had some errors on our site that the PH community pointed out. We quickly fixed those (SSL certificate wasn\u2019t present and our sign up page was sending users to a new tab\u2026 DOH). Then it was time to get started promoting.Promotion StrategyFirst, I sent out emails to our email list, which contained approximately 2,000 people.During our software development phase, I spent time content marketing and amassing a list of entrepreneurs. By the time our launch rolled around, we had around 2,000 emails on this list. I sent out an email to the entire list about our Product Hunt launch. About 16% opened this email. Here\u2019s what I wrote:If you\u2019ve been following some of my last emails, you\u2019ll remember that we\u2019re launching a new product called VYPER, an email marketing tool that helps you create giveaways that collect email addresses.So I had absolutely NO idea that VYPER was going to be hunted on Product Hunt today. We had a whole strategy ready and everything with a big pre-launch reach-out, but I guess the community was ready for us before we were ready for them =) That\u2019s okay, we\u2019re going to make the best of it and try to promote our Product Hunt launch as much as possible!If anyone uses Product Hunt, your support is greatly appreciated. If you don\u2019t use it, today\u2019s a great day to sign up (hehe).Check out VYPER on the Product Hunt homepage (probably will only stay there until tomorrow).Your support is greatly appreciated.Cheers,\u00a0Kevin(The following paragraph is now debunked) According to our sources, upvotes from the homepage give you more weight, so we told people about our Product Hunt posting and linked them to the Product Hunt homepage. The reason for this is because Product Hunt has a ranking algorithm to prevent cheating.UPDATED: Link directly to your product page. Linking to \u201cproducthunt.com\u201d only makes it harder for people to find you and doesn\u2019t have any effect on the algorithm at all. It seems to be \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that you\u2019re punished for linking directly to your product page\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s simply not true. Focus on communicating what your product does. P.S. Linking to producthunt.com is one of the clearest indications you may be \u201cover-optimizing\u201d your launch (gaming the system).Remember, Product Hunt doesn\u2019t like it when you ask for upvotes, so avoid doing it!Secondly, I talked to Slack groups.Not sure how well this strategy did for us because Saturday was DEAD in the Slack channels.My tip is to get well ingrained into each Slack group before your PH launch. Reach out to users in there who post interesting content and make friends. If someone else posts their Product Hunt launch, you should upvote and tell them that you did. This goes a HUGE way when you have your own launch. I had a couple buddies in the Slack groups that had done launches so I messaged them and they supported our launch as well.If you want to build up your network, Slack groups are a great way to do it.Third, I hit up people individually who were my tech-savvy friends.Pretty self explanatory, but the key is to network with people in startups & tech who know Product Hunt. Getting a 20\u201330 person boost was very helpful here. This is something that I never practiced before, but I realize how important having a good network of people in the same industry really is. Over the years I\u2019ve amassed a pretty large network, so it wasn\u2019t hard to get people to check out our Product Hunt posting.Fourth, I posted on Reddit.This strategy requires much more careful planning. This wasn\u2019t as successful as we wanted, but it still drove a few upvotes and I got about 2 emails from people saying they saw us on reddit.Here\u2019s what I posted in /r/entrepreneurGetting a Hunter (Updated)Product Hunt reached out and told us you no longer need a hunter to hunt your products. Here\u2019s an excerpt from their blog.Feel free to hunt your own product. Having someone else posting is fine, but spending lots of time \u201cfinding a hunter\u201d is a distraction. You know your product better than anyone else, and it makes very little difference who hunts the product and how well it performs overall. Follow these steps to get contributor access.If you\u2019re not sure whether your product would do well on Product Hunt, feel free to email me\u200a\u2014\u200akevin@vyper.io\u200a\u2014\u200afor advice and suggestions.How did we\u00a0do?Being that it was a Saturday and we had almost no preparation, our launch wasn\u2019t as successful as some others like Dollar Beard Club (apparently they got thousands of paying subscribers from Product Hunt), but we still got ~9,000 views to our site, about ~200 signups and a handful of paying members.We also got tweeted out by the Product Hunt team on Twitter and we retweeted their posts a couple times. Make sure you add yourself as the \u201cmaker\u201d of the product in order to get tweeted out.

I was excited to take a look at the Vyper team\u2019s perspective on contract design, but ultimately struggled to understand many of the design decisions.This post is meant as a friendly critique of what I found. Realizing that the language is still experimental, I hope it\u2019s helpful that I share my impressions sooner than later.First, I should say that although Python was my first language, I am muchstronger in JS and Solidity. So there may be \u2018pythonic\u2019 design elements\u00a0which I misunderstand.Secondly, I will try to frame my comments with respect to the stated design\u00a0goals for the language. They are very laudable goals, which are what\u00a0initially attracted me to the language:Principles and goals1. Security: It should be possible and natural to build secure smart-contracts in Vyper.2. Language and compiler simplicity: The language and the compiler implementation should strive to be simple.3. Auditability: Vyper code should be maximally human-readable. Furthermore, it should be maximally difficult to write misleading code.I\u2019m particularly interested in the \u201cAuditability\u201d portion. Although the term is not explicitly defined, I believe an auditable language would include:explicit over implicit syntax (ie. function visibility must be declared, there is no default)low cognitive overhead to differentiate between types, and track state variablesThe code and my impressionsThe following is a toy contract I wrote, which is mostly a grab bag of functionality to see what I could get to compile. In order to communicate my likes and dislikes, it seemed easiest to just include it as comments in the code itself.I wrote whatever I was trying to do in square brackets, ie.[Declare a storage variable] followed by my comments on attempting to do that thing.

JozsefBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 28, 2018[Note: I\u2019m working on Part 4, and sorry for the delay! I really appreciate the response this series is getting. As the topic of the next part is going to be the type system, I needed to do some extra research and some experiments. Also, Vyper is still in alpha, which means the language is chainging. Just recently I was part of a debate which changed the approach to handling types in arithmetic expressions.]This article is part of a series I\u2019m doing on the new Vyper language for writing Ethereum smart contracts. In the previous parts I talked about why I dislike Solidity, and about the core difference in philosophy between Solidity and Vyper. I suggest you give them a skim:Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aWhy I think Solidity is a catastrophePart 2\u200a\u2014\u200aOn the philosophy of VyperSo after all this talk about why Vyper is needed and why it\u2019s a good idea, let\u2019s get coding. We\u2019ll be implementing the Tribillium ERC-20 token, an absurd little token I invented for the purposes of tipping and gifting.Setting up the environmentThe easiest way to get into coding Vyper is via the on-line compiler at https://vyper.online/. Unfortunately, unlike Remix for Solidity, this is not a full-featured IDE with a test execution platform built in, just a regular compiler that will give you the bytecode and ABI of the contract.So to test our contracts, we\u2019ll have to use a local test blockchain. We could use ganache-cli (formerly known as testrpc), but it\u2019s a bit painful to do dev testing from the console, especially without the convenience layer of Truffle migrations\u2026 And while you can attach the Mist GUI to a ganache-cli instance, I\u2019m not a fan of Mist (to me it always seemed somewhat unstable)\u2026I suggest using the Parity client in private chain mode, as Parity has a very nice browser-based UI for deploying and interacting with accounts and smart contracts.To help you get going, I set up a Docker image you can use to kick off the environment. It\u2019s configured for development purposes, with single-signer Proof-of-Authority, some pre-funded accounts, a 5 second blocktime, 0 wei minimum gas price, and a block gas limit set at 7 million (slightly below the current annual moving average of mainnet Ethereum\u2019s block gas limit.)You can download the image source from my GitHub repo at the address https://github.com/daniel-jozsef/ParityPlayground. Please refer to the README.md there for instructions, I tried to make it as simple to get up and running as possible.Let\u2019s get\u00a0codingSo I take it the test environment is up and running, you managed to log in with your browser, and you found the Vyper on-line compiler as well. Let\u2019s write some Vyper then.The first part of the Tribillium contract I\u2019d like to implement is the mapping for token balances, as well as the ability to buy Tribillium for Ether.Vyper is a subset of Python syntax, so if you\u2019re familiar with Python, you\u2019ll feel right at home. For those unfamiliar, in Python whitespace is a first class citizen, code blocks are delimited by indenting, and newlines hold meaning. Comments are prepended by the # sign.A Vyper contract is a lot simpler than a Solidity one: we have a single contract per file, no \u201cclass\u201d declarations. The suggested extension for Vyper is\u00a0.vy, or alternatively, to enable Python syntax highlighting in GitHub,\u00a0.v.py.Storage definitionSo let\u2019s create our contract, tribillium.v.py. The first thing we need to put in are the contract storage fields, in our case, the token balance mapping.balanceOf: public(wei_value[address])First, we give the name of the field (balanceOf), and after a colon, define the type. public() is a built-in that defines a field with a public getter function of the same name.Also, here you can see the syntax of defining mappings in Vyper. It\u2019s similar to an array definition, with the value type (in our case wei_value) first, followed by the key type (address) in square brackets. This is roughly* equivalent to mapping(address => uint256) in Solidity.(In case you\u2019re new to Ethereum programming: A mapping in Ethereum smart contracts acts as a key-value map, with log(n) read complexity. Uninitialized keys can be accessed, and have 0 / default values. Iterating over the key-value pairs of a mapping is not supported.)So let\u2019s do a quick detour to talk about Vyper integers. It\u2019s a lot more limited than Solidity, and I absolutely love it. There are two integer types: uint256 and int128. These types were recently renamed, and at the time of writing, the on-line compiler still knows them by their old names: respectively num256 and num.To be honest, the new names are a lot more descriptive, so I like the change. uint256 is for non-negative, and int128 for signed integers. That\u2019s it. Considering how in Solidity a byte costs the same gas as a uint256, this seems like a very good idea.As for wei_value, the name explains itself. *However, for some reason, currently it\u2019s represented as an int128, but sooner or later this behavior is subject to change, and will be a uint256 instead to keep with the \u201cde facto standard\u201d behavior on Ethereum contracts.Defining methodsVyper uses the Python syntax for defining contract methods, with some Ethereum-specific decorators available out of the box. (Vyper doesn\u2019t allow defining custom decorators, for auditability reasons.)@public@payabledef buy():  assert msg.value > 0  # We sell Tribillium at a rate of 1:1 to Ether  self.balanceOf[msg.sender] += msg.valueThe msg object is similar to how we access it in Solidity, msg.value gives us the amount of Ether sent as part of the transaction, in wei. Its type is wei_value (see above for details.) In Pythonic fashion, the contract itself can be referred to from methods as self. Unlike Solidity, Vyper at the moment has a single assert statement as opposed to a separate assert and require. Also note its syntax, it takes a boolean expression without brackets.As for the decorators, @public publishes the method in the contract ABI (this means declared functions in Vyper default to being private), and allows external actors to call it, while @payable is similar to the payable modifier in Solidity, allowing the contract to receive Ether through this call.When someone calls this function sending a non-zero amount of Ether, they get an equivalent amount of Tribillium transferred to their balance.Deploy and\u00a0testIt feels nice to see something run, so let\u2019s compile and try this out. First, hitting Compile in the on-line Vyper compiler will hopefully end with check marks next to the Bytecode, ABI and LLL tabs on the screen, like here:If you have an exclamation mark instead, you have probably mistyped something. Opening the Bytecode tab will show you the error message from the compiler.Now, to deploy our contracts on the test chain, let\u2019s go to the Contracts tab in the Parity UI, and hit Deploy. In the following dialog, you can choose an account to deploy the contract with (since the minimum gas price is 0, it doesn\u2019t have to hold Ether), and set a name for the contract.In the last two input fields, you need to copy the ABI and the bytecode from the respective tabs on the Vyper compiler. For smart contract newbies, the ABI defines the public interface the contract exposes, while the bytecode is the actual compiled program.Feel free to hit Create, and confirm the transaction with the account password (for the test accounts, it\u2019s the same as the account name). You\u2019ll soon have a card for the new contract displayed in the Parity UI.Let\u2019s attempt to buy some tokens then. Open the contract, and hit the Execute tab, which gives you a dialog for calling methods. Since there is only one method, buy() defined on the contract, that will be fine. Using an account that has Ether, let\u2019s send an amount of 3 ETH to the new contract.Once the transaction is mined, on the contract\u2019s tab, you should be able to query the balanceOf public field for the account that sent the Ether, and you should be seeing 3 Ether (or 3,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei) equivalent of tokens shown:Stay tunedSo far we\u2019ve compiled a very simple, but working Vyper smart contract, and deployed it to a local test blockchain. Next time I\u2019ll be digging deeper into the Vyper type system, talk a bit about safemath, the alpha status of the Vyper language, and add further functions to flesh out our token.See you!",

JozsefBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 21, 2018So, after a near month-long sabbatical at a Rainbow Family gathering, and getting all my t\u2019s crossed after coming back, I\u2019m back at writing this tutorial / introduction series to Vyper, the new, still-in-development smart contract language for Ethereum.On a sidenote, apparently, Viper was quietly renamed Vyper recently. From what I gather, the motivation was that source files could have the\u00a0.vy extension, which rhymes nicely with\u00a0.py\u2026 Sweet.In the last article, I explained why I think Vyper is a great idea to begin with, and the issues I have with Solidity as the de facto industry standard in the Ethereum space. Now we\u2019ll start looking at Vyper itself, and go through a demo project from inception to deployment on Ethereum.I decided on a tutorial project I\u2019ll follow through in this series. I published an article yesterday that I\u2019ve had lying around, about a fun little coin I designed. I have some OpenZeppelin-based Solidity code for it already written, but I decided it will be an ideal demo project for Vyper. It\u2019s complex enough to show the real world usability of the language, and non-critical enough so that the big \u201calpha\u201d tag isn\u2019t bothering me.\u00a0:)So throughout this series, I\u2019m going to follow through the creation of the trickster cryptocurrency \u201cTribillium\u201d as described in the article linked above, solely in Vyper.Following alongThe latest documentation for Vyper can be found at readthedocs.io. Note how it\u2019s still spelled \u201cviper\u201d there.\u00a0:) This name change is probably going to haunt link urls for some time. The source code for the compiler, and also the docs, live on Github at ethereum/vyper.Vyper also has an on-line IDE, similar to Remix for Solidity. Unlike Remix though, it doesn\u2019t support debugging (or anything beyond compiling) at the moment. Still, it\u2019s a lot better than nothing.Also, at the moment, the link displayed in the documentations (vyper.tools) is broken. The IDE can be accessed via viper.tools (yea, right?) or vyper.online.The controversial choices of\u00a0VyperThe Github readme pretty much sums up the core driving motivations behind Vyper. Its aim was to avoid all the pitfalls Solidity fell into (or rather, dug for developers to fall into).Vyper is a highly security-focused language. It prioritizes auditability above every other conceivable thing. Coming from an off-chain developer background, it might look downright preposterous, but believe me, on the chain, it all makes absolutely perfect sense.Flat files ought to be enough for everybodyVyper can be defined in terms of what it doesn\u2019t have. And the most important thing it doesn\u2019t have is the \u201c2i\u2019s\u201d: includes and inheritance. You can also read that as \u201ccode composition\u201d.Vyper consciously and religiously forbids any form of code composition you\u2019ve probably taken for granted since the beginning of your life as a developer. Chances are, your first ever computer program started with #include or some idiomatic equivalent. So your panic is understandable and expected.However, before you storm out the door in indignation, or raise an issue on Vyper\u2019s Github, you need to understand that the constraints an Ethereum smart contract must operate under are close to those of a punchcard computer from the 70s.Code composition in Solidity gives you the illusion that you\u2019re developing for a modern machine, with modern constraints, ie. \u201cif it\u2019s polynomial, it\u2019s okay\u201d. Not on the blockchain it isn\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s surprisingly easy to write a contract whose installation cost exceeds the block gas limit. Using code composition makes it even easier.\u201cIf it\u2019s polynomial, it\u2019s okay\u201d? Not on the blockchain it\u00a0isn\u2019t.So due to the limited resources, a smart contract should be as simple as possible. If you can shuttle logic off the chain while maintaining Integrity and Non-Repudiation (in my view the whole point of using blockchain at all), then do so by all means.If you can split your on-chain logic into multiple smaller contracts, then it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest that you do. Say, if you\u2019re running an ICO\u200a\u2014\u200abut please don\u2019t run an ICO unless you\u2019re a crook\u200a\u2014\u200a, it\u2019s better to have your ERC20 / ERC827 token in one contract, your crowdsale in another, your timelocked vestings in a third, etc\u2026As a rule of thumb, if your smart contract is so long and complex that a single flat file feels uncomfortable, you\u2019re doing something wrong (and it probably won\u2019t even fit on Ethereum in the first place.)Another reason for shunning code composition in smart contracts is the nature of smart contracts. While a smart contract is not actually a contract in a legal sense, on public Ethereum, a smart contract is a social contract between the owner and the users, and inbetween individual users. For it to be a social contract, it needs to be readable and understandable by those interested and doing their due diligence.Flat files make that easier, too.So what about code\u00a0reuse?!Software engineers are, by nature, extremely lazy people. In fact, I have a pet theory that the less lazy a software engineer is, the shittier they are as an engineer / developer. A lazy person will notice early if they are doing something repetitive and pointless, and look for a better solution. A non-lazy one will soldier through, cementing in the bad initial decision that made the code complicated in the first place, and pollute the codebase with avoidable workarounds.So since we\u2019re lazy, we hate writing the same thing over and over. This is why we came up with includes, libraries, polymorphism, operator overload, generics, and all that stuff that makes up modern languages in the first place. So how does that figure with Vyper and smart contracts?When I thought of not being able to just include ERC20Token.sol, I felt this gut-wrenching cognitive dissonance sort of thing. Yea I want security and auditability, but shit, I\u2019ll actually have to press crtl+c and ctrl+v\u2026 \u201cGod, I think I\u2019m gonna wretch!\u201dWell, what helped me, and might help you, is to start viewing smart contracts as an entirely different thing. They aren\u2019t computer programs the way a webshop or notepad.exe is a computer program. They are self-documented, self-executing business workflows running on a distributed notarization system.When you are writing smart contract code, you are not simply coding. You are also documenting.The merits of templatingJust look at how a lawyer works. They are faced with the same issues, of having to churn out many extremely similar contracts, say for real estate purchases, employments, mortgages, corporate mergers, etc. One real estate sale is very similar to another. A lawyer who does real estate will have a real estate sale template that they can use to build a real estate sale contract for a client.Instead of composition, say hello to templating. Manual templating at first\u200a\u2014\u200aas I said, if manual is too much work, it\u2019s probably flawed anyway\u200a\u2014\u200a, but in the future I imagine we might see automated templating, too. Maybe with parallel documentation in human language.Also, templating simplifies things that would be complex in composition. Most bugs in OOP come from function overrides. When you want \u201cthis, but not quite this\u201d. With a template, you just go in and edit it. (And I already see someone saying that in OOP you often want multiple slightly different versions of the same, but as I pointed out, you don\u2019t have the capacity on the blockchain for something so complex anyway.)ConclusionVyper creators made some extremely brave decisions. Not brave like \u201cremoving the headphone jack from a mobile phone\u201d, more like \u201cremoving the steering wheel from a self-driving car\u201d. It\u2019s a demonstration of clear product focus, and a better definition and understanding of what it is we are even trying to accomplish.The Ethereum ecosystem needs Vyper and the vision it embodies like Apple needed Steve Jobs back in the 90s. In the follow-ups in this series, I\u2019ll demonstrate that despite its alpha status, it\u2019s already a much nicer language to work in than Solidity.(update: click here for Part 3)", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Plasma MVP Implementation In\u00a0Vyper", "author_name": "Ryuya Nakamura", "link": "https://medium.com/layerx/plasma-mvp-implementation-in-vyper-5a3850e5b1b?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 23, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "461", "content": "Plasma MVP Implementation In\u00a0VyperRyuya NakamuraBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 23, 2018Merkle Proof Membership Check in\u00a0VyperRyuya Nakamura(@veryNR)and Osuke Sudo( @zoom_zoomzo) from LayerX R&D Team implemented Minimal Viable Plasma in Vyper, a smart contract language that targets the EVM.https://github.com/LayerXcom/plasma-mvp-vyperTo our best knowledge, this is the first Plasma implementation in Vyper.

Vyper aims to be simple and human-readable as much as possible in order to improve the security of smart contracts.There have been a lot of malicious hacks due to vulnerabilities in smart contracts so far. Vyper is designed to prevent these vulnerabilities.Vyper\u2019s principles and goals in the document represents this well.Security: It should be possible and natural to build secure smart-contracts in Vyper.Language and compiler simplicity: The language and the compiler implementation should strive to be simple.Auditability: Vyper code should be maximally human-readable. Furthermore, it should be maximally difficult to write misleading code. Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer, and simplicity for readers with low prior experience with Vyper (and low prior experience with programming in general) is particularly important.Vyper is still under development but Vyper has a potential to be widely used when we taking these design goals and their importance into considering.We want to contribute to the Vyper community so decided to implement a Plasma MVP in Vyper. Plasma\u2019s contracts consists of various programs like signature verification, merkle proof, and priority queue so we thought this could be helpful for the development in Vyper in the future and Vyper\u2019s design decision.AcknowledgementWe implemented Plasma MVP based on OmiseGo\u2019s root chain contracts.

It\u2019s written in a Pythonic way which appeals to me and as a more secure alternative to Solidity I think it has a lot of potential. I plan on writing more about working with Vyper in the future.Truffle\u200a\u2014\u200aToo Much Of A Sweet\u00a0Tooth?I\u2019ve recently finished working on a hackathon project and completed the 2018 ConsenSys Academy and during that time, for better or worse, I\u2019ve become pretty accustomed to using the Truffle development environment for writing code, testing and deploying\u2014 it just makes life easier.So, in an ideal world I\u2019d like to use Truffle for working with Vyper. After a bit of investigation I found this ERC721 Vyper implementation by Maurelian who did the work to make it Truffle compatible. I thought it might be useful to document the build process for use in other projects.How To\u200a\u2014\u200aVyper Development Using\u00a0TruffleInstall VyperThe first step is to make sure Vyper is installed locally. If this has been done before you can skip\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can check by running the $ vyper -h command. There are various ways to install, including using PIP, the docs are here. I\u2019m using a Mac and did the following:Set up virtual environment:$ virtualenv -p python3.6 --no-site-packages ~/vyper-venvRemeber to activate the environmet:$ source ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateThen in my working dir:$ git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.git$ cd vyper$ make$ make testInstall TruperNext I installed Truper, a tool written by Maurelian to compile Vyper contracts to Truffle compatible artifacts. It uses Vyper which is why we installed it previously. (See the next section for details of what it\u2019s doing). To install run:$ npm i -g truperCompiling, Testing, DeployingFrom your project dir (you can clone the ERC-721 project for a quick test).Run ganache test network:$ ganache-cliCompile any Solidity contracts as usual using:$ truffle compileCompile Vyper contracts using the command:$ truper* this must be called from the project dir and you must have the virtual environment you built Vyper in running.Truffle tests can be written and run the usual way, i.e.:Use artifacts in test files:const NFToken = artifacts.require('NFToken.vyper');Run tests using:$ truffle testTruffle migrations also work the usual way. For example I used the following migration file to deploy to ganache:2_deploy_contracts.jsconst NFToken = artifacts.require('NFToken.vyper');const TokenReceiverMockVyper = artifacts.require('NFTokenReceiverTestMock.vyper');module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(NFToken, [], []);  deployer.deploy(TokenReceiverMockVyper);};$ truffle migrateWhat\u2019s Going\u00a0OnTruper uses Vyper which is why we installed it in the first step. If we look at https://github.com/maurelian/truper/blob/master/index.js we can see Truper is creating Truffle artifact files for each Vyper contract and writing them to the\u00a0./build/contracts folder of the project.Truffle Artifact\u00a0FilesThese *.json files contain descriptions of their respective smart contracts. The description includes:Contract nameContract ABI (Application Binary Interface\u200a\u2014\u200aa list of all the functions in the smart contracts along with their parameters and return values).

As the code of this token shows, the use of num256 over num also significantly complicates the contract code.THIS TOKEN HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED AND IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION FUNDS.

It is not yet ready to go mainstream since it\u2019s still under development. Vyper was not created to replace Solidity, but to be used alongside since it shares the same bytecode in order to boost security.Inspite of positive reviews pouring in for Vyper, some are questioning the need for another language to create smart contracts others are in agreement that security issues needed to be addressed.Vyper looks logically similar to Solidity but syntactically similar to Python. It eliminates many of the Object Oriented Programming paradigms and hence requiring a new paradigm definition for transactional programming. It has eliminated class inheritance, function overloading, operator overloading, and recursion as none of these are technically necessary to create a Turing-complete language.Should I learn Vyper instead of Solidity?The answer is quite complicated.Well If you want to be employed as soon as possible Solidity is the way to go. Currently, the most widely supported language out there for writing smart contracts is Solidity. It is currently the most documented and stable (um.. relatively) language out there. If you stumble upon something, there\u2019s a huge supportive community and resources that will get you up and running.If you\u2019re a person who is brave enough to experiment with a new language, and don\u2019t mind writing much simpler code, use Vyper. It\u2019s relatively new but it can create more auditable/secure smart contracts WITHOUT the features, community support and documentation that Solidity has.People who are pretty comfortable with Python will find the Vyper space better to breathe in. Vyper has a lot of features stripped down in order to enhance auditability. Smart contracts are supposed to be as simple and readable as possible, because these contracts can\u2019t change and minor flaws can spell financial disaster on a massive scale.Because of this, Vyper aims to provide the following features:Bounds and overflow checkingSupport for signed integers and decimal fixed point numbersDecidabilityStrong typingSmall and understandable compiler codeLimited support for pure functionsThe majority of the developers are speculating that Vyper is going to be used alongside Solidity in the future.When Vyper is ready, you will choose to use it or to use Solidity. Ethereum is planning to use Vyper for its future smart contracts. ( Confused? So am I. Ethereum still hasn\u2019t given any confirmation about the co-existence of Vyper and Solidity ). As far as the information flowing in as of now, Ethereum is planning to use Vyper for a majority of the the future smart contracts.Vyper is more on the positive side as far as security is concerned (Duh.)\u00a0.It is more transparent for all parties involved, and have fewer points of entry for an attack. The existing smart contracts are vulnerable to attacks and contain security flaws. This is the fate of more than 3000 smart contracts as of now. Vyper has the potential to play an important role in the future and security of Ethereum.Keeping in mind the simplicity and security of this language, the following features have been omitted:Binary fixed pointRecursive CallingOperator OverloadingClass inheritanceInline AssemblyFunction OverloadingInfinite-length loopsModifiersYou want me to answer the question? Honestly, I don\u2019t know. At this point I don\u2019t think anybody knows. There\u2019s still a lot of time for Vyper to go live. Remember, the fittest always survive. Let\u2019s wait it out and see what Vyper has in store for us.If you wanna know more about Vyper, check out the official documentation here.Cheers\u00a0:)This story is published in The Startup, Medium\u2019s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +432,678\u00a0people.Subscribe to receive our top stories\u00a0here.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "SmartCheck\u200a\u2014\u200athe First Vyper Security\u00a0Tool", "author_name": "Kirill Gorshkov", "link": "https://blog.smartdec.net/smartcheck-the-first-vyper-security-tool-a6a501904436?source=search_post", "post_date": "Oct 29, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "183", "content": "SmartCheck\u200a\u2014\u200athe First Vyper Security\u00a0ToolKirill GorshkovBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 29, 2018I tried to write some contracts on Vyper. However, it\u2019s toolbox is almost empty. Contract development and security checks are much harder than on Solidity. However, SmartCheck already works with Vyper. So, I decided to present Vyper and SmartCheck in this article.What is\u00a0Vyper?New Ethereum feature is Vyper, a child of Python and Solidity. Thus, it looks like a contract-oriented Python that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine.It is syntactically similar to Python, so inherits simplicity and readability. It was done in order to make Vyper code maximally human-readable so that users with little prior experience could understand contracts.However, from Solidity Vyper inherits not so much. For example, there is no class inheritance or modifiers. Moreover, some Solidity features like assert() / require() / revert() are removed. The whole list of features can be found in the Vyper documentation. The main role of such changes is avoiding misleading code and improving security and gas consumption. Except these alterations, Vyper works like Solidity, as contract structure and built-in functions are the same. Moreover, EVM is the same too.So, if one works with Ethereum, it may seem to him/her, that it is a great possibility to start writing smart contracts without old problems. However, not everything is that good, as Vyper is still in beta version and just doing first steps. Thus, developers run short of tools for Vyper. One can check the whole list of tools and suddenly there are no security tools at all.Let\u2019s check\u00a0securityMany Solidity developers know SmartCheck, but now it also scans Vyper contracts. You can upload your\u00a0.vy files here and check it for vulnerabilities. Let\u2019s see how it works.We have created a short contract, which consists of three functions (constructor, fallback and logic function). This contract is a game where an investor can deposit money and double them if lucky_time is guessed or lose a half of them. Contracts code:investor_money: uint256[address]lucky_time: timestamp@publicdef __init__(_lucky_time: timestamp):    self.lucky_time = _lucky_time@publicdef __default__():    throw@public@payabledef add_investor(money: uint256):    if block.timestamp == self.lucky_time:        self.investor_money[msg.sender] = 2 * money    else:        self.investor_money[msg.sender] = money / 2All we need to do is to upload a file (smartcheck_test.vy on the screenshot).And submit it for a scan.Since it is a testing example, there are only four errors. Let\u2019s take a look at this vulnerabilities and understand what\u2019s a problem.Locked moneyContracts including at least one function with @payable decorator should implement a way to withdraw ETH, i.e. call send (recommended), raw_call, or selfdestruct function at least once. Otherwise, it will be impossible to withdraw ETH.Private state variableInitializing the variables without the public function defaults to a private declaration and thus only accessible to methods within the same contract. Contrary to a popular misconception, values of these variables are still accessible for users. Developers must account for the lack of privacy in Ethereum.Redundant default functionThe payment rejection default function is redundant, since it is generated automatically.Timestamp dependenceblock.timestamp variable is used in the contract. Miners have the ability to adjust block.timestamp slightly and thus manipulate the result of the game. It can be quite dangerous if smart contract\u2019s logic relies on the exact value of block.timestamp variable.Try it\u00a0yourselfVyper can be found here, and SmartCheck is available online.

It is arguably true that all smart contract languages should be formally specified. The KVyper project is developing a formal specification for Vyper using the K Framework programming language design tools. Furthermore, the K Framework automatically generates conforming compilers from formal language specifications! Imagine formally verified smart contracts built with formally specified compilers. That is possible with Vyper.SupportThe Ethereum Foundation and many others organizations support Vyper. Vitalik Buterin and many other blockchain notables are fans of Vyper as well.ConclusionThe simplicity and security of Vyper may make it the right tool for many smart contract applications. Its agreeableness with formal methods is also promising. The smart design and wide support Vyper enjoys should continue to ensure a bright future.FeedbackFeel free to leave any comments or questions below.

A deal to work in a certain way as long as the network lives.With this principles in mind a Smart Contract should be easy to write but must be easy to read.From the Doc:Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer, and simplicity for readers with low prior experience with Vyper (and low prior experience with programming in general) is particularly important.Simplicity first will mean that Vyper doesn\u2019t have: Modifiers, Class inheritance, Inline assembly, Function overloading, Operator overloading, Recursive calling, Infinite-length loops and Binary fixed point.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "The #1 Thing Entrepreneurs Should Know About Growth Hacking: A Q&A with Vyper.io Co-Founder Jack\u00a0Paxton", "author_name": "Launchpeer", "link": "https://medium.com/@Launchpeer/the-1-thing-entrepreneurs-should-know-about-growth-hacking-a-q-a-with-vyper-io-cbcdbb41c7f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 22, 2017", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "28", "content": "The #1 Thing Entrepreneurs Should Know About Growth Hacking: A Q&A with Vyper.io Co-Founder Jack\u00a0PaxtonLaunchpeerBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 22, 2017We\u2019re just one month away from Launch Summit, the first-ever 100% virtual conference dedicated to startup hustlers. To get you ready for the event (and because we\u2019re just too damn hyped to wait), we\u2019re sharing some insights from a few of our amazing speakers.Check out our latest Q&A with Jack Paxton, Co-Founder and CMO at Vyper and make sure to reserve your spot for his talk\u200a\u2014\u200ayou seriously don\u2019t wanna miss it.For folks who don\u2019t know, what is VYPER and why did you decide to start it?I started working in digital marketing agencies doing paid acquisition (Facebook ads, etc.), then progressed into overall acquisition and spotted a huge opportunity for a real growth hacking tool (my job was to acquire new customers and leads as cheaply as possible). I tested out the concepts with some agency clients then made the jump to starting VYPER with a buddy of mine once we saw the results.Can you share a couple examples of badass/unique/creative contests or giveaways that have been run on VYPER?Most of our contests disappear once the account is paused but here are a few examples:https://vyper.io/c/756http://vyper.io/c/719https://vyper.io/c/654http://vyper.io/c/1098What if I\u2019m an early-stage entrepreneur without resources or much money\u200a\u2014\u200ahow can I come up with content upgrades or giveaways?If you do not have an existing audience you can use contests to get going extremely cheaply. A common and simple option is to partner with a complimentary brand and give away their products. The other option is to purchase the prize yourself to then give away. It will be much cheaper than using paid media and much more time efficient than content marketing.My top recommendation here is to just really spend some time connecting with Facebook group admins, community leaders, and industry influencers to get them to share with their audience if you do not have your own. Here is an example of a beta test we did: http://vyper.io/blog/case-study-using-viral-leaderboard-contests/In terms of content upgrades, you can just repurpose blog posts, checklists or short e-book guides to use as PDF downloads. As people start sharing your blog posts to get the content upgrades, it will have a snowball effect to attracting new readers.What\u2019s the #1 thing entrepreneurs should know about growth hacking in 2017/2018?Email is still the best channel for owned traffic but it is getting harder to acquire these emails as consumers become more aware of marketing tactics. Really think about how you can generate engagement and shares from your campaigns, as this will be a factor that helps you go viral. Paying for email leads one by one is so 2016\u00a0;)What are 2\u20133 key takeaways folks can expect to learn from your Launch Summit talk?How to create viral contest campaignsHow to maximize and scale your acquisition campaignsThe value of incentivisation and gamification to turn people into brand advocatesWant to learn more about growth acquisition from Jack?

That the foundation likes a particular language is usually a good enough reason for most developers to jump ship, but coders\u2019 struggles with Solidity\u200a\u2014\u200aalso championed by Ethereum\u200a\u2014\u200ameant that Vyper had to work harder to endear itself to us. And it did!On the blockchain, where gas is dear and threats abound, there are really only two boxes that a smart contract needs to check to pass muster -It must be light and as simple as possibleIt must be secureEasier said than done.A freshly deployed loan contract, for instance, can guzzle up to 4 million in gas. Granted, we can take to recycling contracts to cut costs, but this is far from ideal. The security concerns with Solidity are another matter. It is a beloved language, painstakingly worked on by committed developers, but the toll, some would say, has been heavy. Over the last few years, a rash of attack vectors have been identified and the remedies have mostly been post facto, from the DAO onwards.Vyper is optimized, according to the GitHub page, for security, language and compiler simplicity, and auditability. We found we were in agreement with this. We began playing with Vyper to bolster ReloanR, a secondary market for DAI. It clicked and now we have decided to completely shift to Vyper as our primary smart contract language. For us, Vyper seems like a pragmatic way forward. It is a happy feeling to realize that Lendroid is among the first in the space to switch to Vyper, and we are thrilled about this journey.Here are some highlights so far.1. No more cross contract callsWhile most frameworks and their cousins move towards modular designs, Vyper can be fascinatingly monolithic. Counter-intuitive as it might seem, Vyper owes much of its robustness because of its monolithic architecture.Imagine a single contract that does everything\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding loan kernel creation, fill, top up, position validation, cancel and close. It also takes care of filling in the token allowance at the outset.In effect, this does away with the need for cross-contract calls and all allied security implications. That\u2019s not all. The flow of the loan process becomes linear and logical when it\u2019s all bundled within a single contract.2. Minimizing unknown unknownsWe really don\u2019t know where an attack vector can pop up from, can we. The best we can do is to minimize vulnerabilities and Vyper is by far the most secure we\u2019ve seen. While we\u2019ll slowly modularize the architecture in subsequent versions, this monolithic framework seems the most secure right now.Fewer cross contract calls mean fewer attack vectors. An inherently lean style means a tighter code base and therefore, fewer attack vectors.Smart contract programming is not to be taken for granted, and the shift to a more air-tight environment in Vyper only makes sense.3. Faster, lighter, betterEfficiency has been a very welcome core feature of this language. Consider this. In the solidity version of ReloanR, a loan contract would require a healthy 1.7 million gas when deployed. This was still only half of what a loan process would guzzle in other lending protocols, but the level of consumption is hardly sustainable.With Vyper, a loan contract would consume around 800k or less in gas. That is a radical improvement in efficiency. And there\u2019s still a way to go. We believe the contract can be optimized much more and we shall do so, in subsequent updates.We have also been able to infuse a few nifty advantages to the contracts\u200a\u2014\u200alike a locking mechanism, for instance. Say a loan is falling below the margin level. The wrangler is within his rights to liquidate it. But he can\u2019t; the loan position would be locked if the borrower chooses to top up the collateral.

However since her birth people keep finding problems in this coding language, and are asking for a better one. Vyper currently begins getting more spotlight.This document is by no means an in-depth comparison between the two contract coding languages in Ethereum. Rather, I try to take a sample application to make a practical comparison, and see the difference when the same logic is written into these two languages. After compilation, as long as the logic is correct, the contract deployment and interaction should be the same no matter which coding language is used. Therefore I walk through several test cases using the bytecode from Vyper-coded contract.Hope this serves as the first encounter for those who have not yet seen Vyper, and can arouse some of their interests to further explore on this new contract language in Ethereum world.Contract to be Built: Open\u00a0AuctionThis is a very simple application. Open Auction assumes something to be sold publicly through auction, and anyone (with their Ethereum accounts) can bid it with their own ethers.When the contract is deployed, we need to specify two pieces of information:Beneficiary, who will collect the highest bid after the auction time is over. This is represented by an Ethereum address.Auction time (in second), which is the period for the auction. Bid is accepted when it is still in the auction period, and rejected when it is over. The bid is transferred to the beneficiary only after the auction period.During the auction time, the contract is open for bidding, and keeps track the highest bid and the bidder as its state variables. When it sees a bidder with a higher bid, the contract will refund the previous highest bid to the previous bidder, and keeps the new one. The contract simply rejects bid lower than the current highest bid.Note: it is by no means the best and the most optimized implementation of an auction contract. There is much discussion on how to make an auction contract better and more secure. This is just a minimal contract to demonstrate the basic operation for an auction.Note: this contract code is adapted from the example in Vyper (link) and from a video from Blockgeeks (link).Contract Code: Side-by-SideSimilar StructureThe structure of Solidity and Vyper is very similar, and can be easily divided into three parts,State variables: where one can define the variables for the contract. These variables are kept permanently in the storage trie of the deployed contract, and can only be updated through invoking contract functions.Constructor: the creation code that is executed once when the contract is deployed. It is used to initialize the state variables.Functions: one or more functions are being invoked through transactions after contract deployment. Once invoked, the code in the function is executed (on EVM) and the state variables and other states are updated accordingly.Here is how the logic is implemented using the two coding languages.Just a quick comparison between the two languages,The coding format of Solidity is JavaScript-like (arguably), while Vyper is obviously Python-based. See how to define constructor and functions, and how to refer a state with self.There are more data types defined in Vyper, such as timestamp, timedelta, wei_value, etc.Visibility (like public, private) and other keywords such as payable are coded as annotation in Vyper.Of course there are much more difference when comparing the code, but these are just what what we observe in these two contracts side by side.Compilation and DeploymentLike any coding languages in other domains, both Solidity and Vyper come with its own compiler. The objective of compilation is to generate two pieces of information for contract deployment: Application Binary Interface (ABI) and Bytecode.ABI: it is used when we interact with a deployed contract in a human way (application with SDK or command line)Bytecode: it is the machine code containing the instructions, and is being executed by EVM when deploying contract and invoking functions.The tools I am using for code compilation isRemix (http://remix.ethereum.org) the online tool for Ethereum contractVyper online (https://vyper.online) the online tool for vyper contract compilationBytecode truncated in both contractsWe will not do a byte-by-byte comparison between their ABI and bytecode, as we do not expect both are generating identical codes. We also will not draw a conclusion on bytecode size and therefore gas consumption, as currently we have only one contract without going into very detail analysis. Nevertheless, as far as we can achieve the same logic through executing functions, we just assume both are working fine.The deployment of bytecode is the same for both Solidity-coded contract and Vyper-coded contract. Remember, both bytecodes will deliver the same functionality and logic, and EVM does not care what coding language the bytecode is developed from.Testing with Ethereum Simulator and Geth\u00a0ClientTo demonstrate the compiled result, we are going to deploy the contract. Here are the steps we are going to perform.As both yields the same result, here I just place captured screen shots for code in Vyper.My screen is split into two: the right-hand-side is the ganache-cli Ethereum simulator, and it comes with 10 Ethereum accounts, each of which has 100 ethers.The left-hand-side is where I deploy contract and interact with the deployed contract.Step 1First we define the variable abi and bytecode. Then use the command eth.contract().new to deploy the contract. Note that eth.accounts[9] is the beneficiary and the auction duration is 600 seconds (10 minutes).> eth.contract(abi).new(eth.accounts[9], 600, {from: eth.accounts[0], data: bytecode, gas: 1000000})We obtain the contract ID from the ganache-cli windows. Now we define an object openAuction to this deployed contract. We use openAuction to interact with this deployed contract.> var openAuction = eth.contract(abi).at(<contract address>)At the beginning we see the Auction Start and Stop time (in seconds). Date.now() gives us the current time (in milliseconds). It is smaller than the Auction Stop time, meaning that we are still in the auction period.Also we see the highest bid is currently zero, and no bidder submits the bid yet.Step 2Bidder eth.accounts[1] submits a bid with 10 ethers. The transaction is being processed. Now the Highest Bid and Highest Bidder reflects this bid. Note that eth.accounts[1] balance is ~90 ethers, which is 10 ethers less than the previous balance (plus some gas consumed for bidding transaction).Step 3Another bidder eth.accounts[2] submits a bid with 15 ethers. After transaction is executed, the Highest Bid and Higest Bidder reflects this new bid. As expected, 15 ethers are taken as bid from eth.accounts[2], while eth.accounts[1] gets back the fund as it is no longer the highest bid.Step 4Another bidder eth.accounts[3] tries to bid with a value 12 ethers, which is less than current highest bid (15 ethers). The result is a revert per our contract code (assertion). Meanwhile, the Highest Bid and Highest Bidder remain as Step 3.Step 5eth.accounts[0] tries to execute the endAuction() function, which calls for an end of auction. However it is again a revert as the auction time is not over yet. Current time is still less than the Auction Stop time.Step 6After the auction time is over (see current time is now larger than the Auction Stop time), eth.accounts[0] now can execute the endAuction() function. Per the code design, the state variables ended is now True, and the highest bid (15 ethers) is transferred to the beneficiary (eth.accounts[9]).Step 7After the auction time is over, if any account tries to submit a bid, revert happens as the bid is accepted only in the auction period (assertion).Step 8If anyone tries to execute endAuction() again, revert happens, as the whole auction has already ended.Closing and Further ReferenceThe structure of Vyper is almost the same as Solidity (and in fact all smart contract coding in other blockchain frameworks looks quite similar at all). Using Vyper\u2019s compiler we can get back both the ABI and bytecode, and deploy and interact with the contract with our normal way.If you are interested to know more about Vyper, there is a resource list in this site.

This can be a pain.I made a small library that ~~swerves~~ past this restriction. We\u2019ll discuss that in a moment. I\u2019ll briefly review Vyper before analyzing the library.Source: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*bgBCdx65C6_w6XztyRXfYg.pngVyperis a language built to interact with smart contracts on Ethereum. According to Vitalik:Vyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)You can read the Vyper docs here and play with it in a Remix-like, in-browser environment here.The Becoming Future team loves Vyper for all the simplicity and security it provides. We hope to contribute more to the (admittedly, currently tiny) Vyper community in the future.LibraryLet\u2019s now dive into a simplified version of my implementation. Checkout and fork the repo here! I made implementations for dynamic arrays of different data types supported by Vyper. They all follow the same format, so if you understand one, you understand them all. We\u2019ll be focusing on a simplified version of the uint256 dynamic array implementation in this post.MAXVAL: constant(uint256) = 2**255ls: map(uint256, uint256)currMax: public(uint256)@public@constantdef get(_idx: uint256) -> uint256:    assert _idx < self.currMax    return self.ls[_idx]@public@constantdef length() -> uint256:    return self.currMax@publicdef set(_idx: uint256, _val: uint256):    self.ls[_idx] = _val@publicdef append(_val: uint256):    self.set(self.currMax, _val)    self.currMax += 1@publicdef detach():    assert self.currMax > 0    self.currMax -= 1@publicdef remove(_idx: uint256):    assert self.currMax > 0    assert self.currMax > _idx    i: uint256    for not_i in range(MAXVAL):        i = convert(not_i, uint256)        if i == self.currMax - 1:            self.currMax -= 1            return        elif i >= _idx and i < self.currMax - 1:            self.set(i, self.get(i + 1))Here\u2019s why this simple code is useful: Vyper only allows you to perform range() on a constant-sized input, which is problematic when one has a dynamic amount of content to loop over. Operations such as remove() would be impossible without a tiny fix. Simply define a different, mutable variable (in this case, self.currMax) and loop along range(MAX) until self.currMax is reached.That\u2019s it!I chose MAX to be the largest value a uint256 could be in Vyper, namely 2\u00b2\u2075\u2076 just because I can. Clearly this destroys my space complexity, but at least all use cases are permitted. Feel free to alter this value to fit your own needs.I would not use the above implementation in production. I\u2019d use the actual implementation instead i.e. my library (found in the linked repo above and below and here). The actual implementation, my library, houses many security checks including whitelisted lists, which prevent a random person from accidentally or purposefully overriding your data.Checkout and fork the repo here!Analysis+----------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+|       Feature        |    Array    | Dynamic Array |  My Array |+----------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+| Indexing             |     O(1)    |     O(1)      |    O(1)   || Insert/delete @ start|     O(n)    |     O(n)      |    O(1)   || Insert/delete @ end  |     O(1)    | O(n) amortized|    O(1)   || Insert/delete @ mid  |     O(n)    |     O(n)      |    O(1)   || Wasted space         |      0      |     O(n)      |    O(M)   |+----------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+where M := 2^256 (but you can tune this to your liking)(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array)(Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53939725/why-is-deletion-of-an-item-at-end-of-dynamic-array-on-time-complexity)Thanks for reading!

It was a very cool contest for people like me who could use those tools for our daily work. Of course, I joined without a second thought.Vyper.io concept is similar to Gleam.io and Rafflecopter.com which is not new in the market. So running their own Giveaway Contest is a good way to attract more people (potential customers).The registration process was simple and plain, they sent me an email to confirm and 10 points for verifying my email. The rules were simple, the more points you have the higher chance you win. Fair enough!You can get more point by doing some pre-defined actions, for ex: Like their FB, Join their FB Group, Review their course\u2026etc. Each action will give you different points.But to get past 500 points, you have to refer people to register through your link. Each person you referred will give you 100 points. At the time I joined the contest, the 1st position had 10k points, the 2nd had 5k points. To get in top 10, you must have at least 1k points.I was so into that contest with \u201cmust win\u201d thought in my mind. First I tried to find the Contest\u2019s Term/Rules to follow but found nothing but a line said that \u201cYou can\u2019t refer yourself or you will be disqualified\u201d. Ok, I understood.Next thing I thought: How to win this contest? I have to get at least 5k points to sit in top 3. That will give me a higher chance to win for sure.Before doing anything that costs money, I sent my ref link to all my friends on FB and emails. I messaged them and instructed them to register. I got about 10 friends joined, so 1k points for me. That action gave me sit into top 20 position.But I\u2019m a greedy person so I decided to start a FB Ads campaign for my ref link. (I still follow the contest rules) And here was the result:That was a smart move for me, I was happy to see my points going up every day. Yesterday, I got 5k points and hold #3 spot tightly. I was so close to #2, only 1\u2013200 points to get that position.And BAM! They slapped me in my face. I\u2019ve been disqualified for the reasons below. They didn\u2019t show any proof so I doubt that they just don\u2019t want to give rewards to people \u201cnot on their list\u201d.Without notification, that\u2019s all I get after spending a lot of time and money to promo their Contest.

As the number of applications utilizingpublic cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms grow, thedemand for processing high transaction rates in the order ofhundreds and thousands of Tx/s is increasing.In this work, we present ZILLIQA\u200a\u2014\u200aa new blockchain platformthat is designed to scale in transaction rates. As the number ofminers in ZILLIQA increases, its transaction rates are expected toincrease.

If this isn\u2019t the case, then check out the online compiler or the (very early-stage) Twig framework to build your vyper contract. If you just want to play around with packaging any vyper contract, feel free to grab a sample vyper contract from here.getting setupClone the starter repo linked above, and follow the steps listed in the Quickstart section of the README.md to install the necessary tools on your machine. This repo is by no means necessary to package up your vyper contracts, but simply provided as a resource to make the manifest generation process as painless as possible.hello manifestWhat is a manifest? A manifest can be thought of as the basic unit of measurement in the EthPM infrastructure. Each manifest maps to a version of a package. When you \u201cpublish\u201d or \u201crelease\u201d a package version, you are simply storing the content-addressed URI at which the manifest is located on your on-chain registry.This starter repo uses some pytest-ethereum magic behind the scenes to help generate our manifest.If you\u2019re all set up, copy and paste your vyper contract(s) into the devcon_iv_ethpm/vyper_contracts/ directory.If you want to customize your manifest name and version (which you probably do).

Try our free VyperSDKOne of the most significant challenges for researchers, security experts and those involved in cyber protection in the Windows environment is to know what is going on inside the operating system kernel. Because Microsoft has closed the possibility of monitoring the kernel with the PatchGuard, the only way to do that is with a virtualization layer.That\u2019s why we at Viral Security Group developed a thin hypervisor based on hardware-assisted virtualization technology. This thin hypervisor (called \u201cVyper\u201d) is the core engine of multiple applications, all of which have great potential for commercial use.The core engine was developed based on Intel VT-x technology which implements virtualization at the CPU level. In other words, the running operating system (e.g., Windows) is not aware of being virtualized.To enjoy the benefits of the engine, a dedicated VyperSDK has developed that includes the Kernel Hooking Library and the CPU Registers Monitoring Library. Both are running \u201con top\u201d of Vyper VMM and have the capability of controlling physical and virtual memory access. As well as monitoring for debugging configurations, and more.Such transparency to the operating system kernel protects against malicious code attempts trying to bypass existing security mechanisms in the Windows API.Vyper SandboxTo show what one can do with the VyperSDK, we developed a sandbox based on the virtualization layer. The Vyper Sandbox is an environment that allows one to check how malicious code behaves as soon as one activate it.Because the virtualization engine can monitor all operations performed on the operating system kernel, the report provided by the Vyper Sandbox grants the user with full transparency on the behavior of the malicious code.It is important to note that the current version of the Vyper Sandbox does not label which actions are legitimate or malicious. For this, the user must load known malicious code signatures and \u201cteach\u201d the sandbox how to tag the results.In other words, the Vyper Sandbox is a tool to record the behavior of malicious code running on the operating system. It\u2019s a sort of malware sniffer. Nevertheless, this is a unique ability. The Vyper Sandbox does not trigger the malicious code to run by injecting code. An action that can cause the malicious code to understand that it is being tested and, as a result, trigger evasive mechanisms.Instead, the Vyper Sandbox allows malicious code to run on a real operating system when the virtual layer runs between the operating system and the processor. In this way, the malicious program does not recognize that it is in a virtual environment and does not activate evasive mechanisms.The user\u2019s ability to view the full sequence of malicious code against the operating system kernel allows researchers, and developers of protection tools, complete transparency.Sharing with the communityAs security researchers, we know how to evaluate the benefit of sharing information. And hence, we give the Vyper Sandbox and the VyperSDK free of scharge to the community of developers and researchers. The goal is to share knowledge in favor of improving existing defense tools.However, we maintain transparency, and it is essential to know that the Vyper Sandbox is running in the cloud. Any malicious code snippet that comes up to the cloud for Vyper Sandbox testing visible to all users.Organizations or individuals who wish to receive the code for the Vyper Sandbox for local use may contact us on a specific application form.Each request will receive a response.

This document covers the design specification, providing references to the implementation along the way. Our code supports deploying a new chain to testnet, an on-chain registry of other plasma chains and their block explorers, and transacting via a command-line wallet.IntroductionThe vision of a network of blockchains as a scalability solution has been spreading rapidly. A multi-chain approach for parallelizing transactions is a promising way to increasing throughput\u2026 unfortunately, it also imposes significant challenges:We don\u2019t want to divide security, e.g. 100 chains with 1% of total security each.Advanced solutions like sharding are promising, but not yet ready.We need a solution to scalability that:Provides similar levels of security to the Ethereum mainnet, without paying millions of dollars in mining fees.Can be implemented on Ethereum as it exists today.We believe that the strongest candidate to meet these criteria is a network of chains, each secured to mainnet via the Plasma framework.Plasma is a family of protocols which allow individuals to easily deploy high-throughput, secure blockchains. A smart contract on Ethereum\u2019s main chain can ensure that users\u2019 funds are secure, even if the \u201cplasma chain\u201d acts fully maliciously. This eliminates the need for a trusted pegging mechanism like that of sidechains. Plasma chains are non-custodial, allowing the prioritization of scalability without sacrificing security.We envision a future with many Plasma chains, giving users choice over where they transact. So, along with releasing our plasma chain implementation, we have created a PlasmaRegistry.vy. The registry allows new chains to join the network by listing their IP/DNS address, a custom \u201cname\u201d string, and their contract address. The registry contract does the verifies trusted deployment, so users can be assured that any contract on that registry is safe to deposit into\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if its operator is malicious.Properties of our Plasma Chain ImplementationThis post specifies Plasma Group\u2019s current protocol and implementation, which draws from recent developments within the research community.Our specification has the following properties:Single transactions over large ranges of coins, solving the \u201cfixed-denomination\u201d problem in Plasma Cash.Block size which scales with the number of transactions, not the number of deposits.Light client proofs which scale in the logarithm of the block size and linear in blocks since deposit, making the operator the system\u2019s only (computational) bottleneck.A simplified, optimistic exit procedure that allows exits to specify only the most recent transaction, instead of both a transaction and its parent.Interchain atomic swaps, which lay the groundwork for decentralized exchange protocols.Unlimited deposit capacity.Our implementation follows the above specification, providing the following:A command line plasma chain operator written in Javascript.A plasma client implementation written in Javascript with a command-line wallet.A smart contract supporting ETH and ERC20 tokens written in Vyper.An integrated JSON RPC which allows clients to download and verify light client proofs and transact.A block explorer hosted by the plasma operator.A simulated client swarm which generates transactions to load test.A Plasma \u201cregistry\u201d contract which lists a set of verified-as-safe contracts and operator IP addresses for users to explore.If you\u2019re interested in checking out the protocol and the code implementation, you\u2019ve come to the right place!However, a few disclaimers before we dig in:Our plasma implementation is beta software currently only suitable for testnet use. There are surely critical bugs at this time.The main difference (explained below!) between this protocol and other Plasma implementations is the block structure: a Merkle sum tree. This has significant benefits, but adds complexity. Plasma is already complex in comparison to sidechains.Code has yet to be audited or formally verified, and has not undergone any optimization.While the operator is the only computational bottleneck, the primary performance limit today remains bandwidth. Custody proofs require downloads which are linear in the number of blocks. Our code is an improvement per block, but still linear. This active area of research is yet unready for implementation.Though our safety mechanisms and exit games are both implemented and tested, we have not yet built an automated guard service, meaning challenges and responses must be manually constructed.With that out of the way, let\u2019s jump in!

General Definitions and Data StructuresThis section will cover terminology and intuitions for the protocol\u2019s components. These data structures are encoded and decoded by plasma-utils\u2019 library serialization. The exact byte-per-byte binary representations of all data structures for each structure can be found in schemas.Coin ID AssignmentThe base unit of any plasma asset is represented as a coin. Like in standard Plasma Cash, these coins are non-fungible, and we call the index of a coin its coinID, which is 16 bytes. They are assigned in order of deposit on a per-asset (ERC 20/ETH) basis. Notably, all assets in the chain share the same ID-space, even if they are different ERC20s or ETH. This means that transactions across all asset classes (which we refer to as the tokenType or token) share the same tree, providing maximum compression.We achieve this by having the first 4 bytes refer to the tokenTypeof a coin, and the next 12 represent all possible coins of that specific tokenType.For example: the 0th tokenType is always ETH, so the first ETH deposit will give spending rights for coin 0x00000000000000000000000000000000 to the depositer.The total coins received per deposit is precisely (amount of token deposited)/(minimum token denomination) many.For example: let\u2019s say that tokenType 1 is DAI, the coin denomination is 0.1 DAI, and the first depositer sends 0.5 DAI. That means its tokenType == 1, so the first depositer will recieve the coinIDs from 0x00000001000000000000000000000000 up to and including coin 0x00000001000000000000000000000004.coins all share the same\u00a0ID-spaceDenominationsIn practice, denominations will be much lower than 0.1. Instead of storing denominations directly in the contract, it stores a decimalOffset mapping for each tokenType which represents the shift in decimal places between the amount of deposited ERC20 (or wei for ETH) and the number of received plasma coins. These calculations can be found in the depositERC20, depositETH, and finalizeExit functions in the smart contract//Note: decimalOfsets are hardcoded to 0 for this release, as we lack support in the client/operator code.2. Transactions over ranges of\u00a0coinsTransfersA transaction consists of a specified block number and an array of Transfer objects, which describe the details of each range of the transaction. From the schema in plasma-utils (lengths in bytes):We can see that each Transfer in a Transaction specifies a tokenType, start, end, sender, and recipient.Typed and Untyped\u00a0BoundsOne thing to note above is that the start and end values are not 16 bytes, as coinIDs are, but rather 12. This should make sense in the context of the above sections on deposits. To get the actual coinIDs described by the transfer, we concatenate the token field\u2019s 4 bytes to the left of start and end. We generally refer to the 12-byte versions as a transfer\u2019s untypedStart and untypedEnd, with the concatenated version being called typedStart and typedEnd. These values are also exposed by the serializer.Another note: in any transfer the corresponding coinIDs are defined with start inclusive and end exclusive. That is, the exact coinIDs transferred are [typedStart, typedEnd). For example, the first 100 ETH coins can be sent with a Transfer with transfer.token = 0, transfer.start = 0, and transfer.end = 100. The second 100 would have transfer.start = 100 and transfer.end = 200.Multisends and Transfer/Transaction AtomicityThe Transaction schema consists of a 4-byte block number (the transaction is only valid if included in that particular plasma block), and an array of Transfer objects. This means that a transaction can describe several transfers, which are either all atomically executed or not depending on the entire transaction\u2019s inclusion and validity. This will form the basis for both decentralized exchange and defragmentation in later releases.SerializationAs exemplified above, plasma-utils implements a custom serialization library for data structures. Both the JSON RPC and the smart contract use the byte arrays as encoded by the serializer.The encoding is quite simple, being the concatenation of each value fixed to the number of bytes defined by the schema.For encoding which involve variable-sized arrays, such as Transaction objects which contain 1 or more Transfers, a single byte precedes for the number of elements. Tests for the serialization library can be found here.Currently, we have schemas for the following objects:TransferUnsignedTransactionSignatureSignedTransactionTransferProofTransactionProof3. Block Structure SpecificationOne of the most important improvements Plasma Cash introduced was \u201clight proofs.\u201d Previously, plasma constructions required that users download the entire plasma chain to ensure safety of their funds. With Plasma Cash, they only have to download the branches of a Merkle tree relevant to their own funds.This was accomplished by introducing a new transaction validity condition: transactions of a particular coinID are only valid at the coinIDth leaf in the Merkle tree. Thus, it is sufficient to download just that branch to be confident no valid transaction exists for that coin. The problem with this scheme is that transactions are \u201cstuck\u201d at this denomination: if you want to transact multiple coins, you need multiple transactions, one at each leaf.Unfortunately, if we put the range-based transactions into branches of a regular Merkle tree, light proofs would become insecure. This is because having one branch does not guarantee that others don\u2019t intersect:Leaves 4 and 6 both describe transactions over the range (3,4). Having one branch DOES NOT guarantee that the other doesn\u2019t\u00a0exist.With a regular Merkle tree, the only way to guarantee no other branches intersect is to download them all and check. But that\u2019s no longer a light proof!At the heart of our plasma implementation is a new block structure, and an accompanying new transaction validity condition, which allows us to get light proofs for range-based transactions. The block structure is called a Merkle sum tree, where next to each hash is a sum value.The new validity condition uses the sum values for a particular branch to compute a a start and end range. This calculation is specially crafted so that it is impossible for two branches\u2019 computed ranges to overlap. A transfer is only valid if its own range is within that range, so this gets us back our light clients!This section will specify the exact spec of the sum tree, what the range calculation actually is, and how we actually construct a tree which satisfies the range calculation. For a more detailed background and motivation on the research which led us to this spec, feel free check out this post.We have written two implementations of the plasma Merkle sum tree: one done in a database for the operator, and another in-memory for testing in plasma-utils.Sum Tree Node SpecificationEach node in the Merkle sum tree is 48 bytes, as follows:[32 byte hash][16 byte sum]It\u2019s not a coincidence that the sum\u2019s 16 bytes length is the same as a coinID!We have two helper properties,\u00a0.hash and\u00a0.sum, which pull out these two parts. For example, for somenode = 0x1b2e79791f28c27ed669f257397e1deb3e522cf1f27024c161b619d276a25315ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff, we havenode.hash == 0x1b2e79791f28c27ed669f257397e1deb3e522cf1f27024c161b619d276a25315 and node.sum == 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff.Parent CalculationIn a regular Merkle tree, we construct a binary tree of hash nodes, up to a single root node. Specifying the sum tree format is a simple matter of defining the parent(left, right) calculation function which accepts the two siblings as arguments. For example, a regular Merkle sum tree has:\u00a0parent = function (left, right) { return Sha3(left.concat(right)) } Where Sha3 is the hash function and concat appends the two values together.To create a Merkle sum tree, the parent function must also concatenate the result of an addition operation on its children\u2019s own\u00a0.sum values:parent = function (left, right) {  return Sha3(left.concat(right)).concat(left.sum + right.sum) }For example, we might haveparent(0xabc\u20260001, 0xdef\u20260002) ===hash(0xabc\u20260001.concat(0xdef\u20260002)).concat(0001 + 0002) ===0x123\u20260003Note that the parent.hash is a commitment to each sibling.sum as well as the hashes: we hash the full 96 bytes of both.Calculating a Branch\u2019s\u00a0RangeThe reason we use a Merkle sum tree is because it allows us to calculate a specific range which a branch describes, and be 100% confident that no other valid, overlapping branches exist.We calculate this range by adding up a leftSum and rightSum going up the branch. Initializing both to 0, at each parent calculation, if the inclusion proof specifies a sibling to the right, we take rightSum += right.sum, and if to the left, we add leftSum += left.sum.Then, the range the branch describes is [leftSum, root.sum\u200a\u2014\u200arightSum). See the following example:Merkle sum calculation for a\u00a0branch.In this example, branch 6\u2019s valid range is [21+3, 36\u20135) == [24, 31). Notice that 31\u201324=7, which is the sum value for leaf 6! Similarly, branch 5\u2019s valid range is [21, 36-(7+5)) == [21, 24). Notice that its end is the same as branch 6\u2019s start!If you play around with it, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s impossible to construct a Merkle sum tree with two different branches covering the same range. At some level of the tree, the sum would have to be broken! Go ahead, try to \u201ctrick\u201d leaf 5 or 6 by making another branch that intersects the range (4.5,6). Filling in only the\u00a0?s in grey boxes:You\u2019ll see it\u2019s always impossible at some level of the tree:This is how we get light clients. We call the branch range bounds the implicitStart and implicitEnd, because they are calculated \u201cimplicitly\u201d from the inclusion proof. We have a branch checker implemented in plasma-utils via calculateRootAndBounds() for testing and client-side proof checking:PG Plasma client-side sum tree branch checkeras well as in Vyper for the smart contract viaNote that the ranges are typed starts and ends, the full 16 bytes.Parsing Transfers as\u00a0LeavesIn a regular Merkle tree, we construct the bottom layer of nodes by hashing the \u201cleaves\u201d:In our case, we want the leaves to be the transactions. So, the hashing is straightforward, but we still need a\u00a0.sum value for the tree\u2019s bottom level.Given some txA with a single transferA, what should the sum value be? It turns out, not just transferA.end\u200a\u2014\u200atransferA.start. The reason for this is that it screws up branches\u2019 ranges if the transfers are not touching. We need to \u201cpad\u201d the sum values to account for this gap, or the root.sum will be too small.Interestingly, this is a non-deterministic choice because you can pad either the node to the right or left of the gap. We\u2019ve chosen the following \u201cleft-aligned\u201d scheme for parsing leaves into blocks:Transfer sum\u00a0parsingWe call the bottommost\u00a0.sum value the parsedSum for that branch, and the TransferProof schema includes a\u00a0.parsedSum value which is used to reconstruct the bottom node.Branch Validity and Implicit\u00a0NoTxThus, the validity condition for a branch as checked by the smart contract is as follows: implicitStart <= transfer.typedStart < transfer.typedEnd <= implicitEnd\u00a0. Note that, in the original design of the sum tree in \u201cPlasma Cashflow,\u201d some leaves were filled with a special \u201cNoTx\u201d transaction to represent that ranges were not transacted. With this format, the coins which are not transacted are simply those in the ranges [implicitStart, transfer.typedStart) and [transfer.typedEnd, implicitEnd). The smart contract guarantees that no coins in these ranges can be used in any challenge or response to an exit.Atomic MultisendsOften (to support transaction fees and exchange) transactions require multiple transfers to occur or not, atomically, to be valid. The effect is that a valid transaction needs to be included once for each of its\u00a0.transfers\u200a\u2014\u200aeach with a valid sum in relation to that particular transfer.typedStart and\u00a0.typedEnd. However, for each of these inclusions, it\u2019s still the hash of the full UnsignedTransaction\u200a\u2014\u200aNOT the individual Transfer\u2014 that is parsed to the bottom\u00a0.hash.5. Proof Structure and\u00a0CheckingUnlike traditional blockchain systems, full plasma nodes don\u2019t store every single transaction, they only ever need to store information relevant to assets they own. This means that the sender has to prove to the recipient that the sender actually owns the given range. A complete proof contains all the information sufficient to guaranteed that, if the Ethereum chain itself does not fork, tokens are redeemable on the main chain.Proofs primarily consist of the inclusion and non-inclusion of transactions, which update the chain of custody for those coins. The inclusion roots must be checked against the block hashes submitted by the operator to the smart contract on the main chain. By tracing the chain of custody as verified in the proof scheme, from a token\u2019s initial deposit into the contract through to the present, ability to redeem is guaranteed.plasma-core follows a relatively simple methodology for verifying incoming transaction proofs. This section describes that methodology.Proof FormatHistory proofs consist of a set of deposit records and long list of relevant Transactions with corresponding TransctionProofs.plasma-utils exposes a static checkTransactionProof(transaction, transactionProof, root) method, which is used by plasma-core here via calls to the ProofService.Transaction ProofsA TransactionProof object contains all the necessary information to check the validity of a given Transaction. Namely, it is simply an array of TransferProof objects. As per the above section on atomic multisends, a given TransactionProof is valid if and only if all its TransferProofs are valid.Transfer ProofsTransferProofs contain all the necessary information required to recover the inclusion of a valid branch corresponding to the given Transfer in the Transaction at the correct block number. This constitutes:The actual nodes of the Merkle sum tree which represent the branch\u2019s full `inclusionProof`The index of the leaf to calculate the binary path traced by the branchThe parsed bottom\u00a0.sum as described in the sum tree spec aboveThe signature for that particular sender.Right from the plasma-utils schema:Note that the inclusionProof is a variable-length array whose size depends on the depth of the tree.Proof StepsThe core of the verification process involves applying each proof element to the current \u201cverified\u201d state, starting with the deposit. If any proof element doesn\u2019t result in a valid state transition, we must reject the proof.The process for applying each proof element is intuitive; we simply apply the transactions at each block as the contract\u2019s custody rules dictate.Snapshot ObjectsThe way in which we keep track of historically owned ranges is called a snapshot.Quite simply, it represents the verified owner of a range at a block:{  typedStart: Number,  typedEnd: Number,  block: Number,  owner: address}Deposit recordsEvery received range has to come from a corresponding deposit.A deposit record consists of its token, start, end, depositer, and blockNumber.For each deposit record, the verifier must double-check with Ethereum to verify that the claimed deposit did indeed occur, and that no exits have happened in the meantime.If so, a verifiedSnapshots array is initialized to these deposits with each snapshot.owner being the depositer.Next, we apply all given TransactionProofs, updating verifiedSnapshots accordingly. For each transaction and corresponding transactionProof, the verifier performs the following steps:Verify that the given proof element is valid. If not, throw an error.For each transfer in the transaction, do the following:\u00a0a. \u201cSplit\u201d any snapshots which were updated above at transfer.typedStart, transfer.typedEnd, implicitStart, and implicitEnd\u00a0b. Increment the\u00a0.block number for all resulting verifiedSnapshots which have a block equalling transaction.blockNumber\u200a\u2014\u200a1\u00a0c. For each split snapshot which fell between transfer.start and transfer.end:\u00a0i. verify that snapshot.owner === transfer.from. If not, throw an error.\u00a0ii. set snapshot.owner = transfer.sender.The TransactionProofs must be applied in ascending blockNumber.Once this operation has been recursively applied for all TransactionProofs, the client may check for herself which new coins she now owns, by searching for all elements in verifiedSnapshots with a blockNumber equalling the current plasma block, and the owner equalling her address.TransactionProof ValidityThe transaction validity check in step 1. above is equivalent to checking the smart contract\u2019s validity condition. The basic validity check, based on the sum tree specification above, is as follows:1. Check that the transaction encoding is well-formed.2. For each transfer and corresponding transferProof:\u00a0a. Check that the signature resolves to its transfer.sender address\u00a0b. verify that the inclusionProof has a root equal to the root hash for that plasma block, with the binary path defined by the leafIndex\u00a0c. calculate the implicitStart and implicitEnd of the branch, and verify that implicitStart <= transfer.start < transfer.end <= implicitEnd4. Contract and Exit\u00a0GamesOf course, the proof for a chain of custody isn\u2019t useful unless it can also be passed to the main chain to keep funds secure. The mechanism which accepts proofs on-chain is the core of plasma\u2019s security model, and it is called the \u201cexit game.\u201dWhen a user wants to move their money off a plasma chain, they make an \u201cexit\u201d, which opens a dispute period. At the end of the dispute period, if there are no outstanding disputes, the money is sent from the plasma contract on the main chain to the exiter. During the dispute period, users may submit \u201cchallenges\u201d which claim the money being exited isn\u2019t rightfully owned by the person exiting. The proofs described above guarantee that a \u201cresponse\u201d to these challenges is always calculable.The goal of the exit game is to keep money secured, even in the case of a maximally adversarial operator. Particularly, there are three main attacks which we must mitigate:Data withholding: the operator may publish a root hash to the contract, but not tell anybody what the contents of the block are.Including a forged/invalid transaction: the operator may include a transaction in a block whose sender was not the previous recipient in the chain of custody.Censorship: after someone deposits their money, the operator may refuse to publish any transactions sending the money.In all of these cases, the challenge/response protocol of the exit game makes sure these behaviors do not allow theft, in at most 1 challenge followed by 1 response.Keeping track of deposits and\u00a0exitsDeposits mappingEach time a new set of coins is deposited, the contract updates a mapping which each contain a deposit struct. From the contract:Note that this struct contains neither the untypedEnd or tokenType for the deposit. That\u2019s because the contract uses those values as the keys in a mapping of mappings. Accessing, for example, accessing the depositer of a given deposit looks like this: someDepositer: address = self.deposits[tokenType][untypedEnd].depositerThis choice saves a little gas, and also makes some of the code cleaner since we don\u2019t need to store any sort of deposit ID to reference a deposit.Exitable ranges mappingIn addition to adding self.deposits entries each time there\u2019s a deposit, the contract needs to somehow keep track of historical exits to prevent multiple exits on the same range. This is a little trickier because exits do not occur in order like deposits, and it would be expensive to search through a list of exits.Our contract implements a constant-sized solution, which instead stores a list of exitable ranges, updating the list as new exits occur. From the smart contract:Again, we use a double-nested mapping with keys tokenType and untypedEnd so that we may call self.exitable[tokenType][untpyedEnd].untypedStart to access the start of the range. Note that Vyper returns 0 for all unset mapping keys, so we need an isSet bool so that users may not \u201ctrick\u201d the contract by passing an unset exitableRange.The contract\u2019s self.exitable ranges are split and deleted based on successful calls to finalizeExit via a helper function called removeFromExitable. Note that exits on a previously exited range do not even need to be challenged; they will never pass the checkRangeExitable test called in finalizeExit. You can find that code here.Exit games\u2019 relationship to vanilla Plasma\u00a0CashAt heart, the exit games in our spec are very similar to the original Plasma Cash design. Exits are initiated with calls to the functionbeginExit(tokenType: uint256, blockNumber: uint256, untypedStart: uint256, untypedEnd: uint256) -> uint256:To dispute an exit, all challenges specify a particular coinID called into question, and a Plasma Cash-style challenge game is carried out on that particular coin. Just a single coin needs to be proven invalid to cancel the entire exit.Both exits and the two types of respondable challenges are given an exitID and challengeID which are assigned in order via an incrementing challengeNonce and exitNonce.Blocknumber-specified transactionsIn the original Plasma Cash spec, the exiter is required to specify both the exited transaction and its previous \u201cparent\u201d transaction to prevent the \u201cin-flight\u201d attack where the operator delays including a valid transaction and inserts an invalid one in the block between.This poses a problem for our range-based schemes, because a transaction may have multiple parents. For example, if Alice sends (0, 50] to Carol, and Bob sends (50, 100] to Carol, Carol can now send (0, 100] to Dave. But, if Dave wants to exit that, both the (0, 50] and (50, 100] are parents.Though specifying multiple parents is definitely doable, this specification would be gas-expensive and seemed more complex to implement. So, we opted for the simpler alternative, in which each transaction specifies the `block` its senders intend for it to go in and is invalidated if included in a different block. This solves the in-flight attack and means the contract does not need a transaction\u2019s parents. For those interested in a formal writeup and safety proof for this scheme, it\u2019s worth giving this great post a look.Per-coin transaction validityAn unintuitive property of our exit games worth noting up front is that a certain transaction might be \u201cvalid\u201d for some of the coins in its range, but not on others.For example, imagine that Alice sends (0, 100] to Bob, who in turn sends (50, 100] to Carol. Carol does not need to verify that Alice was the rightful owner of the full (0, 100]. Carol only needs an assurance that Alice owned (50, 100]\u200a\u2014\u200athe part of the custody chain which applies to her receipt. Though the transaction might in a sense be \u201cinvalid\u201d if Alice didn\u2019t own (0, 50], the smart contract does not care about that for the purposes of disputes around exits for the coins (50, 100]. So long as the received coins\u2019 ownership is verified, the rest of the transactions don\u2019t matter.This is a very important requirement to preserve the size of light client proofs. If Carol had to check the full (0, 100], she might also have to check an overlapping parent of (0, 10000], and then all of its parents, and so on. This \u201ccascading\u201d effect could massively increase the size of proofs if transactions were very interdependent.Note that this property also applies to atomic multisends which describe multiple ranges being swapped. If Alice trades 1 ETH for Bob\u2019s 1 DAI, it is Alice\u2019s responsibility to check that Bob owns the 1 Dai before signing. However, after, if Bob then sends the 1 ETH to Carol, Carol need not verify that Bob owned the 1 DAI, only that Alice owned the 1 ETH she sent to Bob. Alice incurred the risk, so Carol doesn\u2019t have to.From the standpoint of the smart contract, this property is a direct consequence of challenges always being submitted for a particular coinID within the exit.How the contract handles transaction checkingNote that, to be used in exit games at all, Transactions must pass the TransactionProof check described in the proofs section above(valid signatures, branch bounds, etc). This check is performed at the contract level in the functiondef checkTransactionProofAndGetTypedTransfer(   transactionEncoding: bytes[277],   transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],   transferIndex: int128 ) -> (   address, # transfer.to   address, # transfer.from   uint256, # transfer.start (typed)   uint256, # transfer.end (typed)   uint256 # transaction plasmaBlockNumber ):An important note here is the transferIndex argument. Remember, a transaction may contain multiple transfers, and must be included once in the tree for each transfer. However, since challenges refer to a specific coinID, only a single transfer will be relevant. So, challengers and responders gives a transferIndex\u200a\u2014\u200awhichever of the transfers relates to the coin being disputed. The check decodes and checks all the TransferProofs in the TransactionProof, and then checks inclusion for each with the functiondef checkTransferProofAndGetTypedBounds( leafHash: bytes32, blockNum: uint256, transferProof: bytes[1749]) -> (uint256, uint256): # typedimplicitstart, typedimplicitEndOnce all TransferProofs are verified, the dispute-relevant values for the transferIndexth Transfer are returned to the exit game functions: namely the sender, recipient, typedStart, typedEnd, and plasmaBlockNumber.With that out of the way, we can specify the full set of challenge/response games for exits.Challenges which immediately cancel\u00a0exitsTwo kinds of challenges immediately cancel exits: those on spent coins and those on exits before the deposit occurred.Spent coin challengeThis challenge is used to demonstrate that the exiter of a transaction already sent the coins to someone else.@publicdef challengeSpentCoin( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],):It uses checkTransactionProofAndGetTypedTransfer and then checks the following:The challenged coinID lies within the specified exit.The challenged coinID lies within the typedStart and typedEnd of the transferIndexth element of transaction.transfers.The plasmaBlockNumber of the challenge is greater than that of the exit.The transfer.sender is the exiter.The introduction of atomic swaps does mean one thing: the spent coin challenge period must be strictly less than others, because of an edge case in which the operator withholds an atomic swap between two or more parties. In this case, those parties must exit their pre-swapped coins, forcing the operator to make a a spent coin challenge and reveal whether the swap was included or not. BUT, if we allowed the operator to do that at the last minute, it would make for be a race condition where the parties have no time to use the reveal to cancel other exits. Thus, the timeout is made shorter (1/2) than the regular challenge window, eliminating \u201clast-minute response\u201d attacks.Before deposit challengeThis challenge is used to demonstrate that an exit comes from an earlier plasmaBlockNumber than that coin was actually deposited for.@publicdef challengeBeforeDeposit( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, depositUntypedEnd: uint256):The contract looks up self.deposits[self.exits[exitID].tokenType][depositUntypedEnd].precedingPlasmaBlockNumber and checks that it is later than the exit\u2019s block number. If so, it cancels.Optimistic exits and inclusion challengesOur contract allows an exit to occur without doing any inclusion checks at all in the optimistic case. To allow this, any exit may be challenged directly via@publicdef challengeInclusion(exitID: uint256):To which the exiter must directly respond with either the transaction or deposit they are exiting from.@publicdef respondTransactionInclusion( challengeID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],):...@publicdef respondDepositInclusion( challengeID: uint256, depositEnd: uint256):The second case allows users to get their money out if the operator censored all transactions after depositing.Both responses cancel the challenge if:The deposit or transaction was indeed at the exit\u2019s plasma block number.The depositer or recipient is indeed the exiter.The start and end of the exit were within the deposit or transfer\u2019s start and endInvalid History ChallengesThe most complex challenge-response game, for both vanilla Plasma Cash and this spec, is the case of history invalidity. This part of the protocol mitigates the attack in which the operator includes an forged \u201cinvalid\u201d transaction whose sender is not the previous recipient. The solution is called an invalid history challenge: because the rightful owner has not yet spent their coins, they attest to this and challenge: \u201coh yeah, that coin is yours? Well it was mine earlier, and you can\u2019t prove I ever spent it.\u201dBoth invalid history challenges and responses can be either deposits or transactions.ChallengingThere are two ways to challenge depending on the current rightful owner:@publicdef challengeInvalidHistoryWithTransaction( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749]):and@publicdef challengeInvalidHistoryWithDeposit( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, depositUntypedEnd: uint256):These both call a@privatedef challengeInvalidHistory( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, claimant: address, typedStart: uint256, typedEnd: uint256, blockNumber: uint256):function which does the legwork of checking that the coinID is within the challenged exit, and that the blockNumber is earlier than the exit.Responding to invalid history challengesOf course, the invalid history challenge may be a grief, where really the challenger did spend their coin, and the chain of custody is indeed valid. We must allow this response. There are two kinds.The first is to respond with a transaction showing the challenger\u2019s spend:@publicdef respondInvalidHistoryTransaction( challengeID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],):The smart contract then performs the following checks:The transferIndexth Transfer in the transactionEncoding covers the challenged coinID.The transferIndexth transfer.sender was indeed the claimant for that invalid history challenge.The transaction\u2019s plasma block number lies between the invalid history challenge and the exit.The other response is to show the challenge came before the coins were actually deposited\u200a\u2014\u200amaking the challenge invalid. This is similar to the challengeBeforeDeposit for exits themselves.@publicdef respondInvalidHistoryDeposit( challengeID: uint256, depositUntypedEnd: uint256):In this case, there is no check on the sender being the challenge recipient, since the challenge was invalid. So the contract must simply check:The deposit covers the challenged coinID.The deposit\u2019s plasma block number lies between the challenge and the exit.If so, the exit is cancelled.This concludes the complete exit game specification. With these building blocks, funds can be kept safe even in the case of a maximally malicious plasma chain.6. The\u00a0FuturePlasma Group is dedicated to the creation of an open plasma implementation for the greater Ethereum community. It\u2019s our mission to push layer 2 scaling forward by exploring the full potential of the plasma framework. There\u2019s certinaly much more to push forward! Here are some of the things we hope to work on next.Missing pieces in implementationAutomated GuardingWhile a good start, many improvements are needed to fulfill the true potential of Plasma, for this spec and beyond. Currently, the most glaring missing piece in our implementation is guarding, the automated process which submits challenges and responses on behalf of users. Thankfully, the exit games themselves are implemented and have been manually tested, so that client software can be updated after a chain is deployed. We felt this was sufficient for a testnet release, but is the most pressing addition the code needs.P2P History ProofsCurrently, when a user recieves a transaction, they ask the operator and re-download the full proof. This introduces a massive increase in operator overhead. What should really happen is that the sender directly transmits their locally stored proof to the recipient, bypassing the operator and making it much cheaper to run a plasma chain.Defragmentation StrategiesSince we support atomic swaps, our current spec is compatible with any defragmentation strategy without any upgrades to the contract. However, it remains to be seen what the right approach will be, especially since we require transactions to specify a Plasma block number. We hope the plasma community can build an extensible defragmentation abstraction library which allows operators and users to try out different approaches.Front-end wallet integrationWe have some designs for a front-end wallet, but currently the client only supports command-line transacting, with no support for trading different ERC20s. Having a nice UI to give to testnet users will be a major step up in terms of UX and accessibility.Operator feesBecause we support atomic multisends, we can support transaction fees without any protocol modifications. However, we\u2019ve not currently implemented anything for this testnet launch.Networked operatorSomething we\u2019re not taking advantage of yet is that merkle tree construction is highly parallelizable. If the operator was deployed as a networked cluster, we could increase block size by constructing subtrees in parallel.Raspberry plasma,\u00a0anyone?Code reviewIt\u2019s very likely that all of the client, contract, and operator implementations have critical bugs at this time. We\u2019re hoping that part of this public launch will be an opportunity for external contributors to help point out many mistakes!Missing pieces in the\u00a0specSuccinct Proof SchemesAs mentioned in the introduction, the most active area of Plasma research is a scheme to reduce the history proof size. P2P or not, an old (say, 1 year+) coin might have a significant amount of associated proof data, making transactions cumbersome. This is because the history proof contains, at minimum, one branch per block.RSA accumulator constructions and STARKS/SNARKS which batch branch proofs over many blocks are currently the most likely candidates. Both would require protocol changes: for RSA (which also introduces a trusted setup), an entirely new validity condition must be added to the exit game. For the latter, the tree needs to be constructed using a SNARK/STARK friendly hashing algorithm, which has not been implemented in EVM.Mass Exit/Deposit SchemesIf the operator does turn malicious, users must (eventually, no rush!) exit their funds. The concept of \u201cmass exits\u201d, in which many users consent to exiting together via a single on-chain transaction, would be a significant scalability increase. Ideally, the exit would be able to auto-deposit funds directly into a different plasma chain via a merkle root of balances. This would enable many users to switch chains, without individual balances ever being resolved on the main chain\u200a\u2014\u200aa significant improvement in the \u201cnetworkability\u201d of multiple plasma chains.Multi-operator networksThough the operator cannot steal funds, they can censor transactions at will. One mitigation to this would be to replace the single-operator model with a set of operators, so that the existence of just a single honest operator is sufficient for clients to transact.Improved exit recordsOur exitable range construction allows for constant-sized checks on exited ranges. However, since each finalization updates this mapping, we will have a race condition if exits on the same range aren\u2019t processed in ascending order. This is because the first exit\u2019s finalization splits the range, changing the key to the self.exitable mapping and causing checkRangeExitable to fail for exits referencing the unsplit range. Those exits will revert and have to be re-submitted in the next Ethereum block. A gas-efficient alternative may exist, possibly using some sort of tree, queue, or some batchFinalizeExits method.State channels and scriptingRecently, there\u2019s been some great progress in the research community which suggests state channels and scripting with covenants are feasible on Plasma. Our current spec does not support either of these features, and will require a significant upgrade to the smart contract to support.Together, we\u2019ll build towards realizing the vision of a more decentralized future.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Reserve Protocol: \u6697\u53f7\u8cc7\u7523\u62c5\u4fdd\u3068\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u578b\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3", "author_name": "Ryuya Nakamura", "link": "https://medium.com/layerx-jp/reserve-protocol-%E6%9A%97%E5%8F%B7%E8%B3%87%E7%94%A3%E6%8B%85%E4%BF%9D%E3%81%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B4%E3%83%AA%E3%82%BA%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E3%83%8F%E3%82%A4%E3%83%96%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E5%9E%8B%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B3%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3-1cddaf337d4f?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 19, 2018", "readtime": "15 min read", "upvotes": "366", "content": "Reserve Protocol: \u6697\u53f7\u8cc7\u7523\u62c5\u4fdd\u3068\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u578b\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3Ryuya NakamuraBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 19, 2018\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3001R&D\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4e2d\u6751(@veryNR)\u3067\u3059\u3002\u666e\u6bb5\u306f\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u691c\u8a3c\u95a2\u9023\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u958b\u767a\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3093\u3067\u304a\u308a\u3001FVyper\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3001OpenZeppelin\u306eVyper\u7248\u306e\u958b\u767a\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u691c\u8a3c\u3084\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u691c\u8a3c\u95a2\u9023\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059(\u6700\u8fd1\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u8ad6\u6587\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8)\u3002\u4eca\u56de\u306f\u606f\u629c\u304d\u306b\u3001\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u66f8\u3053\u3046\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u3070\u6700\u8fd1\u3001$133M\u3068\u3044\u3046\u591a\u984d\u306e\u8cc7\u91d1\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u3001\u6709\u540d\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305fBasis\u304c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u505c\u6b62\u3057\u305f\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u8a71\u984c\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u306f\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u5b9f\u73fe\u624b\u6cd5\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001Tether\u3084TrueUSD\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u767a\u884c\u984d\u3068\u540c\u3058\u3060\u3051\u306e\u6cd5\u5b9a\u901a\u8ca8\u3092\u62c5\u4fdd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3084\u3001MakerDAO\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u30aa\u30f3\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u8cc7\u7523\u3092\u62c5\u4fdd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3001\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305fBasis\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308b\u767a\u884c\u91cf\u8abf\u7bc0\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u7528\u3044\u308b\u3082\u306e\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u672c\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u307e\u305a\u3001Reserve Protocol\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3001MakerDAO\u3068Basis\u306e\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3001\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u8a18\u4e8b\u306e\u6700\u5f8c\u306b\u306fAppendix\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u65b9\u5f0f\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u3001Basis, Carbon, Reserve\u3068\u3044\u3046\u4e09\u3064\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u3082\u8f09\u305b\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u306e\u3067\u3001\u5fa9\u7fd2\u304c\u3066\u3089\u305d\u3061\u3089\u3092\u5148\u306b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3082\u3044\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\uff01", "responses": ""}, {"title": "The future Ethereum crisis nobody has heard of\u00a0yet", "author_name": "D.

JozsefBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 10, 2018I\u2019ve fallen back a lot on my Vyper series. There are actually more than one reasons, including mental health, life management, relationships, work, schoolwork\u2026 But really, the part that will be interesting to you, the readers who have been waiting for the type system article for a quarter of a year, is the part about Vyper itself, and about Ethereum.Let\u2019s start with the Ethereum part, which is exciting but bad news. I\u2019ll cover the Vyper part, which is good news, in the actual next installment of the tutorial, which is actually coming soon.The great gas crisis of\u00a0EthereumSo you might have heard of Gastoken. It has sent the Ethereum community into an uproar. While \u201ctokenizing gas\u201d sounds quite harmless at first, when you examine what it actually does, it will definitely start looking a lot more diabolical.The EVM has a relatively new feature that was meant to incentivize releasing unused Storage, and thus reduce the size of State. When you release Storage (by setting it to zero), you get some gas refunded. Enter gascoin. Gascoin is minted by spamming State with useless data, thus \u201cdeep freezing\u201d the gas paid for the operation\u200a\u2014\u200alater, by setting these fields back to zero, users can thaw the gas. Well\u2026 you can guess whether the gas refund feature has thus made State smaller\u2026 or bigger.So\u2026 Enter the Ethereum developer community, and a revolutionary proposal to deal with Gastoken once and for all: rent, aka pay-to-stay. In the indefinite future, all Ethereum contracts will require regular rent payments, and contracts that fall behind on their rent will be evicted from State.Now, to ensure that value isn\u2019t destroyed by eviction, interested parties will be able to resuscitate evicted contracts by paying a fee. Now the deep specifics of this is not entirely worked out yet as far as I understand, I\u2019m pretty sure that resuscitating a contract with megabytes in Storage (ie. any sufficiently popular ERC20 token) will cost a pretty penny.So\u2026 this pretty much means that current Ethereum development practice, based on central registry contracts, is dead. ERC20 is dead. ENS is dead. Cryptokitties are\u2026 actually no, Cryptokitties aren\u2019t dead.Corporate, privately owned central registries, with a clear offchain owner who gets a cut of the money flowing through their DApp can of course keep working, as the owner will be able to take some of their profits, and pay the rent from it. It\u2019s decentralized, unowned registries, you know the kind that Ethereum was built to create, that will have issues.A question raised on Ethresear.ch was, after I argued the point above, was what technical shortcomings central registries have, beyond the rent issue. Well, the rent issue is the issue. Or rather, it\u2019s similar to CO2 emission taxes\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s not emission taxes that make hydrocarbon fuels unsustainable, it\u2019s global warming. Emission taxes are only a measure attempting to limit the issue.Central registry contracts are unsustainable because they rely on free access to a very limited resource\u200a\u2014\u200aEthereum State size\u200a\u2014\u200athat is currently subsidized in an unsustainable way. Just leaving everything as it is is no longer an option. Not after Gascoin.You\u2019re in Limbo, you just don\u2019t know\u00a0itNow, while I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll come up with something to make sure the existing wealth that is tracked by Ethereum doesn\u2019t become unacessible, what this means is that any decentralized token, any truly decentralized contract that contains an address registry recording ownership, is pretty much a dead man walking.There IS a fix to save ERC20 (the interface, not the implementation), and in general the ability of Ethereum to do all the stuff we took for granted. Vitalik mentioned it in the Ethresear.ch thread linked above\u200a\u2014\u200aa stateless central contract, and independent child contracts for each individual owner. With a central provenance check mechanism, this actually is viable!Too bad you cannot use it yet. You see, for this to really, nicely, seamlessly work, we\u2019ll need CREATE2. An EVM opcode that will allow the creation of child contracts with a custom nonce, as opposed to the TxCount of the parent. Thus, the creation nonce could be derived from the owner\u2019s address, making for a star schema of contracts implementing a \u201cmapping\u201d. The central, stateless contract can still expose the ERC20 interface, and users can still use it as they expect it to work.And CREATE2 doesn\u2019t exist yet. Now you can still build tokens that use a similar multi-contract structure, only one that uses random child contract addresses, and results in a UTXO-like user experience\u2026 But this isn\u2019t all that pretty either, as the EVM currently offers no access to a contract\u2019s own TxCount (which means additional Storage writes for keeping track, and an additional point of failure). Also, provenance checking in a contract is less than comfortable at the moment (maybe I\u2019ll do a separate article on that). For those curious, this is how you do it in Solidity, to my best knowledge:function childAddress(uint256 _nonce) public view returns (address){  //if(_nonce == 0x00) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd6), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x80))); // no 0 nonce on contracts  if(_nonce <= 0x7f) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd6), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd7), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x81), uint8(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xffff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd8), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x82), uint16(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xffffff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd9), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x83), uint24(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xffffffff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xda), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x84), uint32(_nonce)));  revert(); // more than 2^32 nonces not realistic}So any contract you write with currently workable practices is unsustainable. Practices that would result in sustainable contracts are either unworkable or extremely uncomfortable (for the user too, not just for the developer). You\u2019re in limbo, you just didn\u2019t realize it yet.Well now you know.So what?I dunno. Lobby your local representative for the inclusion of CREATE2 in the next hardfork. It\u2019s pretty bad as it looks in my opinion, and people\u2019s total indifference in the face of impending doom is quite similar to how oil conglomerates treat global warming.We\u2019ll see. I think pay-to-stay, CREATE2, and a good, reliable and cheap way to do provenance checks will make Ethereum much better and more sustainable, and Ethereum contracts much prettier from an engineering standpoint. But that needs all of this implemented, and that doesn\u2019t change that none of this is implemented, and that doom is coming to Sarnath whether pay-to-stay becomes reality or not.ps. This is not an \u201cEthereum is dead, long live EOS / NEO / fuckcoin / whatever else\u201d shitpost. I\u2019m invested in Ethereum, both financially and personally.

The implementation follows Lendroid\u2019s whitepaper, and some component properties have been added or updated for practical purposes. The source code is available on Github.Driven by\u00a0designWriting smart contracts for crypto lending is as challenging as it is exciting. On the one hand, there are the functionalities that must be served by the contract. And on the other, the security of the smart contract. Then there is the third and arguably fundamental dimension of usability\u200a\u2014\u200ahow simple the contract is, how light, how economical when it comes to gas cost.Lendroid\u2019s design philosophy was informed by these challenges and can be explained in the following manner -Architect loosely-coupled smart contracts, where each contract is written to perform it\u2019s core functionality perfectly, and interaction of all the contracts resulted in realizing crypto lending. The functionality of each contract is limited to a maximum of two core functions, and cross-contract interaction is implemented via a registry contract.In effect, this design philosophy does three things -Makes the smart contract completely efficient in what it sets out to do.Keeps each of the smart contracts lightMakes cross-contract calls seamless and, more importantly, secure.Needless to say, each contract plays a very important role in the Lendroid Smart Contract ecosystem.Here are some instances -The Kernel contract is important in handling wholly and partially filled loan kernels.The SimpleWrangler contract validates a loan approval (signed from Wrangler server) to create a crypto loan.SimpleLoan contract is necessary to represent a loan position backed by the underlying collateral.Positions contract queries the ecosystem regarding lent and borrowed positions.The Lazarus contract was implemented to handle re-usable SimpleLoan contract for new loans.TokenTransferProxy contract is essential to facilitating token transfers across the contracts and protocol players.The Registry contract was central in storing and retrieving information about all contracts in the ecosystem. This is what makes cross-contract calls seamless.WorkflowHere\u2019s the broad workflow, with some additional detail to navigate unfamiliar components -Lendroid Protocol Smart Contract System design (Solidity)Kernel creation: A loan kernel / order is created, by either a lender or a borrower. If created by lender, it becomes a lend order. If a borrower creates the order, it\u2019s a borrow order. The kernel comprises the following components:lender: lender\u2019s ETH address if created by lender, else ZERO_ADDRESSborrower: borrower ETH address if created by borrower, else ZERO_ADDRESSloanTokenAddress: ETH address of token given as loancollateralTokenAddress: ETH address of token needed as collateralloanTokenAmountOffered: wei_value of loan token that would completely fill this kernel. Partial fills are possibleinterestRatePerDay: positive decimal valueloanDuration: seconds indicating how long a loan (created from wholly / partially filling this kernel) is validrelayerFee: Fee (in LST) paid to relayer for helping fill the corresponding kernelmonitoringFee\u00a0: Fee (LST) paid to wrangler to ensure the loan is not defaultedrolloverFee\u00a0: Fee (LST) paid to wrangler to roll the loan over / extend the loanclosureFee\u00a0: Fee (LST) paid to borrower to clean up the loan contract, so it can be re-used for another loan.Off-chain storage: The loan kernel is saved to a central server, which then broadcasts it to relayersRelayer: On the relayer UI, a filler fills the kernel and sends it to the wrangler as a loan requestWrangler: A protocol keeper that approves and monitors loans. If the wrangler rejects the loan, he sends an error message which is displayed on the relayer UI.Otherwise, the wrangler appends a nonce to the request, signs the request, and then sends an approval object comprisingSignature,Loan amount filled,Kernel (loan terms in it), andNonceThis approval is then displayed on the relayer UI for the filler to confirm. After confirmation, it is sent to the protocol smart contracts.It first enters Kernel.sol smart contract via the fill() functionLoan approvalKernel.sol.fill(): Takes as input the wrangler\u2019s approval and validates the kernel object (that the creator is in fact the one that created the kernel object). It then sends the approval to SimpleWrangler.solSimpleWrangler.sol.create(): Takes as input the wrangler\u2019s approval and validates his signature (i.e., the correctness of the nonce and the wrangler\u2019s signature). Upon correct validation, a loan contract is created as Loan.sol. Fees as described in the kernel are paid to the Relayer and the Wrangler. The collateral is transferred to the Loan.sol contract. The loan amount is transferred to the borrower.Loan closure: Borrower closes the Loan by repaying the loanAmountOwed to the Lender. The Borrower\u2019s collateral is transferred back to his ETH address.The Solidity Smart ContractsLow-level contractsThe following are the base contracts whose logic is not likely to change during the evolution of the Lendroid Protocol.Registry.solStores and retrieves addresses of the lower-level protocol contracts. It contains the following functions:setTokenTransferProxy()Sets the address of the TokenTransferProxy contractgetTokenTransferProxy()Returns the TokenTransferProxy contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.setPosition()Sets the address of the Position contractgetPosition()Returns the Position contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.setKernel()Sets the address of the Kernel contractgetKernel()Returns the Kernel contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.setLazarus()Sets the address of the Lazarus contract (which saves Loan contracts for reuse)getLazarus()Returns the Lazarus contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.TokenTransferProxy.solInspired from 0xProject, all token allowances and transfers to and from the protocol are handled by this contract. This contract transfers tokens on behalf of all the contracts. It comprises the following functions:transferFrom()Calls into ERC20 Token contract, invoking transferFrom.Position.solMaintains a list of all lend and borrow positions per address. It consists of the following functions:recordLoan()Record a position whenever a loan is created. Lend position in created for lender, and Borrow position for borrowergetLoanCounts()Returns the number of lend and borrow positions for a given addressKernel.solExclusive to Kernel-related functionality. Handles kernel-fills and kernel-cancels. It consists of the following functions:fill()This is the entry point of the Loan creation process. This function is called by the relayer once wrangler approves a loan request.cancel()Sometimes, the kernel creator would want to cancel an unfilled / partially filled loan kernel. This function also helps to cancel a loan kernel created by mistake. This is an on-chain call, even though the kernel creation happens off-chain.getFilledOrCancelledLoanAmount()Helper function to determine the loanAmount of loanToken left in a previously created loan kernel.computeOfferHashFromFillInputs()Internal function that returns the kernel hash computed from inputs sent to fill(). Called by only the fill() function. This function was necessary to due to the Stack Too Deep issue.computeOfferHash()Internal function that computes and returns the kernel hash from inputs that make up the kernel object. Called by computeOfferHashFromFillInputs() and cancel() functions.Lazarus.solSaves Loan contracts for reuse, once they have been closed. This technique helps to recycle used contracts so they do not stagnate the Ethereum blockchain forever. This contracts consists of the following functions:addChild()Add a contract as a child. It\u2019s important that the caller is the owner of the contract. After calling this function, the caller should transfer the ownership of the child to LazarusreleaseChild()Release the last child and transfer it\u2019s ownership to the caller. Returns an array of [true, child address] is successful.cleanLastChild()Remove the last child if it\u2019s owner is not Lazarus. This is useful to clean up maliciously added contracts (since the addChild is a public function which can be called by anyone!)High-level contractsThe following contracts are likely to evolve over different versions of the Lendroid Protocol.SimpleWrangler.solCreates, stores info about, and manages loans approved by the wrangler. It comprises of the following functions:create()This function is called by the Kernel.sol contract (specifically, from Kernel.fill()). This function takes as input the wrangler\u2019s approval and validates his signature (i.e., the correctness of the nonce and the wrangler\u2019s signature). Upon correct validation, either a new loan contract or an existing cleaned loan contract is reused, depending on whether a cleaned contract is available or not upon calling Lazarus.releaseChild() function. The Loan.init() method is then called to populate the contract with the loan terms. Fees as described in the kernel are then paid to the Relayer and the Wrangler. The collateral is transferred to the Loan.sol contract. The loan is transferred to the borrower.releaseContract()Transfer ownership of given loanAddress to Lazarus. This is called by the Borrower once a loan is closed. This function resets all parameters of the loan contract, and transfers its ownership to the Lazarus contract.SimpleLoan.solThe Loan contract containing loan terms between the lender and the borrower. All loan-related functions are performed by calling the following functions on this contract.init()Called by SimpleWrangler contract (specifically SimpleWrangler.create()). The loan terms are set as the contract parameters. Fees as described in the kernel are then paid to the Relayer and the Wrangler. The collateralAmount of the collateralToken is transferred to the Loancontract. The loanAmount of loanToken is transferred to the borrower.computeHash()Returns a hash of loan terms defined in the contract.transferCollateralToken()Internal function to transfer the collateral from the contract to the intended recipient. Used by close() and liquidate() functions.close()Borrower closes the Loan by repaying the loanAmountOwed to the Lender. The Borrower\u2019s collateral is transferred back to his ETH address.liquidate()Called by Wrangler if the borrower defaults his payments. In v1, we also allow lender to call this function if the loan expires and still has not been repaid.topUp()Borrower sends some more collateralToken to the Loan contract if the value of the collateral backing the loan decreases below the margin value due to market fluctuationclean()Called by SimpleWrangler contract (specifically SimpleWrangler.releaseContract()). This function resets all the parameters to their default values, and the contract\u2019s ownership is transferred to Lazarus. This makes the contract available for reuse. The borrower is then sent the closeFee in LST.renounceOwnership()This makes it impossible to transfer a Loan contract to a ZERO_ADDRESS, thus making it necessary to always have an owner.In conclusion\u00a0\u2026The information above was intended to provide a comprehensive overview of our design philosophy while architecting our smart contracts.

Programming languages are designed to be fast to run, or easy to learn, or quick to write, or for lots of other reasons. One language can\u2019t do all those things well, so language designers make trade-offs. They may make a language fast but hard to read, or concise but hard to maintain. These goals and trade-offs are well understood and haven\u2019t really changed for decades.Until now.Now Vyper has given up a bunch of features in the pursuit of a new goal: to make it hard to lie.Vyper is designed for smart contracts which are\u2026 well\u2026 weird. We all know normal contracts, they\u2019re legal documents that outline the terms of a relationship. They\u2019re written, interpreted and debated by lawyers, judges and the legal system. \u201cSmart\u201d contracts are contracts that are written as computer programs and executed automatically on a blockchain. Smart contracts are a really exciting development and could be the start of a brand new era. Imagine a world without lawyers where the terms of a contract are defined, enforced and run as code. There is no interpretation or debate, just pure abstract unbiased code.Source: https://medium.com/@fabiojose/build-a-smart-contract-to-sell-goods-6cf73609d25But here\u2019s the problem: What if a smart contract has a loophole in the code? Or a bug?Well\u2026 you lose all your money and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.Without lawyers and courts and judges there\u2019s no debate, no recourse. It doesn\u2019t matter what the program was intended to do, it only matters what the program actually does. The program runs, you lose your money. End of story. This isn\u2019t theoretical, it has already happened. Like the time someone found a bug in an Etherium smart contract and stole $55 million dollars and was nothing happened to them.What makes this problem really bad is that writing tricky, buggy and misleading code isn\u2019t hard. In fact it\u2019s easy. In fact it\u2019s so easy that inexperienced software developers do it by accident all the time. Writing tricky buggy code is the default. Professional software developers spend most of their lives desperately fighting to write code that\u2019s easy to understand.Sometimes just for laughs developers will write hard to read code on purpose. Here is a flight simulator written in a way that\u2019s almost impossible for a person to read, and shaped like a plane just for fun.It\u2019s a flight simulator written to look like a plane http://blog.aerojockey.com/post/iocccsimSo what happens when someone hands you a smart contract shaped like a plane? What if you read the code and are \u201cpretty sure\u201d it\u2019s a plane? How sure do you have to be? Remember, if you\u2019re wrong, or miss a subtle loophole, you lose all your money with no recourse.Will Vyper make sure that if the code looks like a plane, it is a plane? Can it solve this core issue in smart contracts?In the end, like everything in the wild weird world of crypto currencies, Vyper and smart contracts leave me with so many mind blowing questions. In 20 years, will lawyers be replaced by programmers for at least some things? If smart contracts replace normal contracts, will lawyers learn to code? Or will we hire specialist programmers to review smart contracts? Will programmer lawyers try to trick each other with loophole filled smart contracts? Or will smart contracts find a new niche and not replace normal contracts at all? Could Vyper be the first loophole proof programming language?Regardless of what the future holds, I just love it when weird new things happen in technology, and I can\u2019t wait to see what happens.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Generalized Governance", "author_name": "Kenny Peluso", "link": "https://medium.com/becoming-future/generalized-governance-4f804a2e81a2?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 1", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "Generalized GovernanceKenny PelusoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 1A framework for scalable, interoperable governance, coded in Vyper.by Kenny PelusoSource: http://worldartsme.com/images/types-of-government-clipart-1.jpgTo dive right into the code, checkout my repo, here.What is Generalized Governance?What\u2019s the difference between government and governance? Government is the tangible apparatus that legitimizes and executes laws. Governance is the means through which a government distributes its legitimization and execution across laws. Generalized governance (GG) is the set of rules all types of governance mechanisms follow. In other words, GG is all that can be abstracted from all forms of governance. In programming lingo, GG is a class, and things like democracy, republic, TCRs, etc. are instances of that class.Why do we want\u00a0GG?GG is useful for the same reason every Ethereum Request for Comment (e.g. ERC-20, ERC-721) is useful: Ease of interoperability is directly proportional with achieved network effects. When aspects of commonly used notions (e.g. what constitutes a token, what constitutes packets of information sent across the internet, what constitutes governance) are standardized and agreed upon, developers can concentrate on the core competencies of their products and thus augment the network\u2019s cumulative value (e.g. the nuances of TCP/IP minimally distract the front-end developer from providing their users with the best UX).What makes my GG so\u00a0special?Past GG designs have assumed tokenomics-based solutions to governance (e.g. this GG paradigm is tokenomics-specific and this other GG paradigm, by Level K, is again tokenomics-specific but opinionated to easily accommodate TCRs), but clearly there are many instances of governance that don\u2019t need any tokenomics (e.g. despotism, direct democracy, and systems that cannot be implemented with tokenomics). Therefore, past solutions do not fully encapsulate the set of all governance solutions and thus are not truly GG solutions.I have formulated an alternative interface that I now propose as a true GG solution. This solution allows for data type-agnostic decisions and captures the governance instances born from tokenomics as well as the traditional solutions pictured above. I have also made and tested a basic, exemplary implementation of said interface. In this post, I\u2019ll be diving deep into how my interface operates through examining my basic implementation.How does my GG\u00a0work?To explain how my GG works, I\u2019ll first list excerpts from the relevant code that can be referenced as the \u201clegal workflow\u201d is outlined. Then, I\u2019ll actually walk through said outline.Below are excerpts from interfaces/governance.vy, the interface for my GG:@publicaddPreferences(_dud: address, _type: uint256, _prefs: address) -> bool@publicaddIssue(_dud: address, _type: uint256) -> uint256@publicpropose(_dud: address, _type: uint256, _issue: uint256) -> uint256@publicdebate(_dud: address, _bill: uint256) -> uint256@publicvote(_dud: address, _debate: uint256, _votes: uint256, _ye: bool) -> uint256@publicresolve(_debate: uint256) -> bool@constant@publicnumIssues() -> uint256@constant@publicnumBills() -> uint256@constant@publicnumDebates() -> uint256These excerpts allude to the general workflow for \u201chow a bill becomes a law\u201d in my GG.Additionally, here is an excerpt from contracts/preferences_basic_address.vy, a necessary feature of the governance process:inDebate: public(bool)owner: public(address)delegation: public(address)opinions: map(uint256, address) # HERE@publicdef __init__(_owner: address):    self.owner = _owner@publicdef isInDebate(_status: bool) -> bool:    assert msg.sender == self.delegation    self.inDebate = _status    return _status@publicdef setDelegation(_gov: address) -> bool:    assert self.owner == msg.sender    assert not self.inDebate    self.delegation = _gov    return True@publicdef setOpinion(_issue: uint256, _opinion: address) -> bool: # HERE    assert self.owner == msg.sender    assert not self.inDebate    self.opinions[_issue] = _opinion    return True@public@constantdef getOpinion(_issue: uint256) -> address: # HERE    return self.opinions[_issue]In preferences contracts, user can input their opinion for various issues. Those opinions may become law. The excerpt above is taken from the preferences contract handling the address data type. Only 3 lines of code need to be altered to build preferences contracts listing opinions for different data types, and within those lines, only one word needs to be changed. The lines that need to be altered have been commented with # HERE in the excerpt above. If the governance system is to reach decisions regarding string[100] variables instead of address variables, then, within those 3 lines, simply replace address with string[100]. That\u2019s it. My repo provides examples of preferences contracts for uint256, string[100], address, and timedelta data types, so check it out if examples can explain this point better than I.With the necessary infrastructure in place, we can now dive into the \u201clegal workflow.\u201d The workflow that follows is how I thought about the GG process, but the governance interface, I think, accommodates a plethora of alternative and valid workflows. Those other workflows may not even include preferences contracts! That being said, here is my envisioned workflow:Future members deploy preferences contracts for every data type of decision.Future members set their preferences i.e. their opinions are recorded and setOpinion() is called.The GG contract is deployedMembers are \u201cadded\u201d i.e. Members must call setDelegation() to assign the GG contract as their preferences\u2019 delegation, addPreferences() is called to link their preferences with their address the GG contract, and some other operation may be invoked within GG (e.g. reputation points may be assigned to the member\u2019s address or some access token may be assigned to them).5. Members call propose() to propose that their opinion on an issue becomes law.6. Debates on proposed bills are initiated by calling debate().7. Votes follow via calling vote().8. A debate is resolved by calling resolve().9. The governing body\u2019s legitimization of an opinion is asserted; A bill becomes a law. The actual read operation of laws involves reading the approved bill\u2019s sponsor\u2019s preferences and then reading the sponsor\u2019s opinion.A locking operation can be applied to the preferences contract such that when one\u2019s opinion becomes law, then they cannot change their opinion on an issue. The basic implementation on my repo works differently in that it allows those whose opinions have been deemed as law to change their opinions and thus the law. This is akin to selecting \u201can expert\u201d per issue governed, where the governing body defaults to the expertise of a subset of members. I say \u201csubset\u201d because a preferences contract\u2019s opinions can easily be governed by another governing body of individuals, another GG contract, or even the same GG contract with opinionated functionality for whitelisted committees.ConclusionThe contract in my repo has a basic implementations of both the preferences and GG contracts.

JozsefBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 12, 2017Well, after some time spent coding Solidity, and designing off-chain supporting infrastructure for all the things we\u2019ve been coding in Solidity, I\u2019ve come to truly despise this ubiquitous little dialect.Note that this is the opposite of what usually happens.In my\u00a0.NET developer days, I was severely prejudiced against JavaScript, which, after a month or two spent with Node.js, I actually grew to love more than I ever liked C#. (Truth be told, my heart lies with ES6\u200a\u2014\u200aasync/await is a gift from heaven, truly, but still.)I saw Python as a useless kids\u2019 language, a contemporary heir to Commodore Basic and its ilk, until I started using Python\u2026 Which is when I really \u201cgot it\u201d, and learned to actually like its simplicity, its cute \u201cpythonic\u201d nature.Solidity however? Well, at first I thought it was great, I mean it\u2019s the language of Ethereum, and Ethereum is the definition of awesome, right? Well, add a few months, and I cannot express in words how much I loathe this language. What\u2019s with this type system?! Who on Earth ever thought that this was a good idea?Honestly, it\u2019s kinda like Japanese script. A square peg of immense proportions hammered into a round hole with great abandon, breaking peg and hole alike, and then the rough edges filed off, badly. (No offense to any Japanese readers, but seriously, your script system is the oldest and greatest example on Earth of technical debt running wild.)And sure, break Ethereum it did. Multiple times. Last time, in the fabulous \u201cI accidentally killed it\u201d incident. Also, in the process, what started out as a subset of Javascript syntax became something completely different, and not in a good way.At first I was so glad that Solidity has all these include and inheritance features. Seemed incredibly useful\u2026 However, I soon found that installing a program you\u2019d consider of moderate size in the off-chain world will easily exceed the block gas limit. So why do we need inheritance, again?After an initial and misguided period of actually using inheritance (and getting burned by human mistakes and compiler bugs alike), I have fallen back on an Interfaces + Code model. Interfaces are there to enforce public interfaces. Code is there to describe behavior. One contract, one code file. That\u2019s it.That makes Solidity slightly less unseemly, but does nothing to fix the deeply broken type system, which the real bogeyman is. So where can we turn? Fortunately, a newer, better, cleaner Ethereum contract language is in development, called Viper. Unlike Solidity, it\u2019s actually coming from the source (Vitalik), and is based on Python.Even though it\u2019s still in alpha, I found it incredibly likable at first sight. For one, there is no code reuse built into the language. No includes, no inheritance. That might sound bad at first, but not if you consider the specifics of the platform you\u2019re developing on. Also, the type system looks pretty simple and a lot better thought through than the one in Solidity.I intend to write a few posts about exploring this new language, and getting familiar with its quirks and gotchas.

JozsefBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 10, 2018Solidity became such a hit phenomenon specifically because it makes people believe they can code Ethereum. After all, a smart contract isn\u2019t that complex (it cannot be too complex, given the platform limitations)\u2026 but then, this is coupled with a language structure that is far from obvious (did you even know Solidity had pointers, and even worse, pointer arithmetic?), and a million plus one ways to mess up.Solidity is overly complicated, full of traps that lead to insecure code, or can be exploited to write intentionally insecure, backdoored code. It doesn\u2019t present idiomatic guidelines for code, it provides dozens of ways to solve the same simplistic task over and over, it does nothing to guide the developer\u2019s hand, or even make them aware of what they are in the process of doing.I\u2019m doing a series on Vyper, the new Ethereum language, which is a gigantic leap ahead compared to Solidity, but as a general-purposed language, I still think using it should be the exception, not the norm. 90% of smart contracts on Ethereum are either (1) tokens, or (2) value stores with various locking mechanisms. There is no reason whatsoever to re-implement these in generic languages over and over.The way this is done by others is using domain-specific languages. Chain, probably one of the most influential players in our space, has developed Ivy\u200a\u2014\u200aa domain-specific language for the exact two use cases mentioned above. Bitcoin is getting an Ivy compiler. So I wonder, if Bitcoin has one, why don\u2019t we have one?I was talking to a Hyperledger guy recently, and it felt like I was back in the 90s, talking to a mainframe guy who\u2019s only interested in \u201creal computers\u201d, none of these pissant PCs\u2026 Well, it turns out, his main problem with Ethereum was none other than Solidity. And I couldn\u2019t agree with him more. If I was doing systems design for a bank, would I consider Solidity as a language I want in our stack? Fuck no. Seriously. No.And what other options do you have if you\u2019re working on Ethereum? (And why wouldn\u2019t you want to work on Ethereum? Ethereum as an infrastructure is really well-built, and there\u2019s an immense amount of R&D going into it.) Well, it turns out, there aren\u2019t a lot of production-ready, well-maintained languages to begin with, but also we have a problem with ecosystem lock-in.I still remember the ubiquitiously hated little \u201cDesigned for Windows 95\u201d badge. It was on everything from games to floppy disk cases. Well, we now its equally hateful equivalent. Truffle? Designed for Solidity. Ganache? Designed for Solidity. Remix? Designed for fucking Solidity. Using any other language forces you to abandon the existing tooling, and go pedestrian. Sure, it\u2019s not a whole lot of tooling to begin with, and last time I checked, the debugger was completely useless, but it still pisses me off.Leave the EVM\u00a0alone!!!Seriously. It\u2019s not its fault. Ethereum was designed with simplicity in mind. The EVM is almost as simple as a textbook Turing machine. Actually, it\u2019s simpler. It\u2019s the bare minimum of what you can call a processor, real or virtual.So when new blockchain projects spring up trying to fix Solidity\u2019s issues by replacing the EVM, I can\u2019t help but feel a certain way. Would it be cool if EVM bytecode was more transparent to static analysis? Sure, but in an open source ecosystem it wouldn\u2019t be a killer feature, if\u2026the high level language the contract was written in was transparent to static analysis, andthe compiler was formally audited for correctness (ie. the semantics of the output matches the input.)The EVM and its simplicity and generality are a feature of Ethereum, not a bug. The bug is that people are using literally the world\u2019s crappiest, most amateurish language ever for coding security-critical applications on it.The power and limits of going domain-specificNow I\u2019m not saying that ditching multi-purpose languages is a goal. While I cannot see Solidity with anything but contempt, Vyper is quite cool, and for very specific tasks I see value in using LLL time to time. The weakness of Ethereum is also one of its strengths, a multi-purpose language allows for anything and everything to be developed. (Which is also why I argue for keeping the EVM itself.)Ivy, being domain-specific, by its nature constricts its uses to a specific domain (tokenized value and transactions with it). It\u2019s beautifully focused and fully declarative, built on verify, unlock and lock statements.It allows for the verification of credentials and business rules, the conditional unlocking of value based on these verifications, and the locking of value for the recipient. Instead of having to implement balance handling for the n+1th time, you can actually focus on what makes your stuff different.In Ethereum, the concept of Libraries tried to solve the issue of having to implement basic functionality again and again. It failed so spectacularly and catastrophically (due to no specific fault of the concept, but design faults of Solidity, and the horrid implementation of the Solidity Library pattern itself), that today it\u2019s barely ever used, and raises major flags with auditors and clients when it is.Domain specific languages, and declarative languages generally need an underlying infrastructure written in more general, and typically imperative languages. Prolog/CLP solvers tends to be written in C++. So Ivy, or other domain specific languages on Ethereum won\u2019t be the be-all-end-all of Ethereum programming.The infrastructure that will allow DApp developers to use these high-level and high-reliability tools will need some form of the Library concept. However, that underlyning infrastructure will need to be rock solid and secure\u2014 Parity multisig wallets have taught us at least this much.

In fact, it\u2019s not correct anywhere else, either (which is why it\u2019s wrong here). Check out the NetFlix Componentization Architecture instead to actually solve the problem of \u201cseparation of concerns\u201d, most of these patterns just introduce tight coupling across the wrong seams.CONSIDER THIS POST DEPRECATED. Personally, I am not applying any of these patterns.This might be the most controversial post I\u2019ve ever written up to this point.TL;DR and take-away: If you support offline data storage, then:- observe your data layer via either Room\u2019s LiveData support/SQLBrite/etc\u200a\u2014\u200awhat matters is that it can be observed for changes- if you do cache the data across config changes (ViewModel), then store the data in something that can be observed for changes (BehaviorSubject or LiveData). Refer to Google\u2019s \u201cGuide to App Architecture\u201d, the ideas in there are useful.Always make sure you persist presenter state via onSaveInstanceState(). Activity is a process entry point, not just \u201ca view\u201d.Also, I don\u2019t like Redux, and neither of its variants, at all. Really. There is a very long section dedicated to why I don\u2019t like Redux.Overall, I think if you want to use some presentation layer pattern, use MVVM instead for now, or come up with something better (that doesn\u2019t bind a screen to its abstraction). Until then, follow the Architecture Components guide. Check out the codelabs.Compared to Redux, the AAC MVVM is much cleaner, leaner, easier to wrap your head around, and has much less hidden cost involved, and doesn\u2019t make trivial everyday tasks difficult.\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 \u2014People love application architecture patterns.It\u2019s true! Otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have so many of them.Although even the term application architecture pattern in this case is a bit of a misnomer, considering that most of these patterns in the title apply only to presentation layer, and that\u2019s only one layer of the application.Sometimes (and honestly, me included) we build up samples that follow one of these patterns for the sake of following the pattern, look at it and say, \u201cmy, this is pretty!\u201dExtra negative points if the sample has no unit tests\u200a\u2014\u200aalso something I tend to be an offender of, myself.Maybe this is my personal assumption, but a lot of us are influenced by the description of a Clean Architecture with Strictly Enforced Separate Layers, as we\u2019ve read the article by Fernando Cejas on how to build such a layered application and what rules it must obey.In fact, we even read the next article that says we should implement each use-case as an RxJava observable transformer. Sure, why not? It makes sense.And once we have the abstract class UseCase in place, we could even send arguments to them with a Params object that is basically a Bundle!Okay, people actually generally didn\u2019t take that one to heart.Enough foreword, what\u2019s the goal\u00a0here?There\u2019s one very important thing to keep in mind regarding these presentation layer \u201carchitectures\u201d.They were created to enforce separation, in order to introduce indirection (create a new \u201cseam\u201d), so that UI behavior can become unit testable.If we flip that around, we don\u2019t actually need that indirection if we don\u2019t unit test the UI logic.\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 \u2014I can hear alarms going off already, so I\u2019ll take note that doing your best to adhere to SOLID principles\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially the Dependency Inversion Principle\u200a\u2014\u200ais typically a good idea.Naturally emerging patterns, such as providing dependencies to constructors, introducing DI if the object graph is sufficiently complex\u200a\u2014\u200aall of that is useful.\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 \u2014However, introduction of \u201cartificially\u201d emerging patterns might lead us to the wrong abstraction. Each architecture comes with a price, and it comes with even more cost if the architecture is done wrong. And let\u2019s not forget about possible hidden costs that are a result of hidden complexity and learning curves.By nature, the default \u201cgain\u201d of these patterns would be unit testability by levels of indirection. If we don\u2019t unit test, then we\u2019re building these to make things \u201cpretty\u201d. But what is the cost? What is the trade off? What is the problem we are aiming to solve by introducing indirection? What is the indirection we introduce in the first place?Overview of aforementioned popular\u00a0patternsMVC: Model View ControllerThe key points of MVC is:The user\u2019s interactions call methods on the ControllerThe Controller updates the Model (where the model is what actually stores state)The Model exposes change listeners to notify observers that it has changedThe View subscribes for changes emitted by the model to update itselfThe thing that people tend to call \u201cMVC\u201d or \u201cmassive view-controller\u201d has nothing to do with real MVC. No, the layout XML is not a \u201cView\u201d.The Model should have the ability to emit change events, and the View should be subscribed to it.I haven\u2019t seen many if any MVC samples for Android, except in this discussion. So I can\u2019t accurately judge it, as I haven\u2019t really seen it in action!\u00a0:)MVP: Model View PresenterThe key points of MVP is:The user\u2019s interactions call methods on the PresenterThe Presenter stores state, manages state, and calls methods on the view to notify it to update itselfThe Model is just dataThe View receives method calls from the presenter to be notified of changes to update itselfThe supposed benefit of MVP is that there is a well-defined contract between Presenter and View, and it can be verified that \u201cunder the right circumstances, the Presenter calls the right methods on the View\u201d.Some hidden costs:the Presenter is typically bound to a single View, so argument passing between Presenters and hierarchic relations of the Views themselves can introduce difficulty: maintaining the existence of and communication between child presenters and sibling presenters (if they exist) is tricky. This can be avoided if the Presenter is shared between Views of the same flow.The downside is that:the Presenter stores the state, so we must be able to persist/restore the presenter state when the process is re-created (which is typically Android-specific\u200a\u2014\u200aand sometimes ignored!)the View is updated via callbacks, which is more manual work than listening for changesif the Presenter can survive configuration changes, then it is possible for the View to be detached when Presenter receives asynchronous results, and there is a chance that method calls to the View can be dropped ( if(view\u00a0!= null) { anyone?)To eliminate the ability to drop events, we must be able to enqueue these events until the View resubscribes, deferring their execution. But if we\u2019re emitting events and listening to them, then it\u2019s not really a Presenter anymore, is it?\u00a0:)VIPER: View Interactor Presenter Entity\u00a0RoutingThis is actually just an additional twist on top of MVP, namely that they have a Router interface defined for handling navigation.iOS variant also had a \u201cWireframe\u201d, but that\u2019s essentially dependency injection.Any limitations that the Presenter had in MVP still applies.MVVM: Model View ViewModelThe key points of MVVM is:The user\u2019s interactions call methods on the ViewModelThe ViewModel stores state, manages state, and exposes change events when the state changesThe Model is the data mapped into the observable fields (or any other form of event emission)The View subscribes for change events exposed by the viewmodel to update itselfThe supposed benefit is that View can be \u201cdumb\u201d as all it does is display what\u2019s in the ViewModel, and then what is in the ViewModel can be verified to have \u201cthe right values under the right conditions\u201d.The downside is:All state must be moved to the ViewModel (and be somewhat \u201cduplicated\u201d, which is why ViewModel and View must be kept in sync\u200a\u2014\u200athis is what databinding frameworks help with)the ViewModel stores the state, so we must be able to persist/restore the ViewModel state when the process is re-created (which is typically Android-specific)Method calls to View are replaced with event emission, so some form of the Observer pattern needs to be implemented\u200a\u2014\u200atypically combination of PublishSubject/BehaviorSubject, but people try to hack LiveData to work like a PublishSubject and it doesn\u2019tIn this case, the learning curve is the possible overhead, and there aren\u2019t real inherent problems/limitations with the actual idea behind it (other than that it binds a ViewModel to a single view, similarly to MVP). Go MVVM!CLEAN: Clean ArchitectureThis is actually the odd-one-out on the list, as it\u2019s actually an architecture. Namely \u201cData-Domain-Presentation Layering\u201d (or Hexagonal Architecture). So you can have \u201cclean architecture\u201d while following MVVM in the presentation layer, for example.The key points of CLEAN Architecture is:Strict separation of \u201cdata retrieval\u201d, actual \u201cbusiness logic\u201d + application state management, and \u201cdisplaying state\u201dAll specific implementation used (f.ex. image loading, database access) are hidden under interfaces that don\u2019t leak implementation details: isolation of dependenciesThe supposed benefit is that you can plug out any module at any time and replace it with another one. Also, data/domain modules can theoretically be shared between different versions of the same app (think phone vs TV).Also, having layer-specific objects means the mapping between them can be tested.The downside is:If you don\u2019t need to share modules with multiple projects, enforcing the separation is overhead: as you need layer-specific objects and mapping inbetweenDid I mention the mapping between objects defined in 3 different layers? That\u2019s a lot of boilerplate code.Navigation should be a domain-layer responsibility, but it is a common problem that people abuse Activities and make navigation state implicitly part of the task stack. If we wanted to have complete control over our application state, we\u2019d have only 1 Activity that displays the current state. This is often ignored, leaving the \u201cclean\u201d implementation unclean.Hiding certain things under interfaces can be hard, often people still leak details, or their abstraction does not properly handle how their library of choice actually works (for example, SQLite vs Realm\u200a\u2014\u200asingleton global instance vs thread-local ref-counted instances).Personally, I advise keeping API responses and the database\u2019s objects separate. That\u2019s one mapping that\u2019s typically worth introducing: the server response shouldn\u2019t accidentally define what data we\u2019re trying to store, and in what format.The idea is good, but sometimes you just aren\u2019t gonna need it.But also be aware that sometimes you do.REDUX: well, just Redux, although it should be called ActionCreator-Action-Dispatcher-Middleware-Reducer-Store-Middleware-ViewRedux is one of the newest \u201carchitectures\u201d that came to light, a take on the original Flux pattern which had a Store per View (\u201ccomponent\u201d).Flux, in a nutshell:Actions: the object that encapsulates an action, basically the View emitting an event instead of calling a method on a presenter/viewmodelDispatcher: an event queue (where actions are placed), it is similar to the contract that allowed the View to call methods on the presenter/viewmodelStore: stores state and emits change events (basically the viewmodel), and also subscribes for actions in the dispatcherView: observes state changes emitted by the storeSo Flux was basically MVVM with event emission from the View to the ViewModel (now Store) via the Dispatcher (an event queue).\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014Redux \u201cimproves\u201d upon the original design by creating a single global singleton Store that stores the state for every single view that exists in the application, and the state of the application, including navigation state and everything else, currently loaded data, whether data is currently being loaded, or if you should show a loading indicator in some segment of the app. Everything in one big object.In Redux, this state is modified by Reducers that modify bits and pieces of the global app state\u200a\u2014\u200abut not in place: a new object is created with the changes applied. Generally, it has the signature of (State, Action) -> State, and can be modelled with the scan() operator.The supposed benefits are that:the State is immutable, and each change made to it creates a new State, so if we keep a history of Actions and States, we have a snapshot of everything in the app\u200a\u2014\u200aand if something goes wrong, we can \u201csee what goes wrong\u201d (time-travel debugging)each action emitted by the View is deferred to allow enqueueing them: the processing of each actions is forced to be serial execution (a necessary requirement to always have the latest state in the reducer, and to always provide the latest state for the subscribers of the store)it attempts to mimic certain functional programming aspects and other languages like Elm so it\u2019s probably greatConsidering most available samples involving Redux aren\u2019t more complex than a Todo application that has no network calls, no state persistence, and otherwise no asynchronous operations in general, it might be tempting to start using it\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially if you\u2019ve seen time-travel debugging (of Todo apps) in live action.But there are plenty of downsides, especially if attempting to use Redux in the context of Android:Common implementations of Redux bundle together application state and currently loaded data, making it impossible to save the application state to Bundle in onSaveInstanceState()\u00a0, which can result in cryptic bugs.Loading data both from local or remote data source is hard, because it must be implemented as a Middleware (as it is a \u201cside-effect\u201d, asynchronous operation) to ensure that action execution order is correct ~ and the explanation of middlewares is that \u201cyou get to curry the function so that you can for example add a logger that prints text\u201d.Any form of asynchronous action requires the introduction of magical elements such as redux-thunk, which introduces additional learning curve.Execution of one-off operations (like \u201cshowing a toast\u201d) is hard, because you only get to observe \u201ccurrent state\u201d, meaning an action must somehow emit a state for \u201cSTART_SHOWING_TOAST\u201d and \u201cSTOP_SHOWING_TOAST\u201d to have the effect akin to calling view.showToast(), or showToastEvent.call().The single Store contains all app state, therefore the resulting state can easily be a large tree with lots of data, where we must ensure that each view has its own unique ID so that they don\u2019t accidentally overwrite each other\u2019s states. Each view must know how to access the sub-state intended just for them.We must also ensure that each element in the State is immutable, including lists/collections (Kotlin helps).Creating a new immutable copy of the state is only useful if you actually retain the previous values as \u201chistory\u201d, otherwise mutation in place + notifying observers is a much simpler (and less costly) mechanism.So Redux disadvantages on Android in short:all actions are serialized, and inevitably delayed by waiting for middlewares to execute asynchronous operations\u200a\u2014\u200acreating laggy UXdespite trying to make state management easier, it just makes state management more difficultit makes asynchronous operations and simple one-off operations much harderif that is not yet evident, SUPER HIGH LEARNING CURVE if you want to make ANYTHING more complex than a simple Todo appbundling together data and transient state in a single \u201cimmutable object\u201d makes proper Android state persistence very hard or impossibleOverall, what Redux tries to do is abstract away method calls from the View to the Presenter/ViewModel, by creating an object that is passed onto a queue (like Flux)\u200a\u2014\u200areplace method calls with event emission.Then merge all Presenters together to store their state in one place, and create copies of the state each time it is changed in any way.The supposed benefit of course would be the easy testability of the Reducer. But you generally require some form of framework to get a reliable \u201cimmutable event loop\u201d for your state.If you ask me, there is so much \u201cto draw of the rest of the fucking owl\u201d, that I\u2019d argue that Redux is not production ready out of the box, and takes a lot of punching to get into a shape that can properly model real-world requirements.MVI: Model-View-IntentMVI is pretty much the same thing as Flux (multiple stores, view emits actions), with some aspects of Redux (immutable state copies and state reducers), implemented on top of RxJava.The key points:Intentions: same as Actions in Flux\u200a\u2014\u200aevent emission from the View. The \u201cdispatcher\u201d is the Observable that results from merging the actions together into a single stream.Model: the view state that is immutable and copied each time it is changedReducers: same as in Redux\u200a\u2014\u200aevaluates the new value of the current State based on the current method callDownside:Every method call is replaced with a sealed data class and event streams modelled by Observables, so every action is implemented via RxJava operators. This can result in high learning curve and hard to reason about.Of course, we also still have the disadvantage mentioned along with Redux:Common implementations bundle data and state together, making persistence to Bundle difficult/impossible.If we read the page regarding MVI, we see the following:FROM THE ARTICLE \u201cREACTIVE APPS WITH MODEL-VIEW-INTENT\u200a\u2014\u200aPART1\u200a\u2014\u200aMODEL\u201d:However, I personally think that most of the time it is better to not save the state but rather reload the whole screen just like we are doing on first app start. Think of a NewsReader app displaying a list of news articles. When our app is killed and we save the state and 6 hours later the user reopens our app and the state is restored, our app may display outdated content. Maybe not storing the Model / State and simply reloading the data is better in this scenario.Which is crazy, because I can induce a process death for whatever app I have open just by opening Skype and/or the Camera, and I\u2019m sure that starting up the camera takes less time than 6 hours\u200a\u2014\u200aand I have a Nexus 5X with 2.5 GB RAM.Ignoring the Activity contract is a suboptimal solution, especially if we are trying to improve maintainability and reliability, instead of just introducing bugs and user frustration.If you see a ViewState class and it doesn\u2019t have @Parcelize annotation on it, then it\u2019s probably not a production-ready implementation.Always test your application against process death to know what happens in case of low memory condition.For more information on this architecture, check out the comment chain below.PRNSAASPFRUICC: Production-Ready Native Single-Atom-State Purely Functional Reactive Composable UI ComponentsHonestly I just added this to the list for the shock value of the abbreviation.But you can check out the original proposition and the accompanying library: cyklic (fairly unmaintained), it\u2019s also yet another take on emitting events from the view, running them through a reducer (this time called a \u201cDriver\u201d) and it has a start/stop method. Overall, it is MVI-ish.Honorable mention: RIBs (Router Interactor Builder)While I have not used RIBs, supposedly Uber has solved the problem of automatic constructor and tear-down of deep scope hierarchies, and provide proper events (via RxJava) to let you know when that happens.This is mentioned as a presentation layer architecture pattern because they make it possible that the scope hierarchy contains the state, while views are just a display of the current state.To make this happen, they use a single-activity architecture, so that the scope tree provides the navigation information for \u201cwhat view should be showing\u201d as well. With that, they actually solve \u201cthe current view determines the current Presenter/ViewModel instead of the other way around\u201d problem.Honorable mention: Reactive WorkflowsThere used to be no open-source example of Reactive Workflows, but it is what Square swapped out their original Mortar-like ViewPresenters of MVP with.I\u2019ve since then been informed that someone named Blake Oliveira has attempted to re-create a part of this architecture in this repository.The gist of it is that one \u201cworkflow\u201d can be shared across multiple screens, and the \u201cworkflow\u201d contains a state machine to describe the current state (somewhat reducer-y in this regard).Most importantly, the Workflow defines a contract for what Events it can emit, and the view subscribes to them.And workflows can be chained together, but I\u2019m not sure about that part\u00a0:)To make the workflows manage the application state independently of the presentation layer, they use a single-activity architecture.The current recommendation: Google\u2019s Android Architecture Components\u200a\u2014\u200aLiveData (and ViewModel)Google came out with Architecture Components for Android, right? They have documentation on how to use it, and even samples that show how to use it in real life and even write tests for it.The final architecture provided by Architecture Components (from\u00a0here)It handles edge cases better than MVP, and it takes less magic than MVI, and it\u2019s definitely more production-ready (and less confusing!) than Redux.And this all makes it easier to follow the official Android guide on \u201csaving state\u201d, instead of taking shortcuts like implementors of MVP/MVI/Redux\u200a\u2014\u200aand riddling our app with unpredictable behavior and frustrating bugs for the end user.Always test against process death. Forgetting user input is a bug. After all, the Activity is not just a view.ConclusionThat might have been a long article, and a lot to take in (it also took long to write!), but overall, I\u2019d say that for now, AAC is the clear winner\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is an Android-specific variant of MVVM.As long as we use LiveData for emitting data, and PublishSubject for one-off events, things should work as expected (except in fragments: always remove observers in onDestroyView() in Fragments).AAC solves certain common problems that can arise when writing an Android application. However, while doing so, it aims to reduce the complexity of the solution, rather than add additional layers of complexity on it (like Redux and \u201ccurrying with middlewares\u201d just to call a log statement, and so on).Therefore, until Flow Coordinators or Reactive Workflows pop up in every-day use, I\u2019d say for now, MVVM is the clear winner, and AAC helps with that quite elegantly.

Image Source: Screenshot taken from the movie \u201cThe Matrix Revolutions\u201dDesign patterns are God\u2019s gift to software developers. These are techniques that minimize code duplication, prevents high coupling and standardize a common way of writing code that provides a general solution for recurring situation while developing a software. In this story we will get familiar with a design pattern called VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity and Router.) for iOS development.Prerequisites: Before starting about VIPER, please make sure you know about architectural design pattern and delegation pattern.What is Viper\u00a0?Viper is a design pattern that implements \u2018separation of concern\u2019 paradigm. Mostly like MVP or MVC it follows a modular approach. One feature, one module. For each module VIPER has five (sometimes four) different classes with distinct roles. No class go beyond its sole purpose. These classes are following.View: Class that has all the code to show the app interface to the user and get their responses. Upon receiving a response View alerts the Presenter.Presenter: Nucleus of a module. It gets user response from the View and work accordingly. Only class to communicate with all the other components. Calls the router for wire-framing, Interactor to fetch data (network calls or local data calls), view to update the UI.Interactor: Has the business logics of an app. Primarily make API calls to fetch data from a source. Responsible for making data calls but not necessarily from itself.Router: Does the wire-framing. Listens from the presenter about which screen to present and executes that.Entity: Contains plain model classes used by the interactor.Below shows a simple diagram of VIPERViper ArchitectureViper with\u00a0ExampleI have created a simple project to explain viper. It can be found on GitHub. It is a very basic application which shows a news headline fetched from an external API. (how useless\u00a0:p).Viper is a delegation driven architecture. So, most of the communication between different layers executes through delegation. One layer calls another through a protocol. Calling layer calls a function from a protocol. Listening layer conforms to that protocol and implements the function.Below I will explain how I have implemented VIPER in one of my sample projects. I suggest you to open the project in github and go through it while reading the explanation.ProtocolsI have created a separate file for all the protocols.A naming convention is followed to name a protocol. E.g, \u2018viewToPresenterProtocol\u2019. So, it is a \u2018protocol\u2019 which will be implemented by \u2018the presenter\u2019 to listen what the \u2018view\u2019 has to say.PresenterToViewProtocol\u00a0: Presenter calls, View listens. Presenter receives a reference from this protocol to access View. View conforms to the protocol.ViewToPresenterProtocol\u00a0: View calls, Presenter listens.InteractorToPresenterProtocol\u00a0: Interactor calls, Presenter listens.PresentorToInterectorProtocol\u00a0: Presenter calls, Interactor listens.PresenterToRouterProtocol\u00a0: Presenter calls, Router listens.App FlowView has a reference of \u2018 ViewToPresenterProtocol\u2019 to access the \u2018Presenter\u2019 and conforms to \u2018 PresenterToViewProtocol\u2019. In it\u2019s viewDidLoad() it calls the function updateView() of the protocol.//Viewvar presenter: ViewToPresenterProtocol?override func viewDidLoad() {           super.viewDidLoad()           presenter?.updateView()           }Presenter on the other hand conforms to \u2018 ViewToPresenterProtocol\u2019. So, it implements the function updateView().//Presentervar interector: PresentorToInterectorProtocol?;func updateView() {   interector?.fetchLiveNews()    }Inside updateView() presenter tells the interactor to fetch some live news data.Interactor conforms to \u2018PresentorToInterectorProtocol\u2019\u00a0. So it implements fetchLiveNews() function. This function tries to make a network call and fetch data. It has a reference from \u2018InterectorToPresenterProtocol\u2019 to access the \u2018Presenter\u2019.//Interactorvar presenter: InterectorToPresenterProtocol?If the network call successfully have fetched the data it calls the following function.//Interactorself.presenter?.liveNewsFetched(news: (arrayObject?[0])!)if not//Interactorself.presenter?.liveNewsFetchedFailed()Now presenter also conforms to \u2018 InterectorToPresenterProtocol\u2019. So it implements these functions.//presenterfunc liveNewsFetched(news: LiveNewsModel) {        view?.showNews(news: news);    }        func liveNewsFetchedFailed(){        view?.showError()    }So it tells the view whether to show news or to show the error.Now, View conforms to \u2018 PresenterToViewProtocol\u2019. Thus it implements showNews() and showError(). In these two functions view populates the view with the fetched data or the error.The Entity\u00a0LayerAbove in the app flow section entity layer is not discussed. It does not directly connected with the app flow. But it is an integral part for the interactor. Entity layer provides a model which interactor use to create objects from the fetched data.RouterRouter takes care the wire framing of an application. Changing screen in an application is a very basic thing. In VIPER, Router layer is responsible for executing that.We have discussed earlier that in VIPER architecture every single functionality has a single module and a module contains those five layers. A presenter calls the router to create a new module. Then router first initiate all the layer class and returns the module.In my sample project there is no in-app module changing. But routing does happen when the app first time launches. So inside AppDelegate\u2019s \u2018didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()\u2019, router\u2019s createModule() function is called. It returns a module. UIWindow class then show the view of that module.Why and When to use\u00a0VIPERVIPER follows a very clean architecture. It isolates each module from others. So changing or fixing bugs are very easy as you only have to update a specific module. Also for having modular approach VIPER creates a very good environment for unit testing. As each module is independent from others, it maintains low coupling very well. So, dividing work among co-developers are pretty simple.VIPER should be used when an application\u2019s requirements are very well formed. Working with constantly changing requirements may create confusion and messed up codes. So, it should not be used in small project as MVP or MVC will suffice. Also, VIPER should be used if all the developer of the project fully understands the pattern.VIPER ToolsIf one wants to use VIPER in a project, the smartest thing would be to use an automatic module structure generator. Otherwise creating files for modules will be monotonous. There are few generators available online.GenerambaVIPER CodeVIPER GenConclusionJust like any other design pattern VIPER is self-explanatory. One needs to get one\u2019s hands dirty to understand the whole picture. My advice will be to first start with creating a very basic app with VIPER and in the process read online resource. My github repo could also be a good reference.Happy coding\u00a0:)Long live sacred Bangladesh.Bangladesh is a world of metaphor, of high and low theater, of great poetry and music.

In essence, with clean architecture, you abstract your code into four layers: entities (models), use cases (business logic), controllers/gateways/presenters (handles UI logic), devices/UI/Web/DB/External interfaces (frameworks that could change).VIPER stands\u00a0for:V\u200a\u2014\u200aView (displays info to the user and detects user interaction)I\u200a\u2014\u200aInteractor (manipulates the entities/models by fetching data and storing data)P\u200a\u2014\u200aPresenter (without use of the UIKit, it contains the UI related business logic and prepares the data for presentation)E\u200a\u2014\u200aEntity (your model objects)R\u200a\u2014\u200aRouter (aka wireframe, takes care of navigation in your module/application).VIPER architecture allows for a clearer separation of concerns and separates the viewController from handling most of the responsibility in an app. Concerns are separated into modules for each use case (i.e. provide a map for the user). Each module has a clear layer of routing logic, presentation logic and business logic.The View (the View Controller):The view/view controller\u2019s main purpose is to display info to the user and detect user interaction. The view/view controller intercepts user events and has ONE POINT OF CONTACT within the VIPER design pattern: the presenter. The view/view controller owns and sends user actions to the presenter. For example, a view/view controller will let a presenter know when it has started loading itself and when a user has tapped on a button.The Presenter:The presenter receives user action information from the view/view controller and is responsible for the UI related (but not UIKit!) business logic data. The presenter prepares the data for presentation. The presenter has THREE POINTS OF CONTACT: the view/view controller, the interactor, and the router. The presenter owns the responsibility of fetching data from the interactor and preparing that data for presentation and passing it back to the view/view controller (so that it can be updated), of creating objects to be handed off to the router and determining if it needs more data from the interactor. I like to think of the presenter as the \u201cmediator\u201d.The Interactor:The interactor has knowledge of our models, or entities, and fetches and stores data from a manager class (i.e. DataStore.swift). The presenter calls on the interactor for updated data and the interactor, in turn, provides it back. The interactor manipulates data (i.e. validates if a Map location has a valid name) and can call on a helper/manager class (LocationStore.swift) to create entities.The Entity/Entities:The entities are our data models (i.e. MapName, MapCoordinate, MapLocation). These entities are manipulated by the interactor. The interactor has full knowledge of the entities and their properties.The Router/The Wireframe:The router has ONE POINT OF CONTACT: the presenter. The router (aka the wireframe) owns a window and takes care of the navigation in a module. It creates the view controller and wires the presenter to serve as the output for the interactor and for the view controller to be the interface for the presenter. The presenter may know where to go, but the router knows how to get there.Resources:Architecting iOS Apps with VIPER\u200a\u2014\u200aObjC", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "Building Todo List iOS App with VIPER Architecture", "author_name": "Alfian Losari", "link": "https://medium.com/swift2go/building-todo-list-ios-app-with-viper-architecture-bc954ea371bb?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 7, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "63", "content": "Building Todo List iOS App with VIPER ArchitectureAlfian LosariBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 7, 2018Todo List iOS App With VIPER ArchitectureIntroductionDeciding which application architecture to use when building an iOS application is one of the most challenging task, there are many architectures to choose from MVC, MVVM, MVP, View State, VIPER and many more. The architecture we choose will shape on how the software will be built and scale as it grows.One of the architecture this article will approach is the VIPER architecture. VIPER divides the app structure into components inside a module/screen with single responsibility principle. This makes the application becomes more modular and less coupled with other component. Unit testing and Integration test becomes much more simpler because of the boundaries (protocol/interface) between each components.VIPER basic components are separated into 5 parts:View: Shows the user interface told by the presenter, it also communicates back the user input to presenter.Interactor: Process the business logic of the application, it communicates back and forth with the presenterPresenter: Fetch the data from the interactor and handle the logic of how the data will be displayed in view. It also relay the user input from the view and fetch/update the data from interactor.Entity: The model object that used by interactor. Usually the interactor fetch the entity from a separate data store object.Routing/Wireframe: Handle the navigation logic asked by the presenter object. It communicates with other module/screen to be shown.Building Our Todo List App with\u00a0VIPERIn this article we will build a simple TodoList app using VIPER as our application architecture. The project GitHub repository is available here. What we will build:TodoItem Entity and TodoStore: TodoItem is a basic Class object that represent a Todo item, TodoStore is our DataStore that store an array of TodoItem.TodoList Module/Screen: Display list of TodoItem in a UITableView to users and provide the features for user to add new TodoItem, delete TodoItem, and navigate to the TodoDetail Module/Screen.TodoDetail Module/Screen: Display the content of a TodoItem, provide the features for user to delete and edit the TodoItem. It navigates back to the TodoList Module/Screen.App Delegate Integration: Setup the root UIViewController of the application by instantiating TodoListView from TodoListRouterApplication Flow and Project Structure DiagramBuilding Data\u00a0EntityTodoItem EntityTodoItem Entity is just a plain class that represent a TodoItem object. It provides 2 properties, title String and content String.TodoItem EntityTodoStore DataStoreTodoStore is the DataStore Singleton object that stores the list of TodoItem. Our application just stores the array in-memory, but we can extend to store the data in a File or CoreData in the future. It exposed the TodoItem array via todos property and methods to add TodoItem and remove TodoItem.TodoStoreBuilding TodoListModule/ScreenTodoListModule ProtocolsWe use protocol for each component to define the boundaries of how each components will communicate in TodoList Module.TodoListModule ProtocolsImplement TodoListViewProtocolWe create a TodoListViewController object that subclass UITableViewController and implement the TodoListViewProtocol. TodoListViewController responsibility is to display the user interface as told by the presenter. It keeps a reference to the presenter to relay user input and view lifecycle event to the presenter to react.When the view will appear it will invoke the presenter viewWillAppear method so the presenter can retrieve the data from the interactor. The navigation add bar button item triggers an action that will display the UIAlertActionController with 2 textfields for the user to enter the title and content of the TodoItem. It then relay the user input back to the presenter. When user swipes the UITableViewCell and delete the row, the view redirects the user input to delete the associated ToDoItem back to presenter.TodoListViewProtocol provide 2 method to implement, showTodos that pass array of ToDoItem that will be used to display list of TodoItem inside the UITableView. The showErrorMessage pass an error message in case of an error occurs from the presenter, the UIAlertController will be displayed containing the error message to the user.TodoList ViewImplement TodoListPresenterProtocolThe TodoListPresenter Class implements the TodoListPresenterProtocol and TodoListInteractorOutputProtocol. It stores weak reference to the TodoListViewProtocol so it can update the UI. It stores reference to the TodoListInteractorInputProtocol so the presenter can relay the user input to fetch or modify data through the interactor. It also stores the TodoListRouterProtocol object so it can navigate to the TodoDetailModule when user select a TodoItem from the table view.By implementing TodoPresenterProtocol, the view will call the presenter viewWillAppear when view will appear in screeen. The presenter then ask yhe interactor to retrieve the TodoItem array. The implementation of TodoListInteractorOutputProtocol will be used by the interactor to return the TodoItem array by invoking didRetrieveTodos passing the data, the presenter then update the view by invoking view showTodos passing the data to update the Table View.The presenter also implements didAddTodo and didRemoveToDo so when user add a new TodoItem or delete a TodoItem from the view, the presenter can relay the user action to the interactor respective saveTodo and deleteTodo method. The interactor will invoke didAddTodo and didRemoveTodo back to the presenter so the presenter can update the Table View.TodoList PresenterImplement TodoListInteractorProtocolThe TodoListInteractor implements the TodoListInteractorInputProtocol. It stores reference to the presenter object that impeements the TodoListInteractorOutputProtocol. It also has the TodoStore object assigned as the property to fetch the TodoItem list, add TodoItem, removeTodoItem from the TodoStore.The TodoListPresenterProtocol invoke the action to retrieve TodoItem List, save TodoItem, delete TodoItem, the interactor then ask the TodoStore for each respective action then invoke the output method back to the presenter.TodoList InteractorImplement TodoListRouterProtocolThe TodoListRouter exposes static function that can be invoke to instantiate the TodoListModule, instantiate the concrete implementation of TodoListProtocols component, assigning the reference for each component, and then return the UIViewController to display.It also provide the presentTodoDetailScreen that will be invoked by the TodoListPresenter when user select a TodoItem from TableView. This method instantiate TodoDetailModule passing the TodoItem from the TodoDetailRouter static method and navigate to the TodoDetailViewController by pushing the UIViewController through the UINavigationController stack.TodoList RouterBuilding TodoDetailModule/ScreenTodoDetailModule ProtocolsJust like TodoListModule, protocol defines the boundaries of how each components will communicate in TodoDetail Module.TodoDetailModule ProtocolsImplement TodoDetailViewProtocolThe TodoDetailViewController is an UIViewController subclass that implements the TodoDetailViewProtocol. When the View is loaded, it invoke the TodoDetailPresenter viewDidLoad method for the presenter to ask the interactor to fetch the ToDoItem to display in the UI.The showTodoItem will be invoked by the presenter passing the TodoItem for the View to display the TodoItem title and content using UILabels. The view also relay the user action to edit and delete when the button is pressed to the deleteTodo method of the presenter. For the edit action, the UIAlertController containing the TextField filled with current TodoItem title and content will be displayed for the user to modify. When they confirm, the view relay back the user input from text fields back to the presenter passing the new value of the title and content.TodoDetail ViewImplement TodoDetailPresenterProtocolThe TodoDetailPresenter implements the TodoDetailPresenterProtocol and TodoDetailInteractorOutputProtocol. When the view is loaded the presenter asks the interactor for the TodoItem, and then asks the view to display the TodoItem by invoking showTodo.It also handle the relay of user action from the view for editing and deleting the TodoItem to the interactor. The implementation of TodoDetailInteractorOutputProtocol handles the result after the interactor successfully edit the item to update the view based on the new value, for the delete it invokes the TodoDetailRouterProtocol to navigate back to the TodoListView because the TodoItem has been deleted.TodoDetail PresenterImplement TodoDetailInteractorProtocolThe TodoDetailInteractor implements the TodoDetailInteractorInputProtocol, it also has reference to the TodoStore and TodoItem object. The presenter can retrieve the TodoItem from the interactor by accessing the property. It also provide methods to delete TodoItem and edit TodoItem. The delete action will invoke the TodoStore removeTodo passing the TodoItem so the TodoItem can be deleted from the TodoStore.TodoDetail InteractorImplement TodoDetailRouterProtocolThe TodoDetailRouter implements the TodoDetailRouterProtocol. It provides static method to instantiate the TodoDetailModule, setup all the components and associate them, then returns the UIViewController to display. It also exposes navigateBackToListViewController that will be invoked when user delete a TodoItem from TodoDetail Screen for navigation back after the TodoItem is deleted.TodoDetail RouterAppDelegate Setup And IntegrationThe AppDelegate setup is quite simple and direct, inside the applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions we instantiate the TodoListViewController by invoking the TodoListRouter.createTodoListModule that setups TodoListModule components. We then instantiate the UIWindow and assign the ViewController as the rootViewController of the window as our initial screen.App DelegateConclusionBuilding an iOS Application with VIPER provides clean architecture paradigm by dividing the responsibilities of each app layer into separate component that makes our application becomes modular between the view logic and business logic, also it is an advantage in large scale application to be able to make our component modular so we can add more features more easily.One of the main disadvantage of VIPER is that there is too many boilerplate code we need to write for each components protocols, which is an overkill in small application. At last, the decision whether to use VIPER or not in our project will depend on our project scale, how familiar our team on using it, and our app specific use cases.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "\u301d\u53ef\u6015\u7684\u7f8e\u9e97\u301e\u5f71\u7247\u7701\u601d\u200a\u2014\u200aLeanie van der\u00a0Vyver", "author_name": "KAIAK WEN", "link": "https://kaiakwen.com/%E5%8F%AF%E6%80%95%E7%9A%84%E7%BE%8E%E9%BA%97-%E5%BD%B1%E7%89%87%E7%9C%81%E6%80%9D-leanie-van-der-vyver-ce68b71f10e?source=search_post", "post_date": "Aug 27, 2012", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "\u301d\u53ef\u6015\u7684\u7f8e\u9e97\u301e\u5f71\u7247\u7701\u601d\u200a\u2014\u200aLeanie van der\u00a0VyverKAIAK WENBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 27, 2012\u4eba\u985e\u559c\u6b61\u626e\u6f14\u4e0a\u5e1d\uff0c\u4ee5\u7269\u7406\u8207\u96b1\u55bb\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8b93\u81ea\u5df1\u66f4\u5b8c\u7f8e\u3002\u7f8e\u9e97\u662f\u8a31\u591a\u4eba\u6240\u8ffd\u6c42\u7684\u4e00\u5207\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9019\u500b\u5c08\u984c\u5c31\u5728\u63a2\u8a0e\u4ec0\u9ebc\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u3002\u301d\u53ef\u6015\u7684\u7f8e\u9e97\u301e\u5c31\u5728\u6311\u6230\u76ee\u524d\u4eba\u5011\u5c0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u4ee5\u51fa\u4e4e\u610f\u6599\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e26\u6a39\u7acb\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u65b0\u6a19\u6e96\uff01\u4f86\u81ea\u963f\u59c6\u65af\u7279\u4e39\u7684\u85dd\u8853\u5bb6 Leanie van der Vyver \u4ee5\u9019\u500b\u4e3b\u984c\u4f86\u63a2\u8a0e\u4eba\u985e\u4e0d\u6eff\u8db3\u65bc\u5929\u751f\u7684\u81ea\u5df1\uff0c\u7d93\u5e38\u63a1\u53d6\u6975\u7aef\u7684\u63aa\u65bd\u4f86\u6539\u8b8a\u5916\u8868\u4e26\u6e34\u671b\u88ab\u770b\u898b\u3002\u900f\u904e\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u9ad4\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5f9e\u5e7b\u60f3\u6210\u70ba\u73fe\u5be6\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u64c1\u6709\u638c\u63a7\u81ea\u5df1\u5f62\u8c61\u8207\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e3b\u5c0e\u6b0a\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u6a23\u5982\u4e0a\u5e1d\u822c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u53c8\u6703\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5462\uff1fLeanie van der Vyver \u900f\u904e\u7531\u5973\u978b\u88fd\u9020\u5546 Rene van den Berg \u6240\u88fd\u4f5c\u7684\u9019\u96d9\u9ad8\u8ddf\u978b\u4f86\u7aba\u63a2\u4e00\u4e8c\uff01via", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Michal Blaha", "link": "https://medium.com/@michalblaha/hezky-takova-mala-advanced-rada-pri-odblokovani-uctu-se-nemusi-menit-heslo-na-konci-vyber-jen-1c910eed1b66?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 26, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "Michal BlahaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 26, 2018Hezky.

And why do some Muslim women wear it?Raihan Ismail is a lecturer in Middle East Politics and Islamic Studies at the Australian National University.Dr Ismail answers some common questions about the burka.Why do some Muslim women wear\u00a0burkas?These two women in Afghanistan are wearing a burka. Note the complete covering of the body and face. Picture: ninara/FlickrThe Koran calls for both men and women to \u2018cover and be modest\u2019.As with many other religious scriptures, the reference to dress is open to interpretation and has been shaped by centuries of cultures in different nations.\u201cThe Koran does not explicitly say you have to cover yourself in this manner,\u201d Dr Ismail said.\u201cSome scholars argue that it is a religious obligation, particularly the more conservative factions within the Muslim world. There are many variations and interpretations.\u201dDr Ismail is a Muslim and has been wearing her hijab since she was a child.\u201cI\u2019m so comfortable wearing it that I can\u2019t imagine myself without it. I wear it for cultural reasons, but there are many women who wear it for religious reasons.\u201dIs it a burka, niqab, hijab, chador or\u00a0dupatta?This woman is wearing what is often mistaken for a burka. It\u2019s a niqab. Her body and face are covered, except her eyes. Picture: Phil Noble/ReutersThe use of the term burka in Australia is often confused with what is actually the niqab.The burka covers the entire body including the whole face, with a mesh window for the woman to see out of.The niqab covers the whole body including the face with the exception of the woman\u2019s eyes.\u201cThe niqab is more accurate; people rarely wear the burka in Australia,\u201d Dr Ismail said.\u201cIn Australia people mostly wear the hijab in lots of different styles.\u201dThe hijab covers the hair and chest and is common among Muslim women in South East Asia.Hijab is also a general term referring to the practice of wearing veils of all kinds.The chador is a full-length cloak worn by many Iranian women, typically held closed at the front by the wearer\u2019s hands or under their arms.The dupatta is a long scarf draped across the head and shoulders, and is often accompanied by matching garments.It is common in South Asia.This woman is wearing a hijab. Picture: Angie\u00a0BexleyAre some Muslim women forced to wear a burka or\u00a0niqab?The Koran, the holy book of Islam, uses the term sharia to refer to the revealed guidance and directives given by Allah. Sharia is not just a set of laws, but rather an ideology that encompasses the Islamic way of life, covering topics from business transactions to food.Find out more about what sharia involves here.In Australia Dr Ismail said that the reasons women wear veils of all kinds vary widely and take in influences from culture, fashion as well as religion.\u201cSome women wear it because they strongly believe it is their religious obligation,\u201d she said.Dr Ismail does concede that some women may be pressured into covering themselves.\u201cThere is a possibility that some husbands would tell their wives \u2018please wear the niqab, I don\u2019t want any other men to see you\u2019 which is possessive,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen it comes to that, the problem is not the niqab, it is being married to someone who is possessive and oppressive.\u201dShould the burka be\u00a0banned?Dr Ismail does not agree that banning the burka in Australia would solve the problem of oppression.\u201cBy banning the burka or niqab you are preventing some women in freely practising what they believe in,\u201d she said.\u201cYou would probably isolate these women because they would not be able to go out.\u201dMuslim women do not wear a veil in front of their immediate family, which usually means a niqab or hijab is not worn at home.What is your personal experience of wearing the\u00a0hijab?As a Muslim woman who wears the hijab, Dr Ismail has had some negative experiences in Canberra.\u201cOnce in a while, people call me a terrorist,\u201d she said.\u201cMy first experience in Australia [involved] two women behind me who said, \u2018They are everywhere, it\u2019s like a disease\u2019.\u201cThey pushed me a little bit and started laughing; I was so heartbroken.\u201dThough confronting and upsetting, Dr Ismail said this kind of experience is in the minority.\u201cIn Canberra people are so lovely; sometimes people just smile at me, and that is just so nice,\u201d she said.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "On the trail of a real-life \u2018Tarzan\u2019", "author_name": "ABC News", "link": "https://medium.com/abc-news-australia/on-the-trail-of-a-real-life-tarzan-d7031843804?source=search_post", "post_date": "Sep 21, 2016", "readtime": "6 min read", "upvotes": "6", "content": "On the trail of a real-life \u2018Tarzan\u2019ABC NewsBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 21, 2016By James Vyver for EarshotMichael Fomenko peers through sugarcane on a farm in Queensland, Australia.

Or rather, he is recognisable to many. The facts of his personal story and what drove him are known by one or two people at best.Michael was wondered at, and about, for decades in this part of the world. He made the tropical rainforests his home for 50 years, living off the land, detached from society. Part adventurer, part bushman, part vagrant\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was a hero or an oddity, depending on who you asked.In 1960 he wrote:\u201cI have renounced what you call civilisation. I want the life I have been living, otherwise I will be only half\u00a0alive.\u201dHe described his home among nature as \u201cmy paradise of peace and personal endeavour\u201d.It is this \u201cparadise\u201d that I have come to experience. After a short drive we come to the far end of the Reghenzanis\u2019 property, where the bright green cane fields meet wine-bottle coloured bush crowded along the banks of the Mulgrave River.\u201cCrocs?\u201d I ask.\u201cMy brother used to come fishing down here at night,\u201d Greg begins with a sly smile. \u201cHe\u2019d shine the torch and there\u2019d be red eyes everywhere.\u201dArmed with that mental image and wearing my short pants, we enter the bush. We climb down a slippery bank onto an old riverbed and into a mass of vines, palms and giant trees. Mosquitoes are everywhere. It\u2019s dark, humid and the air is thick with the musty smell of wet mud.Why did Michael come to call this place\u200a\u2014\u200aa crocodile-infested jungle ripe with all the dangers of the tropics\u200a\u2014\u200aparadise?\u201cIt\u2019s in his blood,\u201d says his sister Inessa.\u201cIt\u2019s his heredity. He\u2019s a blue blood, you know.\u201dMichael Fomenko in 1960, after returning from an epic canoe to Dutch New Guinea. Picture:\u00a0suppliedMichael and Inessa were born in Russia in the 1920s, and are indeed from aristocratic stock. Their mother was Princess Elizabeth Matchabelli, from a long line of Georgian nobility. Daniel Fomenko, their father, was a Cossack. It was this social status that caused problems for the family.By the time Michael was born, the Bolshevik revolution was a decade old. The full impact had taken time to filter through to Georgia, then part of Russia, but by the late 1920s things had taken a frightening turn.\u201cThere were killing their own people, a kind of cultural genocide. Father was worried that mother would be killed as well,\u201d says Inessa.\u201cPlus, we were starving. Michael\u2019s ribs stuck out and I used to faint from lack of food. Father would hold me up by the ankles so the blood would go back to my head.\u201d\u201cFather wanted to escape, somewhere or other. He was just so worried.\u201dEscape they did. Using forged identification papers and in disguise, the family fled across the continent to Vladivostok in the east. Inessa was around five, Michael was just two.Using what remaining valuables they had\u200a\u2014\u200ajewellery smuggled on the Trans-Siberian Railway sewed inside Inessa\u2019s toy dog\u200a\u2014\u200athey hired Chinese bandits to smuggle them across the border into Manchuria.The family travelled on foot for a month, through the vast Siberian Taiga pine forest. They walked at night, hid during the day and lived on the meekest of provisions.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know where we were going. The Taiga is huge\u200a\u2014\u200asnow tiger country, you know. We relied totally on these bandits. I don\u2019t know how we made it, but we did,\u201d remembers Inessa.After a few years in China the family moved to Japan and relative safety. They lived in the countryside around Kobe and Michael and Inessa found themselves immersed in nature once again, though this time by choice.\u201cWe used to throw ourselves on beds of violets in spring. It was a magical place,\u201d Inessa says.Michael Fomenko walks past canefields in the 1990s. Picture:\u00a0suppliedBy the late 1930s, Daniel could see that war was on the horizon. He moved the family once again, this time to Sydney, and the Fomenkos did their best to reset their lives once again.Daniel took a job at the prestigious Sydney Church of England Grammar School and Michael attended. He was a natural athlete and excelled in the decathlon, even being tipped for the 1956 Olympics.But Michael struggled socially and Inessa says he found it hard to fit in.\u201cBecause we couldn\u2019t communicate our experiences as children, we were very much alone. The experiences we\u2019ve had, nobody in Australia could begin to understand if we told\u00a0them.\u201cThere was danger, oh God, what we went through. Even though you might think he was too young, the past and all that drama really did have an effect on Michael.\u201cI think that\u2019s what got Michael into the forest, the background of our life.\u201dMichael had always loved the outdoors, as if those early experiences set kind of a blueprint for the rest of his life; to be amongst nature, living alone, testing himself against the elements.The tree Michael lived under before he set out to walk from Cairns to Sydney at the age of 86. He made it as far as Gympie. Picture: ABC/James VyverAfter he left school in the mid-1950s he took a job cutting cane near Cairns. This is when he fell in love with the rainforest. He had found the place and the mode of living he felt most comfortable with. And there, by and large, he stayed until 2013.During this time Michael\u2019s adventures caught many an eye: his epic 700 kilometre, two-year journey in a dugout canoe from Cooktown to Dutch New Guinea; the three-day chase in the bush to track him down and throw him in a mental hospital; the camps he made up and down the tropical coast, just like the one on the Reghenzani cane farm.\u201cThey send the SAS out bush to get hard, but this is just how he lived,\u201d says Greg as we stand at the foot of a giant fig tree that Michael slept in.\u201cHe was an incredible guy.\u201dWhile many knew of him, few knew him properly. Michael didn\u2019t really share himself or his story with anyone except Inessa, and even they were estranged for decades.\u201cI never knew where the hell he was,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he had a lovely life, he lived in paradise.\u201dIt was fascinating for me to sit across from her and hear the real stories behind the legend of Australia\u2019s Tarzan. Inessa has a kind face, keen wit and a memory that belies her nearly 90 years. Her eyes dance when she recalls a particular habit Michael had when they were children.\u201cHe was petrified of thunder and lightning, but he would go out in it, or open the window and stick his head\u00a0out.\u201d\u201cEmbrace the fear?\u201d I ask.\u201cTotally, consciously.\u201dMichael Fomenko in Cairns during the 1990s. Picture: Harold\u00a0JungMichael is now in his late 80s and lives in an aged care facility. He and Inessa have reconnected, but it\u2019s taken time. The ice was broken with a painting\u200a\u2014\u200aInessa is an artist\u200a\u2014\u200aentitled \u201cCorina, Corina\u201d, after one of Michael\u2019s favourite songs from the 1950s.\u201cI painted it to cheer him up, I thought it would remind him of those days in Sydney when we used to have sing-songs around the piano.\u201dMichael is basically a recluse. It makes things tricky when you\u2019re making a documentary about someone, though it has added to the mystery. It also means, painting or not, that Michael and Inessa have not spoken with one another in decades.I ask Inessa what she would say if she were reunited with her little brother.\u201cMike, it\u2019s me,\u201d she says. \u201cWe made it, baby!

Since my work has a lot to do with the internet and I use it daily, I need to have a solution\u200a\u2014\u200aa solution for the great firewall of China. For years (since 2009 to be exact), it was Astrill, but never again!For a long time, Astrill VPN was a solid solution and it still is for many people. In fact, it\u2019s probably still the most popular solution in China, which is the problem. Unfortunately, it has been blocked quite often during the last one or two years. China is becoming stricter about this whole area of internet censorship and one VPN they were really focused on was Astrill (I do not have any proof\u200a\u2014\u200ait is just my impression from various web articles, discussions and my own experience). The Astrill team has always been great and they have come up with some solutions. The even made a free Stealth VPN (of their own protocol) for my basic premium subscription, which was working ok for a while.This month as I was redesigning and remaking my webpage, I spent most of my days on the internet and on Astrill. Every day I had to take a few shots of whisky to calm myself down. It was driving me crazy. Everything was super slow, disconnections occurred every ten minutes, my account was blocked a few times because of suspicious activity, etc. In the end, I have decided to give a try to another VPN provider.So, I have started my research. To my great surprise, Astrill didn\u2019t even get a mention in most of the \u201cbest of\u201c reviews on the internet. It is simply not the best solution anymore. I think it is possibly one of the worst solutions now. After reading many articles and reviews, I had two potential winners: VyprVPN and Express VPN. VyprVPN offers a three day trial so I started with that. Outcome: I do not even have to try Express VPN.I am watching 1080HD video on Youtube for the first time in China! I could never have done that with Astrill. With Astrill, I was super happy when 420p was working, but with VyprVPN I can watch 1080HD without interruptions! I have streamed an HD movie with PopcornTime over bitorrents with no problems! I have uploaded hundreds of MBs in minutes. The whole world has changed for me!VyprVPN\u2019s Mac application is on a whole different level. The Astrill application for Mac is a basic solution. It is unstable, and I had to restart it a few times a day; sometimes I even had to restart my Mac because of Astrill. There were times when it acted like I was logged out of my account, but in reality it didn\u2019t log out, making it impossible to log in again (because I was actually logged in even though the app was showing I was logged out). It made my internet speed unusable. VyprVPN is a clean, stable, well-working app and it is also beautiful. Speed tests are available in one click. You can also see your speed history, which is great. They also have a great application for the iPhone as well. I have never succeeded in making the Astrill application for the iPhone work.Apps from VyprVPN just work!!!VyprVPN now offers three kinds of subscription: Basic one, Pro and Premiere. I do not think basic is enough for China so I bought Pro. The Pro subscription offers a special VPN protocol that is especially designed for China and countries with heavy censorship. They call it Chameleon. And the best part? With the Pro subscription, you can get 25GB cloud storage for free! How awesome is that?The Pro subscription with VyprVPN costs USD8.33 for one month if you buy it in a yearly subscription; Astrill costs USD5.83 a month, but if you want to add the NAT firewall (which is included in VyprVPN), you have to add another USD5. I am not sure if StealthVPN is now included or not; they say it both ways on their websites. They gave it to me for free, but it is +USD2 if you want to buy it. So, if you want to have Astrill on the same level as VyprVPN (with the NAT firewall and their own protocol StealthVPN), you have to pay USD12.83 a month. For a lower price with VyprVPN, I get speed, reliability, and a stable app for Mac and the iPhone (and other devices if I wish) and 25GB of free cloud storage. My world has literally changed\u200a\u2014\u200achanged to a much brighter one. I will not have a drinking problem anymore because of all this stress that Astrill was causing me.Originally published at www.bamboome.sk.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Norman Green", "link": "https://medium.com/@vyprvpnreview/the-vyprvpn-review-1968320ba08e?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 11, 2014", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "The Vyprvpn\u00a0ReviewNorman GreenBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 11, 2014Read this Vyprvpn review to learn more about this service.

VyprVPN has already found a good user base in places where the internet is censored, such as Turkey, China and Iran.One of the most common issues that users have while using VPNs is how secure and reliable the VPN itself is. Golden Frog has been around since the year 1994, headquartered in Switzerland. Having been around for such a long time, and that too in a nation where the privacy laws and policies are the best in the world, does give it a lot of credibility.More: http://www.raritysoft.com/reviews/vyprvpn-review", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Digital Marketing Agency", "author_name": "VyprMedia", "link": "https://medium.com/@payperclicknyc/digital-marketing-agency-ac40e36cdec4?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 23, 2018", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "Digital Marketing AgencyVyprMediaBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 23, 2018VyprMedia is a one of the best digital marketing situation in the heart of New York city.

This will also be the final year it will be considered a D-League Championship as the league will re-brand itself as the NBA Gatorade League (G-League) next season.For those unfamiliar with the D-League Playoff format, each round is a Best-of-3 series with the lower seed hosting Game 1 at home each round.Los Angeles D-Fenders (2) vs. Rio Grande Valley Vipers\u00a0(3)Don\u2019t expect a ton of defense to be played when these two teams hit the court. The Vipers and D-Fenders finished first and second in points per game this past D-League season (120.1 and 118.2 respectively) while giving up the second and third-most points per game (115.6 points for LA, 115.3 for the Vipers).Buckets, buckets, and quite possibly even more buckets will rain down as these teams will play with high energy and simply try to outscore one another.The D-Fenders will be paced by top D-League prospect Vander Blue, who eclipsed the 4,000 career point mark this past season, only the third player to do so in NBADL history. Blue averaged just under 25 points per game while shooting 43.4% from the field. He\u2019s a volume shooter, and the D-Fenders went 12\u20132 during the regular season when he attempted at least 20 field goals in a single contest.Blue is not afraid to attack the basket or get to the free throw line. He set a new D-League record just this past week for most free throws made and attempted (23-for-27), 10 more attempts than the opposing team that night.Despite being an offensive-happy team, the D-Fenders will receive a huge boost on the defensive side courtesy of David Nwaba. His defensive prowess is the reason the Lakers called him up this past season and why he signed a multi-year deal with the club.He will be responsible with guarding the scoring threats of the Vipers like former Laker Darius Morris. The Febraury D-League Player of the Month, Morris has been quite an offensive juggernaut for the snakes. He\u2019s averaging 20 points per game but shooting below 35% from three-point range this season.In the frontcourt, the battle will be against Justin Harper of the D-Fenders and Chinanu Onuaku for RGV. Harper earned a call-up this year with the Philadelphia 76ers. Meanwhile, Onuaku has spent the majority of the season with the Vipers, a staple for big men looking to acclimate to the Houston Rocket system.Before Onuaku came Clint Capela (2014\u201315) and Montrezl Harrell (2015\u201316). Onuaku is on a similar path with his improvement this past season for the Vipers. He averaged a double-double for Vipers during the regular season (13.6 points, 10.6 rebounds) in 43 games with the team. What\u2019s impressive about those numbers is he averaged just 28 minutes per contest in that span.Don\u2019t think that you can send Onuaku to the free throw line via hack-a-(insert name here) methods. Onuaku has utilized the infamous Rick Barry free-throw form and is shooting a modest 73% from the charity stripe, a solid number for a big man.The Vipers will have extra backup in the form of their assignment players, Kyle Wiltjer, who is a deep-threat for RGV, and perhaps the league\u2019s best-kept secret, Isaiah Taylor.Taylor missed a majority of the regular season due to injury, but came back in February and has put on a clinic, so much so the Rockets signed him immediately to a multi-year deal and left him on assignment to continue his development.Taylor is shooting over 51% from the field in 25 games, while shooting 45% from long range as well.Josh Magette will certainly have his work cut out for him in this series. He averaged a near double-double this past regular season with 15 points and nine assists but will need to play against a longer and faster team in the Vipers.Minor Notes:The Vipers won the regular season series 3\u20131Chris Johnson will be an important asset for the Vipers as well as Jaron Johnson, who was a late season acquisition after spending the season in Australia. Johnson was sidelined with injury for a significant portion of the season.There will be plenty of opportunities to shoot 3-pointers as well, with both teams averaging a combined 61 attempts from deep.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Twitz Coding Session in Go\u200a\u2014\u200aCobra + Viper CLI with Initial Twitter + Cassandra Installation", "author_name": "Adron Hall", "link": "https://medium.com/@adron/twitz-coding-session-in-go-cobra-viper-cli-with-initial-twitter-cassandra-installation-90989552082b?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 29, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "Twitz Coding Session in Go\u200a\u2014\u200aCobra + Viper CLI with Initial Twitter + Cassandra InstallationAdron HallBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 29, 2018Part 2 of 3\u200a\u2014\u200aCoding Session in Go\u200a\u2014\u200aCobra + Viper CLI for Parsing Text Files, Retrieval of Twitter Data, Exports to various file formats, and export to Apache Cassandra.UPDATED PARTS:Twitz Coding Session in Go\u200a\u2014\u200aCobra + Viper CLI for Parsing Text FilesTwitz Coding Session in Go\u200a\u2014\u200aCobra + Viper CLI with Initial Twitter + Cassandra Installation (this post)Twitz Coding Session in Go\u200a\u2014\u200aCobra + Viper CLI Wrap Up + Twitter Data RetrievalUpdated links to each part will be posted at bottom of this post when I publish them.

This segment also includes a number of refactorings to clean up the functions, break out the control structures and make the code more readable.In the end of refactoring twitz parse came out like this. The completed list is put together by calling the buildTwitterList() function which is actually in the helpers.go file. Then prints that list out as is, and checks to see if a file export should be done. If there is a configuration setting set for file export then that process starts with a call to exportParsedTwitterList(exportFilename string, exportFormat string,\u00a0... etc\u00a0... ). Then a simple single level control if then else structure to determine which format to export the data to, and a call to the respective export function to do the actual export of data and writing of the file to the underlying system. There\u2019s some more refactoring that could be done, but for now, this is cleaned up pretty nicely considering the splattering of code I started with at first.Parse Function50:00 I walk through a quick install of an Apache Cassandra single node that I\u2019ll use for development use later. I also show quickly how to start and stop post-installation.Reference: Apache Cassandra, Download Page, and Installation Instructions.53:50 Choosing the go-twitter API library for Go. I look at a few real quickly just to insure that is the library I want to use.Reference: go-twitter library56:35 At this point I go through how I set a Twitter App within the API interface. This is a key part of the series where I take a look at the consumer keys and access token and access token secrets and where they\u2019re at in the Twitter interface and how one needs to reset them if they just showed the keys on a stream (like I just did, shockers!)57:55 Here I discuss and show where to setup the environment variables inside of Goland IDE to building and execution of the CLI. Once these are setup they\u2019ll be the main mechanism I use in the IDE to test the CLI as I go through building out further features.1:00:18 Updating the twitz config command to show the keys that we just added as environment variables. I set these up also with some string parsing and cutting off the end of the secrets so that the whole variable value isn\u2019t shown but just enough to confirm that it is indeed a set configuration or environment variable.1:16:53 At this point I work through some additional refactoring of functions to clean up some of the code mess that exists. Using Goland\u2019s extract method feature and other tooling I work through several refactoring efforts that clean up the code.1:23:17 Copying a build configuration in Goland. A handy little thing to know you can do when you have a bunch of build configuration options.1:37:32 At this part of the video I look at the app-auth example in the code library, but I gotta add the caveat, I run into problems using the exact example. But I work through it and get to the first error messages that anybody would get to pending they\u2019re using the same examples. I get them fixed however in the next session, this segment of the video however provides a basis for my pending PR\u2019s and related work I\u2019ll submit to the repo.The remainder of the video is trying to figure out what is or isn\u2019t exactly happening with the error.I\u2019ll include the working findem code in the next post on this series.

While that\u2019s easier said than done, patience will typically pay off for those who can endure it.Never more was the case than in Boise, Idaho on Friday night, when Rio Grande Valley Vipers guard Tyrone White exploded for 38 points, 10 assists and 5 rebounds to help his team cruise to victory.DLeagueDigest.com last caught up with White at the NBA D-League Showcase, and it was then that White had to wait his turn as the Vipers\u2019 roster was flooded with players at his position. No player in the NBADL wants to move down the bench and lose valuable playing time, but in a league so heavily impacted by constant change, staying prepared and waiting out certain situations can benefit players who are willing to put in the time.White, an International Basketball Leagues (IBL) alum, and Portland, Oregon native, spoke with DLD after his huge game. \u201cPatience was key, and even though I haven\u2019t been playing, I\u2019ve been able to go up against NBA guards in practice and they\u2019ve been pushing me to get better. Toure Murry, Nick Johnson, and Isaiah Canaan (when he was here) were all great competition for me, and we compete in practice,\u201d White said.White has scored 20 or more points now three times this season, and Friday night\u2019s performance was easily his best as a professional in the NBA D-League. White dropped 30 points in the first half alone. \u201cI just cleared my head and it felt good to play in front of family, my Mom and Dad were here so it\u2019s always good to point to them in the stands, the feeling was right,\u201d White added.White, a Jefferson High School (Portland, Oregon) alum shared his big game on the same night another notable Jefferson high alum went off. Terrence Jones has enjoyed a nice comeback as of late for RGV\u2019s parent club the Houston Rockets (Jones went for 26 points, 12 rebounds vs. Brooklyn on Friday night), and according to White, the Jefferson alumni make sure they stay in touch as their professional careers unfold, including another alumni in Toronto as well.When asked if he had heard of Jones\u2019 big game on Friday White commented, \u201cI mean T-Ross is out there doing his thing too, we have a nice pipeline going, we hope to continue to do that.\u201dJones has recently announced his involvement in the upcoming and new Portland Pro-Am, where the Houston Rockets versatile player will host the event alongside some of his fellow Portland, Oregon natives, White being one of them.In regard to playing in the upcoming Summer event, White added, \u201cDefinitely, that\u2019s already a done deal, I\u2019m very excited for it.\u201dWith a roster that stands in White\u2019s favor, more big games can be expected from the 6'7'\u2019 point guard. White has taken his game to another level as a member of the Vipers, and based off his recent production, White\u2019s ceiling seems to be at an all-time high.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "LIVE REVIEW: Say Anything @ The Viper Room, LA\u00a03/12/12", "author_name": "The Owl Mag", "link": "https://medium.com/the-owl-mag/live-review-say-anything-the-viper-room-la-3-12-12-849bb695061d?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 16, 2012", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "LIVE REVIEW: Say Anything @ The Viper Room, LA\u00a03/12/12The Owl MagBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 16, 2012To celebrate the release of their first new album since their 2009 self-titled record, Say Anything decided to throw a party and invite all their fans. It was strange to be waiting outside the Viper Room in the middle of the day while the sun was still shining, but once we were inside, the only difference to be found were the extra video cameras.A group of lucky local fans crowded near the stage with growing excitement as the final preparations for the live video broadcast were made, and then the band was onstage and the show began.

It was a tightly contested game with 17 lead changes in all.\u201cWe got down early and we fought back,\u201d Cook said of the team\u2019s performance. \u201cI think we did a good job of forcing (the Vipers) to do things they\u2019re not accustomed to doing.\u201dSanta Cruz Warriors head coach Casey Hill knew Cook was capable of such a performance.\u201cHe and I sat together before the game and I told him that our first two games he\u2019s been decent, but he\u2019s got a whole other gear he can go to,\u201d Hill said. \u201cBoth on the defensive and offensive end.\u201dIsaiah Taylor notched a double-double for the Vipers (3\u20131) with 30 points on 8-of-17 from the field to go with 11 assists. He showed off his ability to attack the basket and find his way to the free throw line, with a perfect performance from the charity stripe (13-of-13).Kyle Wiltjer, on assignment from the Houston Rockets, led the team in scoring heading into Friday night with 27 points per contest. Santa Cruz held him to just nine points through the first 36 minutes.\u201c(Wiltjer) and amazing shooter,\u201d Cook said. \u201cSo we had to crowd him and not give him much space. Every time he was in a ball screen we tried to switch it and just be physical with him.\u201dFellow assignee Chinanu Onuaku dropped 11 points and grabbed nine rebounds for the Vipers in the defeat.With the game tied with less than a minute to go, Dennis Clifford hit the go-ahead runner with 33 seconds left to give the Warriors the lead.\u201c(Clifford) has been such a surprise for us,\u201d Hill said. \u201cHe\u2019s been great, I don\u2019t know what else to say about Dennis other than he\u2019s been nothing but a great teammate, he\u2019s executed everything we\u2019ve asked him to do, he\u2019s way tougher than everyone thought he was coming out of college and he\u2019s proving that he might end up being an NBA player.\u201dOn the ensuing possession, Taylor was fouled by Clifford and was sent to the free throw line. He would hit both free throws to tie the game and send Clifford to the bench after fouling out of the contest. Clifford finished with a double-double of his own with 14 points and 12 rebounds.The contest was marred with personal fouls, 15 between both teams in the first quarter and a combined 56 for the game with a player fouling out for each team.NBA legend Gary Payton was in attendance to watch his son, Gary Payton II play for the Vipers. Payton II scored eight points on 3-of-11, was 2-of-9 from three-point range and grabbed seven rebounds.Along with the game-winning shot, Pressey finished with 19 points on 8-of-17 from the floor and dished out nine assists as well in the victory, a win that shows the team\u2019s toughness according to Hill.\u201cWe\u2019ve got some stones.\u201d", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Houston Rockets Rookie Sam Dekker Makes Season Debut With\u00a0Vipers", "author_name": "Chris Reichert", "link": "https://2ways10days.com/houston-rockets-rookie-sam-dekker-makes-season-debut-with-vipers-6111fa98d2b8?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 19, 2016", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "Houston Rockets Rookie Sam Dekker Makes Season Debut With\u00a0VipersChris ReichertBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 19, 2016After sitting out for three months recovering from back surgery, Houston Rockets rookie Sam Dekker made his return to the court Friday night while on assignment with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers.Dekker was selected with the 18th overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft by the Rockets. For Dekker, the return to the hardwood was bittersweet.\u201cI\u2019m just glad to be playing again,\u201d Dekker said. The University of Wisconsin alum noted conditioning was a factor in the decision to assign him to the D-League.\u201cIt felt amazing to be out there, but I didn\u2019t feel amazing if you know what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Dekker said. \u201cI was suppose to do four-minute stints and I did an eight-minute stint because I felt pretty good and then I ran out of gas.\u201dPlaying time was limited for Dekker in his return. In 19 minutes, Dekker scored eight points on 3-of-9 from the field while grabbing three rebounds and handing out two assists in the team\u2019s victory over the Santa Cruz Warriors. He received a wake-up call during the game reminding him of his current physical limitations.\u201cI was short on a layup and airball short on a three. That\u2019s when I knew I\u2019ve got to settle down a little bit and catch my wind but me as a competitor wants to always be at my peak,\u201d Dekker said. \u201c(Vipers coaching staff) told me \u2018Hey, don\u2019t put any pressure on yourself, you have no one to impress. Just go and play and get your rhythm back.\u2019 It was good to be out there again.\u201d\u201cWe are using this assignment for Sam to get in game shape and play professional basketball,\u201d Vipers head coach Matt Brase said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t able to play Summer League and only played a little in the preseason before he was shut down. This is a chance for him to get comfortable with our organizational system and speed of the game at the next level.\u201dDekker\u2019s preexisting relationship with Brase helped make the transition to the D-League a bit smoother.\u201cMatt\u2019s a great guy. He worked a lot with me this summer when I first got to Houston so we built a good relationship,\u201d Dekker said. \u201cHe\u2019s an easy guy to talk to that let\u2019s you go out and play. He\u2019s done a good job with these guys and I think they\u2019re responding well to him.\u201dDekker noted his familiarity with the D-League before his assignment having kept up with teammates Montrezl Harrell and KJ McDaniels, who have also been assigned to the Vipers as well previously this season.According to Dekker, there is no clear timetable for his return to the NBA, but he mentioned he would be moving back-and-forth between the two teams for the foreseeable future.\u201cWhen (Rockets) see I\u2019m ready to be back and look like I\u2019m at full strength I\u2019ll be back up but who knows how long that will be,\u201d Dekker said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to take it a day at a time and try to play as hard as I can.\u201d\u201cThey just want to keep evaluating me. They want to have their hands on me to see how I\u2019m progressing and what my conditioning is like,\u201d Dekker said. \u201cSo we\u2019re just going a day at a time. I\u2019m not really worried I\u2019ll be back up there soon.\u201dDid Harrell and McDaniels offer Dekker any advice before his D-League stint began?\u201cThey just said go play, go have fun with it. Like the other guys said don\u2019t put any pressure on yourself,\u201d Dekker said. \u201cA lot of these guys down here played in training camp with us so I\u2019ve built some relationships with them. This is my life, playing hoops, and not being able to do it for three months sucked.\u201cI knew there was going to be rust. It\u2019s going to take a week or two to feel like myself again but I\u2019m blessed to be out here doing this and trying to make the most of the opportunity.\u201dWhile conditioning is the biggest immediate concern for Dekker as he continues to get back into basketball shape, there are other challenges he faces moving forward with his career.challenge:\u201cI think style of play is different, it caters a little more to my liking. More open floor, pick-and-roll situations, that\u2019s where I thrive,\u201d Dekker said. \u201cI got in a little bit of those tonight but as we progress into this I\u2019ll feel more comfortable getting into that and getting back to my style of play. I like the NBA style of play. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s free, it\u2019s physical, but that the basketball I like.\u201dThe Vipers head to Boise, ID Saturday to play the Idaho Stampede to close out this back-to-back road trip.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "HEAR THIS: Viper Creek\u00a0Club", "author_name": "The Owl Mag", "link": "https://medium.com/the-owl-mag/hear-this-viper-creek-club-5bc02e1d8085?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 9, 2012", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "HEAR THIS: Viper Creek\u00a0ClubThe Owl MagBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 9, 2012Video game synth beats, tinges of alternative rock, and raw vocals make up Seattle-based Viper Creek Club\u2019s newest album Hot Lights.

In total six players scored in double-figures for Santa Cruz, including Alex Hamilton, who dropped 20 points on 6\u20130f-9 from the field and posted a +17 rating for the game.With the victory, Santa Cruz (16\u201312) are mere percentage points ahead of Rio Grande Valley (17\u201313) in the standings and currently sit as the fourth seed in the Western Conference if the playoffs were to start today.\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIt locks (the players) in, it focuses them. \u201cI think from a development standpoint, (players) learning to approach these type of games as professionals is really important.\u201dThe Vipers struck first, however, with an 8\u20130 run to open the game, with Santa Cruz\u2019s first bucket coming nearly four minutes into the first quarter.Rio Grande Valley would extend their lead to 11 points by the end of the first quarter as they led 34\u201323 with Alex Hamilton hitting a buzzer-beating layup to closeout the first.Santa Cruz continued its scoring ways by opening the second quarter with a mini 7\u20130 run to cut the Vipers\u2019 lead to six, but the Vipers would respond courtesy of Chinanu Onuaku, who controlled the paint with a pair of vicious alley-oop slams.Midway through the second quarter, Scott Wood and Darius Morris showed off their three-point shooting prowess, hitting back-to-back-to-back three pointers for their respective teams, but Morris helped to extend Rio Grande Valley\u2019s lead to seven with 4:54 remaining in the first half.Santa Cruz would close the gap heading into the locker room, but would still trail, 61\u201358 at halftime.The Warriors claimed the lead for the first time in the third quarter as they outscored the Vipers 18\u201310 midway through the frame and led 76\u201371.Santa Cruz outscored the Vipers 36\u201317 to take a 94\u201378 lead heading into the final quarter. Phil Pressey netted a triple-double (1o points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists) through three quarters of play. Pressey ended the game with 16 points, 14 rebounds, and 13 assists in the victory.\u201c(Pressey) is doing a really good job of seeking out Scott Wood in transition,\u201d Hill said, who mentioned previously his goal for Pressey is to facilitate more and average a triple-double rather than take on the bulk of the scoring load. \u201cPhil\u2019s also been doing a really good job of running our offense for us.\u201dJoshua Smith fouled out midway through the fourth quarter after a strong performance.

One current player is trying to bring that style\u00a0back.Chris ReichertBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 27, 2017(Getty Images)Early November games in the NBA D-League rarely create headlines, but in a match up between the Rio Grande Valley Vipers and the Los Angeles D-Fenders (now the South Bay Lakers) this past season, there were some unexpected fireworks.Not even two minutes had elapsed when Ivica Zubac fouled Chinanu Onuaku\u200a\u2014\u200aboth of whom were on assignment from their NBA affiliates\u200a\u2014\u200asending the latter to the free throw line. Free throw attempts don\u2019t usually illicit shock and awe, but after Onuaku released his first one a visibly shook Vander Blue turned to his bench and mouthed, \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d, Blue hadn\u2019t seen Onuaku play before so a wave of shock hit him when he saw his underhand free throws and he couldn\u2019t contain himself.That\u2019s right\u200a\u2014\u200aa professional basketball player in the NBA shoots his free throws underhanded. Onuaku splashed both of those free throws and finished with 14 points and 22 rebounds in a 133\u2013120 Vipers win. From then on, it became accepted that Onuaku was going to shoot free throws \u201cgranny style\u201d and it was a non-story until he did the same thing a little over a month later, this time for the Rockets. People tend to make fun of things they do not understand and an NBA player shooting underhand free throws, which have been coined granny style, certainly opens the door for finger-pointing and laughs. Onuaku could care less, because the change in style has exponentially increased his efficiency at the free throw stripe. Any negative attention he has received for the shooting motion is short-lived when people see its effectiveness and Onuaku\u2019s laser-focus on perfecting his craft.A metamorphosis like the one Onuaku chose to make only occurs when a player puts the goals of his team and his individual craft above any backlash he may receive. Of course Onuaku knew he would be made fun of, but after shooting a porous 46.7 percent from the free throw line his freshman season at Louisville, he was willing to put himself out there for improvement. He, and the Louisville coaching staff, spent the entire summer prior to his sophomore season studying old film of Rick Barry and honing his new craft. Just like a standard shooting motion, there\u2019s a process, shot mechanics and a flow he had to learn and develop.Onuaku finished his sophomore campaign by raising his free throw percentage to 58.9. In just one season his efficiency at the charity stripe jumped 12 percentage points. The sample size was quite small\u200a\u2014\u200ahe made 33-of-56 attempts\u200a\u2014\u200abut the rapid improvement was there for all to see, and it was enough to keep Onuaku working at making it better.After his successful sophomore season at Louisville, Onuaku declared for the 2016 NBA Draft and was selected by the Rockets with the 37th overall pick. Though he had promise, it was clear Onuaku would spend most of his rookie season with their D-League affiliate and he ended up playing 46 games of their 50-game schedule. Now on a much bigger stage, Onuaku would get the opportunity to test his underhanded style yet again. His sample size for the Vipers was much larger as he attempted 177 free throws during the regular and postseason. Add the four free throws (he went 4-of-4) he took for the Rockets and he amassed 181 attempts to glean even more knowledge from. Onuaku\u2019s percentage rose yet again to 72.4 percent. That means he\u2019s been able to raise his efficiency almost 26 percentage points in two years of shooting underhand free throws, which is astounding to comprehend.After reaching out to teammates and opponents of Onuaku this past season in the D-League, it became clear they didn\u2019t really care about his shooting motion. One of his teammates told us, \u201cYeah it was funny at first. I mean, most of us thought he was messing around, but after he said that\u2019s how he shoots I really just moved on. As long as it goes in the hoop I don\u2019t care what it looks like basically.\u201d I spoke to some opponents of his who confirmed the same but added a new, expected wrinkle: \u201cI mean, we talked shit to him when he stepped to the line because of the granny shot thing, but if it was my teammate I really wouldn\u2019t care.\u201dClearly there\u2019s a stigma around shooting underhand. Rick Barry holds the fourth highest career free throw percentage at 89.9 (only Steve Nash, Mark Price and Stephen Curry are better) yet no NBA player has chose to adopt his anatomically correct style. Barry is obviously a proponent of the style telling Sporting News, \u201cIt\u2019s a much more efficient shot. It\u2019s so much more efficient than overhand. There\u2019s so many positives to it because it\u2019s a much softer shot. It\u2019s one fluid motion and not a bunch of different motions that you have to do.\u201d Even with Barry being a staunch advocate of the style, only one of his five sons would take on the challenge of shooting underhand, which tells you all you need to know about the difficulty of widespread use of the style.The biggest name to employ the underhand free throw technique was Wilt Chamberlain who used the granny shot during the 1961\u201362 season where he shot 61.3 percent\u200a\u2014\u200ahis only season above 60 percent. He used it one year and stopped because, as he wrote in his autobiography, \u201cI felt silly, like a sissy.\u201d This is the problem with underhand free throws\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter how effective they can be, players will always push back due to the negative perception.Even still, Onuaku\u2019s recent success forces me to think how this underhand option would help current NBA players who struggle mightily from the line. Guys like Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard could really benefit from putting their pride aside and improving their efficiency at the line via the granny shot.While it\u2019s important to note Onuaku was already a better free throw shooter, the pivotal note to pull from this table is the marked improvement Onuaku was able to see after switching styles. Drummond has seen basically no improvement over this span, Jordan has raised his efficiency 10 percentage points and Howard has gone up about four percentage points but all are still wildly inefficient overall. Drummond is just 23-years-old and likely has another 10\u201312 years of his career left. Even if he were to improve to 52\u201360 percent, it would benefit him and his team greatly. Jordan is 28-years-old and in the prime of his career. A change could still be made for him as well. Howard is already 31-years-old. Even though a shift could assist him as well, he\u2019s the least likely of the three if we had to rank likelihood.In all honestly, there\u2019s a one percent chance of any one of these three\u200a\u2014\u200aor any other struggling free throw shooter (I\u2019m looking at you Andre Roberson)\u200a\u2014\u200aadopting this style and pride is the culprit. But just for fun, let\u2019s look at the potential impact for these three guys if they were to start shooting underhand free throws, and had the same success rate as Onuaku.Stan Van Gundy might kiss me on the mouth if this worked. Drummond shooting almost 61 percent from the free throw line would help their team so much. He would be able to stay on the court in late-game situations with much less fear of hack-a-Drummond, which would ultimately help their club attain more wins.The figures above project impact if all else remained exactly the same, which of course does not happen from year-to-year. Nonetheless, it\u2019s encouraging to see how things could shake out.Evidence shows that everyone who has attempted to use the underhand free throw technique saw an improvement in their overall efficiency at the free throw line. During my research I could not find a single subject who tried it and got worse, so there\u2019s nothing to lose\u200a\u2014\u200abesides maybe personal dignity.The impressive thing for Onuaku is he\u2019s seen this improvement while apparently using bad form. Rick Barry himself told the Washington Post last December, \u201cI admire the fact he [Onuaku] was willing to try something different. Unfortunately, his technique leaves a lot to be desired.\u201dSo, he could improve even more?Maybe the Rockets should hire Barry to work with Onuaku this summer to keep his development trending the right way and apparently to fix his technique. Or maybe they\u2019re more than pleased with 72.4 percent from the charity stripe for their role player 20-year-old. As for the Pistons, they should have added a clause to Drummond\u2019s contract stating if he could shoot 55 percent or better from the free throw line, he would get a $10 million bonus or something akin to that.If The Big Dipper himself couldn\u2019t change the course of big men shooting underhand free throws, it\u2019s highly unlikely Onuaku\u2019s bravery moves the needle for others, but it should.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "A Year of Vaping\u200a\u2014\u200aNot Smoking.

Savings Made, Lessons\u00a0LearnedDan ThorntonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 25, 2018Last week I reached the milestone of a year of vaping. That means 12 months since I last bought or smoked a full cigarette. I did have a total of about two puffs on a friend\u2019s Marlboro Light around Christmas, and immediately handed it back purely out of preference. I don\u2019t have a problem standing near people smoking. But it\u2019s not something I ever want to do again. Meanwhile I\u2019m still enjoying vaping as I learn new things about it. And at the same time, I\u2019m reducing my nicotine intake.My main aim was to stop smoking. Mainly for my own health, but also for those around me. And in that respect, vaping has worked perfectly. All impartial studies show the risks to me are greatly reduced. The same is true for family and friends. And there have been big financial savings as well.To put it into context, I smoked for around 20 years. In that time, the longest I managed to quit smoking was a few months. And then fell right back into it. When I couldn\u2019t vape recently due to potential conflicts with medication, it didn\u2019t cross my mind, and even the lowest level of nicotine lozenges felt really strong\u2026A Year of Vaping\u200a\u2014\u200aSavings and\u00a0Stats:365 days since my last cigarette.5,475 cigarettes not smoked (average of 15 per day)\u00a32,737.50 cigarettes not bought (average of \u00a310 per pack)Total cost of vaping so far: Kit (inc 2 tanks) \u00a392. Liquids and coils: \u00a3534.98. Total: \u00a3626.98.Savings after 12 months: \u00a32119.52Average cost of vaping per month: \u00a344.58. And average cost per day: \u00a31.48At an estimated potential of 10 minutes lower life expectancy per cigarette, I\u2019ve now regained: 912.5 hours. Which is 38 days. Or 5.4 weeks of extra time on the planet.Exercise: I haven\u2019t kept up my exercise regime as well as I could have done, although I can definitely run further more easily. And that\u2019s one of my next areas to focus on. In 12 months, I\u2019ve only managed around 7,170 push ups and squats for various reasons, and I should have been closer to 10,000.Still, saving more than \u00a32000 by doing something which is actually better for me is pretty impressive. And it\u2019s been completely painless for me. I know some people don\u2019t get on with vaping, or find it more difficult. But I literally started vaping on a Saturday night before Fathers Day 2017 whilst still smoking (and drinking some beers at the pub), and the next day I just kept vaping.A Year of Vaping\u200a\u2014\u200aLessons Learned and\u00a0Effects:I\u2019ve regained my sense of smell and taste, which is handy for cooking. And life in general.I don\u2019t feel the cold as much. Which means I save on heating bills and don\u2019t get woken up in the middle of the night with cramp in my feet.And I also haven\u2019t spent mornings hacking up the remnants of cigarettes from my lung, which means I\u2019m a bit less sluggish.Aside from remembering to stock up on coils and liquid, the only hassle from vaping is spending time researching and debating the health benefits with people who have only accepted some tabloid headlines. With nicotine as an active ingredient, vaping will never be healthy. But all impartial studies have shown it\u2019s 90\u201395% healthier in the short to medium term. And the biggest health problem I\u2019ve found is remembering to drink enough water.Meanwhile I don\u2019t build my own custom coils with exposed connections, so the risk of a battery exploding is roughly the same as for my mobile phone.And the time spent learning and researching vaping has paid off a little. The vaping community is a pro-active one, and recently the nice people at e-cigarette Direct got in touch. They were kind enough to send me a free Innokin Pocketbox to review, along with with new eliquids to try. The full write-up is on Disposable Media, but essentially it\u2019s a pretty decent vape kit for \u00a325. Less than half of the amount I spent to get started. And while I still prefer my Aspire kit for everyday use, it shows just how quick and easy it is to get started now.I\u2019ve found almost everyone in vaping has been really helpful.That includes the staff at Nicogreen in Rochester, Kent. They got me started and had to deal with my inexperienced questions a fair bit. I\u2019d link to their website, but it seems to be constantly offline at the moment. And since moving back to Peterborough, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time chatting and buying new stuff from Central Vape Shop in the town centre, and the Vape Project in Werrington.It\u2019s also interesting seeing how engaged most vaping companies are, especially when I share anything on Instagram. All of the vaping companies are quick to pick up on anything posted, and often share mentions of their products.Over time, I\u2019ve slowly reduced the nicotine levels of the eqliuid I use from 12mg at the start. I went through 9mg and 6mg, and have settled on 3mg which is the lowest level usually available. I honestly can\u2019t say if I\u2019ve vaped so much more on 3mg that the actual levels are similar, but it\u2019s coming down a little now. And partly that\u2019s due to finding lots of really good flavours in the last few months.And new flavours are great. Over time I realised that not only did smoking cause people to move away from the tobacco smell. But as I got older and had more and more parents as friends and colleagues, I understood why some of them weren\u2019t keen on having their children near someone who smoked. I obviously didn\u2019t smoke indoors, or near anyone when outside. But the smell and after-effects of tobacco linger so long\u2026By contrast, some of my family actually lean forwards or comment on how nice some of the vaping liquids smell. I\u2019m a big fan of I VG, for example, who seem to always have refreshing fruit flavours. Like Blackberg (blackcurrant and blueberries), Blue Raspberry (raspberry,blueberry and mint), and the sadly discontinued Pineapple Blast (pineapple and menthol). Or Nasty Juice, whose Fat Boy Green Mango liquid is perfect with some craft ale. And I\u2019ve recently discovered Zap Juice and their lychee and lemonade flavour, which is lovely, too.As with vape kits and batteries, by buying from reputable companies and shops, I know that the products are compliant with the new Tobacco Products Directive laws. Which including testing all eliquids for sale in the UK.And for the last 12 months, there hasn\u2019t been any need to leave the house at midnight just to find a petrol station still open and buy cigarettes. Or spending an hour trying to find a lighter.Will I Ever Smoke\u00a0Again?Short answer\u200a\u2014\u200aNo!Even now, I occasionally get a psychological craving if I\u2019m watching television or a film in which people are constantly smoking. But it lasts a few seconds at most, and vaping relieves that urge immediately. When I can\u2019t vape because I\u2019m stuck inside somewhere, or for other reasons, I\u2019ll stick to some of the nicotine mini-lozenges if I really have to. Or just wait, because my nicotine cravings are much less than they used to be, after moving down eqliquid strengths.Are there downsides to\u00a0vaping?It\u2019s still not healthy to be inhaling nicotine, and vaping a lot can lead to a dry mouth and throat. Neither of which is great, but it does encourage drinking more water as a result.And you do get people who either complain about you vaping in the open air (I don\u2019t vape indoors around anyone). Or those who insist that having given up smoking, you should now immediately give up vaping. I understand where they\u2019re coming from, but there\u2019s no point in rushing to give up everything and relapsing straight away.The only other downside to vaping is the constant amount of misinformation, often coming from the tobacco industry and studies they have sometimes covertly funded. And the fact it\u2019s mispreported at face value in the media. 5 minutes checking the provenance and actual details of each study, and you find that there\u2019s no evidence of any major health risk, no equivalence to smoking, and no proof that vaping has encouraged any significant number of people to start using a nicotine product if they didn\u2019t already smoke.There\u2019s a hashtag on Instagram, #vapingsavedmylife. And while I wouldn\u2019t quite go that far, it\u2019s certainly improved it a hell of a lot, as well as saved me time and money.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "31 Observations from RGV\u2019s 123\u2013115 Win Over Texas\u200a\u2014\u200aOR\u200a\u2014\u200aHooray!

D-League Season is Finally\u00a0Here!Chris ReichertBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 19, 2010In honor of Richard Roby\u2019s game-high 31 points, I\u2019m providing 31 observations/facts/random tidbits of meaninglessness from watching the Rio Grande Valley Vipers defeat the Texas Legends 123\u2013115 in the 2010\u201311 D-League season opener last night on Versus.Check out the highlights in the video below and then read on for my scattered thoughts:1. Houston Rockets assignee Patrick Patterson scored just 7 points on 2\u20136 shooting from the field with 9 rebounds in 22 minutes.2. In fact, the most interesting aspect of Patterson\u2019s D-League debut was when he \u201cfouled out.\u201d This happened at the 6:11 mark in the 4th quarter. The Versus announce, the online box score, and the Cover-It-Live chat that the NBADLeague.com was running last night all said it was his sixth foul. So you can imagine how surprised/confused I was to see him back on the court coming out of a commercial with a little over two minutes remaining. Either A, the D-League instituted a little-publicized rule that assigned players are exempt from foul limits or B (and probably more likely), one of his fouls was later credited to another Vipers player. Either way, someone should have communicated the discrepancy because, with Twitter as my witness, I wasn\u2019t the only person watching who was dumbfounded by that unusual turn of events.3. Mustafa Shakur should will be back in the NBA at some point this season. His stat line was not overly impressive: 14 points on 4\u201312 sshooting, 6 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 turnovers. But he demonstrated a killer crossover move on multiple occasions that allowed him to either get to the rim or create open shots for teammates.4. Judging by the mascot, a Legend = a Cowboy in Texas.5. Jordan Eglseder received a DNP\u200a\u2014\u200aCoach\u2019s Decision. Somewhere a D-League blogger wonders what could have been.6. The Texas Legends\u2019 box score lists 15 players. The league limit is 10\u200a\u2014\u200anot counting assigned players, of which the Legends have none.7. So much for being the oldest player in the league. Antonio Daniels logged a game-high 42+ minutes for the Legends. He scored 19 points on 5\u201312 shooting, grabbed 7 rebounds, had 7 assists and committed 4 turnovers.8. Daniels also did not get special treatment from the officials, earning the game\u2019s lone technical foul.9. The Vipers connected on 11\u201325 (44 percent) from 3-point range, including 5\u20137 for Terrell Harris and 4\u20135 for Roby.10. Sean Williams was erratic at times, but made his presence felt defensively with 5 blocks.11. People on TV love to say the full name of sports leagues. From Gruden and Jaws on Monday Night Football saying \u201cNational Football League\u201d as opposed to simply \u201cNFL\u201d to NBA Development League President (see what I did there?) Dan Reed saying, \u201cNBA Development League\u201d repeatedly rather than D-League.12. Booker Woodfox isn\u2019t just one of the coolest names that never actually played in the D-League anymore. He scored 8 points in 14 minutes for Texas.13. \u201cEverything\u2019s Bigger in Texas\u201d apparently applies to scoring-based food giveaways too. The Vipers had to reach 120 for fans to earn free Tacos (and they did!) The D-League games I\u2019ve been to in Erie require the home team to net just 100 points to earn the fans free fries.14. Patrick Sullivan was the most effective Patrick for the Vipers. His plus/minus of +12 was tied with Roby for best on the team.15. Reece Gaines did not play like a former first-round draft pick: 6 fouls and 1 turnover in less than 14 minutes of action.16. Gaines also scored as many points (0) as Rashad McCants, who has not yet reported to the team.17. The Vipers out-rebounded the Legends 49\u201337, including a 17\u20139 advantage in offensive rebounding.18. Watching D-League games in HD is awesome. More, please.19. Justin Dentmon may have been the player of the game for Texas. He hit all 3 of his threes and 8\u201310 overall on his way to a team-high 21.20. Both teams had 7 players score in double figures.21. I like the new and improved D-League box scores/game story. Texas won the fast break points 12\u20139, but RGV won the battle in the paint 50\u201338.22, Mickell Gladness was the only player to record a double-digit rebounding performance. Of his 10 rebounds, 8 came on the offensive end.23. I really liked coach Nancy Lieberman\u2019s pregame message to the team. Sure she\u2019s 0\u20131, but congratulations to her for making history as the first women\u2019s coach in the D-League.24. According to David Hinojosa of rgvsports.com, former Vipers Antonio Anderson and Mike Harris could return to the team.25. The Vipers have players with the last names of Swann and Gladness: not exactly the most intimidating-sounding duo.26. Speaking of names, Sir Allen Conner has to be in the running for best names among referees.27. Legends first-round pick Matt Rogers was a late scratch for due to injury. I believe the quote that Lieberman offered was that his ankle/foot was as blue as the Legends\u2019 jerseys.28. Dar Tucker didn\u2019t get to do this, unfortunately. However, the former Los Angeles D-Fender turned Texas Legend did score 10 points on 3\u20134 shooting and grab 7 rebounds in just 17 minutes.29. I really like the NBA\u2019s \u201cHere\u2019s to a BIG Season\u201d commercial. I know it\u2019s been around for a while now, but the facial expressions get me every time.30. The Vipers are 1\u20130 and on pace for an undefeated season. The Legends are on pace to eclipse last year\u2019s expansion franchise Springfield Armor\u2019s D-League record-low 7 win season, but that\u2019ll change if they manage to win at least one of their next six games.31. For another perspective on the game, Voice of the Vipers Alex Del Barrio and Jonah Goldberg did a video recap.31 is a much bigger number than I thought. But here\u2019s to a great 2010\u201311 D-League season!And finally, a quick shout-out to all of my followers on Twitter (@DLeagueDigest) for helping me hit my goal of 500 by opening night tipoff.

Listen from the presenter about which screen to present and executes it.Entity: Contains plain model classes used by interactor.VIPER\u200a\u2014\u200aView-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-RouterVIPER ImplementationViper is a delegate driven architecture. So, most of the communication between different layers executes through delegation. One layer calls another through a protocol. Calling layer just calls a function from a protocol. Listening layer conforms to that protocol and implements the function.A naming convention is followed to name the protocols used for the communication between layers. Like \u2018viewToPresenterProtocol\u2019\u00a0. So, it is a \u2018protocol\u2019 which will be implemented by \u2018the presenter\u2019 to listen what the \u2018view\u2019 has to say.PresenterToViewProtocol\u00a0: Presenter calls, View listens. Presenter receives a reference from this protocol to access View. View conforms to the protocol.ViewToPresenterProtocol\u00a0: View calls, Presenter listens.InteractorToPresenterProtocol\u00a0: Interactor calls, Presenter listens.PresentorToInterectorProtocol\u00a0: Presenter calls, Interactor listens.PresenterToRouterProtocol\u00a0: Presenter calls, Router listens.App FlowView has a reference of \u2018 ViewToPresenterProtocol\u2019 to access the \u2018Presenter\u2019 and Presenter conforms to \u2018 PresenterToViewProtocol\u2019. In View\u2019s viewDidLoad() it calls the function updateView() of the protocol which is implement in Presenter that confirms to the protocol.// View var presenter: ViewToPresenterProtocol?override func viewDidLoad() {           super.viewDidLoad();           presenter?.viewDidLoad(tableView: tableView)           }Presenter conforms to \u2018 ViewToPresenterProtocol\u2019. So, it implements the function viewDidLoad(tableView: )var interector: PresentorToInterectorProtocol?func viewDidLoad(tableView:UITableView) {   interector?.fetchMovies();    }inside viewDidLoad() presenter tells the interactor to fetch some movies. Interactor conforms to \u2018PresentorToInterectorProtocol\u2019\u00a0. So it implements fetchMovies(). This function tries to make a network call and fetch movies data. It has a reference from \u2018InterectorToPresenterProtocol\u2019 to access back the \u2018Presenter\u2019.//Interactorvar presenter: InterectorToPresenterProtocol?if the network call successfully have fetched the movies data it calls the following functions.presenter?.loadMoviesFinished()and if it errors outpresenter?.loadMoviesFailed()Presenter also conforms to \u2018 InterectorToPresenterProtocol\u2019. So it implements loadMoviesFinished() and loadMoviesFailed() functions.//presenterfunc loadMoviesFinished() {        view?.showMovies()    }func loadMoviesFailed(){        view?.showError()    }View conforms to \u2018 PresenterToViewProtocol\u2019. Thus it implements showNews() and showError(). In these two functions view populate the view with the fetched data or the error.VIPER architecture using\u00a0RXSwiftRxSwift\u201cRxSwift is the reactive extension for Swift and can be found for free at https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift.\u201dRxSwift is based on reactive programming, so what does that mean?In computing, reactive programming is a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change. This means that it should be possible to express static or dynamic data flows with ease in the programming languages used, and that the underlying execution model will automatically propagate changes through the data flow. \u2014 WikipediaThere\u2019s a high probability that you didn\u2019t understand anything of this paragraph after reading it. May be it would be better to understand with the following example:Imagine you have three variables ( a,b,c ) like\u00a0:var a: Int = 1var b: Int = 2var c: Int = a + b // output 3 Now if we change a from 1 to 2 and we print c its value remains 3.But things are different in reactive world and c value\u2019s is depend on a and b it means if you change a from 1 to 2 c value is change from 3 to 4 automatically and its not necessary to change it yourself.Let\u2019s look at RxSwift basics:In RxSwift (and of course Rx ) world everything is stream of events ( including UI events\u00a0, network requests\u00a0,\u00a0\u2026). The main things in RxSwift are Observable and Observers.ObservableAn Observable is something which emits notifications of change.ObserverAn Observer is something which subscribes to an Observable, in order to be notified when it has changedIn Rx world for every observable in its persistent time it can emits 0 to\u00a0\u2026 number of events which these events are enum consist of there 3 probable values:.next(value: T)2.\u00a0.error(error: Error)3.\u00a0.completedIf we want to cancel a subscription and unsubscribe from an observable we can call dispose method or if you want this method called when your view deinits you should make variable with DisposeBag type and this variable do the work for you when your class deinitilized. I must say if you don\u2019t remember this your subscribers will make memory leak\u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udc80.Convert Protocol VIPER architecture to RXSwift\u00a0VIPERTo convert Protocol approach using RxSwift, the easiest way is to change Protocols to Observables the class having the reference of protocol can have a reference of Observable(that can be simple observable, Variable or any Subject) and the class that conforms to protocol can subscribe to the desired observable. We can name these observable references as per the naming convention of protocols. For example View has a reference of PublishSubject named \u2018ViewToPresenterProtocol\u2019 and presenter can subscribe to this observable at the time of initialisation.// Viewvar ViewToPresenterSubject: PublishSubject<UITableView?>?override func viewDidLoad() {           super.viewDidLoad();           ViewToPresenterSubject?.onNext(tableView)           }Presenter becomes the subscriber of this observable subject at the time of initialising the presenter.//Presenter func subscribeToVariable(_ subject: PublishSubject<UITableView?>) {    subject.subscribe(onNext: { (event) in                if event != nil {                    self.viewDidLoad(tableView: tableView)               },               onCompleted: {                   print(\"completed\")               })            .disposed(by: disposeBag)}Now Presenter is the subscriber of \u2018 ViewToPresenterSubject\u2019. So, it will call viewDidLoad(tableView: ) when subject fires the onNext event from viewDidLoad of View.In Rx approach Presenter will have \u2018PresentorToInterectorSubject\u2019 and it will fire onNext event from viewDidLoad function.//Presenter var PresentorToInterectorSubject: PublishSubject<Void>?func viewDidLoad(tableView:UITableView) {   PresentorToInterectorSubject?.onNext(());    }Interactor will subscribe to this Observer.//Interactorfunc subscribeToVariable(_ subject: PublishSubject<Void>) {    subject.subscribe(onNext: { (event) in                   self.fetchMovies()               onCompleted: {                   print(\"completed\")               })            .disposed(by: disposeBag)}inside viewDidLoad() when presenter calls onNext on PresentorToInterectorSubject, the onNext block in the subscription is called, which then call fetchMovies() function. As previously this function makes a network call and fetch movies data.Presenter also has a reference of \u2018InterectorToPresenterSubject\u2019//Interactorvar InterectorToPresenterSubject: PublishSubject<Void>?InterectorToPresenterSubject is again subscribed by the Presenter.//Presenterfunc subscribeToVariable(_ subject: PublishSubject<Void>) {    subject.subscribe(onNext: { (event) in                     self.loadMoviesFinished()               }),               onError: {                   self.loadMoviesFailed()               }),               onCompleted: {                   print(\"completed\")               })            .disposed(by: disposeBag)}if the network call successfully have fetched the movies data it calls onNext event on the subject.InterectorToPresenterSubject.onNext(())and if it errors outInterectorToPresenterSubject.onError(ToPresenterError.error)Error can be defined as an enum extending from Errorpublic enum ToPresenterError: Error {     case error}when \u2018InterectorToPresenterSubject.onError\u2019 is called the onError block in subscription is called, which is calling loadMoviesFailed() function.Finally Presenter has reference for PresenterToViewProtocol and View becomes subscriber for it.// View func subscribeToVariable(_ subject: PublishSubject<Void>) {    subject.subscribe(onNext: { (event) in                     self.reloadTableViewData()               }),               onError: {                   self.showError()               }),               onCompleted: {                   print(\"completed\")               })            .disposed(by: disposeBag)}OnError event is fired from loadMoviesFailed() function of Presenter and onNext is fired from loadMoviesFinished function of Presenter.func loadMoviesFinished() {    PresenterToViewSubject.onNext(())}func loadMoviesFailed() {    PresenterToViewSubject.onError(ToPresenterError.error)}In every subscription there is a disposed function as well, it will dispose of the subscription using a dispose bag, when the respective class is deinitilized the subscription is automatically disposed of. In this way subscriber will not leak memory.ConclusionJust like any other design pattern VIPER is self-explanatory. One needs to get one\u2019s hands dirty to understand the whole picture. My advice will be to first start with creating a very basic app with VIPER architecture, and then follow the steps explained above to convert the protocol implementation to RxSwift Observables.Happy coding\u00a0:)", "responses": "7"}, {"title": "Architecting Mobile Apps with (B)VIPER\u00a0Modules.", "author_name": "Nicola Zaghini", "link": "https://medium.com/mobile-travel-technologies/architecting-mobile-apps-with-b-viper-modules-e94e277c8d68?source=search_post", "post_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "140", "content": "Architecting Mobile Apps with (B)VIPER\u00a0Modules.A structured engineering approach for big mobile\u00a0apps.Nicola ZaghiniBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNov 25, 2015Ponte Vecchio (FI)\u200a\u2014\u200aPictures taken walking to #PragmaConf15 Venue in Florence\u200a\u2014\u200aXT1,\u00a023mmFor those of us out there since the first iOS SDK was released we have seen a big shift in application engineering. While in the past we were all quite happy with what today we joke as Massive View Controller, now we face problems that require more structured engineering.Irrespective of the technology decisions, what we should all try to achieve in a single word is: simplicity. Simplicity means that our codebase, which can be quite large, should be simple to communicate and maintain. Should also be simple to reuse, and should be simple to test, not just for the sake of code coverage, but for the confidence that as engineers we build bridges that won\u2019t collapse under our feet.In this post I will take you through a structured approach to mobile application engineering to achieve the simplicity mentioned above. This is not necessarily a new or \u201cone fits all\u201d way of doing things, but something that we have seen working quite well where I work at MTT, creating great apps for airlines and travel companies worldwide.We will together build on top of the VIPER Architecture in order to achieve a high order modularity by formalising the building blocks of the design, focusing on reuse and customization with an high degree of testability.What we are going to discuss here is tailored to iOS but can be successfully applied to Android and most likely other platforms.The blueprintIf you have ever built a complex application you know already that most of the time MVC pattern falls short, as it leads too easily to (let\u2019s abuse of this joke once again) Massive View Controllers; and you are already aware of some other interesting strategies on the subject tending towards something that helps us creating less Massive but more Lighter View Controllers.Without a properly designed and communicated approach, it is quite easy to fall back to the \u201cmassive something\u201d world.An effective and clearly communicated blueprint is strategic in the engineering business.Without it, it is quite common to end up with something that looks quite like the below\u00a0:-)https://twitter.com/jordimirobruix/status/652394048146276352/photo/1I will not dig into technology choices or chunks of code here, but instead I will focus on the blueprint and the relevant parts to successfully apply the design.Starting from VIPER ArchitectureVIPER from Mutual Mobile Engineering is a way of architecting applications which takes heavy inspiration from the Clean Architecture.The main idea of VIPER is to create a (mostly vertically) layered architecture where the Single Responsibility Principle is achieved by using several different components.Here is a standard representation of the different VIPER components and relationships between them:http://mutualmobile.github.io/blog/2013/12/04/viper-introduction/The acronym stands for:View: encapsulates the actual views, starting from view controllersInteractor: encapsulates all the business logic and datasource accessPresenter: encapsulates the presentation logicEntity: the object model manipulated by the InteractorRouting: or Wireframe encapsulates the navigation logicThe next logical step is to formalise this design into units of reusability. In this interesting issue of obcj.io there is an incipit on using VIPER to build Modules.We want to go deeper in the VIPER Module definition and make it the building block of the (B)VIPER approach.Toward a Standard\u00a0ModuleWhile the VIPER layering allows for great decoupling, the way Modules should be built and communicate is left to the designer.We can think of a Module as a unit of reusability that encapsulates a Use Case, or a Functionality, or one or more Stories. To start simple, just think of a Module as a single iPhone Screen; we can build from there.Let\u2019s start sketching with a 3 screens example Application: from an initial category selection to a list of items to a detailed view of the item.Step 1\u200a\u2014\u200aModule as a Black BoxThe Example Application made of 3 Modules linked to each\u00a0other.On the iOS platform the foundational building block of an iOS App is the UIViewController. The navigation happens from UIViewController to UIViewController.It is foolish to fight against the framework, so a Module should be presenting itself to the outside world as a standard UIViewController.From an external point of view each Module is a standard UIViewController.This allows the use of a Module into any iOS Application without any additional knowledge by the hosting application: a Module can be navigated from and navigate to something that has nothing to do with the current design.Step 2\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Wireframe roleWhen investigating the navigation between Modules, I want to stress that the Wireframe only business is to define the navigation to the next Module. Other approaches leave the business of Module creation to the Wireframe itself which violates the Single Responsibility Principle.The Wireframe only business is to navigate to the next Module(s).This of course implies some sort of knowledge of the next Module.Step 3\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Module BuilderTo better decouple Modules to each other and achieve a strong self containment, we introduce the Module Builder component to the standard VIPER set of components.The Module Builder is in charge of creating all the components of the Module (Presenter, View, Interactor,\u00a0\u2026) and make the connections. The Module Builder protocol usually presents a single methods like this:It is of course possible to have the UIViewController implement a protocol representing the Module external interface if needed.The Standard (B)VIPER\u00a0ModuleThis is a visual representation of a Standard (B)VIPER Module.Module as black box for the outside world, presenting itself as a standard UIViewController. This allows an easy re-use of a Module even within apps that have a complete different design.Design by Interface as default approach where each component exposes a contract. It allows an easy swap of concrete implementations thus behaviours, plus easy mocking for testing.Builder is the key for reusability, declares what data is needed for the Module to be built, inject all the needed components letting the implementations change easily. A Builder must know the next Module(s) Builder.Services as data sources. A Service provides a contract to the Interactor to consume in order to retrieve or create Entities. Services are horizontal to Modules avoiding code duplication. Examples are Weather Service or Stock Service; those are not part of any Module.Each Service should ideally live in its own Library.On the relationship between Presenter and\u00a0ViewFrom the standard VIPER definition:\u201cThe Presenter can only prepare the data for display in the View. [\u2026] The View is passive. It waits for the Presenter to give it content to display; it never asks the Presenter for data.\u201dIntroduction to VIPERLet\u2019s try to map this into some more canonical terms.VIPER promotes MVP pattern where the Presenter handles View interactions, delegating any business logic to the Interactor if needed (so Presenter cannot modify the Model ideally) then asking the View to update by preparing \u201cdata for display\u201d.We need to introduce the concept of the Presentation Model which is our \u201cdata for display\u201d. Ideally this model is UIKit agnostic as it exposes pure ready to display data in the form of String or Numbers: you can hypothetically share this code with other platforms with this approach.\u201cPresentation Model is of a fully self-contained class that represents all the data and behaviour of the UI [\u2026] Presentation Model will have data fields for all the dynamic information of the view. This won\u2019t just include the contents of controls, but also things like whether or not they are enabled.\u201dMartin Fowler Presentation Model.I\u2019ve intentionally omitted any form of \u201clogic\u201d within the Presentation Model because we want to achieve the following:The View informs the Presenter on user interactionsThe Presenter creates an immutable Presentation Model from Domain Model provided by the InteractorThe Presenter provides the View with the Presentation ModelHere is the visual representation:The Presentation Model Builder is extracted from the Presenter logic as it may get quite complicated when multiple Domain Models are needed to build a single Presentation Model. It also makes a lot more sense in terms of Single Responsibility.A reactive programming style could be achieved here as well.Dependency Injection for\u00a0BuildersThe Builder is in charge of building the Module it ships with. The best way of doing it is via dependency injection. Typhoon is probably the best DI Library for iOS available today.Without getting into too much detail here, the DI gives you the ability to describe declaratively what Concrete Implementation for each Protocol is needed and the scope.It is pretty much like playing LEGO\u00ae with the components building the Module. By injecting a custom component, changing the behaviour or the Visual Representation of the Module is easy.Testing the\u00a0ModuleIf you got this far you know that the main goal is to make testing easy. We can write isolation checks for each component of the Module easily by mocking the dependencies.Adopting the Presentation Model approach we also get a great level of confidence on what the User Interface is actually going to display, even without touching a single UIKit class.If you believe that your tests should actually cover the integration of your codebase from Network to User Interface, as this is what your user is actually going to experience, then you are not limited and I believe it is a nice addition on top of it.Dependency ManagementSuch architecture would be rather ridiculous without a proper way to manage dependencies like CocoaPods.As Modules are building blocks of Applications each Module should ideally live in its own Library, allowing the creation of Applications made of several Modules/Libraries. We are now playing LEGO\u00ae with different pieces: Modules rather than components within the Modules.ConclusionFirst of all, thanks a lot to Valentino, Claudio, Colin, Onur, Juzo and many other talented guys and girls at MTT for banging their heads with me on this!We started from the word \u201csimplicity\u201d. On a first glance this may not seem exactly simple, as we added extra component to the canonic VIPER design. As the blueprint should be quite clear at this stage it is up to you to decide if the number of components per Module is too high for your specific business. Maybe your business is better tailored for a MVVM design or even a plain MVC.Here at MTT we have the sort of challenges that makes the (B)VIPER architecture very useful, and the experience of presenting and applying such approach to teams usually goes from this on day 1:http://replygif.net/961To this on day 3 or 4:http://replygif.net/877Some of the best feedback I have received so far is:\u201cNow that I am familiar with it, I can jump through unknown Modules very quickly and I always know where to put my code\u201d and\u201cI can finally write tests easily and quickly, which it has always been a nightmare for me to do.\u201dFinal thanks to the guys at #PragmaConf15 Florence.

Since all our business logic has been dumped in the controller, at the end we see a huge and fat controller which becomes difficult to manage if our project is to be scalable. So these are the primary reasons why we need VIPER:To make the structure more modular.To build the application on the Single Responsibility Principle.To reduce the load and dependency on controllers.To build the app on basis of use cases or behaviour based.VIPER flowVIPER FlowAll the communications in the project are usually made using protocols and delegates.View\u200a\u2014\u200aPresenterView communicates with the Presenter regarding all the user interactions and asks the presenter to perform necessary handlings regarding the same.Presenter\u200a\u2014\u200aInteractorPresenter communicates with Interactor(The brain of the module) regarding user actions or data fetching actions.Interactor\u200a\u2014\u200aPresenterInteractor communicates with the presenter regarding the output of the business logic which has performed the necessary actions.Presenter\u200a\u2014\u200aViewPresenter communicates with the view to make the necessary UI changes with the results from the Interactor.Presenter\u200a\u2014\u200aRouterPresenter communicates to router regarding navigation between pages.This flow will be pretty more clear once we dig into some code.Sample Code (ViperDemo)We will be taking ViperDemo Project as an example.We will be preparing a small app which shows a fruit list that we will have in our diet plan along with the vitamins that they provide to us. Oh cool now it feels, we are going to do a nursery project. Ooof\u00a0\u2026reliefThe sample code has two modules: A FruitList and FruitDetail module.FruitList ModuleThe fruit list has the following parts in it:View\u200a\u2014\u200aFruit List page UIInteractor\u200a\u2014\u200aFruit List module\u2019s business logic and handlingsPresenter\u200a\u2014\u200aFruit List module\u2019s communication handler, we can tease the presenter like that as it handles all the communication.Entity\u200a\u2014\u200aModel class of our FruitsWireframe\u200a\u2014\u200aDon\u2019t get confused, that\u2019s our router.Okay so let us dig into the code: Let us start with the protocol file that has all our communication methods.The FruitListProtocols.swift contains all the related protocols and delegate methods that we will be using to communicate between our different handler files.Now, let us start a simple app flow with a detailed description of all the happenings one by one.App FlowOn the opening of the app, in the viewDidLoad() of the FruitListView, we ask the Wireframe to initialize all our related protocols starting from the ones present in the view and till the interactor. Then we notify our presenter using View -> Presenter about the loading of the FruitList page as:FruitListWireframe.createFruitListModule(fruitListRef: self)presenter?.viewDidLoad()The presenter then calls the interactor using Presenter -> Interactor delegate and informs it to fetch all fruits that will be in our diet plan:interactor?.getFruitList()The interactor, in turn, handles the data fetching mechanism, it can be anything like making the network request, database fetching operations, etc. Since we are determined not to make our simple project messy, we are using a small Common.swift class to get a small list of fruits.Common.generateDataList()The interactor after fetching our fruit list informs the presenter using the Interactor -> Presenter delegate.presenter?.fruitListDidFetch(fruitList: getAllFruitDetail())The presenter, in turn, informs the view about the completion of data fetching using the Presenter -> View delegate.view?.showFruits(with: fruitList)Now our view handles the displaying of our fruit list loading the tableView.Whoa!!! That was easy\u00a0\u2026.. Wait but we didn\u2019t see any router mechanism. Wait we will be seeing that soon.Click on any fruit and that will open up the fruit detail page with a beautiful image of your selected fruit. So how the mechanism is going on\u00a0??In our tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)\u00a0, we are handling the user selection. The view calls the presenter using the View -> Presenter delegate to handle user selection action.presenter?.showFruitSelection(with: fruitList[indexPath.row], from: self)The presenter, in turn, asks the wireframe/router to show up the FruitDetail page using the Presenter -> Wireframe delegate.wireframe?.pushToFruitDetail(with: fruit, from: view)The wireframe?.pushToFruitDetail(with: fruit, from: view) thus initializes the protocols used in the FruitDetail module by:func pushToFruitDetail(with fruit: Fruit,from view: UIViewController) {let fruitDetailViewController = view.storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"FruitDetailView\") as! FruitDetailViewFruitDetailWireFrame.createFruitDetailModule(with: fruitDetailViewController, and: fruit)view.navigationController?.pushViewController(fruitDetailViewController, animated: true)}I have created a separate module for FruitDetail in order to make us clear how we can manage multiple modules in our codeThat was a sweet travel along our small Diet plan. Looking back to our project structure, we can see that our project has become more modular and structured.VIPER sample on a real time app building environment.I have written down an application demonstrating more advanced usage of VIPER design pattern. I would love everyone to visit the repo and hop into ViperAdvanceDemo.Disadvantages of\u00a0VIPERDon\u2019t get away with the modularity of VIPER. There are many disadvantages of VIPER as well:We do have lots of code to write down.We have lots of files added to our project.Communication between different file handlers become difficult and needs to be planned before implementation.VIPER in small projects can be a killer, time consuming and bulgy.PresentationI have a small presentation prepared regarding the VIPER architecture which you would love to have a peek into VIPER Presentation.I would love to hear from\u00a0youYou can reach me for any query, feedback or just want to have a discussion by the following channels:Twitter\u200a\u2014\u200a@G_ABHISEKLinkedInStackOverflowGMailabhisekbunty94@gmail.comIn order to get connected instantlySkypeId\u200a\u2014\u200agabhisekbuntyPlease feel free to share with your fellow developers.", "responses": "12"}, {"title": "VIPER-Architecture for iOS project with simple demo\u00a0example.", "author_name": "Bipin Pandey", "link": "https://medium.com/cr8resume/viper-architecture-for-ios-project-with-simple-demo-example-7a07321dbd29?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jul 4, 2018", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "264", "content": "VIPER-Architecture for iOS project with simple demo\u00a0example.Bipin PandeyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 4, 2018While creating apps we may need to face the different Design Architectural Patterns depends upon the project type and behavior.We always need to figure out the best architecture depends upon the project requirements and it\u2019s behavior before initiating the project.

These architecture helps us to minimize code duplication, prevents high coupling and standardize a common way of writing code that provides a general solution for reoccurring situation while developing a software.So, What is VIPER architecture?VIPER is a backronym for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router.This architecture is based on Single Responsibility Principle which leads to a clean architecture.View: The responsibility of the view is to send the user actions to the presenter and shows whatever the presenter tells it.Interactor: This is the backbone of an application as it contains the business logic.Presenter: Its responsibility is to get the data from the interactor on user actions and after getting data from the interactor, it sends it to the view to show it. It also asks the router/wireframe for navigation.Entity: It contains basic model objects used by the Interactor.Router: It has all navigation logic for describing which screens are to be shown when. It is normally written as a wireframe.Building iOS application with VIPER architectureI have created a detailed sample app using VIPER architecture for iOS which you can download on Github. Let see the project structure for better understanding.After the completion of the project you will get the result like:Rest API used in the\u00a0projectREST APIs is often used in mobile applications, social networking Web sites, mashup tools, and automated business processes. The REST style emphasizes that interactions between clients and services is enhanced by having a limited number of operations. Using this link that are mentioned below we are trying to fetch the json data.Screen 1- Notice-Module: When you open the app you will get the notice list result containing notice-title, notice-brief, notice-filesource which is fetched using Alamofire using this notice-api.Notice-Module-API: https://api.myjson.com/bins/1bsqcn/Screen 2- Movie-Module: If you click any of the item of the table list you will push to another movie-view-controller which contains image, title and brief which is fetched using Alamofire using this movie-api.Movie-Module-API: https://api.myjson.com/bins/1h87n6Podfile:In the podfile we have included the Alamofire to call rest apis, AlamofireImage to load images in the tableView and AlamofireObjectMapper to map the model or entity.AppConstants.swiftNoticeModel.swiftEntity layer provides a model which interactor use to create objects from the fetched data. The Entity is probably the simplest element inside a VIPER structure. One important thing to notice is that the Entity is different from the Data Access Layer, which should be handled by the Interactor. Here, we use object mapper to map the response JSON object and the MODEL object.NoticeProtocol.swiftWe use protocols to define the methods that a module component can call from other components on the same module. Simply we can say, protocols are use to communicate between the different layers\u00a0.NoticePresenter.swiftNoticeInteractor.swiftInteractor is the main integral section where all the business login resides. We create a instance of InteractorToPresenterProtocol to send the success or error response came through the APIs to Presenter.NoticeViewController.swiftNoticeViewController only shows the data in the tableView that came through the APIs response. Here we implement the PresenterToViewProtocol as extension to receive the data came through the presenter. And we create the instance of presenter:ViewToPresenterProtocol for network APIs calls.NoticeRouter.SwiftRouter layer is responsible for wireframing of the application like changing between the different screens. In this project routing happen when the app first time launches. So inside AppDelegate\u2019s \u2018didFinishLaunchingWithOptions router\u2019s createModule() function is called which returns a module. UIWindow class then show the view of that module.AppDelegate.swiftIn AppDelegate, we just create the instance of UINavigationViewController by passing the NoticeViewController instance and set this UINavigationView Controller as the root view controller.Please clone or download the whole project from GITHUB.

Following a Design Pattern while developing a software is very important (When I say this, believe me, I have met some who don\u2019t even know what is Design Pattern but have their apps in App Store. \ud83d\ude36) as it\u2019s not only just a folder structure but much more than that\u2026. To me, when you say you followed a particular architecture you should know at least a few things:You need to know how to define and divide each feature/functionality as a responsibility and assign these tasks to different parts(classes).Stay aware of the proper communication flow between the classes you implement.The code that you write after minutes or hours of thinking is maintainable and can be enhanced by any other \u2018person\u2019 (Here the \u2018person\u2019 is also a Software Developer).Being an iOS Developer by profession, I tried out a very recent and famous architecture- VIPER.VIPER, a design pattern used worldwide today, is one of the cleanest architecture you can refer to while working on a big project. Viper is a protocol-oriented programming along with a modular approach. All the modules are divided into 5 different parts(rather classes) and each has their responsibility. The classes are bound to perform only a particular task and pass on the desired outcome to other (if required).The 5 different parts or classes in which you break down a module are:View- View contains all your UI elements. Whenever a user interaction occurs, View has the responsibility to pass the information to Presenter.Interactor- The Interactor is the brain of the module. It contains different business logic and uses case implementations.Presenter- The presenter passes on the obtained data from View to Interactor for further processing as per business logic. After further processing, the Interactor passes the data to Presenter and then View to update UI. The presenter also interacts with Router to perform navigation.Entity- Entity are the Data Models which have the natural tendency to be processed and updated as per the app flow. It\u2019s actually the combined effect of the Data Model and View that is visible to the user as UI.Router- The Router is responsible for all navigation-related tasks and passes on any data if required.This breakdown of responsibilities is called Single Responsibility Principle. Because of this, its very easy to write test cases, unlike others architectures which contain everything like business logic, UI handling, navigation etc. in the same class.The Communication FlowThe VIPER Flow(Single Responisibility Principle)In the above image you can see Interactor communicates with two other types of ClassesAPI Data ManagerLocal Data ManagerThese are not other components, but helper methods of Interactor just to segregate the responsibilities more like API Data Manager for making API calls and Local Data Manager for handling data persistence.Now by looking at the diagram you are pretty much clear about the flow. If not, let me clear it by an example. Suppose you are on the login screen. And after login is completed you have to show dashboard. So, for that, the flow would be something like this:Login API Call flow\u00a0diagramI think the flow diagram is pretty much clear in terms of its purpose(If you still have any doubts, please reach out in Comments section and I will be at your service\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42).The VIPER Structure.When I started writing this blog my main concern was to focus on the structure that I am following now(just curious to know whether what I am doing is good or not\u2026 with ready to accept any suggestion attitude\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e).I have uploaded a simple application in Viper architecture. The application demonstrates a Login Screen, Side Menu, Dashboard and Logout functionality.

Speziell am VPN-Angebot von Golden Frog ist, dass in dem VPN-Offerte gleichzeitig auch ein DNS-Service enthalten ist: VyprDNS. DNS-Server sind daf\u00fcr zust\u00e4ndig, Hostnamen (wie z.B. www.vpnvergleich.net) in eine f\u00fcr den Computer lesbare IP-Adresse zu \u00fcbersetzen.Die Firmen, die mit VyprVPN assoziiert sind, sind seit mehr als drei\u00dfig Jahren in der Entwicklung fortschrittlichster Verschl\u00fcsselungstechniken und damit zugeh\u00f6render Services t\u00e4tig. Demzufolge innovativ sind auch die Features von VyprVPN ausgefallen. Kunden von VyprVPN erhalten zus\u00e4tzlich einen inkludierten sicheren und anonyme DNS Server und ein selbstentwickeltes VPN Protokoll \u201eChameleon\u201c mit einer 256-Bit Verschl\u00fcsselung. Dies z\u00e4hlt zu den gegenw\u00e4rtigsten, flottesten und gesch\u00fctztesten Methoden bei der VPN-Daten\u00fcbertragung heute weltweit.Unsere Erfahrungen zeigen, dass der VPN Client von VyprVPN ist sehr einfach und \u00fcbersichtlich gehalten. Neben dem gro\u00dfen Knopf im oberen Bereich der Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che kann man das Land w\u00e4hlen, aus dem man eine IP Adresse ben\u00f6tigt um z. b. Videostreaming anzusehen per Netflix. Im Vergleich zu anderen VPN Providern hat VyprVPN einen leicht verst\u00e4ndlichen, aufger\u00e4umten und professionellen VPN Client, der alles bietet was man im Normalfall braucht.Golden Frog betreibt \u00fcber 700 Server in 40 verschiedenen L\u00e4ndern, womit der Anbieter seinen Klienten mehr als 200.000 IP-Adressen zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen kann. Features wie den regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Wechsel der IP Adresse bietet VyprVPN aber derzeit noch nicht.Golden Frog speichert generell keinerlei Informationen \u00fcber User-Aktivit\u00e4ten und den Traffic seiner Kunden auf seinen Servern\u200a\u2014\u200aes sei denn, dies wird vom Kunden zu Support-Zwecken gew\u00fcnscht. Erfahrungsgem\u00e4\u00df stehen leider bei VyprVPN keine anonymen Zahlungsmethoden zur Wahl\u200a\u2014\u200abezahlt werden kann lediglich via PayPal und mit Kreditkarte (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express).Die Bandbreite wird vom Anbieter nicht beschr\u00e4nkt. Die tats\u00e4chliche, vom Kunden erlebte Schnelligkeit h\u00e4ngt von diversen Bedingungen ab. Hierzu z\u00e4hlen beispielswiese die Bandbreite der eigenen Internetverbindung. Auch P2P und Filesharing ist auf den Servern des Anbieters gestattet. Laut Tests und Erfahrungen kann VyprVPN derzeit mit Windows, Mac, iOS und Android verwendet werden. Es darf zun\u00e4chst 3 Tage kostenlos getestet werden es gibt eine Geld-Zur\u00fcck-Garantie f\u00fcr 30 Tage.RELATED ARTIKEL\u00a0: VyprVPN Erfahrungen", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Bola straten\u00e1, ale na\u0161iel\u00a0ju", "author_name": "Krist\u00edna Uebersax", "link": "https://medium.com/@kristnarimkov/bola-straten%C3%A1-no-na%C5%A1iel-ju-d67aaf3a5956?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 21, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "1", "content": "Bola straten\u00e1, ale na\u0161iel\u00a0juKrist\u00edna UebersaxBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 21, 2017Kr\u00e1\u010dala \u017eivotom sama, ponoren\u00e1 v tme. \u013dudia ju prehliadali, akoby ani neexistovala.

This might be a bit confusing or even appear mystical, technically-infeasible. For some clarity, here\u2019s a mini-story that illustrates the basic principle of zkSnarks.Double TroubleOur story begins with a parrot and a viper, who have an affectionate yet mischievous relationship. The two friends are prowling the jungle in search of a tropical\u00a0treat.Shortly after setting off, they come upon a tree bearing two mangoes. Upon inspection, the viper remarks excitedly that the mangoes are (miraculously) identical! The parrot disagrees and insists that there is indeed a difference.There\u2019s good reason for this dispute: while snakes are color-blind, parrots have superb vision. And so, the parrot, unlike the viper, recognizes a subtle difference in color between the two mangoes. The parrot proposes a game to prove she is right but desires to do so without revealing how the two mangoes are different. The viper reluctantly agrees and the game begins.Each round, the viper hides both mangoes from the parrot and chooses one mango to reveal. The parrot then decides if the revealed mango is the same as in the previous round. After many rounds have passed, the parrot boasts a perfect score; she\u2019s guessed correctly every round.Illustrations by Lea\u00a0Filipo.With each successive round, it becomes increasingly likely that the two fruit are different. How else could the parrot guess correctly every time? Faced with the parrot\u2019s success, the viper has no choice but to concede that the two mangoes are indeed different. You can think of the parrot as the prover and the viper as the verifier.This\u200a\u2014\u200aadmittedly strange\u200a\u2014\u200atale illustrates the \u2018zero-knowledge\u2019 or zk property of zkSnarks. During the above interaction, the parrot convinces the viper that a certain statement is true (that the two mangoes are different) without revealing why it\u2019s true (because they are different colors). This framing should look familiar to the definition that we laid out at the beginning of the article.Take the core concept of this story, add a dash of cryptography, toss it in the world of blockchain, and you\u2019ll end up with a rough but palatable approximation of zkSnarks.Now that we have a sense of how zkSnarks work, let\u2019s have a look at what they can do.Taking the\u00a0PlungeBefore we talk about how zkSnarks could help scale Ethereum by a \u201chuge amount,\u201d there\u2019s another use case that\u2019s worth mentioning: privacy. Crypto projects like Zcash use them as a way to maintain a publicly-verified ledger while shielding participant identification and keeping transaction data anonymous.How does it work? Think back to the parrot\u2019s game. But instead of mischief and mangoes, think in terms of tokens and transfers. Simply put, someone can prove ownership of a token and send it to someone else without revealing the value of the token or the identity of the recipient. Again this framing should look familiar.ScalabilityPrivacy is undoubtedly cool. But developers soon realized that zkSnarks could also alleviate Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues. ZkSnarks could be leveraged to generate small and tidy computational proofs\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if the computation in question was executed off-chain, that is, untethered to the Ethereum network.ZkSnark proofs can be generated off-chain and then verified on-chain, and the process of verifying one of these proofs is cheaper and faster than having to execute the computation directly on the Ethereum network. In this way, the computational heavy lifting can essentially be offloaded to off-chain computational resources and thereby free up (more finite) on-chain resources.In other words, this process essentially shrinks the amount of on-chain resources needed for each computation. And if each computation consumes fewer resources, the Ethereum network can process more of them. The end result? More scalability.Crucially, zkSnarks maintains the security guarantees of on-chain computations. That is, you can still prove that you ran your program or executed a certain smart contract in a trustless manner.Vitalik Buterin preaching the gospel of zkSnarks.As Buterin mentions in this Tweet, a zkSnark is considered a \u2018layer 2\u2019 solution, which means that it could be implemented without altering the blockchain itself. But, unlike other \u2018layer 2\u2019 solutions, such as Plasma or Raiden, zkSnarks doesn\u2019t require data to be held off-chain. (For the curious, a \u2018layer 1\u2019 solution, like sharding, directly alters the functionality of the base-layer blockchain.)The Road\u00a0AheadzkSnarks isn\u2019t a silver bullet. It won\u2019t vanquish Ethereum\u2019s scalability limitations overnight. And it still faces significant technical hurdles. While clever solutions are already in the works (e.g. this one), the true promise of zkSnarks is patiently awaiting real-world deployment and implementation.Despite its nascent form, the technology represents a promising route toward a more functional Ethereum network. Vitalik Buterin estimated that zkSnarks could bring the Ethereum network throughput from 15 to 500 transactions per second\u200a\u2014\u200aan increase of over 30x. While this is surely a tall claim, Buterin isn\u2019t known to be the hyperbolic type. And if he\u2019s right, headlines decrying Ethereum\u2019s inability to process CryptoKitty transactions could be (god-willing) a thing of the past.", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "Clean architecture en iOS:\u00a0VIPER", "author_name": "Alfonso Miranda Castro", "link": "https://medium.com/build-and-run/clean-architecture-en-ios-viper-893c8c3a75a4?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jan 20, 2017", "readtime": "9 min read", "upvotes": "172", "content": "Clean architecture en iOS:\u00a0VIPERAlfonso Miranda CastroBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJan 20, 2017En los \u00faltimos tiempos est\u00e1 muy de moda en el mundo del software la filosof\u00eda \u201cclean\u201d, hacer de la construcci\u00f3n de software un arte, y que estemos orgullosos del c\u00f3digo que escribimos.Seguramente el mayor defensor de esta filosof\u00eda, o al menos el que m\u00e1s ha escrito al respecto sea Robert C. Martin, m\u00e1s conocido como Uncle Bob, y en este texto me basar\u00e9 en mucho de lo que \u00e9l ha escrito y contado. Tambi\u00e9n hay que hacer alguna referencia a otros autores, como el conocido Gangs of four, los cuales escribieron mucho sobre patrones de dise\u00f1o o Martin Fawler, el cual colabor\u00f3 con Robert C. Martin en la definici\u00f3n de SOLID (que veremos m\u00e1s adelante) y escribi\u00f3 un libro imprescindible llamado Refactoring.Clean architecture.Robert C. Martin fue el que defini\u00f3 esta arquitectura all\u00e1 por el a\u00f1o 2012 en su web. Exist\u00edan entonces, y siguen existiendo, muchas arquitecturas definidas que intentan solucionar los mismos problemas:Independiente de frameworks. Debemos hacer la arquitectura independiente de cualquier librer\u00eda que usemos en el desarrollo, y que no nos aten a sus requisitos, us\u00e1ndolas como lo que son, herramientas para conseguir un fin concreto.Testeable. La l\u00f3gica de negocio se deber\u00eda poder testear sin necesidad de la interfaz de usuario (UI), base de datos, servidor web u otras herramientas externas, y de esta forma eliminar elementos que son m\u00e1s complicados de probar.Independiente de la UI. Como la interfaz de usuario suele ser el elemento que m\u00e1s expuesto est\u00e1 al cambio debemos asegurarnos que no afecten al resto del desarrollo. De esta forma, adem\u00e1s, se podr\u00e1 usar un mismo c\u00f3digo para diferentes interfaces solo cambiando la capa de UI.Independiente de la base de datos. De forma similar al punto anterior, al ser la arquitectura independiente de la base de datos, o m\u00e1s gen\u00e9ricamente, de la fuente de datos, podemos hacer cambios en esta parte sin que afecte a la l\u00f3gica de negocio, teniendo la posibilidad de cambiar una api por un webservice, una base de datos por una api, o cualquier combinaci\u00f3n que se nos ocurra.Independiente de factores externos. Como resumen al resto de puntos, la l\u00f3gica de negocio debe ser ajena a todo lo que venga del mundo exterior, pudiendo cambiar el resto de piezas sin que le afecte, como si de un puzzle se tratara.Como hemos comentado, las arquitecturas existententes solucionaban la mayor\u00eda de estos puntos y todas separaban la arquitectura en capas para diferenciar los diferentes conceptos, pero algunas estaban m\u00e1s enfocadas a la interfaz y otras a la l\u00f3gica de negocio.En el caso concreto de iOS, la m\u00e1s usada era (y es) MVC, aunque habitualmente esas siglas perd\u00edan su significado de \u201cModel View Controller\u201d, para pasar a ser \u201cMassive View Controller\u201d, al terminar siendo cualquier clase u objeto una vista, modelo y controlador a la vez, terminando por desvirtualizar e incluso elimininar la arquitectura.The Clean Architecture, by Uncle\u00a0BobEn este diagrama se intent\u00f3 unificar todas estas ideas en una sola, que fuera entendible y que cumpliera una serie de reglas.Reglas de dependencia.Los diferentes c\u00edrculos representan diferentes capas del software. En general, cuanto mas nos alejemos del n\u00facleo mayor es el nivel del software y m\u00e1s unido al framework est\u00e1. Los c\u00edrculos exteriores son mecanismos mientras que los interiores son pol\u00edticas. La regla primordial que hace que esta arquitectura funcione es la regla de dependencia. Esta regla dice que las dependencias a nivel de c\u00f3digo fuente s\u00f3lo pueden apuntar hacia dentro. Nada que se encuentre en un circulo interior puede saber algo sobre lo que hay en un c\u00edrculo exterior, es decir, algo declarado en un c\u00edrculo externo no puede ser mencionado desde el c\u00f3digo situado en un c\u00edrculo interno. Eso incluye funciones, clases, variables o cualquier otra entidad software. Por la misma raz\u00f3n, los formatos de datos usados en un c\u00edrculo exterior no deber\u00edan usarse por un c\u00edrculo interior, especialmente si esos formatos son generados por alg\u00fan framework en un c\u00edrculo situado al exterior. No queremos que nada de un c\u00edrculo exterior impacte en los c\u00edrculos o niveles interiores.EntitiesLas entidades son usadas por la l\u00f3gica de negocio de la aplicaci\u00f3n, por los llamados interactors. Deben ser objetos que solo dependan de esta capa y que no deben ser usados por las capas superiores, teniendo \u00e9stas que funcionar con objetos m\u00e1s simples (diccionarios, arrays, struts,\u00a0\u2026) o con par\u00e1metros de una funci\u00f3n.User CasesEn esta capa, tambi\u00e9n llamada Interactor, se tienen los casos de uso, lo cual tienen que ser independiente de la fuente de datos o de la visualizaci\u00f3n de los mismos. Si cambia los datos no debe influir en estos casos de uso, al igual que si la apariencia de nuestro desarrollo cambia. Es donde tendremos la l\u00f3gica de negocio en nuestra aplicaci\u00f3nInterface adaptersO tambi\u00e9n llamados Presenters, es la capa que comunica los resultados de los casos de uso con la capa m\u00e1s externa. Esta capa recoger\u00e1 los datos del interactor que a su vez los habr\u00e1 procesado de la fuente de datos, y los formatear\u00e1 para ser presentado en la capa m\u00e1s externa, ya sea en una UI, en una base de datos o en alg\u00fan dispositivo.Frameworks y adaptersEs la capa m\u00e1s externa y la m\u00e1s pegada a la tecnolog\u00eda que estamos usando. En una web ser\u00eda el html/javascript, en una app iOS todo lo referente a UIKit. Esta capa es una de las que est\u00e1 m\u00e1s sujeta a cambios, y la que podemos hacer m\u00e1s intercambiable. Si nos enfocamos en iOS, solo (o casi) cambiando esta capa podremos adaptar nuestra aplicaci\u00f3n a iPhone, iPad o Apple TV.Cruzando los l\u00edmites, \u00bfc\u00f3mo y qu\u00e9 puede cruzarlos?La forma en la que debemos comunicarnos entre capa ser\u00eda a trav\u00e9s de interfaces, protocolos o delegados. Debe ser lo m\u00e1s polim\u00f3rfico posible y que no cause mucho da\u00f1o el cambio de una de las capas, siempre respetando la interfaz. Si jugamos con protocolos haremos estas comunicaciones totalmente independiente las unas de las otras, y ser\u00e1n piezas f\u00e1cilmente intercambiables. Desde la llegada de swift ha proliferado la llamada OPP (Programaci\u00f3n orientada a protocolos), la cual, entre otras muchas cosas, ayuda mucho a este cometido.SOLIDAntes de hablar de VIPER me gustar\u00eda comentar algo sobre SOLID. Para el que a\u00fan no lo conozca, SOLID es una serie de principios b\u00e1sicos definidos por varios autores para el desarrollo orientado a objetos, unificados en este acr\u00f3nimo inventado por nuestro Uncle Bob. Vamos a echarle un vistazo r\u00e1pido a cada uno de ellos.S: Single responsibility principle: Una clase deber\u00eda solo tener una responsabilidad, es decir, solo deber\u00eda de tener una raz\u00f3n para cambiar. Dicho de otra forma, cuando una clase o funci\u00f3n es usada para m\u00e1s de una cosa suele ser causa de estar haciendo algo mal. Esto parece algo muy l\u00f3gico y b\u00e1sico, pero muchas veces no se cumplen y terminamos haciendo peque\u00f1as tareas en funcionalidades ya existentes porque \u201cnos pilla m\u00e1s a mano\u201d, terminando por ser un problema a la larga cuando ese m\u00e9todo lo queramos usar en otro sitio, teniendo que recordar que tambi\u00e9n sirve para m\u00e1s cosas. Por ejemplo, si tenemos un m\u00e9todo que imprime un documento, y en alg\u00fan momento tambi\u00e9n a\u00f1adimos ah\u00ed que se guarde en disco, si en otro lugar queremos imprimir tendr\u00edamos el problema de que tambi\u00e9n har\u00e1 otras funciones no deseadas y que quiz\u00e1s ni recordemos que estaban ah\u00ed.O: Open/closed principle (Bertrand Meyer): Una clase deber\u00eda ser abierta por extensi\u00f3n, pero nunca por modificaci\u00f3n. Es decir, se puede heredar de esa clase, extenderla, pero nunca modificar su c\u00f3digo fuente para adaptarla a todos los casos. La forma m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de extender una clase es con herencia o interfaces (protocolos en nuestro caso). Este principio puede parecer f\u00e1cil pero no lo es tanto, ya que tenemos que tener bastante claro la definici\u00f3n de nuestro proyecto, y preveer que clases vamos a tener que extender, no siendo siempre posible y teniendo en alg\u00fan momento que necesitar refactorizar.L: Liskov substitution principle (Barbara Liskov): Los objetos de un programa deber\u00edan de ser sustituidos por una subclase o instancia sin modificar el comportamiento del programa. Es decir, una clase que herede de otra no tiene que modificar el comportamiento de la clase base de tal forma que al sustituirlo por ella el comportamiento sea diferente. La forma m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de ver si estamos cumpliendo esta regla es sustituir en nuestro c\u00f3digo la clase base por cualquiera de las subclases y ver si todo sigue funcionando igual.I: Interface segregation principle (Robert C. Martin): Muchos peque\u00f1os y espec\u00edficos interfaces son mejores que uno gen\u00e9rico. Esto evita el acoplamiento y fomenta la segregaci\u00f3n. Es parecido al primer principio pero orientado a interfaces, las cuales deben ser para un caso de uso concreto y no demasiado gen\u00e9rica. El objetivo de este principio es principalmente poder reaprovechar los interfaces en otras clases. Si tenemos un interface que compara y clona en el mismo interface, de manera m\u00e1s complicada se podr\u00e1 utilizar en una clase que solo debe comparar o en otra que solo debe clonar.D: Dependency inversion principle (Robert C. Martin): Se debe depender de abstracciones, no de concreciones. Esto fomenta el uso de interfaces y es algo que ya hemos hablado antes en clean arquitecture, que deber\u00eda ser la forma en la que se comunican las diferentes capas. De esta forma unas clases pueden interacturar con otras sin conocer toda su implementaci\u00f3n, usando, por ejemplo, inyecci\u00f3n de dependencias.VIPERVIPER no es m\u00e1s que una implementaci\u00f3n de esta arquitectura, orientada a un desarrollo iOS. VIPER es un conjunto de siglas que describen las diferentes capas, View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity y Routing.VIPERView: Capa que \u201cpinta\u201d lo que le mande el presenter y que, mediante los inputs del usuario le pregunta al presenter qu\u00e9 hacer. Esta capa tiene que ser totalmente pasiva, lo m\u00e1s \u201ctonta\u201d posible y tendr\u00e1 dos formas de reaccionar: a los inputs externos (touch de un usuario, por ejemplo) o a \u00f3rdenes del presenter.Interactor: Contiene la l\u00f3gica de negocio de un caso de uso. Aqu\u00ed se manipula las Entities (modelos) para una tarea espec\u00edfica. Como ya hemos dicho debe ser independiente de la interfaz gr\u00e1fica y debe modelar lo recibido de una fuente de datos. Al hacerlo independiente de la interfaz este c\u00f3digo deber\u00eda ser compatible para desarrollar, por ejemplo, para iOS y OSX sin ning\u00fan problema.Presenter: Contiene la l\u00f3gica que la vista tiene que presentar y reacciona a los inputs que desde la vista son mandadas. Esto quiere decir que le dir\u00e1 a la UI que tiene que pintar al recibir la informaci\u00f3n del Interactor y reaccionar\u00e1 a las acciones de la View (UI) para hacer una navegaci\u00f3n o pedir datos.Entity: Contiene el modelo de los objetos usados por el Interactor. Ser\u00e1, normalmente, un simple PONSO, o si estamos usando CoreData ser\u00e1n los NSManagedObjects generados.Routing: Contiene toda la navegaci\u00f3n de la app. Es quiz\u00e1s la m\u00e1s complicada de entender al estar acostumbrados hasta ahora a hacer toda la navegaci\u00f3n en los ViewController. Este Routing (tambi\u00e9n llamados Wireframe) son aprovechados para hacer la inyecci\u00f3n de dependencias a la hora de crear una nueva navegaci\u00f3n y presentar una nueva secci\u00f3n. Existen muchas formas de implementar esta parte y suele ser motivo de discusi\u00f3n de darle o no m\u00e1s responsabilidad. Lo importante es que en esta capa est\u00e9 concentrado toda la navegaci\u00f3n de la app.Esta separaci\u00f3n cumple la Single Responsibility Principle. El Interactor es responsable de la l\u00f3gica de negocio, el Presenter representa la interacci\u00f3n con el dise\u00f1o y la View es responsable del dise\u00f1o visual.Tambi\u00e9n es importante que cumpla la norma \u201cDependency segregation principle\u201d, ya que a la hora de conectar las diferentes capas deber\u00edamos hacerlo con interfaces, protocolos, y de esta forma depender de estas abstracciones y no de implementaciones concretas, pudiendo de esta forma cambiar la implementaci\u00f3n de una capa sin que afecte a otras.Los otros tres principios tambi\u00e9n deben ser cumplidos, en realidad cualquier arquitectura orientada a objetos deber\u00eda cumplir SOLID, y aunque no sea f\u00e1cil debemos obligarnos a ello.Si en alg\u00fan momento no estamos cumpliendo las diferentes buenas pr\u00e1cticas y normas no debemos tener miedo a refactorizar y siempre intentar mejorar el c\u00f3digo. Si no sab\u00e9is qu\u00e9 es la teor\u00eda de las ventanas rotas os invito a conocerla.Para terminar, os dejo un poco de documentaci\u00f3n y bibliograf\u00eda en la que me he apoyado y basado para escribir esto:Clean arquitecture: https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.htmlVIPER: https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/SOLID: https://www.genbetadev.com/paradigmas-de-programacion/solid-cinco-principios-basicos-de-diseno-de-clasesClean Arquitecture by Robert C.

No carro assim como em um software temos camadas de componentes que s\u00e3o separados por formas de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Um dos carros que mais me atrai \u00e9 um Locost Seven. Ele \u00e9 um carro de corrida inspirado no Lotus Seven e seu projeto \u00e9 aberto para constru\u00e7\u00e3o caseira (n\u00e3o que isso seja f\u00e1cil).Locost Seven\u200a\u2014\u200ahttp://www.cheapsportscar.netLogo de cara, a carca\u00e7a externa ou lataria pode ser considerada a tela do nosso sistema. No carro ela define um estilo e prop\u00f3sito, basta olhar o Locost e perceber que ele \u00e9 um carro de corrida com apelo vintage. No software essa parte \u00e9 representada pelas telas que podem transmitir a real inten\u00e7\u00e3o de cada parte do sistema.Por baixo da carca\u00e7a existe uma estrutura base, diferente e essencial para cada carro. Quando carro de corrida, necessita de uma estrutura forte para aguentar disputas, mas ao mesmo tempo leve para ter um bom desempenho. No caso do Locost, al\u00e9m de ter uma estrutura pensada para corridas, seu chassi interno pode ser amplamente modificado.O que mais atrai no projeto do Locost \u00e9 facilidade de modifica\u00e7\u00f5es. Por exemplo, a vers\u00e3o brasileira do Locost foi facilmente adaptada pra comportar um motor de Chevette e pe\u00e7as de Fusca. E isso s\u00f3 \u00e9 poss\u00edvel pois foi concebido tendo uma estrutura base que comporte modifica\u00e7\u00f5es. Um software tamb\u00e9m deveria ser assim. Ter uma estrutura que isole as camadas, facilitar\u00e1 a troca por exemplo do Parse, servi\u00e7o de push notifications que o Facebook matou, por Firebase.Instrumentos de um\u00a0carroAssim como num software, um carro \u00e9 repleto de instrumentos de a\u00e7\u00e3o (pedais, alavancas, bot\u00f5es, etc.). Tamb\u00e9m possui diversos mostradores que d\u00e3o um feedback do que est\u00e1 acontecendo no sistema. Essas s\u00e3o as camadas de intera\u00e7\u00e3o, que tamb\u00e9m devem ter seu devido isolamento, para que a substitui\u00e7\u00e3o dos componentes nessa camada sejam f\u00e1ceis e n\u00e3o afetem todo o sistema. A troca de um veloc\u00edmetro por outro n\u00e3o deve fazer o motor funcionar diferente, ou at\u00e9 mesmo parar de funcionar. E para proteger nossos sistemas das mudan\u00e7as de detalhes, existe a camada de Frameworks & Drivers.O motor \u00e9 o respons\u00e1vel por transformar um combust\u00edvel em energia mec\u00e2nica. No software isso ocorre quando o usu\u00e1rio preenche um formul\u00e1rio, e os dados preenchidos precisam ser convertidos numa estrutura que facilite intera\u00e7\u00f5es no sistema. Outro ponto de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 quando o aplicativo solicita dados de um banco de dados ou de um servi\u00e7o web e tamb\u00e9m transforma estes dados numa estrutura que fa\u00e7a sentido dentro do software. E a camada que realiza esse servi\u00e7o \u00e9 conhecida como Interface Adapters.A roda \u00e9 algo comum entre todos os carros. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel pegar a roda de um carro e encaixar em outro. E embora haja diferen\u00e7a entre algumas fura\u00e7\u00f5es, existem adaptadores para colocar uma roda de 5 furos num encaixe de 4 furos. Em um sistema teremos c\u00f3digos que podem ser reaproveitados em outros softwares e devem estar numa camada isolada chamada Entities.Usu\u00e1rio.Para o motorista, disponibilizamos tudo o que \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio para executar a principal intera\u00e7\u00e3o ou caso de uso, dirigir. E dirigir um carro possui estranhas semelhan\u00e7as com cadastrar um cliente. S\u00e3o semelhantes por envolverem um usu\u00e1rio, intera\u00e7\u00e3o com um sistema, processamento das informa\u00e7\u00f5es, valida\u00e7\u00e3o de regras (de neg\u00f3cio) e feedback do que est\u00e1 acontecendo. Os casos de uso de um sistema devem morar na camada Application Business Rules.Locost Seven \u00e9 um carro pronto para mudan\u00e7as e melhorias. Tem componentes isolados e com responsabilidades bem definidas. Assim tem que ser nosso Software, e \u00e9 por isso que devemos esquecer, pelo menos um pouco, o MVC.Tchau MVCMeados de 2014 eu comecei a estudar sobre desenvolvimento de aplicativos para iOS. Fazia parte do meu estudo baixar APPs de c\u00f3digo aberto e essas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es tinham sempre duas caracter\u00edsticas. Primeiro que era utilizado MVC e segundo que nunca possu\u00edam testes.Por utilizar o padr\u00e3o MVC, as vezes de forma errada, acabava-se criando arquivos enormes. Quando eu via que a classe herdava de UITableViewController eu tinha a certeza que estava na lama e tinha que aprender a nadar. Eram classes que exerciam muitas responsabilidades, desde gest\u00e3o das views at\u00e9 intera\u00e7\u00f5es nas camadas de persist\u00eancia.E a falta de testes era uma consequ\u00eancia do Massive View Controller. Ficava dif\u00edcil testar unitariamente uma classe gigantesca, pregada ao framework e \u00e0 camadas de persist\u00eancia.Os dias de MVC estavam contados. Metade de 2015 eu comecei a trabalhar na Meus Pedidos, e foi l\u00e1 que tive meu primeiro contato com a Clean Architecture. Confesso que minhas primeiras impress\u00f5es n\u00e3o foram das melhores. Mas conforme o tempo foi passando eu fui me interessando, compreendendo e vendo que o mundo poderia ser um lugar melhor. Chega de lama.Ent\u00e3o comecei a criar APPs para estudo me baseando na arquitetura que utiliz\u00e1vamos no projeto web da Meus Pedidos. Ao mesmo tempo, comecei a pesquisar sobre arquiteturas utilizadas no desenvolvimento de APPs. At\u00e9 encontrar a VIPER, que \u00e9 uma forma de aplicar as camadas propostas pela Clean Architecture no mundo mobile.Monster (Massive) View Controller e suas\u00a0tretasClean Architecture\u00c9 uma proposta de arquitetura de software criada por Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin). Inspirada em outras 5: Hexagonal Architecture, Onion Architecture, Screaming Architecture, DCI e BCE.A Clean Architecture divide nosso software em camadas. As camadas auxiliam a criar um software que esteja de acordo com os 5 princ\u00edpios do SOLID. E tamb\u00e9m existem para organizar os c\u00f3digos dos nossos APPs.As camadas da Clean ArchitectureCamadas propostas pela Clean ArchitectureFrameworks &\u00a0Drivers\u00c9 a camada mais externa, uma camada repleta de detalhes. S\u00e3o detalhes pois a altera\u00e7\u00e3o de suas partes n\u00e3o altera o comportamento do sistema. O aplicativo continua fazendo o que ele foi projetado para fazer, independente das escolhas feitas nessa camada.Interface AdaptersAqui \u00e9 onde moram os respons\u00e1veis por transformarem dados. \u00c9 a casa dos presenters, controllers, gateways e repositories. Os dados digitados num formul\u00e1rio, v\u00e3o ser recebidos nessa camada, convertidos em um Value Object, e passados para a camada seguinte.Motores realizam um trabalho extremamente semelhante. Atrav\u00e9s de mangueiras, recebem combust\u00edvel e transformam em energia mec\u00e2nica, que \u00e9 aplicada nas engrenagens que colocam o carro em movimento.Application Business\u00a0RulesNesta camada \u00e9 onde deve ficar as l\u00f3gicas e regras de neg\u00f3cio que dar\u00e3o vida ao nosso software. Dentro desse pacote, encontra-se os Use Cases ou Interactors, que s\u00e3o os detentores das regras de neg\u00f3cio.Enterprise Business\u00a0RulesAqui deve entrar c\u00f3digos de regra de neg\u00f3cio \u00e0 n\u00edvel de neg\u00f3cio. Esses c\u00f3digos devem estar prontos para o reaproveitamento. Uma regra para aplicar desconto sobre desconto se encaixa perfeitamente aqui. Pois ela pode ser reutilizada em diversos use cases/interactors.No mundo automobil\u00edstico quando giramos um volante sentido hor\u00e1rio o ve\u00edculo vai para a direita. Se viramos anti-hor\u00e1rio o ve\u00edculo vai para a esquerda. E isso n\u00e3o importa se voc\u00ea est\u00e1 dirigindo um carro de corrida, de passeio, caminh\u00e3o, \u00f4nibus\u2026 Se tiver volante, a regra ta valendo.VIPERDiagrama de como o viper interage entre as\u00a0camadasSendo o VIPER uma forma de usar a Clean Architecture, ele sugere como fazer as intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre as camadas propostas por Uncle Bob.

Assim como o Parse j\u00e1 morreu, qualquer outro servi\u00e7o pode morrer. E isso n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais uma dor de cabe\u00e7a. A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o desse servi\u00e7o vai estar numa camada isolada e f\u00e1cil de trocar.Testar fica prazeroso. Acabou a dor de saber como realizar setup de banco, View Controller, Storyboard e etc pra rodar testes unit\u00e1rios. Injete um gateway/repository que funciona com dados em mem\u00f3ria pro use case/interactor e um presenter fake que ta tudo resolvido.Agora o designer do time pode remodelar o sistema inteiro, pois mexendo nas telas, as regras de neg\u00f3cio continuar\u00e3o intactas.Migrar um banco de dados vai sempre doer. Mas aqui conseguimos diminuir um pouco da dor. Os locais \u00e0 serem alterados ap\u00f3s a migra\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o somente os repositories/gateways.

We have been able to make significant breakthroughs in interoperability (achieving new milestones in DEX infrastructure), launch the first POS +MN coin with segwit activated ( executing lightning swaps), first to deliver TPoS (a premiere and first of its kind offline staking solution), launched Stakenet.io cloud staking + masternode setup platform, work alongside industry leaders such as the Litecoin Foundation and much more.Always thinking forward, we make sure to position and engineer the network for success and are proud to present our vision & roadmap for 2019. Here is an overview of the general plan discussing some key milestones to look forward to in the year to come.2019 Stakenet DEX, MERLIN +\u00a0VIPEROur 2019 roadmap primarily has a focus on two main areas we call MERLIN and VIPER. DEX technologies, cross chain interoperability, and cross chain staking fall into MERLIN. A product line of custom XSN unique blockchain powered-hardware devices will make up VIPER. Below I will cover these 2 phases, how they will connect along with descriptions, goals and key milestones for each. Both phases will be worked on in parallel.MERLINIn the latter half of the year our team was able to make significant progress and breakthroughs in the field of interoperability. After publishing one of the first guides on how to execute cross chain atomic swaps over lightning we successfully organized and executed the first ever public push that guided over 100+ lightning swaps on main-net where everyday users exchanged LTC for XSN on lightning of both respective chains. This was an important step as it proved the infrastructure of our coming DEX + light wallet has baseline stability to further develop and complete our goals. Below we describe the key goals of MERLIN in the 2019 roadmap ahead.Key upcoming milestones MERLINEnable 1 click lightning swaps, allowing users to exchange assets instantly over Lightning with the click of a buttonAchieve frictionless interoperability, notably achieved by our pro trader DEX high volume exchange. Instantly trade assets as they are secured from our open source cold storage EXCALIBUR (HW that maintains, and manages users private keys)TPoS migration to masternode layer, + automated exchanging of assets through MN quorums. (enabling cross chain proof of stake (CCPoS) on the XSN network)Cross Chain DaPP infrastructure on MN networkVIPERWith the amount and variety of chains that exist supporting specialized 2nd/ 3rd layer technologies, support for databases + CPU to run these processes (I.e lightning hubs, masternodes etc) will come at ever increasing costs. This means larger and expensive devices are needed making it difficult to scale. With VIPER we aim to use the Stakenet blockchain itself to solve these problems with custom HW products offloading CPU and DB requirements into the XSN network. This will keep products small, affordable but powerful which will allow us to contribute unique value to the space.This technology of blockchain powered devices we believe will be at the forefront of both IOT and Web 3.0 in the near future. Offloading CPU, dB requirements successfully to a decentralized network alone has the potential to push major paradigm shifts in the general computer hardware/ tech space. As for our network, the resulting effect will be increased vehicles for MN nodes to collect fees (in XSN) for providing these services leading to increased use and demand of the Stakenet coin. Network economics will also strengthen on both first and second layers as added services will increase demand and fees through the entirety of the platform. Below are key milestones of VIPER to look forward to in the forthcoming year.Key upcoming milestones VIPERLaunch of our open source private key management and storage system (EXCALIBUR). Private key management will be audit-able by the public. We will utilize EXCALIBUR in all VIPER products making them safe, secure and trustlessLaunch initial HW versions (XSN VIPER): Early versions of the VIPER will integrate basic LN routing capabilities giving users ability to run LN hubs and generate fees for XSN, BTC and LTCActivate CPU offloading from XSN VIPER to Stakenet blockchainEnable multiple LN Hubs + MN\u2018s to be run on VIPER. Allowing users to safely execute higher level functions of various chains and coins from cold storagePutting a focus on hardware + 2nd layer software will build a strong foundation in building future applications in the areas of security, governance, (blockchain) software as a service, DAPPs, interoperable payment networks and more which we plan to also integrate into our platform and product lines moving forward.Another important point to mention is our 1st later protocol upgrades in the 2019 roadmap as well. We understand heavy disruption (specifically in 1st layer consensus) is coming, and are making sure the platform is positioned to quickly and easily adopt these new technologies when proven stable. Having a reliable and prime procedure for network upgrades big and small will be a constant focus during development (of MERLIN and VIPER), making sure to accommodate any unforeseen disruptive tech that comes.There are of course many other exciting developments in addition to the ones mentioned, keep track of fully detailed descriptions and realtime progress and updates of our roadmap hereJoin our discord to be a part of our community.

While most developers will stick to the tried and true MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM (Model-View-View Model), there is a clever pattern called VIPER that many do not know about. VIPER may change the way you\u2019re used to developing for the iOS platform, and like most things, it has positives and negatives.The Usual\u00a0SuspectWhen first starting with iOS development, developers will hear a lot about MVC or Model-View-Controller. This Apple approved architectural pattern appears everywhere including Apple\u2019s UIKit, most tutorial example apps, and a majority of the apps on the App Store today. Just like the name suggests, MVC is broken down into three responsibilities:Model: The application\u2019s data and logic that manipulates that data.View: The User Interface that the user manipulates.Controller: Controls the logic between the Model and the View.MVC will work just fine if you\u2019re working on your first app or working in a small team, but as the app grows, developers begin to jokingly refer to MVC as \u201cMassive-View-Controller.\u201d As time goes on more and more logic gets shoved into the Controller, and the Controller becomes more bloated and untestable. This is what the VIPER pattern tries to solve.What is\u00a0VIPER?The VIPER pattern is a Clean Architecture that conforms to the Single Responsibility Principle. VIPER strives to divide the app\u2019s logic into distinct layers of responsibility. Going a couple steps further than MVC, VIPER is broken down into five responsibilities:View: Displays information from the Presenter and sends user interactions back to the Presenter.Interactor: Retrieves Entities and contains the business logic for a particular use case. They are view agnostic and can be consumed by one or many Presenters.Presenter: Handles preparing content for the display and intercepting user interactions.Entity: Simple data model objects.Router: Handles navigation logic for which screens should appear and when.When implementing VIPER, each feature or module will follow the above structure. Since the app\u2019s logic will be separated into smaller components, the views now become lighter and the logic now becomes more testable.The Flow of\u00a0VIPERThe basic flow of VIPER is fairly straightforward. The user is brought to a new View by the Router, the View notifies the Presenter that it needs data, the Presenter asks the Interactor for data, the Interactor retrieves the Entities (from network request or local database), the Interactor sends the Entities to the Presenter, the Presenter creates View Models from the Entities, the Presenter sends the View Models to the View, and the View displays the necessary data to the user.Implementing VIPERTo demonstrate creating a module in the VIPER pattern, let\u2019s pretend we are creating an app that displays a table of cars. Each cell displays the car\u2019s make and model. The user will have the ability to tap on a cell and see the details of the car, or they can click on a \u201cCreate new car\u201d button to add a new car to the list. When implementing a new module, I find it easier to work bottom-up, so we will start with defining our Entities.EntitySince the app is dealing with cars, let\u2019s create a simple struct object that will hold some basic information: the car object.The car object is what our API service will return to us. It contains basic information like id, make, model, and trim of the car. However, when we want to display information about cars, we do not need to include all of their information since the table cells only need to display the make and model of the car. So, we can create a quick view model to represent just the make and the model of the car.This quick view model will be created in the Presenter and passed back to the View.InteractorNow that our Entities are established, let\u2019s create our business logic or \u201cuse cases\u201d for them. Our table view will need to be populated with cars from an API service. So we will create an Interactor that handles retrieving cars from the API and sending them to the Presenter.To do this, we declare a protocol method called getCars that will use our API service to get the cars and return them. Since our app is pretty simple, we do not need additional use cases (although most real applications have several use cases).PresenterWith the Interactor in place, we now have a way to retrieve cars that we will eventually display. As stated earlier, the Presenter is in charge of reacting to a user\u2019s input and preparing content for the display. Our app\u2019s description mentioned the need to display cars (make and model), the ability to show a car\u2019s details, and the ability to create and add a new car to the table. Next, we will create a Presenter that allows us to do just that.For our ability to show cars, we have added a showCars method that uses our previously created Interactor to retrieve the cars and then create simple View Models from those objects that will be used for specific types of cells within the View. The next two methods, showCarDetail and showCreateCarScreen, will use the Router (this will be created next) to navigate the user to the correct screen. These are three methods that our View will use to enable functionality.RouterWhat\u2019s an app without navigation? The next step will be to create a Router that handles navigating a user to different screens depending on the action. So far, our app requires us to navigate to a car detail screen and a create new car screen. Let\u2019s implement those two scenarios now.Our two methods showCarDetail and showCreateCarScreen simply instantiate new View Controllers and use a presenting View Controller\u2019s Navigation Controller to push them onto the view stack.ViewNow that we have a way to retrieve cars for display and several means for navigating the user to different screens, our next step is to create a View Controller that relies on the Presenter to handle its content and actions.The first thing we may notice is our View Controller is now extremely light. There is no logic done in our View Controller, just simply calls to the Presenter which delegates what should happen. No more Massive-View-Controller!Testing With\u00a0VIPERDue to the VIPER pattern\u2019s distinct layers of responsibility, unit testing can be accomplished very easily. Each level can be tested individually without the need to set up complex environments. To demonstrate this, we can test our CarPresenter. This Presenter handles loading car data, showing the car detail screen, and showing the create new car screen. Let\u2019s create some tests.Since we created our Router and Interactor methods with Protocols, we can easily mock those classes for testing purposes. The CarPresenter is then created using those test classes, and within the tests we can easily verify that our expected behavior is correct.The Benefits of\u00a0VIPERIn the seven months that I used the VIPER pattern, I identified some advantages:Ease of testing: Due to the loosely coupled nature of the VIPER pattern, adding unit tests to every object is simple compared to other patterns.Handles large teams: The project that I used VIPER on had roughly 15 developers. Because of the separation of modules within the pattern, developers can easily work on different parts of the app without stepping on each other\u2019s toes. Using VIPER also helps to reduce merge conflicts.Ease of development: Once the project is fully set up on VIPER, it becomes easier to add a new feature to a module. If you need a new way to sort something, you can add a new method in the Presenter. Developers can couple the VIPER pattern with Dependency Injection to add new features quickly and easily.The Negatives of\u00a0VIPERWhile the VIPER pattern might help eliminate Massive-View-Controllers, it does come at a price.Too much boilerplate code: As you can see in the examples above, a lot of template code needs to be created to create a simple application. This can slow down development in the beginning and add unneeded complexity. The increase of files can also add to the compile time.High learning curve: Due to the increase complexity of VIPER over MVC, the team might need more discussion and training on to properly implement the pattern across their application.Full buy-in: In my experience, the whole project needs to use the VIPER pattern. VIPER does not play nicely with Massive-View-Controllers, partially implemented VIPER modules, third party Cocoapods that do not use VIPER, and even Apple\u2019s own frameworks. When using VIPER with existing code or new frameworks, extra work is required to ensure code compatibility.ConclusionAlthough the world of iOS development is tightly coupled to MVC, the benefits of using the VIPER pattern in iOS development can be transformational for the right kinds of projects and teams. I\u2019d recommend evaluating the VIPER pattern for larger projects and teams who are looking to reduce conflicts, increase test coverage, and separate their code responsibility more cleanly.", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "Building Screen Flows with VIPER on\u00a0iOS", "author_name": "Nebs Petrovic", "link": "https://brigade.engineering/building-screen-flows-with-viper-on-ios-3459353d3a10?source=search_post", "post_date": "Mar 14, 2016", "readtime": "4 min read", "upvotes": "96", "content": "Image: Kevin\u00a0DooleyBuilding Screen Flows with VIPER on\u00a0iOSNebs PetrovicBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMar 14, 2016We use the VIPER architecture pattern in the Brigade iOS app. We\u2019ve had to build a few screen flows with VIPER so I thought I\u2019d share some of our learnings.We haven\u2019t found a one-size-fits-all design pattern so we\u2019ve identified three: Single-Module Flows, Multi-Module Flows, and Linked-List Flows.", "responses": "3"}, {"title": "Creating an iOS Viper Module\u200a\u2014\u200aStep by Step\u00a0Guide", "author_name": "Emre Erg\u00fcn", "link": "https://medium.com/trendyol-tech/creating-an-ios-viper-module-step-by-step-guide-cd1f414b7dd3?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 28, 2018", "readtime": "8 min read", "upvotes": "206", "content": "Creating an iOS Viper Module\u200a\u2014\u200aStep by Step\u00a0GuideEmre Erg\u00fcnBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 28, 2018What is VIPER\u00a0? What is VIPER Module\u00a0? How should a module be assembled?The BackstoryRecently, as iOS development team we have decided to migrate our project codebase from Objective-C to Swift, also we have discussed the use of a new architecture instead of keeping all stuff in MVC.So, open XCode, select file and new project, choose swift as development language and start over again, right\u00a0? \ud83e\udd14Nope, sometimes things are not so that easy. In fact, product managers would not be happy if whole team left new upcoming features as well as sprint goals to work on migration process. Therefore, we had to do both swift migration and common sprint jobs in parallel to make everyone happy. Apple call it Mix and Match, details can be viewed from link below,Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 4.1): Swift and Objective-C in the Same ProjectDescribes various aspects of Swift's compatibility with the Objective-C language and Cocoa/Cocoa Touch frameworks.developer.apple.comHowever this story is not about swift migration, also there are much better articles about it. If we focus on our decision about changing app architecture, what was the reason behind this\u00a0?Actually iOS project we have been working on was like a giant spaghetti in a pot that every developer add her/his own sauce to recipe for each new task.So, which features should a good architecture provide?Easily followable data flow.Each object has a clear role separated from others.Easy to test.Truth is, our iOS project is lack of these features clearly.Well, what are signs indicating there is a problem with app architecture\u00a0?Massive view controllers with thousands of lines of code.Getting lost while debugging.Increasing number of global variables all along the app.Nearly impossible to test.Not surprisingly, these signs were defining our project. So, we have started to search for different architecture patterns used in iOS, with considering their pros and cons. After lots of reading, we have set a meeting to discuss with each other and make a final decision. At the end of the meeting, everyone seems to be satisfied with an architecture named VIPER to be our next.What is VIPER\u00a0?Viper is an architecture that divides a feature implementation into five distinct layer in one module. Each character of VIPER represents a different layer;V: ViewI: InteractorP: PresenterE: EntityR: RouterEach layer has a distinct role in the module. In VIPER, I think implementing a feature like building a lego from different parts. Let\u2019s take a look at each layer,ViewView is a dummy object receiving touch events most of the time. Instead of MVC\u2019s massive view controller with thousands lines of codes, basically all service related codes and decision makings should not exist in it. For example, when a touch event was received from the user, view object should notify the presenter like \u201cMy dear presenter, a touch was received from user and I don\u2019t know what I should do with it\u201dPresenterI think presenter is the heart of the VIPER module. Only layer in the module that communicates with all other layers. Basically all decision makings should be handled in the presenter. After the decision, presenter has to communicate with the layer required. For example, after notified by view with touch event, presenter should decide what should be done next. Does screen need to update it\u2019s UI\u00a0? Then tell view layer to update UI with given info. Should a data be fetch from remove server\u00a0? Then tell interactor to fetch it. Similarly, does app need to navigate to other screen\u00a0? Then tell router to navigate which screen it is.InteractorInteractor contains business logic and it\u2019s mostly responsible from api calls. It builds request from parameters and creates objects by mapping response. After finishing service connection, it notifies presenter like \u201cHey presenter, these are puppies you are looking for\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am not able to fetch your needs at this moment\u201d. You get the idea.RouterYou need segue to another module\u00a0? Tell router which module it should be presented next and leave the rest to it. Router needs a UINavigationController instance to do such navigation stuff. Also I think that router should be responsible for showing alerts since UIAlertController is used with present method.EntityPlain data objects mainly driven by interactor. No more, no less.To summarize, what a VIPER module should look like, take a look at the figure below;Figure 1: Basic Viper Module\u00a0DiagramMeet the Best iOS Demo App\u00a0EverLet\u2019s convert something implemented in MVC to a viper module step by step. I created a very basic iOS app that consists of 3 screens which are Home, AddressList and AddressDetail. Home and AddressDetail are just dummy screens to provide integrity all around the app.For example, let\u2019s reimplement address list screen with VIPER. (Unit tests are skipped for now to make implementation short). Address list view controller simply presents addresses and if user clicks one of the addresses or add new address on the navigation bar, page navigates to address detail screen.Before start, take a look at the AddressViewControllerAs you can see, making service calls, presenting popups, triggering segues etc all are handled in view controller. It may seem not a problem in this case, however believe me view controller will be getting bigger and bigger in the real world scenario in a similar situation. So, let\u2019s implement it with VIPER.Viper Module ImplementationFirst thing first, we should create layers, like;AddressListView, aka AddressListViewControllerAddressListPresenterAddressListInteractorAddressListRouterAddress as EntityOf course all these layers should move under the folder AddressListModule.Initial AddressList Module Folder StructureLayer InterfacesTo make responsibilities clearer, each layer should apply a protocol to open themselves to other layers, from now on I will call it interface. For example, what does presenter want AddressListView to do\u00a0? Most probably it gives an array of address properties which are listed in the screen. Also grouping protocol methods with a comment according to who will use them would be better.Before jump to implementation directly, let\u2019s define interfaces of layers;AddressListView InterfaceAddressListPresenter InterfaceAddressListRouter InterfaceAddressListInteractor InterfaceHow did we write all these\u00a0? Answer is simple, thinking about responsibilities of each layer. Just be sure that each layer applies it\u2019s own interface after defining them \ud83d\ude43After interfaces are done, define associated layer variables in each layer considering which layer it should communicate with. You may want to look at the Figure 1 at this moment.Next we should think how we can create the module. Since different modules communicate between their routers, I think router should assemble the whole module. Since it is independent from module\u2019s actual router instance, we can create a static module creation method in AddressListRouter;Module Creation Static MethodAlthough static module creation method in router is just fine for me, I\u2019d like to hear if you have a better idea.Now, we can implement interface methods. Let\u2019s check the AddressListViewController again after implementing methods;AddressListView ImplementationNow you can see that view has no idea what is going on. Each time a user touch event is happened, lifecycle method is called, view tells what happened to presenter instead of doing something itself. Even it does not contain any data related with addresses, it just asks to presenter what will be displayed in the cells while reloading table view. So let\u2019s look at the presenter then;AddressListPresenter ImplementationAs you can see that presenter determines what will happen next and invokes responsible layer. If fetching data is required, it tells to interactor, if the view should be updated, it makes it via view\u2019s interface methods. Similarly, if a navigation stuff is required, it commands router to do it. However no UIKit related operation is allowed here. Also, when view is needed to address data, presenter gives only a part of the necessary properties will be displayed in the screen, it handled with giving tuple to view in the demo project.Let\u2019s look at the interactor;AddressListInteractor ImplementationInteractor is just responsible from service calls in this module. It fetches address list using it\u2019s service property whenever presenter requested. Also if an error occurs, interactor notifies the presenter with associated error message. Although there is no analytics event sending or fetching local data in this module, interactor is responsible from them. At last, router implementation can be seen below;AddressListRouter ImplementationWhenever you present, pop or push something, you should know that it is router\u2019s job. As you can see above, router provides that navigate another view controller, as well as presenting something includes popups. Again, since it is a demo project there is only one module in it, router should communicate with other modules in a real project in terms of navigation.What about other stuff used in the module except layers\u00a0?We have used custom cell named AddressListTableViewCell in the view layer to present address data. Also AddressListResponse and Address models are used by interactor layer. Since these files are associated with AddressList module, we should move these files under the module\u2019s folder in the project navigator;AddressList Module Folder StructureFinal WordsAt the end of the story, we created an Viper module step by step. Although implementation of VIPER seems more work needed in first step, adding new capabilities to the layers is really easy thanks to the protocol oriented approach. Following data flow in the debugging is easy too, since each layer has a clear role. In addition to it, even view controller can be testable by using presenter when each life cycle method invoked and each user action happened.However, it would be an overkill for the relatively small projects.One last thing, if you are afraid number of layers that you should create for viper module, you may want to give a chance to script below, which is created by my teammate \ud83d\ude0cCIVIPERGeneratorHappy coding\u00a0!", "responses": "2"}, {"title": "IOS Memory management (ARC) in Viper implementation", "author_name": "Cristian Cosneanu", "link": "https://medium.com/@cristiancosneanu/ios-memory-management-arc-in-viper-implementation-7ede1e8092ff?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 2, 2017", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "109", "content": "IOS Memory management (ARC) in Viper implementationCristian CosneanuBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 2, 2017This is my fist time writing a blog, it is a new thing to me so, i really hope it won\u2019t be boring.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "VIPER Project Template in Xcode 9: When module template is not\u00a0enough\u2026", "author_name": "Manish Kumar", "link": "https://medium.com/@manishkumar_8449/viper-project-template-in-xcode-9-when-module-template-is-not-enough-d6248deb75d8?source=search_post", "post_date": "Feb 16, 2018", "readtime": "7 min read", "upvotes": "147", "content": "VIPER Project Template in Xcode 9: When module template is not\u00a0enough\u2026Manish KumarBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 16, 2018The Problem..Nowadays iOS requirements are very difficult to accomplish(with respect to time).

But to be honest, do we have enough time for that\u2026 to go through scratch..???Why to go for a Project Template when Xcode itself provides some to start\u00a0with..??Very recently I was working with a new architecture VIPER. After working on this protocol oriented architecture, I realized one thing that you got to have enough time to work with this, as almost 3x amount of code has to be written as compared to MVC.\ud83d\ude1fWhat Xcode Project templates provide is a minimal basic showcase of files that you have to play with. But when working on a big project you need to have a good structure which will contain files like Enums, Extensions, Constants, Storyboards, Feature Modules etc. This structure grows and grows as you deep dive into the requirement.So, I thought\ud83e\udd14 of having a Project Template which will contain a basic structure as well some basic modules like Login, Side Menu, Dashboard, Logout etc. At least it could save two or three days of my initial effort...\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01Creating a Project\u00a0TemplateFor creating a project template, I think what you need to know first is how a project template looks like.For that go to location /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project\\ Templates/iOS/ApplicationAt this location you can find many folders with extension\u00a0.xctemplate.Copy the folder Single View App.xctemplate and paste it to your Desktop before you start exploring its contents as you don\u2019t want to mess around with Xcode\u2019s default template.First, change the folder name from Single View App.xctemplate to Viper Project Template.xctemplate\u00a0.But changing the folder name would not do all, its all about TemplateInfo.plist file lying under the folder that you have to play with.Open TemplateInfo.plist. Now like Xcode projects, project template also has an Identifier that makes it unique. You can see for Single View Application it\u2019s com.apple.dt.unit.singleViewApplication. You can change it any other value like I used \u201ccom.manishKumar.singleViewApplication\u201d. Now after that just save the TemplateInfo.plist file and copy the folder Viper Project Template.xctemplate and paste it to the same location from where you copied Single View App.xctemplate. Quit Xcode and start it again. Now when you create a new project you will an option like this.Option for creating Viper Project using Viper Project\u00a0TemplateYippee\u2026\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03 you have created your own project template\ud83d\ude0e. But its not over yet. We still have got no contents as per the VIPER structure. We need to work on that now\u2026\u2026Again open TemplateInfo.plist(kept on Desktop). In that file navigate under Options option.You can see under Units there are two optionsObjective-CSwiftYou have to choose between these two options based on the development language. I prefer Swift more, so I go ahead with the same for creating Templates.Under Swift, you can see a key named Nodes.Nodes key is used to create files, just by placing file name. If you want to create a file a particular location, then you need to include the path with the file name at last.Under Nodes, you can see some items and their respective values. After having a deep look you can understand these configuration lines are used to create a ViewController with ViewControllerLifeCycle methods. But we need a lot greater than this\ud83d\ude10.Creating Inbuilt\u00a0modulesNOTE: You can see this Github Repo regarding the Viper structure followed for implementing this project template.Now our target is to create some inbuilt modules.Let\u2019s keep everything aside, and think of how much time and effort would you need to create an application with feature shown below\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb in gif image(in VIPER)Sample AppI bet it\u2019s a very easy task for you with not much of an effort\ud83d\ude0e. But this is what we will be implementing initially as a project template(later you can enhance the template as per your requirement). You can use Module Templates from this Github repository to speed up the whole process and refer to my previous blog on what is Module Template, and how to create one for your own process.So initially, you will be building a Xcode project with the features shown above. For reference, you can check out or use this Github repository. Just remember one thing, that whatever you are coding will remain as a template.Take out all the module namely Login, Home, SidePanel, Resources, Settings, UI, AppDelegate.swift and AppDependencies.swift(parent folder along with the files) and keep it somewhere else. We will be working now, on importing the files in the template. Starting with Login module, just copy the Login module and paste it into Viper Project Template.xctemplate. But just copying these files in the folder won\u2019t be enough. You will have to do some configurations in TemplateInfo.plist file.Module File Configurations..Just like in my last blog, you will have to follow the process for just changing the file header components to generic values.TemplateInfo.plist configurations..Let\u2019s roll back to where we left, i.e Units. Now in units, we will go with Swift option as my preferred language choice for templates as said earlier. Now in Nodes(an array), you will have to provide file name along with their path for each file in Login Module like in below image.Login Module\u00a0NodesYou can see all the files and their paths are with respect to their parent module folder. But adding these files under Nodes will create new files at this path. But our objective is to import created files.So after this, we will be working with one more set of keys called Definitions.Definitions allow you to include source files and codes in your Xcode project until and unless you provide the actual file path. It can also be used to create groups of files and foldersUnder Definitions(a dictionary), you will create a dictionary. The key of the dictionary will be the path of any file of Login Module(along with file name). In that dictionary there will be two components:Path- It will be a String and it\u2019s value will be same it\u2019s parent dictionary key.Group- Group is an array of Strings and will contain the whole path(excluding file name) as per their source parent hierarchy.So, suppose you created Definitions for LoginAPIDataManager.swift\u00a0, it will look something like this:Definition for LoginAPIDataManager.swiftLikewise, you have to create Definitions for all the Login Module files.Now, this process of adding keys and values for Nodes and Definitions is repetitive until we are done with Login, Home, Settings, SidePanel and Resources Module. Resources module comprises of SidePanel source files and some extensions on various UIKit elements.After you are done with the above task, you have to work on another component i.e UI. It contains a file Storyboard.swift which is used to just collaborate references to all the storyboard used in the project.After all this, at last, we are left with AppDelegate.swift and AppDependencies.swift. Now, as these files are interdependent, Iwould club these two files into a single folder, AppDelegate. After you get these two files in the folder, paste it into your Viper Project Template.xctemplate\u00a0. Same configurations for renaming the header in those two files will be followed. Also, plist configurations have to be followed in the same manner both for Nodes and Definitions keys.Here ends, all the configurations. But just for once, check headers in all the files as you don\u2019t want files to show themselves as a part of different project or author or organization.That\u2019s all for now. Hope this Project Template can speed up your development process.You can find project templates at the following Github Repository: https://github.com/manish-1612/Viper_Project_Template.If you find this blog helpful, please dont forget to clap... \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a", "responses": "4"}, {"title": "", "author_name": "Oursky", "link": "https://m.oursky.com/viper-ios-app-beyond-mvc-mega-viewcontroller-e2b625ac58d5?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 19, 2015", "readtime": "5 min read", "upvotes": "31", "content": "How we develop using VIPER architecture in\u00a0iOSTo fight against MVCs (Mega-ViewControllers)OurskyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 19, 2015The MVC (Model-view-controller) paradigm is a default way in developing iOS applications. However, that default \u201cViewController\u201d messes up Views and Controllers. The developer usually introduces both view animations and business logic in a single UIViewController. It all feeds into a MEGA-ViewController. The massive ViewController actually violates the original MVC design that views are not supposed to have direct access to models.In this post, we will share our experience on how VIPER saves our lives from the MVC monster in our projects. In part two, We\u2019ve also included an example of a SignUpViewController.The \u201cMVC\u201d\u00a0monsterWhat is\u00a0VIPER?For smaller scale applications (with less model and UI interactions), MVCs should not be a nightmare. However, imagine we are building a slightly more complex application that includes several models and live UI updates. This makes the typical view controllers massive and difficult to test.VIPER is not a framework but an approach to iOS application architecture that remains clean with complex applications. It stands for:ViewInteractorPresenterEntityRouting (Wireframe)Each component bears a single responsibility, hence developers are forced to write corresponding logics inside each component without messing up view and business logic codes.VIPER is an architecture based on the Single Responsibility Principle. This is how the components working together to build up the application flow:VIEWA View should consist of views and view controllers. It is responsible to receive user interactions and pass them to presenters for decision making. The View should not contain any view logics to keep it simple. This is where you define how the view looks like, and include nothing (NO error checking, NO data fetching) beyond the view appearance\u00a0.PRESENTERPresenters define the view logics, such as when to show a warning message or highlight a button. It is responsible for preparing content for the View to display. Whenever data is required, the presenter requests data from interactors (but without directly getting it from the model).INTERACTORInteractors mainly contain business logic, such as logging in the user, processing a purchase, or sending a friend request. It should be independent of the UI. It only handles requests from the presenter and prepares corresponding data regardless of how the View looks.ENTITYEntities are the model objects manipulated by an Interactor and only by the Interactor. It can be simply an NSManagedObject. It is model orientated and therefore should not contain any business logic. Something like [User loginWith: (NSString*) name password: (NSString*)password] is not supposed to be placed inside an Entity.ROUTING (WIREFRAME)Routing has a special role in VIPER architecture. It tells where UI Navigation should go. It defines the routes from one screen to another as wireframes. In VIPER, the responsibility for Routing is shared between the presenters and the wireframes.When a presenter receives user interactions and there is a need to navigate to another screen, it will \u201cask\u201d the wireframe to perform the desired navigation to a screen. The wireframe can also specify transition animations if needed.What does VIPER help us\u00a0achieve?Quick answer: VIPER breaks down complex logical structures into layers of well-defined responsibilities.And yes, we did this in the early architecture design\u00a0phase.If MVC is a mega-monster that troubles you, VIPER is a little-monster-collection that aids you in building iOS apps\u200a\u2014\u200ain a more delightful and controllable way.Now, we can prevent the Mega-ViewControllers from growing and messing up our codebase.By separating responsibilities, it also enhances isolating dependencies. This makes testing and debugging much easier. Since the physical files are becoming smaller and puts more focus on their corresponding responsibilities\u00a0, it facilitates team collaboration.Part Two: Example SignupViewControllerTo help illustrate how we work with VIPER, in this example, we would like to show how we define components for a signup page.When an app has a first launch, we have a SignupViewController as the rootViewController of AppDelegate.ViewThis shows the login / signup view. It\u2019s only responsible for showing the UI elements and receiving interactions.Login PageSign up\u00a0PagePresenter@interface LoginPresenter- (void)loginButtonTapped:(NSString *)email password:(NSString *)password;@end@protocol LoginPresenterProtocol- (void)showErrorMessage:(NSString *)message;@endInteractor@protocol LoginInteractorProtocol <NSObject>- (void)requestSuccess;- (void)requestFailed:(NSString *)errorMessage;@end@interface LoginInteractor : NSObject <ETRequestManagerProtocol>- (id)init:(NSString *)emailpassword:(NSString *)passworddelegate:(id<LoginInteractorProtocol>)delegate;- (void)startRequest;@endWireframe@interface WireFrame : NSObject- (void)navigateToMainScreen;@endIf you are starting a new project, you may also start with some open-source VIPER generators:pepibumur/viper-module-generatorviper-module-generator - Gem to generate VIPER modules to use them in your Objective-C/Swift projectsgithub.comiSame7/ViperCodeViperCode - A simple OS X App for generating VIPER modules's skeleton to use them in your Objective-C/Swift projects.github.comChecklist\u200a\u2014\u200amake sure you\u2019ve implemented VIPER correctlyThis list helps to make sure everything follows the VIPER\u2019s design principle.

The MVC organizes the code, grouping them in one of the three layers (Model, View or Controller). But when we are working in some big projects we need more than three layers to get a better code organization.The problem of using the plain MVC is the Controller classes handle a lot of work as we see below:MVC - Modelcontains entities objects;handles persistence of the each entities;handles the business logic.MVC - Controllerintermediate View and Model objects;handles the views and application logic;tests View logics, data transformation, basic validations;manage Keyboard, tableView delegate and datasource;handles navigation between views;manages and takes part in the responder chain used to handle events.MVC - Viewdraw and animate the interface;handle the user interaction passing data to Controllers.Note the Controller responsibility. It explains why developers use too manny #pragma mark to organize their codes. If your controller classes are huge, you have fallen into Massive View Controller problem.Ok, what can be done now?

Although there are still a lot of \u201cnon-believers\u201d and skeptics of Bitcoin (some referring to it as the modern day Ponzi scheme), I can assure you that Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology, Blockchain, is not going anywhere soon. Blockchain has the power to revolutionize a wide range of industries such as Healthcare, Insurance, Banking, Stock Markets etc. However this is not what inspired me to write this article.I want to touch on the topic of cryptocurrency trading, specifically Altcoins. This is something that I have really started to enjoy and a few of us created a Telegram group called The Crypto Aquarium. On this platform we basically live and breathe crypto; from discussing the next buy, when to HODL, getting set up, to sharing of great articles. Our aquarium has grown to over 185 crypto fish in just 8 weeks, consisting of crypto investors, miners, developers and entrepreneurs. After being a part of this community and involved in this market, it has made me realize a few key things that anyone with experience in the traditional stock markets should remember when trading crypto. On Monday June 26th, the crypto exchanges were a bloodbath, to the point where I lost 40\u201350% on some Altcoins. Even though most recovered a week later, the cycle repeated itself and on July 10th, we experienced June 26th all over again. The crypto markets\u2019 volatility is truly remarkable and almost experiences a boom and recession on a weekly basis. One of my friends perfectly summed it up, \u201ca week in crypto is like a year on the stock exchange\u201d. This brings me to the key points I want to highlight:Emotional Trading\u200a\u2014\u200aIf you thought that emotional trading existed in traditional stock markets, guess again. The typical crypto trader differs significantly from your traditional stock trader. A good % of the population does not trade in these decentralized digital assets because they understand its value, but more out of fear of missing out (the FOMO is real) and have little or no traditional stock trading experience. Thus any news (good or bad), results in exaggerated market movements, which drives someone like me, who has been trading stocks for several years, absolutely crazy at times. Some of the more experienced crypto traders, use this to their advantage and takes the term \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d to a whole new level.Blind leading the blind\u200a\u2014\u200aI cannot help but shake my head in some instances where the \u201ccrypto specialists\u201d, who made serious profits from trading cryptocurrency by getting in early, now all of a sudden act as investment advisors to all the FOMO players that just started. Don\u2019t get me wrong, these \u201cspecialists\u201d should be admired for believing and investing in something everyone laughed at a few years ago, but to give investment advice with no finance background is very dangerous. Does this mean that someone with no finance background can\u2019t be an exceptional trader? Not at all! While some of these \u201cspecialists\u201d are genuinely great crypto traders and truly understand the dynamics of these coins better than most, others might have to take a step back and ask themselves \u201cmaybe I was just lucky?\u201d. I\u2019ve heard of multiple cases where people invested all their savings into some of these coins and instead of holding their positions during massive sell-offs, realize their loss by selling. Bare in mind, the \u201ccrypto specialist\u201d who tweeted what to invest in is definitely not to blame for that person\u2019s loss, however do you see how vicious this circle can get? One must not forget that the first step in wealth management is to determine a client\u2019s risk and return objectives, while strictly considering their constraints and combining that with a client\u2019s emotional biases, before investing in anything. The suitability of an asset class and it\u2019s allocation % to one person doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to another.Valuation of crypto assets\u200a\u2014\u200athe fundamental analysis techniques used for stocks do not necessarily apply in the valuation of crypto coins. A company\u2019s performance, discounted cash flows etc. is not a measure of the coin\u2019s value. Two big factors driving a coin\u2019s value are the utility and scarcity of the coin. This makes it difficult to determine a coin\u2019s intrinsic value compared to traditional stocks. There are great articles out there explaining this more in depth and I would recommend doing some reading before investing in crypto, as you might be a victim of a \u201cpump and dump\u201d trade and lose half of your value in a matter of minutes.In summary\u200a\u2014\u200awe are living in very exciting times, some of these coins, if they succeed, will change the world as we know it and in most cases, for the better. Crypto is a completely new asset class and we are still trying to figure out how we should look at it in combination with other traditional investments. In the meantime, happy trading and remember the 3 key factors to maximizing your profit is to diversify, diversify and most importantly\u2026.. diversify! Don\u2019t invest money that you are not willing to lose as your coin might just not be there tomorrow.

The types of architectural patterns may vary, but there are 4 most commonly-used ones - the ones whole IT world continuously criticizes but keeps using at the same time: MVC, MVP, MVVM and Viper (the last one as iOS architecture pattern mostly). The comparison of these patterns and choosing a better fit for each Swift-written project\u2019s case will be discovered further on in this article.Following the chronological order of things, once the first software design patterns have appeared, the common issues of those ios development architecture patterns didn\u2019t take long to arrive. For instance, the problem of server-client communication - how does one interact with another? Or a different one - the problem of separating the application\u2019s business logic from the in-app\u2019s logic; how this one should perform in terms of application\u2019s architecture? Due to them various design patterns for different architecture layers have seen the world; the most well-known amongst them are:Please continue reading on our blog MVP vs MVC vs MVVM vs VIPER.

For everything?Yes. Well no. Here\u2019s some constraints.This is for startups and small businesses. We\u2019re supporting your growth. We\u2019re enthusiastic founders and we want to make you succeed. If you\u2019re a bigger company, we will charge you more so we can support smaller companies better.This is for an MVP. Very minimal. We\u2019re looking through your business goals together with you and make sure that we deliver your key USP for that price, that means kicking features until it fits the budget; however, oftentimes founders decide to go for some extra features for a couple of extra bucks. We oftentimes end up with a price around 5000Eur which covers a couple of extra features.So, who\u2019s the\u00a0team?Good question\u200a\u2014\u200aand I think that\u2019s a good thing to cover in future blog posts\u00a0:)In short: we\u2019re a bunch of founders (for project management and design) plus a bunch of developers who were working hard on a couple of open source projects and are passionate about new fun projects.Our Core\u00a0ValuesValues are what define us as humans as well as a company.

The study that they are citing, though factually true, isn\u2019t true for real world vaping. The scientists tested their ecigarette at a very high voltage of 5.0, which no vaper would actually use with a coil temperature of 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature, which you can imagine, would cause the eliquid to burn and would lead to an undesirable burnt taste that all vapers try to avoid. Ecig users vape at the normal coil temperature between 392\u2013500 degrees Fahrenheit. As you can see, the coil the researchers tested was over double the real world coil temperature that vapers use.\u201cAren\u2019t vaping and smoking the same thing?\u201dActually, vaping is NOT smoking. Smoking involves combustion or the burning of tobacco leaves. Whereas vaping involves heating up (vaporizing) a liquid to create vapor. There is absolutely no combustion involved. Cigarettes also contain over 4,000 chemicals and 43 of those chemicals are known carcinogens and 400 other known toxins. Eliquid in quality ecigarettes only have four ingredients and these four ingredients have all been FDA approved.\u201cDo you even know what\u2019s in that\u00a0juice?\u201dBut we do, unlike with tobacco cigarettes. Eliquids are composed of up to four main ingredients, a main base of propylene glycol, which has been on the FDA\u2019s generally recognized as safe (GRAS) list and has been used in many products that consumers use daily, like albuterol or in asthma inhalers. PG is a perfect carrier of flavorings and offers the throat hit that smokers enjoy. The second ingredient is vegetable glycerin which is also on the FDA\u2019s GRAS list and like PG is also used in many products that people use / consume daily. VG, unlike PG does not hold flavor very well and is much thicker in consistency, but it does produce thick clouds when vaporized. This is why most manufacturers of eliquids use a combination of both PG and VG as their base as it affords both characteristics needed for a perfect vape. The third ingredient in eliquid are flavorings, these are always food-grade and can be natural or artificial, they are the same type of flavorings that are use in the food and beverages people consume everyday. The final ingredient is liquid nicotine. The liquid nicotine used is pharmaceutical grade and affords eliquid makers to create bottles that range in nicotine content depending on the user\u2019s preference.\u201cHave you heard the latest ecigarette news\u00a0story?\u201dDon\u2019t believe everything you hear on the news or read on the Internet, those scaremongering articles and stories aren\u2019t always true. But the fact is most people do not have time or the attention span to go digging for the truth regarding articles they read or news they hear on the TV or radio and they simply accept them as reliable and true.\u201cDon\u2019t those blow up in your\u00a0face?\u201dMost of the ecigarette malfunctions that you hear about are due to misuse where the user failed to follow the instructions of the manufacturer. The very few reports of ecigarettes that have failed during use or charging was because the user tried to charge their ecigarette with a charger that did not come with their kit. For mechanical mods, that is a little different. When a new user first asks about a mechanical mod, the first thing a more experienced user will tell them is to make sure that they do their research first and very thoroughly. Mechanical mods do not come with electrical protections; they are called unregulated because of this. Mods are really only suitable for those who have done their research and know what they are doing.Read the entire article about \u201c5 Questions That All Vapers Are Sick Of Hearing\u201d where it was orginally published here.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Soldiers Of Sunrise: tr\u00eas d\u00e9cadas do\u00a0Viper", "author_name": "Diego Cataldo", "link": "https://medium.com/revista-subjetiva/soldiers-of-sunrise-tr%C3%AAs-d%C3%A9cadas-do-viper-1ed0925582fc?source=search_post", "post_date": "Dec 11, 2018", "readtime": "11 min read", "upvotes": "151", "content": "Soldiers Of Sunrise: tr\u00eas d\u00e9cadas do\u00a0ViperBanda formada por garotos nos anos 1980 fincou os alicerces do Power Metal/Metal Mel\u00f3dico no Brasil com cl\u00e1ssicos como Soldiers Of Sunsire e Theatre Of\u00a0FateDiego CataldoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 11, 2018Viper da esq. para a dir.: Andre Matos, Pit Passarell, Felipe Machado, Yves Passarell e C\u00e1ssio\u00a0AudiEnquanto o Heavy Metal no Brasil era brindado com cl\u00e1ssicos nacionais em 1985 como Bestial Devastation, do Sepultura; as colet\u00e2neas SP Metal I e II; S\u00e9culo XX, do Overdose; Flor At\u00f4mica, do Stress; e A Ferro e Fogo, do Azul Lim\u00e3o, nascia em S\u00e3o Paulo uma banda que para muitos deveria receber o devido cr\u00e9dito por ter forjado o chamado Power Metal/Metal Mel\u00f3dico.

Eu tinha que gravar essa \u00faltima faixa chamada \u2018HR\u2019, que \u00e9 traduzida como \u2018Heavy Rock\u2019, e n\u00f3s est\u00e1vamos at\u00e9 pensando em chamar outra pessoa para cantar porque eu n\u00e3o conseguia cantar uma \u00fanica nota. Mas a\u00ed n\u00f3s dissemos, \u2018Ah, n\u00f3s podemos fazer isso um pouco mais como punk rock,\u2019 ent\u00e3o eu pude cantar com minha voz grave, que eu podia soltar naquele\u00a0momento\u201dPara promover o \u00e1lbum, o Viper saiu em turn\u00ea pelo Brasil e protagonizou momentos memor\u00e1veis. Apresentando-se no audit\u00f3rio de um dos col\u00e9gios mais tradicionais de S\u00e3o Paulo, o Col\u00e9gio Rio Branco, Andre Matos quase p\u00f4s fogo no local ao entrar em cena com uma tocha. Durante o solo da m\u00fasica Soldiers Of Sunrise, o vocalista subiu correndo no palco com uma tocha e correu para todos os lados. Num determinado momento, Matos parou pr\u00f3ximo \u00e0 bateria quando um peda\u00e7o do pano que ardia em chamas caiu sobre o kit. A partir da\u00ed: o caos.No mesmo ano, a banda apresentou-se no programa Toquem Rock, na TV Gazeta. Al\u00e9m da performance ao vivo, com direito a Andre Matos vestido como Bruce Dickinson na \u00e9poca do The Number Of The Beast, a banda deu uma entrevista onde o vocalista explicou o porqu\u00ea das bandas de Heavy Metal cantarem em ingl\u00eas e n\u00e3o em portugu\u00eas.>> Assista ao Viper no programa Toquem Rock\u201cO Heavy Metal veio da Inglaterra, entende? Ent\u00e3o a gente tem que cantar em ingl\u00eas mesmo. Seria a mesma coisa que cantar samba em ingl\u00eas. N\u00e3o d\u00e1 pra cantar Heavy em portugu\u00eas\u201dE aqui podemos abrir um parenteses: em janeiro de 1987, a banda alem\u00e3 Helloween lan\u00e7ava o disco Keeper Of The Seven Keys Pt. I, considerado por muitos o primeiro disco de Power Metal/Metal Mel\u00f3dico do mundo. Pela proximidade e partindo da premissa que o Viper n\u00e3o sabia o que o Helloween estava fazendo, muitos f\u00e3s acreditam que, assim como Keeper I, Soldiers Of Sunrise deveria ser conhecido como percursor desta variante do Metal.Theatre Of\u00a0FateCapa do vinil Theatre Of\u00a0FateMais experientes\u200a\u2014\u200aapesar da idade\u200a\u2014\u200aos meninos do Viper come\u00e7aram a pensar no seu segundo disco. Para tal, lan\u00e7aram uma demo em 1989 com tr\u00eas m\u00fasicas que integrariam o pr\u00f3ximo \u00e1lbum da banda. Diferente da primeira, esta demo encontra-se escondida nos arquivos secretos da banda sendo desejo de consumo dos f\u00e3s.Neste mesmo ano o Viper participou do programa Boca Livre, na TV Cultura, apresentado pela figura lend\u00e1ria do Kid Vinil. Ali, a banda apresentou a m\u00fasica At Least Chance (com outra letra) e tocou m\u00fasicas do seu primeiro disco. Vale dizer que a banda havia trocado a Rock Brigade Records pela Eldorado.Viper em\u00a01989Com esse up na gravadora, o Viper pode investir um pouco mais na produ\u00e7\u00e3o do seu segundo \u00e1lbum e recrutou o ingl\u00eas Roy M. Rowland (Kreator, Sabbat, Satan e Testament) para produzir o disco. As grava\u00e7\u00f5es ocorreram no BMG Ariola Studios, em S\u00e3o Paulo, nos meses de agosto e setembro. A mixagem foi no Strawberry Studios, na Inglaterra, nos meses de setembro e outubro.>> Assista ao Viper no programa Boca Livre>> Assista ao Viper no programa Mat\u00e9ria PrimaEm entrevista ao site Metal Meltdown with Dr. Metal, Andre Matos falou sobre o processo de grava\u00e7\u00e3o:\u201c[\u2026] foi um grande salto de um n\u00edvel para outro n\u00edvel. N\u00f3s contratamos um produtor ingl\u00eas chamado Roy Rowland que veio ao Brasil. O cara era muito bom, e n\u00f3s tivemos tanta sorte de termos provavelmente o um dos melhores est\u00fadios na cidade dispon\u00edvel para n\u00f3s. Era um est\u00fadio velho dos anos 50 ou 60, sabe, dos tempos do cinema. Eles gravavam orquestras inteiras l\u00e1, e eles tinham equipamentos maravilhosos, como mesa ao vivo e gravadores de fitas e todos os tipos de microfones e todos os tipos de salas e piano ac\u00fastico e orquestra dispon\u00edvel, e tudo. Ent\u00e3o foi uma realidade completamente diferente [\u2026]\u201dNo dia 10 de outubro de 1989 chegava \u00e0s lojas o segundo e \u00faltimo disco do Viper com a forma\u00e7\u00e3o cl\u00e1ssica. Diferente do antecessor, Theatre Of Fate foi um passo enorme na carreira da banda. O som, mais pr\u00f3ximo ainda do Metal Mel\u00f3dico, foi muito bem aceito e a banda estourou no Jap\u00e3o.Da esq. p/ dir.: Yves Passarell, Guilherme Martin, Andre Matos, Felipe Machado, Pit PassarellAs influ\u00eancias de m\u00fasica cl\u00e1ssica come\u00e7aram a dar o ar da gra\u00e7a e os teclados disseram \u201cpresente\u201d no decorrer do disco. Al\u00e9m disso, a m\u00fasica que encerra o \u00e1lbum \u00e9 uma adapta\u00e7\u00e3o de Moonlight Sonata, de Beethoven.Assim como o primeiro disco, Theatre Of Fate tamb\u00e9m recebeu o merecido destaque junto ao p\u00fablico gra\u00e7as \u00e0 m\u00fasicas como At Least A Chance, To Live Again, A Cry From The Edge e Living For The Night, que virou o hino da banda.>> Assista ao Viper em est\u00fadio durante as grava\u00e7\u00f5es de Theatre Of FateShows foram marcados em todo territ\u00f3rio nacional e, como \u00e9 poss\u00edvel ver em bootlegs, o Viper estava pr\u00f3ximo de atingir o seu \u00e1pice, mas\u2026Evolution (?)Capa do vinil EvolutionRec\u00e9m admitido na faculdade de m\u00fasica, Andre Matos resolveu deixar a banda em 1990 alegando n\u00e3o conseguir conciliar as atividades do Viper com os estudos. Desta forma, durante a turn\u00ea de promo\u00e7\u00e3o do Theatre Of Fate, Pit Passarell assumiu os vocais e o show continuou.Ainda pela Eldorado, a banda lan\u00e7ou o disco Evolution em 1992. Apesar da perda do vocalista e de uma figura central, o Viper se saiu muito bem nessa reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o. O \u00e1lbum manteve o nome da banda em alta gra\u00e7as ao hit Rebel Maniac e o sucesso no Jap\u00e3o estava intacto, tanto que no ano seguinte saiu o ao vivo Maniacs in Japan.>> Assista ao Viper no Jap\u00e3o em 1993Ap\u00f3s esse lan\u00e7amento, o contrato com a Eldorado foi encerrado e a banda assinou com a Massacre Records. Entretanto, apenas um EP foi lan\u00e7ado pelo novo selo. Vipera Sapiens agradou os f\u00e3s por ainda manter a pegada original do Viper\u200a\u2014\u200amesclado com a mudan\u00e7a ocorrida no Evolution\u200a\u2014\u200a, mas marcou fim do per\u00edodo criativo da banda.Viper p\u00f3s Andre Matos em 1990 (da esq. p/ dir.: Yves, Renato, Pit e\u00a0Felipe)O quarto disco de est\u00fadio intitulado Coma Rage (Roadrunner Records) n\u00e3o agradou aos mais saudosistas. Lan\u00e7ado em 1995, o \u00e1lbum havia abandonado tudo o que o Viper tinha desenvolvido at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o para flertar com o Punk Rock numa tentativa n\u00e3o muito feliz de fazer o crossover. O passo seguinte quase p\u00f4s ponto final na hist\u00f3ria da banda.>> Assista ao Viper no Monsters Of Rock Brasil em 1994Em 1996, pela Castle Brasil, o Viper lan\u00e7ou o disco Tem Pra Todo Mundo sepultando de vez aquele Viper dos anos 1980 e come\u00e7o da d\u00e9cada de 1990. O Pop Rock influenciado pelas bandas nacionais desagradou por completo os f\u00e3s. O \u00e1lbum tem um cover para a m\u00fasica Mais do Mesmo da Legi\u00e3o Urbana.Em entrevista \u00e0 Folha de S. Paulo, Andre Matos falou sobre o disco:\u201cAgora eu vejo que foi um erro ter sa\u00eddo com o nome Viper. Deveria ter sido um projeto paralelo, pois a mudan\u00e7a foi enorme.

Yves Passarell foi parar no Capital Inicial e os demais membros seguiram seus rumos. Ainda em 1996, a Paradoxx Music relan\u00e7ou os discos Soldiers Of Sunrise e Theatre Of Fate em um \u00fanico CD. Em 1999, pela Eldorado, saiu a colet\u00e2nea Everybody Everybody.O Viper ficou longe dos holofotes at\u00e9 que, em 2005, Pit Passarell e Felipe Machado come\u00e7aram a se movimentar para reacender a chama da banda. Com Guilherme Martin (bateria), Vald\u00e9cio Santos (guitarra) e Ricardo Bocci (vocal) completando o line up, a banda lan\u00e7ou uma nova demo.>> Ou\u00e7a a demo lan\u00e7ada pelo Viper em 2005No mesmo ano foi lan\u00e7ado o document\u00e1rio 20 Years Living For The Night contando a hist\u00f3ria da banda que, naquele ano, comemorava 20 anos de exist\u00eancia. Os \u00faltimos dois materiais reanimaram os f\u00e3s e um novo disco era aguardado.

Ap\u00f3s a tour comemorativa, que durou at\u00e9 meados de 2017, Andre Matos novamente deixou a banda e Leandro Cai\u00e7olo assumiu os vocais.

Ele entrou na banda e, desde ent\u00e3o, fizemos poucos shows, sempre celebrando material antigo. Estamos em uma fase dif\u00edcil para sentar e compor algo novo, mas insisto em fazer o Viper Day [show que a banda realiza todo dia 8 de abril celebrando a primeira apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o da banda em 8 de abril de 1985] at\u00e9 para jogar uma pilha em todos.

Trousers! Grey! Titanium! Oh my! Viper Tactical have released their new version of the Titanium jacket and trousers and thanks to Military1st we can show you what they came up with.Elite JacketThe Viper Elite Jacket is a new version of a water resistant micro shell made out of breathable fibre fabric called Taslon that\u2019s very lightweight and similar to cotton in look and feel. It improves over cotton in many ways as it utilises the latest fibre technology and at the same time provides natural feel.What we\u2019re getting is a very good product, comparable to other brands such as Helikon but at even more affordable price.It\u2019s packed with features too! Apart from being water resistant which is its main premise, the Elite Jacket comes with 5 external pockets. Two upper arm zipped pockets include an elasticated inner D-ring and a rubberised headphone port in case you want to put your phone or radio and weave the cable through. Outside, the pockets are covered with large 4x4 inch Velcro patches for your identification needs.The central zipped pocket also features a headphone port and a nice soft-material sleeve to keep your device secure. On the lower left sleeve you can also find an additional zipped pocket for extra storage.As most of similar products, this jacket also contains underarm zipped vents which enable you to get more breathability during warmer days, definitely a plus. Cuffs come with neat rubberised Velcro adjustment to keep the perfect size.The main two-way YKK zipper includes a nice chin protector, so you don\u2019t have to be worried to catch your skin with it. Most of the zipper feature a non-slip pull tab with a pretty cool Viper logo.At the bottom you\u2019ll find a bungee retention system for the waist to allow a slicker fit around your body.Not to be forgotten is the foldable hood that can be stored in the collar. It features a full bungee system to help keeping it in place and shape it to the users desire.All in all, we were very happy with the quality of the product. It features reinforcements where needed, such as reinforced elbows. As most soft shells it\u2019s very comfortable, soft and pleasant in touch and comes in a great price. Oh, and this trendy grey colour that we like!Contractors PantsI\u2019m a big fan of these trousers. After owning older Viper BDUs and some other Helikon pants, I really enjoyed testing these. Like the jacket, they come in Titanium grey colour and are made out of 60% polyester and 40% Ripstop cotton.The wide belt loops allow to to use belts of almost any size and make sure that the trousers don\u2019t move. The back of the waist is elasticated which improves the comfort and lets the trousers stretch depending on the users movement.Happily your gusseted crotch will keep your important parts safe, so will the YKK zip fly. The included button and Velcro adjustment is neat.Like most modern trousers, the front pockets have strengthened lips and give you easy access to the contents. Back pockets are simple, quite big and allow you to close them with Velcro flaps.I really liked the deep cargo pockets with inner felt-lined compartments. For me they were perfect for storing 2 magazines in each pocket for a pretty slick undercover look.Another neat feature is the possibility to add knee pads, as the reinforced knee part features a Velcro pocket. Obviously the knee pads are not included but there\u2019s plenty of them to pick from in the market. Like most of the trousers the bottoms could be tied for better fit.The pants we comfortable to wear. Event without a belt they stayed where they were supposed to and the elastic back worked great, improving the movement. The solid front Velcro flap and button were a good design choice.SummaryGreat products at a great price. I\u2019m becoming a big fan of the new line of clothing that Viper releases, especially given the price point.

Po ob\u011bd\u011b bereme bus sm\u011brem k botanick\u00e9 zahrad\u011b. Po vystoupen\u00ed si u vchodu bereme mapku a vyd\u00e1v\u00e1me se vp\u0159ed.

Sle\u010dna mus\u00ed sama nastoupit, tak\u017ee se lou\u010d\u00ed, ale mlad\u00edk, kter\u00fd sly\u0161el jak se pt\u00e1me na cestu, si v m\u00edstn\u00ed MHD aplikaci na\u0161el trasu k ZOO a taktn\u011b \u0159\u00edk\u00e1, \u017ee n\u00e1s sly\u0161el pt\u00e1t se na cestu do ZOO a ukazuje mi v mobilu p\u0159esn\u011b \u010d\u00edsla pot\u0159ebn\u00fdch linek a zast\u00e1vku na kter\u00e9 p\u0159estoupit. Po \u00fasp\u011b\u0161n\u00e9m p\u0159\u00edjezdu k Night safari jdeme k pokladn\u00e1m. Avizovan\u00e9 ceny na bilboardech a netu byly samoz\u0159ejm\u011b \u201cod\u201d a jeliko\u017e my chceme Night safari a ZOO, tak je cena 71 SGD na jednoho. Co\u017e je p\u011bkn\u00e1 p\u00e1lka a tak v\u00e1h\u00e1me, jestli takov\u00e9 pen\u00edze za tuto atrakci d\u00e1vat, pro\u010d\u00edt\u00e1m recenze na TripAdvisoru a po v\u00e1h\u00e1n\u00ed plat\u00edme, uvid\u00edme jak\u00e9 bude srovn\u00e1n\u00ed s Night safari v Taiping. Po zaplacen\u00ed jdeme p\u0159es turnikety d\u00e1l a kouk\u00e1me na p\u0159\u00ed\u0161ernou frontu, kterou koordin\u00e1to\u0159i rovnaj\u00ed mezi d\u0159even\u00e9 ohradn\u00edky.Pomalu postupujeme jako na por\u00e1\u017eku.

Proj\u00ed\u017ed\u00edme trasou, hezky bez hluku (elektrika) narozd\u00edl od vl\u00e1\u010dk\u016f v Taipingu.

Jedna byla t\u011bsn\u011b nad n\u00e1mi na v\u011btvi a jeden z o\u0161et\u0159ovatel\u016f zrovna na protilehl\u00e9 stromy v\u011b\u0161el kbel\u00edky s potravou. Rozhodli jsme se \u010dekat a sledovat. Nijak jsme na veverku nemluvili, co\u017e jeden z n\u00e1v\u0161t\u011bvn\u00edk\u016f za n\u00e1mi zkusil a o\u0161et\u0159ovatelka ho dost slu\u0161n\u011b zpra\u017eila, \u017ee veverky nejsou cvi\u010den\u00e9, a\u0165 ji laskav\u011b nech\u00e1 let\u011bt, a\u017e sama uzn\u00e1 za vhodn\u00e9. Po chv\u00edli na\u0161tvan\u011b ode\u0161el, my st\u00e1le \u010dekali. A nakonec jsme se po p\u00e1r minut\u00e1ch do\u010dkali, veverka si popob\u011bhla po kmeni o kus v\u00fd\u0161e, znovu se rozhl\u00e9dla a p\u0159ipravila ke skoku a pak je\u0161t\u011b o dal\u0161\u00ed kus v\u00fd\u0161e.

Cena je na na\u0161e pom\u011bry v\u0161ak p\u0159ehnan\u00e1. P\u016flnoc se bli\u017eila a tak jsem zkoumal na tabuli bus, kter\u00fd pojede nejbl\u00ed\u017ee k na\u0161emu bydlen\u00ed. Radoval jsem se kdy\u017e jsem v jednom z j\u00edzdn\u00edch \u0159\u00e1d\u016f na\u0161el Blk 617, co\u017e bylo \u010d\u00edslo na\u0161eho bloku (zji\u0161t\u011bn\u00ed z prvn\u00edho dne). Tato linka pr\u00e1v\u011b p\u0159ij\u00ed\u017ed\u011bla a tak jsme nasko\u010dili.

This article has solved the very problems I was having with VIPER. The examples are of not much use since in a real use case you wouldn\u2019t create retain cycles (yeah that is actually in one of the examples). So thank you for creating this article explaining a much needed variation on VIPER.I am also curious as to how one module would present another. Laurie makes a great point, with one exception. The last idea of having Module(B) send back the wireframe instead of the view solves the problem of the module(B) knowing *how* to present itself (which I agree would be ideal). However given the strong reference chain, if you were to only send back wireframe(B) then the view(B) would be deallocated since nothing is holding on to it (it hasn\u2019t been presented yet) which would cause everything else in Module(B) to be deallocated except wireframe(B) (as it is being returned) and whatever it is holding onto.With that being said one could solve the issue by returning the view which solves the issue of other design patterns being able to work seamlessly with BVIPER. To also solve the *how* issue we would have to (a) be able to get to the wireframe from the view which I feel like violates the idea of the view never gets anything from the presenter or (b) send in an \u201cevent\u201d to the view with the fromViewController as a parameter, which would then be forwarded onto the presenter, similar to: (void)someLabelTextChangedTo:(NSString *)text but instead (void)presentModuleFromViewController(UIViewController *)viewController. Option (b) seems to solve all issues while not violating any of VIPER\u2019s rules. However, I\u2019m not sure if it is the cleanest way to solve this problem.Thought?", "responses": "1"}, {"title": "VIPER Architecture", "author_name": "Joshua Brunhuber", "link": "https://medium.com/joshtastic-blog/viper-architecture-c1884b0f81f5?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 13, 2018", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "VIPER ArchitectureJoshua BrunhuberBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 13, 2018In software development we run into many problems. Code that is difficult to test, duplicated code or little to none separation are things that give me headache nearly everyday.Patterns try to solve common problems for certain use-cases. Singleton is a simple example. It solves the problem that a class just has to have one state.The difference between design patterns (like the singleton) and architectural patterns is that architectural patterns solve problems relating with the separation of concerns.The ProblemWe create amazing apps. And with amazing apps, amazing user interfaces and complex functionality. That means our features will get complex as they grow.We have to think about how we get everything clear, extensible, maintable and understandable.The solutionVIPER solves exactly this problem: It describes the responsibility of our parts and how they interact with each other.I refactored my App PursCreate to VIPER and started using it in some other larger projects. And this is what I learned:Everything has it\u2018s specific place. You know exactly that a functionality musst be placed in the router or presenter for example.The structure got more complex but it\u2018s super easy to add new features and keep them decoupled from anotherI reduced side effectsIt was easier to write UnitTests for my business logicLet me give a short description of the parts of VIPER:ViewWhen you launch your App the things you see is the view. It\u2018s that red button with corner radius and shadow or some gradient-colored pills.PresenterThe presentation logic handles all actions that are needed in order to display all required information in the view (asks the Interactor for the data).It also handles all user-interaction like present a new screen, visually enter the edit mode or a custom back-action.InteractorThe Interactor contains the business logic or acts as a facade to it.In my recent projects common use cases were CoreData access, filtering products in a product-list (shopping app) or fire HTTP-Requests.EntityEntities represent your DataModel. This might be a ManagedObjectModel (for CoreData) or a structure containing a HTTP-response.RouterThe Router handles all the display and navigation logic. For example when a user clicks a button:The presenter will call the router and say: displayMyView().Why should I extract this simple logic?Because it quickly grows.In my App PursCreate I have the following case:When you click on a cell, an overview of your goal appears. There are two goal types. So you have to determine wether it\u2018s a classic task or a streak.Now the user can edit his goals. If he enters the edit mode you have to determine the types again but in this time open the edit for the corresponding task and not the overview.When an app grows this part might get very complex.ComplexityVIPER has many advantages. However it comes with a lot of complexity. This might result in unnecessary overengineering.HelloWorld OverengineeredOur job as programmer is to decide which architectural pattern is the right one for our use case. Maybe MVC or MVVM is perfect for simple use cases. In more complex things VIPER benefits with its separation and scalability.This article describes it perfectly.

Adhere to these tips, make them habits, and you may be better off than you would be if you ignored this advice.#1\u200a\u2014\u200aKeep Your Vape ChargedThis is the first tip I offer: keep your vape fully charged. When your vape battery runs out of juice, you may find yourself looking for a cigarette instead of a charger. Avoid this scenario by always making a point to keep your vape or e-cig fully charged.#2\u200a\u2014\u200aBuy Spare BatteriesIf you haven\u2019t already, get a spare vape battery or two. This way, when you find the urge hit you- you\u2019re ready for it. Finding yourself in a situation where your battery is dead could otherwise lead you to buy or bum a cigarette, which is far from ideal for the vaper using vaping as a means by which to quit smoking.Don\u2019t just buy a spare battery or two- carry them with you. Make sure you always have them when you need them. And remember: batteries can explode so you\u2019re going to want to make a point to protect them and treat them right. If you\u2019re carrying them in a pocket, make sure they\u2019re enclosed in a proper protective case. And when you\u2019re charging them, always ensure that you\u2019re using the right charger. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more tips on how to properly store and charge your batteries on their website.#3\u200a\u2014\u200aKeep Your E-Liquid Supply Fully StockedHaving a fully charged vape battery is great and all but if you run out of e-juice, it\u2019s all for nothing. This is why I suggest making sure you\u2019re always stocked up on e-liquid. By doing so, you won\u2019t ever have to worry about what might happen (potential relapse) if you run dry.Another bit of advice here is to stock up on some different flavors. This way, you\u2019ll be able to avoid vaper\u2019s fatigue, which is what happens when you vape the same flavor day in and day out.#4\u200a\u2014\u200aBring Your ChargerIn case you need it, it\u2019s wise to carry your charger on you at all times. Assuming you have spare batteries, this might not be necessary for all vapers but for those who often find that their batteries have run dry, it can make a world of difference.Take me for example. Just the other night I went out to dinner with a friend and realized that my batteries were dead. All of them. I didn\u2019t realize it until we were almost at the restaurant and so instead of turning back, I simply reached in my pocket and pulled out my charger. I took it inside, handed it to a waitress, and kindly asked her to charge my battery. She found an outlet nearby and plugged it right in. Easy as that.#5\u200a\u2014\u200aNever Leave Home Without ItWhen I first started vaping instead of smoking, I would occasionally forget to bring a vape with me when I ventured out. A number of times, due to my forgetfulness in this regard, I found myself bumming cigarettes off my friends. To avoid this scenario, make a habit of always bringing your vape with you wherever you go. This way, you\u2019ll never be without when you need it.Need spare vape batteries, e-liquid, or maybe a new e-cigarette altogether?

The field security & surveillance camera is used when you need to use a wide sweep to monitor movements and doings, especially outdoors. For situations where a higher level of security is required, an advanced pro system may be necessary. Pro systems often have more night vision capability and larger cameras are made with heavy-duty metal housings making them ideal for businesses in higher crime areas. Some of them come with an auto flip option, meaning that they rotate automatically when someone or something passes underneath them. So the object or person remains upright when viewed on the monitor.Do not know what happens at your office or business when you\u2019re away? Use mini security & surveillance cameras to know what goes on behind your back. Some are compact enough to fit into a large light socket. Others are small enough to fit into a wedge in the wall. For example, pinhole cameras are mini cameras with small lens openings enabling it to be easily concealable or embedded into other gizmos or objects as a concealed surveillance camera. On the other hand, the snake cameras are mini cameras with a flexible but controllable body allowing them to be inserted into holes and tight places where ordinary cameras could not be installed. The flip side is that they do not have the 360 degrees rotation view that a normal PTZ camera would have.If a camera is merely installed for general surveillance it may tell you what happened but identifying a suspect would not be possible. For business surveillance, recording your footage is highly recommended. Many security systems come equipped with video output connectors that allow you to connect to a VCR for recording. However, a digital video recorder (DVR) is a much more efficient recording device.", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Worms Clan Wars Update 9 And Crack-3DM [VIPER666] Download", "author_name": "Jessica Lujan", "link": "https://medium.com/@jessicalujan/worms-clan-wars-update-9-and-crack-3dm-viper666-download-e9b73bb6996c?source=search_post", "post_date": "May 9", "readtime": "", "upvotes": "", "content": "Worms Clan Wars Update 9 And Crack-3DM [VIPER666] DownloadJessica LujanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMay 9alsClick Here >>> http://bit.ly/2HeWLQKClick Here >>> http://bit.ly/2HeWLQK239ceedf5d1ffb623e752c0f925e6a94b266caccDescription:--===VIPER666===--\r Crack provided by 3DM.\r Includes all the updates till 19-Nov-2013\r Check here for changelogs: http://store.steampowered.com/news/?appids=233840\r --===VIPER666===--\r \u00a038aedb91e8", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Why vapers love e-liquids from Cyberliquids?", "author_name": "cyberliquids", "link": "https://medium.com/@cyberliquids09/why-vapers-love-e-liquids-from-cyberliquids-e708730e44b3?source=search_post", "post_date": "Jun 15, 2017", "readtime": "2 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "Why vapers love e-liquids from Cyberliquids?cyberliquidsBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJun 15, 2017What makes your vaping experience special?

Jde o enterprise datab\u00e1zi, kter\u00e1 jde koupit s HW akcelerac\u00ed. Na wikipedia se do\u010dteme, \u017ee je to Asymetric MPP datab\u00e1ze, pohlcen\u00e1 v roce 2010 IBM za $1.7B. IBM to dneska marketuje pod n\u00e1zvem IBM PureData System for Analytics. J\u00e1 m\u011bl mo\u017enost pustit benchmark na nejslab\u0161\u00ed sestav\u011b, ozna\u010dovan\u00e9 jako PureData System for Analytics N3001\u2013001, kter\u00e1 nem\u00e1 HW akceleraci a fyzicky jde o 4U server + SW s \u00falo\u017ei\u0161t\u011bm 16TB dat. List price je \u00fadajn\u011b n\u011bco kolem 190k USD.Z Amplab Benchmarku jsem pustil Test 1 (Scan Query), Test 2 (Aggregation Query) a Test 3 (Join Query), v\u017edy v\u0161echny t\u0159i verze odstup\u0148ovan\u00e9 podle slo\u017eitosti (A, B, C). Tohle je v\u00fdsledek na Netezza:Snowflake.netSnowflake je nov\u00e1 cloudov\u00e1 datab\u00e1ze (b\u011b\u017e\u00edc\u00ed v AWS), kter\u00e1 m\u00e1 ambice b\u00fdt prvn\u00edm \u201ccloud enterprise DWH\u201d \u0159e\u0161en\u00edm.

Pokud jeden warehouse zapisuje data do databaze, druh\u00fd je schopn\u00fd okam\u017eit\u011b pracovat s aktu\u00e1ln\u00ed verz\u00ed dat. Je-li jeden server p\u0159et\u00ed\u017een\u00fd, na jin\u00fd to nem\u00e1 vliv. D\u00edky tomu jde izolovat nap\u0159\u00edklad aplika\u010dn\u00ed logiku od analytick\u00e9 vrstvy.

With the last scene of \u2018The Mountain and the Viper\u2019, it delivers one of the book series\u2019s most memorable events so perfectly that I feel the same awe, shock and sadness as I did when I first experienced it.On some level, we know Oberyn has weaknesses. But, he\u2019s also a considerably stronger fighter than the Mountain, who is a lumbering brute of a man with little skill. The Red Viper of Dorne is a master with the spear, exploiting his opponent\u2019s vulnerabilities while exuding his trademark charisma and charm effortlessly. What consumes him ultimately, though, is his thirst for vengeance. For Oberyn, it\u2019s not enough to have mortally wounded the Mountain, he must hear him confess to the murder and rape of his sister and her children. The disgusting brutality of the end of the trial by combat sees Gregor Clegane admit what he did, before he kills Oberyn by crushing his head with his bare hands.It\u2019s almost unquestionably one of the most sickening acts to take place in the book series (Oberyn\u2019s fate is even described as occurring with a \u201csickening crunch\u201d), and in the the source material Tyrion throws up immediately and does not even hear his death sentence read out to him. It\u2019s designed to make you feel sick. I feel sick and I knew it was coming. That\u2019s what works so well about this scene, because the Viper is just so convincing that we can\u2019t see him losing. Especially when he begins to exploit the Mountain\u2019s inability to move at speed or with grace. We should know better but we believe he can win, and he basically does. His failure is a result of a win that he just won\u2019t take until he\u2019s had it the way he dreamed it would be.The version of the fight on the show is brilliant, and it gives Pedro Pascal his chance to really show off his character\u2019s marvellous speed, agility and deadliness. They don\u2019t call him the Red Viper without good reason, and the incredible stunt work and direction throughout the duel complement Pascal\u2019s effortlessly cool performance to make for another one of those Game of Thrones scenes that is simply unforgettable.The ending scene (which, of course, is where the episode gets its title from) is preceded by another excellent scene that is just a conversation between Tyrion and Jaime. Childhood memories take on new meaning as the two gradually realise they\u2019re sharing what might be their last interactions without ever mentioning it. To see Jaime smile when it looks like Oberyn has won only to have it snatched away is as heartbreaking as it comes.\u2018The Mountain and the Viper\u2019 is far from solely focused on the trial, though, as it spends a considerable amount of time telling stories with the Bolton family that most definitely don\u2019t occur in A Storm of Swords. These examples of the show taking material from later books are interesting, although I feel Reek needs to have been Reek for longer before he can be sent off to impersonate Theon. In any case, this plot works because Alfie Allen is doing some fine work that always manages to convey his character\u2019s fractured personality.A lot of what we see in this episode is either new or expanded from the books, especially where Arya and Sansa are concerned (speaking of Sansa, how amazing is Sophie Turner in the scene where she tells some, but not all, of the story of her aunt\u2019s death?). The wildling forces storming through Mole\u2019s Town makes for a fearsome opening, as Ygritte kills indiscriminately but chooses to spare Gilly because she has her baby with her. The show perhaps hasn\u2019t done enough to suggest just how large and destructive Mance Rayder\u2019s army is, but it\u2019s doing its best. Material like this and the scene that follows where Jon and his friends ponder how a hundred men can possibly fight 100,000 goes a long way towards making the wildlings out to be a huge threat.Lastly, the other big moment from the books to happen here is the unveiling of Ser Jorah\u2019s betrayal. This information has been waiting to be revealed since Season 1, and it\u2019s another one of those vital lessons in leadership that Dany has to learn. Her most trusted advisor? Not so trustworthy. She still can\u2019t bring herself to execute him for what he\u2019s done, though, so he\u2019s exiled with the warning that if he\u2019s caught he\u2019ll be killed. I\u2019ve always found the idea of talking about how he\u2019s stuck in the \u201cfriend zone\u201d to be a little off topic and simplistic. Jorah\u2019s an opportunistic guy who realises he\u2019s following a leader but still cares about that all-important pardon. His indecisiveness is his downfall.Conversely, it\u2019s Oberyn\u2019s steadfast inability to change his mind about needing to hear a confession that seals his fate. He\u2019s too decisive, and he somehow underestimates an enormous man with an enormous sword. In fairness, he does beat him, but this show teaches us that sometimes winning isn\u2019t enough. Sometimes, in the Game of Thrones, you win and you die.Game of Thrones airs on Sky Atlantic, at 9pm on Mondays", "responses": ""}, {"title": "Perfil del inversionista en\u00a0VaperMan", "author_name": "Marly Yamile", "link": "https://medium.com/@marlyyamile/perfil-del-inversionista-en-vaperman-4b6964b5af76?source=search_post", "post_date": "Apr 27", "readtime": "3 min read", "upvotes": "", "content": "Perfil del inversionista en\u00a0VaperManMarly YamileBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 27Introducci\u00f3n:En este caso espec\u00edfico el cliente o alianza a la cual se quiere llegar es a uno joven, entre los 25 y 30 a\u00f1os de edad, el cual en promedio ya ocupa un puesto de trabajo, ha estudiado una carrera universitaria y tiene unos prop\u00f3sitos y metas por cumplir,Biograf\u00eda/Vida personalJhonny libos tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, se gradu\u00f3 de la universidad EAFIT de Medell\u00edn como administrador de empresas, su estado civil es: soltero.Actualmente es el gerente de una gran compa\u00f1\u00eda de Medell\u00edn, distribuidora de esencias para vaporizadores de talla internacional.
