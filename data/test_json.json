And revealing the truth is important for everyone looking to be a part of the next big innovation.Ripple is dominatingYou\u2019ve heard the news. Ripple has the 2nd highest market cap out of all cryptocurrencies \u2014 a whopping $128 billion USD. A valuation higher than Uber, Airbnb, and Slack combined with $20 billion left over in pocket change. Ripple was the best performing cryptocurrency of 2017, with a staggering 36,000% increase from the beginning of the year!Coinmarketcap.com Jan-Dec 2017Things have certainly been going well for Ripple. And to some it\u2019s no surprise. They\u2019ve been killing it for years. From 2012\u20132016, Ripple raised $93.6 million from Andreessen Horowitz, GV (Google Ventures), and many more of the top VC firms in Silicon Valley. These are the kinds of the firms that routinely invest in startups like Facebook, Slack, and Uber when they\u2019re starting up. Them backing Ripple means they believe in the mission and they believe in the team.Major banks using the Ripple platformAnd Ripple is everywhere online. Successful pilot programs, working with 100+ financial institutions, and even the Japanese government seems to be behind them.Everything is perfect.A textbook case of a company with innovative technology that\u2019s taking the market by storm.And this would be true, if it wasn\u2019t for some of the finer details that have HUGE IMPLICATIONS.1. XRP is not RippleWhen people hear Ripple they instantly think of their coin XRP. This makes sense since other communities and coins are one and the same. When you buy ETH you are betting on Ethereum and when you buy BTC you\u2019re betting on Bitcoin. Why would Ripple be any different?Well, this is where things become interesting. To understand the differences between XRP and Ripple, first we need to examine Ripple the company.Ripple was founded in 2012 as Opencoin, renamed to Ripple in 2015, and is currently based in San Francisco, California. They have more than 150 employees, a nice office, and they sell banking software that uses blockchain.Ripple headquarters in CaliforniaWhat does Ripple do? They have 3 products \u2014 xCurrent, xRapid, and xVia.xCurrent is their flagship product. It gives banks the ability to efficiently move money across borders. It uses RippleNet, the Ripple blockchain, but does NOT use XRP. Banks like this software because it allows them to save money and time when sending payments, without introducing much risk or changes to their workflow.xRapid helps banks improve liquidity when trading in emerging markets. It is the only Ripple product that does use XRP. Banks like it because it helps them free up mountains of money they\u2019re stuck sitting on, but dislike it because it introduces unknowns \u2014 such as the volatility of XRP.xVia is still in development and scheduled to come out in early 2018. It\u2019s similar to xCurrent, but allows entities besides banks (such as corporations and payment providers) to send money through banks. xVia also does NOT use XRP.Remember that impressive 100+ list of financial institutions Ripple is working with? Guess what, they are all using xCurrent. And xCurrent does not use XRP. Of the 100+ partnerships Ripple has, ONLY ONE actually uses XRP the cryptocurrency. There is just one small \u201cnon bank financial institution\u201d from Mexico called Cuallix that is using xRapid.This means that the headlines showcasing Ripple\u2019s partnerships with more and more banks are good \u2014 Ripple the company is succeeding \u2014 but also don\u2019t mean much for XRP gaining adoption.Now this isn\u2019t to say that banks will never adopt xRapid (and start using XRP). In fact, this has been a part of the Ripple business plan from the very beginning. Get banks using xCurrent and then cross-sell them into xRapid. Banks may come to love xRapid.Or they might not.For Ripple this difference doesn\u2019t matter much. For investors in XRP, this is the difference that makes or breaks their investment.2. XRP is not the currency of the futureWhen people hear Bitcoin, they think digital money. As in, you can send money to anyone in the world without limitations.XRP might become this in the future, but right now XRP is stuck in banking. And Ripple has made no mention of changing this anytime soon.This is completely fine and makes perfect sense for Ripple as a company to choose. By focusing on just banks and financial institutions, they can provide value and create a profitable venture.The problem for XRP investors is that XRP can become overbought by people that think it will beat Bitcoin, replace fiat, and become the world currency. This means the market cap can be artificially higher and undergo a correction when this becomes common knowledge.Given that Ripple is going after global bank payments, their real goal is to replace SWIFT, the 45 year old society responsible for moving money between banks internationally.In 2016, SWIFT earned $31 million in profit, sending a huge amount of money through their system. Yet this was small compared to the over >$1,000,000,000,000 in monetary assets around the globe.Being limited to the SWIFT market reduces the opportunity of XRP by many orders of magnitude below that of a true digital world currency.3. XRP is not disruptive technologyRipple isn\u2019t the only company interested in revolutionizing banking.R3 is doing the exact same thing as Ripple. They\u2019ve raised $107 million from top venture capitalists and are using blockchain to help banks move money internationally. They\u2019re currently in 70 of the world\u2019s largest banks and the reason you might not have heard of them is simply because they have been doing this WITHOUT their own coin.SWIFT is working with more than 11,000 institutions and employs over 2600 people. To capture this market, Ripple will have to 100x. The challenge here is that there is no reason SWIFT couldn\u2019t develop their own blockchain technology and use their already established relationships to roll it out faster than Ripple can grow.SWIFT Headquarters in La Hulpe, BelgiumWill SWIFT develop their own blockchain? Harry Newman, SWIFT\u2019s global head of banking seems unphased. He looks at blockchain as simply a new technology which can be integrated into their existing systems if the benefits outweigh the cons.\u201cIf it makes sense to build it into our global payments innovation offering over the next few years then we will. That is why I don\u2019t see this as a disruption. I see these as constructive technologies that can be examined and adopted and used.\u201dAnd their actions align with their words. They have completed a proof-of-concept with 22 banks using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to help them free up capital stored in their nostro accounts. They have also tested smart contracts.Maybe we should all jump on SWIFT\u2019s coin if they come out with one?Stellar Lumens (XLM) was created by the founder of Ripple, Jed McCaleb, in 2014 to solve the problems he saw with Ripple.Stellar has since grown to number 8 in total market cap and is boasting deals with IBM and payment providers in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Korea.By expanding their focus outside of banks, Stellar has the potential to be much larger than Ripple. And the Stellar protocol supports smart contracts, a key component of the popular Ethereum network. A recent win for them on this front was Kik, the $1B messaging app, committing to moving their KIN tokens from Ethereum to Stellar in 2018.4. XRP is not decentralizedRipple controls RippleNet and they own a whopping 62% of the total XRP coins in existence. This has understandably worried XRP investors and Ripple\u2019s response was to lock up 55 billion coins in escrow.As with any centralized system, investors now have to trust Ripple to keep their word.And they most likely will. Given their strategy is to release 1 billion each month for the next 55 months, they stand to gain a lot of money by selling these 55 billion XRP tokens at the current market price.But the risks of being centralized extend beyond simply whether or not you trust Ripple to keep your best interests in mind and play fairly.The issue is also resilience. The reason digital currency have failed in the past is because a centralized digital currency is too easy to kill with regulation. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization is one of the reasons it\u2019s survived when digital coins of the 2000s (like E-gold, Liberty Reserve and Tencent) failed.Ripple faces the same weaknesses of these early digital currencies. It is one entity to attack legally when things inevitably go wrong.5. XRP adoption \u2260 price increaseAssume everything goes according to plan. Ripple works with 100x more banks. The banks love using blockchain and xCurrent, then decide to take a chance on XRP through xRapid. They love xRapid and feel confident enough in it to process all of their transactions through it \u2014 even ones in the millions of dollars. SWIFT drops the ball hard and completely fails to innovate, losing all of their customers and shutting down.You\u2019re happy. There are more than $5 trillion dollars being transacted daily in XRP. The price of XRP should be to the moon. Right? Well, not necessarily.The value of XRP is driven upwards by people holding the asset and believing it will be worth more in the future. Banks looking to move money across borders are not speculating. In fact, they have a disincentive to hold XRP, since they take on risk due to natural XRP volatility.This means banks will hold XRP for the absolute minimum amount of time they can. And given the speed of the Ripple network; that time is 4 seconds. With banks \u2014 the actual users of XRP \u2014 not holding onto their coins, XRP\u2019s market cap will decrease and EVEN AT SWIFT LEVELS will only result in approximately $230 million.This is worlds apart from the current speculative value of $128 billion.ConclusionRipple is good, but XRP\u2019s success for investors is an uphill battle.First Ripple the company needs to do well. Since XRP is centralized, if Ripple dies so too does XRP.Next Ripple needs to sign up 100x as many banks and financial institutions on xCurrent to become as big as SWIFT at sending payments internationally. Then the banks need to start using xRapid and settling transactions with XRP.In this process, SWIFT, a 45 year old group that has been evolving with technology over that time, needs to fail to offer a competitive product to Ripple and lose their entire market share. Also R3 and other startups breaking into this space have to fail too.And only at this time will all 100 billion XRP coins be worth approximately $231 million, or $0.0023 per coin.This being said, Ripple is still an amazing company. Even if they fail to capture the entire SWIFT market, they could still offer a valuable suite of products to banks. They could still generate significant revenue and command a high price per share.This just might not be the outcome XRP investors are hoping for.Enjoy this article?

Install Atomic.Ripple and XRPRipple is a funds transfer company that created RippleNet and XRP. XRP is a digital asset running on it\u2019s own blockchain. The main purpose behind XRP was to create a decentralized custodial free payment system which will use another consensus algorithm than Bitcoin. The project was initially based on the idea that you can exchange any asset or goods by using XRP ane currency bridges (exchange your currency to XRP and then transfer it to the other address via public ledger in just a couple of seconds).Ripple featuresIn XRP the system is handles by the verified or trusted nodes from the UNL (unique node lits) owned by the Ripple company and third parties. Two years ago it was possible to critise the project, but nowadays XRP is working hard to make their network more decentralized and trustless. Don\u2019t trust, verify!More than 150 nodes are running all over the globe right now and only 10 are governed by Ripple. In the past there were only 10 nodes and the whole XRP Ledger was governed by Ripple company. To decrease the risk of any failures in the validation Ripple decided to make a devirsification of nodes by their region, computing powers and other requirements. They validate tranasctions and protect the network from any maliscious actions. For example, to make changes into the blockchain the whole majority of nodes (80%) should vote for two weeks for these changes. Every node has only one vote, it\u2019s fair and trustless.The next step for centralization will be to decrease Ripple nodes from validation. Ripple will decrease the number of self-governed nodes with every two newcomers to the UNL (unique node list). Then every node will receive their own Token (unique number) that will be used for Vailidators Rotation. And the final step for the nearest future will be implementing Cobalt consensus algorithm.Sound impressive, isn\u2019t it?XRP real world use casesRipple is working with different financial institutions (banks and etc.) to provide a better and faster option for cross-border money transfer and exhange.Buy XRP (Ripple) instantlyNow you can Buy Ripple with a bank card easily!

To control these assets fully, you need to get familiar with some nuances.These assets use Destination Tag technology, the purpose of which is to assign the specific recipient of the transaction.What is Destination Tag?For example, some trader gives you their XRP address to send coins to, and you suddenly notice that this is the same XRP address as yours. How\u2019s that possible?It happens since exchanges often use a one XRP address for all their XRP traders. The only difference is the Destination Tag, a short complimentary code piece that assigns your transaction to a certain account.The Destination Tag is mandatory for the overwhelming majority of transactions. Once you set random numbers or inappropriate values instead of the required combination, you\u2019ll lose your funds. Either the funds will be sent to any other user having that combination as the tag, or to the exchange storage as an unassigned transaction.The Destination Tag purpose is to identify a transaction recipient.It\u2019s like the numbers of rooms. If you live in the same building, you\u2019ll need to use exactly your room number. If you live in a private house, you won\u2019t need one.How to use Destination Tag?The Destination Tag is not needed if you have your own personal wallet address for these coins. Atomic Wallet provides every user with their own wallet address. However, when it comes to exchanging your coins using centralized services, the Destination Tag becomes mandatory.Don\u2019t use the name of an exchange service as a Destination Tag! Otherwise, your transaction will get stuck as unassigned.In Stellar, the Destination Tag is called \u00abMemo ID\u00bbIn Monero, the Destination Tag is called \u00abPayment ID\u00bbIt\u2019s just the different names of the same feature.XRP Destination Tag in Atomic Wallet UIDestination Tag freeIf you want to use the custody-free wallet for Ripple, Stellar, Monero and other altcoins and tokens, download and install Atomic Wallet at atomicwallet.io.

(For a fun twist, you can pronounce it wipple in your head the whole time.)Ripple makes payment software for banks; their flagship product, xCurrent, doesn\u2019t even use XRP, because it doesn\u2019t need to.An upcoming product (xRapid) will use XRP as a way to \u2018source liquidity\u2019 \u2014 it will allow a customer to have access to a fiat currency without previously amassing a big pile of that currency. The big boss says one or two banks should be doing the money shuffle with xRapid by the end of 2018, and dozens by the end of 2019.Ripple owns lots of XRP. That XRP is locked up and will be released over the next 4.5 years. Each month, 1 billion XRP are released (about $500m) \u2014 available for Ripple to sell on the market. For the last 6 months, they have chosen to return 90% of that into the lock up, keeping a cheeky fifty mil as walkin\u2019 around money.If Ripple the company went away, XRP and the network it sits upon would be just fine \u2014 although the price of XRP would tank since so many people think that XRP is Ripple.Interledger is the protocol that sits under RippleNet. It is being developed as a potential web standard under the watchful eye of the W3C, you can find the unofficial draft specification here.In the xCurrent product (with no XRP), it is used to join the ledgers of banks together into a network. It could also be used to join XRP, or any other, ledgers together.The CTO, Stephan, has left Ripple to be with Coil, a company that will use Interledger to create a way of allowing money to flow from consumers to creators on the internet, kicking ads to the curb in the process. This is the part that gets my juices flowing.I was originally going to say that Ripple doesn\u2019t really compete with the likes of Bitcoin, but then I heard that they want to make the \u201cXRP ledger more decentralised than Bitcoin or Ethereum\u201d. Shots fired!(Although at the moment, to be more decentralised than Bitcoin, you just need more than three Chinese factories.)Ripple is quite a different beast to all the other cryptocurrencies out there. They\u2019re up to almost 300 employees, have truckloads of money at their disposal, and are unapologetically running a business that services banks.It\u2019s no wonder they draw a lot of ire.But at the same time, Interledger is not only open source, but hopefully on its way to becoming a web standard (or part of one), meaning that it can then be incorporated into browsers.If this happens (Interledger becoming a standard that is then built into the major browsers) we will then effectively have money baked into the web and I think that\u2019s pretty interesting.I\u2019d like to do a deep dive into Interledger at some point. All I\u2019ll say here is that if you\u2019re interested in the Oyster Protocol and Brave and the Basic Attention Token, then you\u2019ll probably be pretty interested by Interledger.A web of misinformationAs always, for my research I searched for things such as \u201cthe problem with ripple\u201d, \u201cwhy ripple is a scam\u201d and so on. And wow, there\u2019s a lot of stuff out there that is not correct.Luckily, all one needs to do is spend 25 minutes reading the Ripple website (you don\u2019t even have to believe what they tell you), and it will become easy to detect fake news.The article 5 alarming reasons Ripple might not be what you think accidentally did a good job of summarising the misinformation out there. Here\u2019s the five super-alarming reasons, paired with my thoughts on the matter:\u201cXRP is not Ripple.\u201d This is correct. It\u2019s on the Ripple website. In fact there\u2019s a whole page for it. And the poor CEO Brad Garlinghouse repeats \u201cXRP is not Ripple, Ripple is not XRP\u201d in every single interview he\u2019s ever done.I am not alarmed.\u201cXRP is not the currency of the future.\u201d Well that\u2019s just opinion. I think VR won\u2019t catch on and that cheese is pointless, but I don\u2019t expect you to be alarmed about it.\u201cXRP is not disruptive technology.\u201d Oh no, the authors appear to have forgotten their first point, and have confused Ripple\u2019s xCurrent product with XRP. They are saying that Ripple xCurrent, (which does not use XRP) is not disruptive, and has some decent competition. Sure. Whatever.\u201cXRP is not decentralised\u201d. Not true. If Ripple the company were to disappear, the XRP network would not be affected. XRP can operate just fine without Ripple in the same way that Ethereum can operate just fine without the Ethereum foundation. Because (say it with me) Ripple is not XRP, XRP is not Ripple.\u201cXRP adoption \u2260 price increase\u201d. For this to be true, then the following must also be true: \u201cBTC adoption \u2260 price increase\u201d, \u201cXLM adoption \u2260 price increase\u201d, \u201cADA adoption \u2260 price increase\u201d, and so on. They again appear to be forgetting that XRP isn\u2019t Ripple and they\u2019re assuming that the only use case for XRP is Ripple using XRP for xRapid.But anyone can use XRP just like anyone can use Bitcoin.On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rank my alarmedness at a solid zero.There\u2019s misinformation in both directions, of course. Such as with the Reddit post Apple implements interledger in safari on iOS, which says \u201cApple announced they support of the W3C payment request API in Safari. It uses Ripple\u2019s Interledger\u201dThis got almost 500 upclaps.Also, this is not true.The Payment Request API is an established web specification. It has been implemented in Chrome and Edge and Safari and has nothing to do with crypto.It does not use Interledger and the specification makes no reference to Interledger.The person who made the post shows a screenshot of a document called the Interledger Payment Method (which is an unofficial draft written by a Ripple employee) which references the aforementioned Payment Request API (as in \u201cmaybe one day Interledger will be used by the Payment Request API\u201d).Interledger is exciting, but it\u2019s not in your phone just yet. If you\u2019re super keen (you should be!), there\u2019s a reference implementation in JavaScript called Interledger.js that\u2019s just waiting for you to tinker with it.The verdict: XRP as an investmentI\u2019m quite sure that no one knows how much the price of XRP will reflect the success of Ripple the company.In a technical sense, they are disconnected (did I mention that already?), but in reality there is probably some significant correlation between the success of Ripple and the price of XRP.The question is, I suppose, how will that correlation hold over the years?Later this year Ripple plan to go live with xRapid, their first product to actually use XRP. I\u2019ve gotta believe that this will have a positive effect on the price.Iterledger also has the potential to be huge. It doesn\u2019t rely on XRP to function (it\u2019s inter-ledger) but Ripple believe that people will choose XRP because it\u2019s fast and cheap.Maybe five years from now, browsers will ship with Interledger abilities built in, people will default to using XRP because that\u2019s what\u2019s in the readme, and hey presto, XRP becomes the most used currency in the world.So, even though I\u2019ve gone on and on (and on) about Ripple and XRP being different. I\u2019m going to go right ahead and grab $500 worth of XRP because I like Ripple.Suck it, common sense.I\u2019m starting to get it about moneySomething clicked this week and I can see quite clearly now that something is wrong with digital money. (Let the mocking begin.)I can\u2019t buy a sandwich and directly pay the shop owner in money, unless it\u2019s physical. I can\u2019t pay my electricity bills over the internet straight from me to the power provider, and even shifting funds to my llama cleaner requires a third party.I have money, I want someone else to have that money, but we can\u2019t work it out, just the two of us. We need this massive piece of fiscal machinery just to move $4 over the counter in exchange for a coffee.The more I think about it, the weirder this seems.Crypto-angerHaving spent the week researching Ripple, I\u2019ve come across a fair amount of anger, so I thought I\u2019d give that topic a once-over.I have a theory that the people who are really interested in the technology don\u2019t get angry. I mean, it\u2019s all pretty interesting, this crypto stuff.But a certain subset of \u2018the community\u2019 appear to think of all this like some sort of sporting event (coinmarketcap is the leaderboard). They have picked their favourite team and root for them with great fervour.For these people it isn\u2019t about the technology, it\u2019s about the drama and the characters and the competition.I think these are the people getting mad on Twitter (the world\u2019s #1 platform for seeking approval).It\u2019s a little bit comical to watch someone get really worked up about one particular cryptocurrency that they don\u2019t like, because it doesn\u2019t fit with what they believe a cryptocurrency should be.It\u2019s like someone going shopping for a car and yelling at boats.I mean, I really hate sun dried tomatoes, but I don\u2019t go writing blog posts bout it.Maybe I should. Perhaps I\u2019d make it a vlog. I\u2019d call it \u201cDavid yells at food\u201d and start every episode by saying \u201cWhat. Is. Up. YouTube\u201d and do that thing where I talk to one camera but also film from another camera so you can see what I look like from a slightly oblique angle talking to a camera. Do they teach that on the first day of film school or something? It makes me very mad.OK that\u2019s enough of that.Proof of usefulnessOne of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest downsides is the fact that it uses \u2014 some might say \u2018wastes\u2019 \u2014 an enormous amount of electricity.So I\u2019ve been wondering, what if you could take the proof-of-work mechanism \u2014 with thousands upon thousands of processing machines doing work that is ultimately discarded \u2014 and somehow get it to do some useful work.Have you have heard of Folding@home?\u201cFolding@home is a project focused on disease research. The problems we\u2019re solving require so many computer calculations \u2014 and we need your help to find the cures\u201d.Now you\u2019ve heard of Folding@home.Doesn\u2019t it seem wrong to you that on one hand there is a need for computing power that will ultimately save lives, and on the other hand there is a mass of computing power being \u2018wasted\u2019 to secure a cryptocurrency?How hard could it be to combine the two?Maybe it\u2019s possible to break down the protein folding work that Folding@home does into chunks that take a predictable amount of time (e.g. 10 minutes). If you automate that process of building 10-minute chunks of work, then you could have a difficultly adjustment just like there currently is.Maybe that\u2019s not possible \u2014 to get the timing reliable enough \u2014 so perhaps you could have something in the consensus mechanism like: You must earn the right to mine a block by solving a protein folding problem.Your overall chances of mining a block in a given day would stay the same, since everyone must follow the same rule. The protein folding might take 2 minutes or an hour, it wouldn\u2019t matter in the long run provided the work is evenly distributed.Maybe it just isn\u2019t possible to break down protein-folding work. But maybe it is possible for SETI work, or something else I haven\u2019t heard of.Lastly, you\u2019d need a way to submit work to the network, perhaps to be voted on by nodes. Since you probably don\u2019t want to be instrumental in cracking passwords, you might require proof of who the person is. So a proposal to submit proof-of-usefulness puzzles to the network might take the form: \u201cwe are Folding@home and our signed proof is at https://foldingathome.org/pou-proof-key.\u201d \u2014 they then have a licence to publish puzzles for 1 month, or something like that.Details details.Anyway, that\u2019s just some thoughts that have been rattling around in my skull. I\u2019m sure this has already been discussed in great detail somewhere.Next weekI\u2019ve been itching for a while now to get my hands dirty with IPFS. And as of this week, I\u2019ve also been itching to get my hands to a similar state of uncleanliness with Interledger (then Ripple and Protocol Labs can duke it out over who gets to hire me).But these posts take about 8 hours to write and the research is probably another 10\u201320, which is most of my time outside my day job.Also, I\u2019ve looked at most of the coins that seem promising and I\u2019ve got no interest heading into ICO town because that\u2019s just straight up gambling.Even heading further down into the top 200 seems like a whole lotta guesswork \u2014 I reckon I\u2019m pretty good at spotting crap, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m any good at picking what the rest of the world will think is great.So, I\u2019m considering taking a break from the weekly write-ups of cryptoassets, and instead actually building something of substance and writing about that.Maybe if I stumble across something interesting (Tezos keeps doing a little dance in my peripheral) I\u2019ll dive into that and do a write-up.We will see. (I\u2019ll continue to do the $500/week into BTC, ETH and XRP.)One last thing, did anyone do that memory thing last week? Did it stick? Impact, galaxy \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 stomach \u2026 ancient?

Ripple is aiming to bridge the remittance cost-gap between institutions across the globe \u2014 Financial Institutions. something that has torn the cryptocurrency community due to the decentralized nature /ideals of the markets.Why has Ripple been such a major topic in the cryptocurrency community?Well, take a look at the image below. I don\u2019t have a clue when this picture was created, but Bitcoin fees and Credit Card Processing fees continue to take center-stage topic as more and more retail consumers enroll in the markets. Why fees? I thought the magic of Bitcoin was in it\u2019s Decentralised Organisational Structure? It is, still. Bitcoin will not be regulated by any government and cannot be shut down unless governments in every country across the globe shutdown electricity to every individual supporting the network via Bitcoin Mining. More below.The reason Bitcoin still has such high-fees is because the network is currently developing different technological solutions to solve this problem, allowing Bitcoin to scale. Instead of staying patient, a faction of the original Bitcoin community led by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu decided to continue supporting the old fork which, today, is known as Bcash (short for Bitcoin Cash), in an effort to expedite the process of Bitcoin becoming a tool for payment processing and Remittances.Looking above at the original Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto, we can see the title clearly states:\u2018Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u2019Key-word = Peer-to-Peer. While Bitcoin Cash is still a decentralized Blockchain (database), it is very, very heavily influenced by a centralized force of commercial Bitcoin miners. This takes away the original peer-to-peer ideals out of the BCash network because it is so centralized \u2014 the miners are controlled by a couple people which gives a major threat to 51% attacks on the Proof Of Work (POW) Bitcoin Network.51% attacks are prevented by having a majority of the network\u2019s mining hash power distributed across individuals as opposed to running ASICS-powered mining rooms in one building, centralized. Since BCash is a centralized blockchain network, it can be compared with Ripple \u2014 another centralized blockchain aiming to create a remittance system for institutions who will ultimately allow their customers to make low-cost remittances through the Ripple payment network.Now that we know the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash when it comes to the nature of the blockchain, we can look at Ripple through a similar lens that we look at Bitcoin Cash through \u2014 a company using blockchain technology strategically to increase the quality of service for companies using their service, but in a centralized manner.For the purpose of this article, it\u2019s important to know the difference between a truly decentralized blockchain network and one that is centralized, but using blockchain technology to power the network. The hurry to become a payment processing network will likely impede BCash\u2019s growth progress because security is far, far more important than being first-to-market. Look at the recent Equifax Data Leak (September 2017). This is one of, if not THE, world\u2019s biggest Credit Rating Agencies in the world \u2014 the WORLD.You can look into the statistics yourself, but over 150 million customer\u2019s information was stolen \u2014 yours, mine, your parents, etc. This is an issue Blockchain Technology aims to solve by using Public-key Cryptography to thwart hackers\u2019 ability to steal mass amounts of data in one fowl swoop. As soon as the Lightning Network is established and Atomic Swaps become more stable, the Bitcoin Economy will be easily integrated into other blockchain networks as it continues to become more efficient.A major lack of patience is what caused the Bitcoin Cash chain to continue running after the Bitcoin Cash Hard-Forks From Bitcoin (August 2017) \u2014 that and the sometimes uncontrollable characteristic of human-greed.Anyway, let\u2019s dive into Ripple and how this centralized blockchain network may have the ability to garner Visa, MasterCard\u2019s, or any other Credit Card Processing company\u2019s business, and what type of price movement this could create for the Ripple (payment network).One of the pictures above displays that Ripple already has a much, much lower fee than the distributed Bitcoin network and Visa\u2019s current fee schedule. Even Bitcoin\u2019s currently inefficient network beats Visa\u2019s payment processing fees. Ripple has a highly-dedicated team of Finance and experienced technology professionals fueling their growth and they are either aiming to integrate with credit card processors like Visa OR simply take their market-share. Either way, it should be interesting to watch Ripple\u2019s price in the process!The sheer statistical figures below give us some interesting potential scenarios that I will have fun projecting below in this article!Okay so 16,600 Financial institution clients\u2026do we really need to go through every single stat? I don\u2019t think so\u2026we all know Visa owns a significant portion of the market so let\u2019s have fun diving into potential Ripple projections!According to CoinMarketCap\u2019s Ripple profile, there are currently 38,739,144,847 XRP in circulation with a total of 100 billion XRP in max supply, held by Ripple leadership and a fund of XRP used to ease the price growth of XRP as the company increases the volume and attention on their products. I will keep all figures the same as they are now in the projections below:38,739,144,847 XRP.$8,900,000,000,000 is Visa\u2019s yearly total payment processing volume.Now, keep in mind that Ripple will be used for payment PROCESSING. Meaning, Ripple will not always be held for the entire time it is being used to send value, right? For example, you or I might send U.S. Dollar to somebody in Europe where the USD is instantly converted into XRP, sent to the final destination at a bank in Europe, and then settled in Euro (currency) or the proper tender in the country sent to. However, Visa will not be the only provider that would use Ripple, it would be major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan and other behemoths.Since Ripple is a Digital Currency/Virtual Currencies, financial institutions and especially Assets Under Management institutions can add it as an Asset Diversification strategy in their client Portfolios. So we don\u2019t know how much volume will be transacted in XRP by these institutions, so let\u2019s have some fun!$8,900,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= $229.742 XRP.Kind of cool to think about, heh? The equation above is IF Ripple\u2019s XRP captured ALL of the value of the Visa payment network, something unlikely to occur. However, as mentioned, Visa isn\u2019t the only company Ripple can serve. What about Mastercard?Interestingly, I could not find a single number that made sense to include in this article because one source says that Mastercard was processing $5.5 trillion in transactions as of 2003 and another source (image above) says 10\u2013years later, in 2013, Mastercard is processing $3.5 trillion \u2014 companies do not usually shrink over time, but maybe Visa or other payment processors took some Mastercard volume? I don\u2019t know, but let\u2019s use the $3.5 trillion figure from the image above.$3,500,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= $90.35 XRPIf, somehow, Ripple was able to capture all of the value of both Mastercard and Visa processing volume, XRP price might look something like below:$3,500,000,000,000 + $8,900,000,000,000= 12,400,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= $320.09 XRPKeep in mind, the Assets Under Management (AUM) market is currently a $71 trillion market as per PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)\u2019s Assets Under Management 2020: A Brave New World report, and expected to grow to $101 trillion by 2020. Considering Mastercard and Visa\u2019s payment processing equates to something like $12.4 trillion in annual volume, that\u2019s just a drop in the bucket compared to the large and separate $71 trillion AUM market.What if, say, all major asset funds used the \u20185% rule\u2019 to diversify into 5 different major currencies, one of them being Ripple\u2019s XRP? This assumption means that 1% of the overarching $71 trillion AUM market share would go to Ripple\u2019s XRP.0.01 x $71,000,000,000,000= $710,000,000,000 ($710 billion)Just the $710 billion would increase the $320.90 XRP price by:$710,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= $18.33 XRP$320.90 + 18.33= $339.23 XRPRemember, PwC projects the AUM market to reach $101 trillion by 2020, just 2-years away. What might this $18.33 price increase be if it were 1% of a $101 trillion market?0.01 x $101,000,000,000,000= $1,010,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= 26.07 XRP$320.90 + 26.07= 346.97 XRPThese are some pretty \u2018brave\u2019 and potentially over-zealous projections to make for Ripple\u2019s XRP price and is not meant to be taken as a forecast of what will happen or advice for that matter. You, me, nor anybody else truly knows what will happen in the future of this financial revolution we are currently in the process of experiencing and are an integral part of. However, the dynamics discussed in this article are potential forces that will affect the price of XRP in the potentially near-future.If you\u2019re interested in trading Ripple\u2019s XRP, you can find it at the following exchanges:Binance ExchangeCEX ExchangeEXMO ExchangeBittrexBitfinexKrakenHuobiPoloniexPlease clap for this article and follow my blog as I continue to write about various thought-provoking topics in the cryptocurrency market!

During the .com bubble this manifested itself in anything related to the internet soaring and companies like etoys.com or letsbuyit.com commanding hefty valuations only to later succumb to their fates. There is currently a very strong move going on in the cryptosphere which mirrors this bubble characteristic.Top 10 \u201cCoin\u201d Assets by TOTAL Supply market cap, Coinmarketcap.comLet\u2019s look at the current Top 10 Crypto \u201cCoins\u201d in market cap by total supply (ie not just circulating supply, which is a misrepresentation that is prevalent in the entire space, see my previous articles on the topic). I am not a coder at all, but even my simplest of technical minds is able to grasp the following example.The big surprise is that the highest market cap coin in the world is actually not bitcoin, but Ripple at this point in time. In short, Ripple aims to take the blockchain technology to large financial institutions in a scalable way in order to compete with and possibly replace SWIFT. Lofty goals for sure and the number and names of banks said to be clients of Ripple certainly lend some sort of credibility to the firm. However, it is important to note a few points regarding Ripple\u2019s valuation.The public blockchain of Ripple is currently valued at over $200bn or more than Goldman Sachs, Pfizer or General Electric (let that sink in for a second). This public blockchain currently has zero use for anyone. It is a centralized ledger and thereby unattractive to anyone believing in the crypto value proposition of decentralized, trustless transactions. It is in effect simply another centralized system not that different from SWIFT in many ways. The company behind Ripple owns c. 62% of the total Ripple supply directly (escrow not withstanding) and there are no decentralized miners. Other people far more qualified than myself have written about the reasons for decentralization, but suffice it to say, this key difference makes it impossible for Ripple to be valuable the way bitcoin is.Fair enough you might say, given Ripple has reportedly gained well-known financial institutions as clients, there is no need for Ripple to be decentralized in order for it to have enourmous value that might easily outshine bitcoin if the banking industry were to start using it as an alternative to SWIFT. Banks certainly won\u2019t mind centralization. While that is true, note that this has nothing whatsoever to do with the Ripple coins that you can buy on crypto exchanges and that constitute the market cap that currently ranks number one in the world above bitcoin. None of the banks will use the public blockchain as their means to transfer money. When they become clients of the company behind Ripple, they are asking them to build (or rather to explore building) a PRIVATE, in-house blockchain based on Ripple technology. To avoid any doubt, that blockchain, just like SWIFT will be internal to the banks and there will not be any transactions taking place from banks using the public Ripple blockchain. Yes, that might (this is a very small chance in my view) at some point still happen for some smaller banks, but it is not the likely use case and certainly not what is happening currently. Therefore at this point, \u201cdumb money\u201d mostly at home on Coinbase and some of the other \u201centry-level\u201d exchanges is currently attributing a valuation of $200bn+ to something that is quite literally hot air. None of this is to say that the team behind Ripple might not one day build a replacement for SWIFT, but let it sink in again that this has no relation whatsoever to the coin people are trading now. It is not equity in the Ripple company, it is a share in a useless network. (Edit: don\u2019t believe me? here s the FT: read)A final thought on Ripple for everyone who claims the protocol still has a value for people not minding the centralization who want fast and cheap transactions. To those people I say: use raiblocks \u2014 it is decentralized, lightning fast and most importantly free. There are no transaction fees. This value proposition is unlikely ever to be bettered by a for-profit organization\u2019s centralized public blockchain. Should that public blockchain (again \u2014 not the company\u2019s equity) really be worth more than Pfizer?! Let me throw in that Uber\u2019s latest investment round was valueing the company at just under $50bn. A fourth of the value of Ripple\u2019s useless coins.Some good commentary on this whole Ripple issue can be found in this discussion of Tone Vays and Jimmy Song from c. minute 6 onwards for 10 minutes or so: link. Also, a full cryptoscam episode here.Other coins with similar issues where the companies behind these coins might easily have an attractive product to offer to corporate clients, but suffering of very much the same issues as Ripple or where the entire coin very much looks like a scam that we can currently find in the Top 10 (!) of Crypto market cap are IOTA, Bitcoin Cash, ATMcoin and potentially Solarcoin. I have not done enough digging on the latter two, so they might be wrongly added to the list, but you can do your own research. Even just looking at the \u201cnormal\u201d Circulating supply market cap (basically the start page of coinmarketcap.com), you have several of these centralized, useless public chains as well as scams listed with $0.5bn+ valuations. To name a few, we can find Ripple, IOTA, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitconnect, Tether, Veritasaeum and Digibyte all in the Top 50.The fact that the market currently does not seem to distinguish between strong projects with coins that will actually have a use case and potentially a value to investors like Syscoin, Raiblocks, Monero, bitcoin, Sumokoin or Lisk and the aforementioned scams or useless \u201chot air\u201d token in terms of valuation shows only one thing: a lot of \u201cdumb money\u201d that buys anything blockchain related and hyped by potentially malignant actors with a hidden agenda (nota bene: this refers to pump and dump schemes, never to the people behind the projects) has recently entered the crypto markets. That is very often the final stage of a bubble and I do not believe that \u201cthis time is different\u201d.Crypto valuation levels are now getting relatively close to .com levelsCrypto and bitcoin adoption \u2014 How far along are we really in this rally?I recently read this interesting article by Ari Paul on Forbes, which basically argues that in terms of adoption of\u2026medium.comAn (Institutional) Investor\u2019s Take on CryptoassetsIMPORTANT NOTICE: This document is intended for informational purposes only. The views expressed in this document are\u2026medium.comI pasted the above two articles here as I try to use some small-town analytics in the first one to compare the .com bubble in size to the current crypto bubble and the second article is an excellent paper by John Pfeffer that clearly makes the case for the long term value of bitcoin and other crytpo assets coming to the same conclusion as myself (namely, bitcoin might be a rational addition to an investor\u2019s portfolio, but current valuation levels do not support any other crypto asset to be added).In the first article I conclude that the .com bubble was worth approximately $4trn, but that about 90% of that was institutional money. The share that is comparable to crypto is probably much smaller as the institutional side to crypto investing will need much clearer regulations and asset custody security to really take off. I am of the opinion this will happen only after the current, private individual-driven bubble bursts.At this point in time, the combined total supply market cap (ie not the circulating supply, but the supply that includes the founders/team\u2019s allocation of token, which is only sensible, please see an earlier aricle here) of all crypto assets has surpassed $1trn. That is one trillion US Dollars for \u201cassets\u201d that offer a share in network dynamics but no ownership in the underlying blockchains or development teams at all. I am not saying many of these projects won\u2019t disrupt the economy, much like the internet did, but they currently certainly are not (much like internet stocks did not yet in 1999/2000).That means the current bubble in crypto of $1trn compares to approximately $400bn fueled by private individuals in the .com bubble. As I say in my earlier article, of course the crypto assets are valuable so not all of this is bubble, but by now it is relatively safe to assume that the part of crypto valuations driven by bubble-mania has reached at least the level of the .com bubble in terms of private individuals\u2019 involvement. I encourage everyone to read John\u2019s excellent paper I linked above on the valuation aspect.The Coinbase issueWhat I describe as the Coinbase issue is a bit special to crypto. The management of digital assets is much more difficult at this stage for the individual user than it is to buy some stocks or even an ETF. There are things like wallets, cold storage, multiple different exchanges and transaction fee settings to worry about, aside from maneuvering the scams like VERI, John McAfee\u2019s coin shills or BCASH.Therefore, people caught in the mania typically buy whatever is easy for them to manage. This means that any coin (rumored to be) added to Coinbase, which is the world\u2019s most likely entry point exchange for most people starting off now, goes parabolic in price for no apparent reason. Ripple is an example of this, while BCash and Litecoin are others.This extends to public, established markets, where the Bitcoin Trust trades at a 20% to 150% premium to its underlying coin holdings (ie people are paying double the price to gain exposure to bitcoin via an easyily tradeable security than what they would have to pay if they simply bought bitcoin directly).Overall, the typical Coinbase user, in my opinion rarely invests in established assets like stocks, bonds and ETFs and might very well be making his or her first experiences with gaining money and losing money on Coinbase trading crypto. I remember well how agonizing and thrilling those times were for me. Currently however, this fraction of the market is dominating the moves of assets and no regulations are in place to prevent malicious behaviour (if crypto is not defined as an asset class like equities etc then insider trading and wash trading are actually not illegal and the market is currently aflush with these activities), so the results are sometimes downright scary. It does not help that mainstream financial media like CNBC, at times, look very much like beginners in the space as well.All of the above make me yet more certain that the current mania will not last and that we will see a massive correction before the cryptomarkets, much akin to Amazon, Ebay, Google or Facebook will truly take off after the wash out is over. It is, by the way, not a valid counter point to say that crypto has been called a bubble many times over and always came back stronger. There is no reason whatsoever the same asset (bitcoin for example) should not experience multiple bubbles after which it falls 80\u201390% and then recovers. So yes, I believe the earlier bitcoin bubbles where indeed also bubbles, but on a smaller (much smaller) scale. But that is debatable.The all important bitcoin price \u2014 where are we going now?I feel like this post would not be complete without updating my previous post on bitcoin price prediction below.Elliot Wave prediction for bitcoin price move from hereThis is to follow up with my earlier price prediction posts. In my last one I said that bitcoin would first correct to\u2026medium.comIn the article above I specifically said that bitcoin was at (in my opinion) the end of its current, years-long bull cycle and that a strong wave 5 (Elliot waves) was in process at the time. I went on to say that this wave was likely to take bitcoin above $15,000 and would be followed by a strong correction that should show the complete A-B-C pattern typical for Elliot Wave corrections. Bitcoin went a bit further up than predicted but sure enough started its correction. I have posted two updated charts below.Medium TermLong TermThe medium term chart is the more relevant in my view and shows two negative developments. Firstly, wave A (itself made up of a-b-c moves) is clearly in process and therefore a correction has begun. What is more worrying is that a Shoulder-Head-Shoulder (S-H-S) formation indicated by the red line has also been triggered with bitcoin falling below $13,500 (if it closes there today). The reasonable target for both wave A as well as the S-H-S is somewhere around $8,000 per bitcoin. Given this would also represent a c 60% correction from the highs, it should serve the market well in sweeping out all the \u201cweak hands\u201d that recently joined crypto and are buying indiscriminately across the board. Afterwards, a recovery to B should follow and a final sell off should test $6,000 to $8,000 levels again. I personally at the very least expect bitcoin to test the $10,000 level soon. With a lot of luck or tether printing it could turn around then and leave all my lower targets untouched.As always, I cannot be even remotely sure this is actually how it plays out, but I find it not too unlikely that this sequence of events is triggered by weak hands exiting (move to A), a few insitutions cautiously buying (move to B) and then government regulation causing another move down (to C). Also as always, given Tether can just conceive new US Dollars out of thin air at this point and push bitcoin price higher on its own, it is just as likely we take off to a new all time high from here, given we are still at the early stages of a very manipulative market.I fully expect the next wave of crypto assets to start making a mark in their respective industries after this correction and institutions to drive prices much higher than the current levels. I also want to re-iterate that I am generally positive on bitcoin and the cryptosphere, but at this point in time I would tread carefully.As always, a short but important disclaimer: none of what I write here is to be construed as advice to buy or sell any kind of asset. It is merely my personal and not my professional opinion. Any asset can go to zero. I also want to add that any negative opinions expressed about the blockchains of brilliant development teams are just that \u2014 opinions.

Lately I\u2019ve been getting a few questions from followers on why I\u2019m still holding XRP after the (~36,000%) returns in 2017, and why it\u2019s still the only digital asset I own. There are a few reasons which I\u2019m happy to share publicly:#Progress. Most people see MoneyGram\u2019s recent announcement to adopt XRP as a brave and spectacular management decision. But it really isn\u2019t. What alternatives are there? MoneyGram could keep on processing crossborder payments through SWIFT and the correspondant banking system, which takes days, is unpredictable, expensive and ties up some >$900MM in interest bearing liquidity. Or it could try and utilize eg Bitcoin, having transaction fees of around $20+, no settlement finality and whose throughput and scalability isn\u2019t anywhere close to allow for commercial implementations. So in the end, adopting XRP (4 second settlement time, 1500 transactions per second and fees of around 1/100th of a cent) is actually \u2018just\u2019 a very rational and economic decision. What\u2019s driving MoneyGram is also driving other money transmitters. So I do expect a constant and positive newsflow of XRP-adopting institutions in the upcoming months and years, fueled by a \u2018disclosure incentive\u2019:#DisclosureIncentive. Ripple continues to have a very strategic and long term approach when it comes to XRP. Working with financial institutions usually is a lenghty process, covered by non-disclosure-agreements (\u2018NDA\u2019). Note that first rumours of a MoneyGram partnership came up in 2015(!). As much as I understand the reason for NDA\u2019s, it does hold down market prices, because the public isn\u2019t aware of potential heavyweight partnerships and how the overall \u2018pipeline\u2019 looks like. But something remarkable happened recently. While cryptocurrencies had a negative connotation (\u2018bubble!\u2019), hindering corporates to disclose respective partnerships, they are now being rewarded by capital markets for making their ties to Ripple and XRP public. Recent examples are Seagate, WesternUnion, SBI Holdings, and MoneyGram.#UtilityValue. It\u2019s an unpopular view because XRP also profits from overall (rallying) market developments, but in my view it\u2019s almost certain that today\u2019s market for cryptocurrencies is in bubble territory: 1,380 cryptocurrencies are heavily traded, complexity is high, beliefs are strong, utility usually not in sight. All strong bubble indicators. I\u2019m not having a view when useless tokens finally disappear. Could be next week, could be 2020. Encouraging sign: with the world\u2019s second largest money transmitter planning (besides two other TOP5 names) to integrate XRP into its core payment flows, Ripple scored a \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d. Via Ripple\u2019s liquidity offering \u2018xRapid\u2019, XRP has reached a turning point, now building true utility value. Evidence is there, that xRapid already works for small Mexican money transmitter Cuallix (the first confirmed xRapid customer), including the desired impact on XRP. It\u2019s important for an investor, as natural buyers act as a downside protection. Imagine you are MoneyGram and need to transfer a $1MM payment from the US to Europe. Today you\u2019d need 500k XRP for it (XRP/USD = $2). If the exchange rate drops to $1.90, you\u2019d now need 526k XRP to bridge the next $1MM payment, generating 26k XRP outright demand, driving the exchange rate back up. Of course this also works in the other direction, but overall it entails stability. Decreasing volatility attracts a new set of financial institutions and corporates. And there are quite a few on the sidelines (~30,000 banks globally + a decent number of payment providers).#Potential. Speculative value is dominant in every crypto, including XRP. Utility value is hardly existant, maybe non-existant. As an investor I try to minimize my downside, so I like to think of a scenario in which all speculative value has vanished. How big could the utility value of a given crypto grow? XRP is unique in a way that its potential utility value by far exceeds today\u2019s market/ speculative value. XRP would need to bridge a fraction of today\u2019s $155tn annual crossborder payment volumes and/or to replace a fraction of the $27tn of stuck capital in global nostro accounts. I\u2019m not talking the dimension of eg a company that successfully built a global social network with some billions of quarterly ad-based revenues. I\u2019m talking about an asset that is intended to move around a share of the entire world\u2019s monetary value.#VirtuousCircle. Ripple is the biggest holder of XRP and also intends to use its pile to incentivize adoption. Ripple also incentivizes market makers to quote competitive spreads against XRP, so more payment volume is bridged through XRP, so network effects keep on building. In other words: every rise in XRP\u2019s price makes it more likely to succeed. Having a >$100bn (XRP equivalent) holder whose goal is to make XRP the world\u2019s primary value transfer vehicle is something very powerful.#Holders. The majority of XRP investors understand the overall strategy, and they are in it for the long run (enabling an even more powerful virtuous circle).#Hedge. To me XRP has become the perfect short/medium term hedge for every investor\u2019s portfolio. Interest rates are at historical lows. Global central banks are becoming more vocal on raising main refinancing rates. It\u2019ll make equities, bonds, commodities and real estate suffer at the same time once interest rates rise. It\u2019ll also make opportunity costs for $27tn of (stuck) capital in nostro accounts rise, which should put XRP in heavy *demand*. It\u2019s a second order effect, but it should enable you to watch everyone\u2019s net worth going down while yours is going up.", "responses": 9, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Xrp", "Ripple", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "What is Ripple?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@haydentiff/what-is-ripple-efc179bc02ae?source=search_post", "author_name": "Tiffany Hayden", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@haydentiff", "publish_date": "2017-05-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-14", "readtime": "3.20", "claps": 1353, "voters": 239, "content": "What is Ripple?A study guide for Cryptocoins NewsTiffany HaydenFollowMay 19, 2017 \u00b7 4 min read\u201cThe technical description of Ripple is rather ambiguous.\u201dIt was once said that it would take the average person around 6 months to fully understand Ripple. I have to agree. I can understand why people would shy away from putting in the effort. What I can\u2019t understand is why uninformed people keep choosing to write about it though. Hopefully, I can help clarify things a bit.To start, it\u2019s helpful to look at Ripple as something completely different from Bitcoin. Ripple is back-end infrastructure and not a consumer facing product. Ripple is not a currency. It\u2019s an open-source, global exchange. Anyone can access it and everyone has an equal right to use it. Ripple, the company, does not control the network, collect fees, or limit access.Ripple is a distributed, real-time payment protocol for anything of value. It\u2019s a shared public database, with a built-in distributed currency exchange, that operates as the worlds first universal translator for money. Ripple is currency agnostic and has a foreign exchange component built right into the protocol. Ripple acts as a pathfinding algorithm to find the best route for a dollar to become a euro or airline miles to become Bitcoin. It will look at all the orders in the global order book. ANYBODY can put a bid-ask on anything of value. The Ripple protocol is designed to route every transaction to the cheapest price available in the market.XRPThere is a transaction fee to use the exchange (~.00001XRP) and it must be paid in XRP, the native asset of the network. This transaction fee is not collected by anyone; the XRP is destroyed and ceases to exist. Having a cost associated with ledger entries helps prevent ledger flooding attacks. Like Bitcoin, XRP has no counterparty risk. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP transactions clear in 4 seconds or less. XRP is a digital asset with verifiable mathematical properties, similar to how we can reliably verify gold as a substance made of 79 protons. XRP also serves as a currency of last resort that can bridge between any currency, asset, or thing of value in the world. If every currency is liquid to XRP, it is also liquid to other currencies. By design, 100 billion XRP were created at Ripple\u2019s inception, and per the protocol rules, no more XRP can ever be created.Nostro AccountsTied-up capital accounts for more than 80% of payment costs for every industry. Worldwide, businesses have more than $27 trillion in capital sitting idle in nostro accounts. Ripple aims to free up this capital by using its global exchange as a market place for float. Financial brokers, market makers, anyone, really, can offer up their cash positions. With a marketplace for cash inventory, businesses no longer need to keep funded positions in every country they send payments to. This also means that the payments will be sent from a local provider, allowing businesses to avoid hitting the international SWIFT rail, which is expensive, slow, and doesn\u2019t scale.Global SettlementThe global foreign exchange market does $5.7 trillion per day and that\u2019s the market Ripple is after. Ripple Consensus Ledger can handle 1,000 transactions per second and XRP Payment Channels allow transaction throughput to increase to tens of thousands of transactions per second, bringing scalability to the same level as Visa.XRP is not the core utility of Ripple. External currencies are the focus of the protocol. Ripple is a global settlement network.There\u2019s been a lot of quasi-religious Bitcoin nonsense spewed, ever since the price of XRP started to rise. Alleged free market capitalists are horrified that Ripple, the company, wants to make a profit and doesn\u2019t plan to distribute XRP in any sort of socialist, utopian manner.Because Ripple is a payment network first and foremost, XRP will be used to make the network as healthy as possible, which will most likely mean managing liquidity with XRP.", "responses": 21, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Blockchain", "Ripple", "Hypocricy", "Fintech"]}, {"title": "XRP is now available on Coinbase", "post_link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/xrp-is-now-available-on-coinbase-d884e33fa8b7?source=search_post", "author_name": "Coinbase", "author_link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/@coinbaseblog", "publish_date": "2019-02-28", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-01", "readtime": "1.16", "claps": 1216, "voters": 220, "content": "XRP is now available on CoinbaseCoinbaseFollowFeb 28 \u00b7 2 min readStarting today, Coinbase supports XRP at Coinbase.com and in the Coinbase Android and iOS apps.

After launching their blockchain in 2012, Ripple Labs has been working with financial organizations to build one of the largest payment networks in the ecosystem, proving one of the first B2B use cases for the fledgling industry.Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have used this as a sign that XRP will be very valuable in the future. In order for these financial institutions to run any operation on the blockchain, they need to spend a small amount of XRP to complete the transaction. And according to the market, this means high value for XRP:Just this year, the value of XRP has grown from below $.01 per token to it\u2019s currency price of $.25, a 25X jump that rivals even the growth of BTC.So why would someone believe that XRP wouldn\u2019t be worth very much in the future? In this article, I\u2019m going to make the case that despite Ripple Labs impressive growth and strong partnership network, XRP has already become obsolete due to the emergence of permissioned blockchains in their market.What is Ripple?Before we can understand the problem, we need to understand what the Ripple does. Ripple is an open-source, semi-permissioned blockchain run by Ripple labs. On the surface, there\u2019s a lot that Ripple offers that\u2019s not too different form other blockchain applications: It has a distributed ledger, a variety of wallet applications and a native asset, XRP.Where Ripple decided to differentiate itself from blockchains like Bitcoin is in it\u2019s use of gateways, issuance and trust lines. Here is a basic overview of these features:A blockchain gateway is feature to allow for transfer of non-native assets (blockchain or otherwise) onto a particular blockchain. This includes a bank being able to lock USD, Yen, or even another blockchain asset like BTC/LTC and be able to transact with it on the Ripple Network.An issuance is a method for an individual account holder on the blockchain to \u2018lock\u2019 a particular asset (let\u2019s say Gold) on the blockchain ledger. Similar to a gateway, after an issuance is made to the blockchain, you can then send it to other accounts, thus taking advantage of Ripple low fees.Trust lines are Ripple\u2019s way of securing issuance transactions between individual parties. As opposed to XRP, which can be sent to anyone, an issuance can only be sent to parties who both agree to open a line of communication. So while I can send and receive XRP from anyone in the world, I can only send the gold I claim to have to accounts that actually trust my word.These three features are special, because they gave Ripple the momentum to move into the financial world in a big way. By allowing banks to create their own network of partners and allow them to transact assets on the blockchain, they introduced a new way to cut transaction costs.This is the secret sauce behind Ripple\u2019s success: by being able to create low cost transactions on the network, financial institutions were able to take advantage of the blockchain. And by using XRP to secure every transaction, Ripple gave a powerful incentive for these institutions to use XRP.Who Is Ripple\u2019s Competition?In the emerging blockchain industry, every value driver is creating a small industry. Monero and Zcash are leading the way for the privacy focused cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, NEM, Waves and a plethora of other blockhains are competing to be the top platform blockchain. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are competing to be the \u2018top\u2019 cryptocurrency overall. There are other markets forming as well.When you look at the market for Ripple and try to find their competitors, something odd jumps out. Despite being one of the oldest cryptocurrencies with the clearest use case, there are surprising lack of direct competitors for financial payments\u2026 at least financial payments for large corporate banks. Platforms easily have 20+ blockchains all competing for Ethereum\u2019s place, but Ripple only seems to be competing with the Stellar Network and few other organizations. For as mature as Ripple is in the ecosystem, you would expect more. So where are Ripple\u2019s competitors?It turns out that Ripple has very stiff competition\u2026 but you\u2019re not going to find them on CryptoMarketCap. Ripple\u2019s chief competition today is coming from the new class of cryptocurrencies called \u2018permissioned blockchains\u2019. As opposed to permission-less system, where anyone globally can join, permissioned blockchains require an invitation from an organization before you\u2019re allowed to join.Today, there are a handful of permissioned blockchains that are offering similar services that Ripple offers. These organizations include R3 Corda, Hyperledger, the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) and SWIFT(Ripple\u2019s chief rival, at least according to Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas). These businesses are creating products similar enough to Ripple\u2019s feature set and partnership network that these organizations constitute the financial payment network market.Why Ripple\u2019s Market Matters for XRPIf you accept that Ripple\u2019s competitors are permissioned blockchains, then it\u2019s useful to compare their features to understand how, say, SWIFT\u2019s blockchain payment network might be more useful than Ripple. One thing that jumps out immediately about every permissioned blockchain is that these networks don\u2019t have native assets, despite offering the same basic services that Ripple can offer.Here\u2019s a statement about SWIFT and considering native asset:One area SWIFT will not be considering is generating its own digital assets, or cryptocurrency, Grainger said. This is at odds with other cross-border payment services, notably Ripple, whose digital currency XRP is used to conduct payments over its distributed ledger network.Here\u2019s another analysis from Philipp Sandner, comparing Hyperledger, Corda and Ethereum:Even Ethereum through the EEA are creating permissioned blockchains (such as JP Morgan\u2019s Quorum) that do not require the need for native assets.If part of the market was split, and only half the market had native assets, this might be less odd. Diesel engines were still produced even after alternatives appeared on the market. But that fact that every major competitor has opted out of having a native asset, one that has allowed Ripple to control billions in value through XRP, signals a change in the market.What A Lack Of Native Assets MeanLet\u2019s think about the implications of this: strong competition has appeared in the market, as to be expected. But instead of creating a native asset to secure the network, these competitors have decided to use another method (Native Identity Management, in this case) that secures the network. These blockchains can offer similar features without the need for an XRP-like component.We can argue whether SWIFT, R3 Corda or Hyperledger really have a better set of features than Ripple, but that is beside the point. What these projects have shown by universally disregarding native assets is that that component of Ripple is no longer required to provide value. It\u2019s an obsolete component of Ripple\u2019s blockchain. In the same way that CD drives were slowly eliminated from new PC\u2019s after flash drives became more common, native assets for blockchain payment networks have a better alternative.Even if Ripple remains the best payment network for financial institutions, XRP remains a vestige of what Ripple Labs thought the market would become. But the market changed. Ripple\u2019s competitors will get better and strong, and financial institutions will start considering alternatives, with XRP sticking out as a sore thumb. Even if Ripple is the best, it is not because XRP offers some great advantage. If anything, it\u2019s an additional cost that none of their competitors will have.How Does This Affect XRP?Ripple still has a better partnership network, a more mature product line and strong leadership. But with competitors like IBM and R3 Corda entering the industry, it is only a matter of time before the competition will get stronger. In this race, XRP offers no competitive advantage and only represents an additional cost.At the end of the day, Ripple Labs is valuable because of their ability to provide great value to financial institution. But if an organization like SWIFT begins to win the market, Ripple Labs will be forced to respond. As Ripple already owns 55% of all XRP, it would be easy for their organization to either sell XRP as a market discount, or give it away entirely to new organizations who want to join their network. Increasing the price of XRP does not strengthen their position in winning the financial institutions market. When competition get intense, XRP will be one of the first factors to be eliminated, either through devaluing XRP significantly or giving it away entirely.This is ultimately the fate of XRP is: at best, a potential incentive to have new organizations join their business, at worst, an additional cost that is completely eliminated by giving away XRP (or close to it). In either case, the value of XRP is simply not supported by it\u2019s use case and will be unlikely to retain it\u2019s value.", "responses": 15, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ripple", "Xrp", "Ripple Currency Problem", "Permissioned Blockchains"]}, {"title": "XRP Is A Cryptocurrency Like The USS Zumwalt Is A Boat", "post_link": "https://code.likeagirl.io/xrp-is-a-cryptocurrency-like-the-uss-zumwalt-is-a-boat-3b25be5226b8?source=search_post", "author_name": "Tiffany Hayden", "author_link": "https://code.likeagirl.io/@haydentiff", "publish_date": "2017-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-13", "readtime": "4.26", "claps": 1256, "voters": 179, "content": "XRP Is A Cryptocurrency Like The USS Zumwalt Is A BoatTiffany HaydenFollowSep 14, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readImage stolen and altered from a presentation given by Stefan Thomas.XRP is a cryptographically secured digital asset with verifiable mathematical properties, similar to how we can reliably verify gold as a substance made of atoms with 79 protons. The XRP ledger\u2019s headers are like Bitcoin\u2019s block headers, both chain & incorporate transactions by hash.]The XRP Ledger is a cryptographic system. Accounts are identified by cryptographic identities. Transactions are authorized by cryptographic signatures matching these identities. Users can use cryptographically signed transactions to store and transfer almost anything (euros, gold, company shares, etc).Among other things, XRP is a cryptocurrency.By design, 100 billion XRP were created at Ripple\u2019s inception and, per the rules of the protocol, no more XRP can ever be created. Transactions are verified through Consensus, in which the entire network agrees on the same ledger. All of this happens independent of a central bank.Some people claim that XRP is \u201cpre-mined.\u201d That\u2019s inaccurate. Ripple Consensus does not involve proof-of-work (commonly referred to as \u201cmining\u201d) therefore XRP cannot be \u201cpremined.\u201dCryptocurrencies are created from code by coders. Crypotcurrencies are not divine gifts from God. Whoever conceives of the idea has full control over distribution. It\u2019s the philosophical underpinning of a new currency that determines whether the first 5% will be \u201cmined\u201d right away by its creator, while everyone else is forced to jump through hoops for the next 131 years, or whether the new currency will be generated and available immediately, or somewhere in between.It has also been said that \u201creal\u201d cryptocurrencies have their own blockchain. XRP meets this requirement. It exists natively on the XRP Ledger as a counterparty-free asset, similar to Bitcoin. XRP forms a core part of its blockchain as part of an incentive scheme. There is a transaction fee to use the XRP Ledger (~.0001XRP) and it must be paid in XRP. This transaction fee is not collected by anyone; the XRP are destroyed and cease to exist. Having a cost associated with ledger entries helps prevent ledger flooding attacks.https://ripple.com/xrp/XRP consistently handles 1,500 transactions per second, 24x7, and can scale to handle the same throughput as Visa. (50,000 transactions per second, as of July 15, 2017.)XRP transaction fee = 1/100th of a cent!UTILITYXRP comes with a utility that most people fail to recognize. Aside from providing an anti-spam mechanism, XRP comes equipped with GPS! The XRP Ledger has a pathfinding algorithm designed to route every transaction to the cheapest possible path. It\u2019s currency agnostic and even has a built-in foreign exchange component.To illustrate how important (and unsolved) pathfinding is for other projects, take a look at misguided comment by Greg Maxwell\u2019s (Blockstream CTO) about using Ripple\u2019s pathfinding method for the Lightning Network. (Hint: They can\u2019t.)https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/43kyev/greg_maxwell_accidentally_tells_the_truth/czjh0s5/XRP was designed as a settlement asset. It\u2019s quick, scalable, and cheap. While banks may use the Ripple network to swap their own private IOUs, only a digital asset without counter-party risk can provide instant settlement.So Much FUDXRP CANNOT BE FROZEN!The XRP Ledger has no administrative functions.Issuers of assets (IOUs) on the XRP Ledger can freeze their own assets, but XRP is not an issuance and nobody can freeze it. Additionally, Ripple can\u2019t freeze ANYTHING because Ripple doesn\u2019t issue assets.https://ripple.com/build/freeze/Ripple doesn\u2019t issue any assets on the ledger and there are no trust lines that end at Ripple.The XRP Ledger is a tool, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain. KYC tools cannot be built into a global ledger because nobody has that kind of jurisdiction. Any business that chooses to build on either of these protocols is responsible for complying with their jurisdiction\u2019s anti-money-laundering regulations and they would add compliance features ON TOP OF THE PROTOCOL.Permissioned? Hell no.Similar to the Blockchain, the XRP Ledger is an open-source protocol, with globally distributed validators. Anyone can access the protocol and everyone has an equal right to use it. It\u2019s a system with no central authority. Ripple does not control the network, collect fees, or limit access.Moreover, Ripple validators do not have the ability to censor transactions. The rules of the protocol determine whether or not a transaction is valid. Validators order transactions using deterministic rules. They do not have the power to make arbitrary decisions.With Bitcoin, however, miners have complete freedom to select which transactions to include in a block.Anybody who wants to participate in the network is free to do so. Running a Ripple validator is similar to running a Bitcoin full node. By running your own, you don\u2019t have to rely on somebody else. Ripple doesn\u2019t pay people to run validators, so rent-seekers will have to look elsewhere.Setting up a validator is easy. My validator synced to the network in 130 seconds and proposed in 401 ledgers before I finished my beer.Cheers!", "responses": 9, "tags": ["Xrp", "Bitcoin", "Blockchain", "Codelikeagirl", "Tech Talk"]}, {"title": "Create a Material Design ripple effect without JS", "post_link": "https://codeburst.io/create-a-material-design-ripple-effect-without-js-9d3cbee25b3e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vaibhav Khulbe", "author_link": "https://codeburst.io/@vaibhavkhulbe", "publish_date": "2018-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-19", "readtime": "3.87", "claps": 646, "voters": 158, "content": "Create a Material Design ripple effect without JSGoodbye JavaScript \ud83d\udc4bVaibhav KhulbeFollowJun 15, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readGIF credits: GiphyOkay, so this one will be real quick to implement.

I used to think \u201cWhy do we even need such a language which had lots of declarations, loops, functions and what not while making just the front-end of a website?\u201d .

This is the only point, no JS only CSS, and uh, of course HTML\u2026What is a Material Design\u2754Honestly, this design theme is brought to you by Google years back at their Google I/O 2014 event. Now you\u2019re using this theme on your Android smartphones, some websites and yes, all other \u2018Googly\u2019 things from sometime. It\u2019s like some flat elements on top of a website or app, but it\u2019s not limited to that.What exactly \u2018Material\u2019 means?Well, if we were to believe Envato,Google\u2019s Material design considers material to be a homogeneous digital \u201cfabric\u201d created with pixels. Users can tap, swipe, or pinch this material fabric and it will move according to user interaction.You can learn more about the same in Daniel Hollick\u2019s blog post or refer to Google Design publication.What will I need? \ud83d\udee0\ufe0fH\u0338a\u0338m\u0338m\u0338e\u0338r\u0338 \u0338a\u0338n\u0338d\u0338 \u0338w\u0338r\u0338e\u0338n\u0338c\u0338h\u0338Your already wonderful HTML and CSS skills.A text editor (I\u2019ll be using Atom just because for my last tutorial on Flutter I used VS Code\u2026)Shall we\u2026ripple?You don\u2019t really need to blow your fingers like that\u2026 GIF credits: GiphyLet\u2019s do what we had done before. Create a folder, add two files namely index.html and style.css. Start with HTML. I hope you\u2019re already familiar with Atom\u2019s shortcuts. I think this one is really handy:Just start typing \u2018html\u2019 and hit enter when you see the autocomplete. Smooth!Now we have the most basic structure of a HTML file you can think of. A head, a title, a meta and the body tag. First, we gonna link our CSS file in this. That means, using <link rel=\u201dstylesheet\u201d href=\u201dstyle.css\u201d> inside our <head>. Give it a suitable <title> like Material Ripple Effect.We\u2019ll now add a class, say container in the <body> . Just like this:Another cool feature of Atom :\u2019) Type \u2018div.class\u2019, hit tab and there you have it.Inside this container class, we\u2019ll add a button element. Don\u2019t forget to add a class like class=\u201dbtn ripple\u201d . Both the btn and ripple will be used individually in our styling.At last, this will be our final HTML code:Let\u2019s hover to styling. All the materialistic magic will happen here. I\u2019ll only write what all you need to make the button materialistic on click. So, your style.css file should have the following:Container: display property set to flex to make it of same length regardless of the content.Ripple: transform property set to translate3d to define a 3D translation.Ripple-after: this is where the ripple effect ends. We can show something like a text but it doesn\u2019t make sense here. Therefore the content has been set to \"\".background-image's value has been set to the radial-gradient function which takes in a circle as its shape, #fff or white as the start-color and last-color as transparent 10.01%.transition is used along with transform with its corresponding timing and opacity.If that felt too overwhelming for you in first go, try to implement the same again and use the documentation links to dive deeper in those elements. Obviously, there is some more code other than this. Take a look at our final style.css file:That\u2019s it! No JS! Run the .html in your favorite web browser and see for yourself. You\u2019ll have a container and a button with Material ripple effect!Where to next? \ud83e\udd14You can experiment more with the .container, .ripple, .ripple:after and .ripple:active:after in your style sheet. Or if you want to be more like a ninja \ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\udc64, you can tell me how to start the ripple from different places on the button. Like, if I click on lower left side of the button, the ripple should originate from there.The source code for this project is hosted on GitHub (and not GitLab \ud83d\ude09):Kvaibhav01/Ripple-without-JSRipple-without-JS - Create Material Design ripple effect in your HTML without using a single line of JavaScript code.github.comYou can now see LIVE DEMO here, thanks to GitHub Pages.Liked this story?

Many cryptocurrency experts believe it will take another ten years before this form of currency goes mainstream.However, cryptocurrencies are already making their way quickly into society and although skeptcism is still a barrier to adoption, the road to trust and real-world utility is getting shorter as many cryptocurrency projects prove to the world their real-world use cases, such as Ripple\u2019s XRP for inter-banking transfers and remittances. XRP is of great benefit to those who send money back home to their families in developing countries by drastically reducing the cost of remittances.Last month, Ripple announced a partnership with MoneyGram which serve millions of people who send money to their families. In their press release, they claimed they would reduce the fees for remittances from circa $30 to fractions of a penny.Non-governmental organisations are catching on as well. They have begun to see the benefits of accepting crypto donations and some of the most reputable in existence have gradually gone from scepticism and wariness to trust and confidence.Only 1% of NGOs currently accept cryptoStill, only 1% of organisations currently accept cryptocurrency as donations, according to a 27-page 2018 Global NGO Technology Report.\u201cWhile 72% of the 5,352 NGOs surveyed accept website donations, only 1% accept (cryptocurrencies),\u201d the report reads. \u201cEarly adopters of cryptocurrencies will gain an advantage in a fundraising landscape that is increasingly competing for new donors.\u201dThe report anticipates, however, that although, \u201ccredit cards, PayPal, and direct debit are the most accepted forms of payment \u2026 digital wallets and cryptocurrency, are likely to become more widely accepted in the coming years.\u201dA rise in cryptocurrency prices may also spark donations. That was the case in late December 2017, when Bitcoin peaked. At that time, the Pineapple Fund, a philanthropic project created by an anonymousindividual, donated 5,104 Bitcoin to 60 NGOs.Ahead of the gameLate last year, Blake Rizzo, head of charity affairs for Tour de Crypto, said NGOs that accept cryptocurrencies are ahead of the game. He mentioned Houston Area Women\u2019s Centre (HAWC), for example, who accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero.\u201cThey (NGOs) are immediately able to tap into a previously-formed, global social media network of crypto enthusiasts that are searching for ways to do good and promote mass adoption through good intentions,\u201d Rizzo added.Rizzo agrees that as the cryptocurrency industry further matures, more donations will pour into NGOs, who have to prepare for this in order to stay ahead of the fundraising game.Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong told Hacker Noon before becoming involved in crypto, he had \u201cspent about a decade of my careerworking on social problems like global poverty, and my first reaction wasskepticism.\u201dOn the riseIn November 2018, Forbes wrote that \u201ccharities accepting crypto donations is on the rise. UNICEF began accepting crypto in March 2018.\u201dThe following is a list of some of the notable organisations that according to Bitcoin Wiki accept cryptocurrency donations, mostly in Bitcoin.The Charities Aid Foundation wrote a 22-page report praising blockchain as a revolutionary way to make NGOs more transparent and bring trust back to philanthropic organisations.In the paper, the CAF said they had previously explored \u201cthe potential opportunities and risks for charities and donors associated with the rise of cryptocurrencies.\u201dHowever, CAF say the \u201cmost interesting thing about the current crop of cryptocurrencies is not actually the currencies themselves, but rather the mechanism that underpins them: blockchain.\u201dThe organisation spoke of how blockchain and smart contracts could \u201coffer a form of radical transparency that can overcome public scepticism and lack of trust.\u201dTaking it one step furtherCurrently, many organisations have implemented blockchain, but only one on record has taken it a step further by mining cryptocurrency, implementing blockchain and accepting donations in crypto.Ubuntu Pathways recently announced its association with Electroneum and their cryptocurrency ETN, which they mine for block rewards they use to further their cause in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, where for over 20 years they have delivered long-term assistance to thousands of children and their families.The organisation, which channels over 80% of the donations it receives to their work on the ground, have received recognition from many international personalities, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu (1984 Nobel Peace Prize) and former US President Bill Clinton.\u201cWe were initially very skeptical about cryptocurrencies,\u201d says Beth Honig, UK Director for Ubuntu Pathway. \u201cThere are so many scams out there, and we personally heard of so many bad actors out there that we were hesitant to work with crypto.\u201dHonig also says that immediately after announcing Ubuntu\u2019s association with Electroneum, the organisation have received overwhelming support from the public.\u201cThe response has been amazing across all media platforms. Visits to our website of people interested in donating have doubled as has engagement across all our social media platforms,\u201d she said. \u201cIn less than 24 hours, we\u2019ve had people pledging to make donations in crypto.\u201dWhile cryptocurrency is making its way into many sectors of society, the likes of Electroneum and Ubuntu Pathways, as well as XRP and MoneyGram, to mention only a couple, are leading the way in helping people in developing countries live more.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum", "Likecoin"]}, {"title": "Meet The Crypto Billionaires Getting Rich From Ripple\u2019s XRP", "post_link": "https://medium.com/forbes/meet-the-crypto-billionaires-getting-rich-from-ripples-xrp-b5fce50c84c1?source=search_post", "author_name": "Forbes", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@forbes", "publish_date": "2018-01-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-14", "readtime": "3.02", "claps": 837, "voters": 127, "content": "Psst... there\u2019s an audio version of this story.

The path to QRC status will need to include demonstrable growth within the following areas:Liquidity and market makersInstitutional derivatives that would allow banks to hedge foreign exchange exposure on their balance sheetOn-boarding financial institutions onto xCurrent + xRapid in both exotic and non-exotic corridorsShort Term XRP Trading AnalysisThe crypto space is in a speculative \u201cfrothy\u201d frenzy currently. Under these circumstances, fundamental analysis becomes less important in the short term since speculators will trade on emotion and greed compared to fundamentals. Pugilist made an XRP trading recommendation to our internal investor network right after we released our report last month. We stated that despite XRP\u2019s long term hurdles, their price action and technical analysis charts were setting up nicely for a price spike. At that time, XRP was trading between $0.25 \u2014 $0.30. We did not forecast a specific price target given we don\u2019t own a crystal ball, but we did see an interesting dichotomy forming.DichotomyPugilist Ventures maintains its speculative fundamental evaluation AND positive short term trading view for XRP; simultaneously. Furthermore, if XRP maintains its exponential growth during 2018, then its long term fundamentals may change for the positive according to the Theory of Reflexivity a la George Soros.Reflexivity TheoryBy simple definition, Reflexivity is a three part process whereby an asset\u2019s price increase drives investor expectations higher which positively changes the asset\u2019s fundamentals, resulting in further price appreciation. Rinse and repeat.Reflexivity for XRPReflexive price appreciation and expectations may substantially increase demand and mainstream adoption for XRP. For example, imagine if XRP supersedes bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) market cap in 2018. This speculative demand spike would dramatically increase liquidity and potential derivatives coverage, which would help Ripple on-board more banks (fewer objections to adoption) onto xCurrent + xRapid, thus improving XRP\u2019s fundamentals, i.e. the path to QRC status.SummaryXRP is being driven primarily by speculation in our opinion. However, this speculation may actually increase the long term probability of success for XRP by increasing market liquidity, derivatives coverage, and mainstream adoption as medium of exchange and store of value; while planting the seeds of a future QRC debate. All of which provide fuel to Ripple\u2019s most important business goal of growing financial institutions using both xCurrent and xRapid for global payments. Only time shall tell if this path bears fruit for Ripple and XRP.\u2014 \u2014 Disclaimer: Neither the author of this article, nor Pugilist Ventures, provide investment, financial, or legal advice.

The insinuation being: \u201cif this piggy doubles after listing, you could pocket a cool $100mm in the trade.\u201dLess standard by public equities standards, but this dynamic isn\u2019t unique in crypto.Earlier this week, Autonomous Research published a report that claimed the average listing fee charged by top crypto exchanges stretched up to $3mm, 10x what you\u2019d expect in the public markets.The problem is crypto companies tend to want things both ways.Act like a securities offerer when it\u2019s convenient from a capital formation perspective or when you\u2019re doling out \u201cfounders\u2019 rewards\u201d. Pretend you\u2019re actually selling a currency or commodity when it becomes markedly less convenient from an investor disclosures standpoint.There\u2019s a reason for public equities listing fees, by the way. They usually carry with them the expectation that listees will be regulated and subject to some level of standardized reporting. They only get to list in the first place if they\u2019ve abided by widely accepted rules.In that case, I suppose we should welcome this week\u2019s news!I look forward to working with Ripple on standardizing disclosures around how they (and other token teams) manage their treasuries.I\u2019m sure board members like Gene Sperling (former Economic Advisor to Presidents Clinton and Obama) and Ben Lawsky (creator of the infamous NYS BitLicense) would push fervently for better disclosures around XRP\u2019s treasury management and distribution.Especially given Lawsky\u2019s mandate at the company:Here\u2019s a starting point for disclosures:+ How is Ripple paying its strategic partners? What are the terms with respect to discounts, lock-ups, etc? How do the rebate programs work for companies testing XRP? Are they like Coinbase offers\u2026free money \u201cloans\u201d?+ Why did the company implement a programmatic selling program where they aimed to sell 25 bps of global XRP volume per quarter only to ratchet that back in Q4? Did the $91.5mm in XRP sales look like it might set off alarms, so they stopped short of selling $300mm?+ Why does the company write about XRP price appreciation as if it\u2019s a milestone? Why do they do little to tamp down speculation around XRP enterprise adoption? No, why do they actively insinuate big news is coming by writing things like \u201cXRP markets began to connect the dots once again?\u201d+ What are Ripple\u2019s insider trading policies with respect to XRP? Are any employees or advisors paid in XRP? If so, what are the terms?It might seem annoying to pester the company like this, and indeed it would be more convenient to approach their marketing team \u2014 who is doubling as investor relations, but we can\u2019t call it that \u2014 to answer these questions in private.But the company is managing a \u201cbridge currency\u201d that they package to retail investors, who buy on the assumption that they are front-running big bank purchasers.That makes this a public conversation. How about an analyst call, Brad?****Note: I hope they will sit down with a real journalist soon and answer macro questions about their policies. A good interviewer wouldn\u2019t let them off the hook because \u201cconfidentiality agreements.\u201d NDAs prevent a company from discussing specific deals. They do not preclude you from discussing general distribution strategy. That cop out should be called out.*Speaking of disclosures, I wanted to write more about an A+ post from Meltem Demirors re investor disclosures in crypto, but I got carried away with the XRP stuff.

Several Iranian government officials have publicly called for Telegram to be banned in the country, believing the platform shouldn\u2019t be the country\u2019s dominant social app. Their main concern is linked to national security, since the assumption is that the app played an undeniable role in igniting the December 2017 protests across the country. In response, Iran\u2019s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani declared his opposition to such a ban, noting that blocking access to messaging platforms was not a solution.

China\u2019s crypto ban in late 2017 resulted in the boom of underground traders known as \u201cbitcoin mules\u201d. These traders buys cryptocurrencies in other markets (such as Thailand or Japan) and sells them at a premium to investors in China, who cannot otherwise get them. Aside from the geographical arbitrage, the traders also exploit lesser known exchanges by buying cryptocurrencies cheaply on lesser-known exchanges and selling them for a profit on more liquid and widely used platforms. With the downturn in recent crypto markets combined with the flood of traders in the space, the premium for crypto has fallen from 30\u201340% at its height to around 7% or so.

The interesting thing about Ripple technology is its currency independence. Basically, a transaction in the Ripple network can be processed in any currency imaginable. In this way, Ripple wants to solve a fundamental problem in the international monetary system. This is because complicated currency exchanges lead to high fees, especially for transactions across national borders, and banks must remain constantly liquid and have so-called Nostro accounts in the receiving countries. (I get commissions for purchases made through links in this post.)The technology behind RippleRipple plays a special role in the world of blockchain technologies. While other projects follow a path that rejects the classical banking system, Ripple tries to cooperate with them. To this end, RippleLabs, the organization behind Ripple, has launched several products, xRapid, xCurrent and xVia, which can be used by banks to process their global transactions. The XRP token, which is used to process the transactions, serves as the bridge currency in the Ripple network.In plain text, this means that an input currency is exchanged in XRP and transmitted over the network prior to a transaction. Once it reaches the recipient, it is exchanged back into the output currency. This means that transactions in two different currencies are also possible. XRP is currently the only coin used in RippleNet. Nevertheless, it would theoretically be possible for banks to create their own coins and use them in the network.So-called gateways operate in the network and take on the role of intermediaries. These have the function of an intermediate station that receives an incoming payment and forwards it accordingly. A transaction can also run over several gateways. This is even the rule, especially in the case of a currency change. As soon as a transaction in the ripple network runs across several gateways, the borrower\u2019s notes (IOUs \u2014 \u201cI owe you\u201d) are created that must be settled by the subsequent party. This allows transactions to be quickly routed through the network without having to wait for the IOUs to settle.The Function of the XRP TokenAs already mentioned, the XRP tokens are used for currency balancing and payment of transaction fees. Each transaction is subject to a fee of 0.00001 XRP, which is then destroyed and no longer available. This is to avoid spam attempts in the highly frequented RippleNet. In this context, the transaction fee is often referred to as 10 drops. A drop is the smallest unit in relation to the XRP token. It is important to know that XRP is not mined, but is already fully distributed. A total of 100 billion XRP were issued, of which 63 billion are owned by RippleLabs. The XRPs held serve to finance the project and network.The XRP token is independent of the organization behind Ripple and will continue to exist even if RippleLabs closes. As with a traditional SWIFT transfer, a transaction with XRP involves some price risk and is affected by price fluctuations. However, since an average transaction in RippleNet is completed after approximately 5 seconds, the risk of a strong fluctuation is significantly lower than with a SWIFT transfer that takes several days. Investors and users can save their XRP in the official online wallet, but also unofficial desktop wallets.The Functionality of the ProtocolMost modern payment systems are based on trust in the state or in financial institutions such as banks. This applies in particular to digital accounts of government currencies, since the money is not possessed here in principle and an institution watches over the amount and disposes of it. Ripple is an attempt to transfer this mechanism of trust to digital currency by storing all transactions and liabilities between users and institutions in a public register.Behind this system are so-called IOUs. The abbreviation stands for the English phrase \u201cI owe (yo)u\u201d and is a kind of promissory note. In the Ripple Register, the user\u2019s promissory notes are stored, i.e. which person owes how much of which currency to another individual and vice versa. In addition to the debt system, the protocol also enables an extensive foreign exchange market in a similar way, which is constantly evolving.Advantages and Disadvantages of RippleAdvantages of the Ripple Protocol:Almost forgery-proofFast transactions within secondsOpen standardCan act in its final stage as a universal translator of any currencyEnables quick lending and borrowing of money amountsLoans by IOU (a type of promissory note)Simple connection of payment networksMany new possibilities due to maximum compatibilityDisadvantages of the Ripple protocol:Ripple not only had positive developments to report but the company behind the protocol, in particular, was often criticized for various business practices. Among others, it is stated that although the company promised to pass on a large proportion of the XRP to the users of the network, so far only small amounts have been transferred. In addition, Ripple Labs has retained nearly half of all existing XRP to benefit from value creation.Distribution of RippleRippleLabs\u2019 largest customers include the major Spanish bank Santander, American Express, UniCredit and Western Union. Some financial services providers also use technology for their internal transactions. All banks use Ripple to process their global transactions, saving up to 70% of the usual transaction and management fees. Most companies and banks use the xCurrent and xRapid products developed by RippleLabs, which directly address the complex needs of financial institutions.If you like what you read be sure to \u2665 it below \u2014 as a writer it means the world.

Two days prior to that, Laura Shin tweeted a link to an episode of her podcast (Unchained) where she was joined by Ryan and Matt Leising:This was my first experience observing the XRP Army on the attack. To get a better sense of what that entails, I would encourage you to scroll through the replies to Laura\u2019s tweet (there are hundreds!). I have included a few of those replies below:On May 10th, 2018, Ryan shared some thoughts re: XRP/Ripple:Ripple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, replied (almost immediately) with this tweet:Ryan\u2019s Twitter account was hacked at some point later that day. Given the timing, I can totally understand why he would suspect that XRP was behind this attack:Intrigued, I decided to acclimate myself with the XRP Army:Later in the thread I highlighted 100+ accounts which contain \u201cXRP\u201d or \u201cRipple\u201d in their usernames:XRP-supporting accounts chimed in with questions about the graph/data and to state they know some/most of the accounts:I would soon learn that two core members of the XRP Army/community are @haydentiff and @XRPTrump. Despite my best efforts, members of the XRP Army have always twisted my words.Fortunately, it seemed that @XRPTrump \u2014 an anonymous account which is highly knowledgeable re: XRP/Ripple \u2014was (finally) interpreting my words based on what had actually been stated:I was encouraged by the change in their tone (see below tweet) and opted to continue the discussion via Twitter DM:The Calm Before The StormLater that same day, @XRPTrump suggested that I \u201c[come] forward with a list of people that [I am] confident [are] bots and share with Tiffany [@haydentiff] and [him] privately\u201d (side note: between May 11th and Jul 14th, 2018, I traded quite a few DMs with @XRPTrump; discussion was always civil):That exchange took place while my Twitter account was getting bombarded by the XRP Army (for tweeting this graph and data earlier that day). Hence, I was in no rush to identify/share accounts with @XRPTrump (even privately) which I was confident were fake/bot accounts, as I wanted to halt the attack (rather than prolong it).Instead, I would later share a handful accounts with @XRPTrump, which, to me, appeared suspicious. I never stated that I was confident they were bots, although the XRP Army would later twist my words (they love to gaslight!).Two of those accounts \u2014 namely, @Ripple_Expert (username has since been changed to @California_luve) and @xrptips (58.6K followers) \u2014 were presented to @XRPTrump on May 15th, 2018:@Ripple_Expert had a substantial following (23.2K followers) and only followed 171 accounts. One of those accounts happened to be @XRPTrump:@Ripple_Expert has since changed their username to @California_luve; screenshot from May 15th, 2018; at that time, @XRPTrump was one of 171 accounts being followed by @Ripple_ExpertWhen asked, @XRPTrump stated they were not familiar with @Ripple_Expert, yet they engaged with the account (@California_luve below) on Jan 26th, 2018:Above @XRPTrump likes a tweet from @California_luveAlthough @XRPTrump wasn\u2019t quite to the point where they were ready to acknowledge the presence of fake/bot accounts, they certainly appeared to be warming up to the idea:In fact, on July 13th, 2018, @XRPTrump even shared two accounts which they referred to as being \u201cvery dodgy\u201d:I didn\u2019t actively pursue proving to @XRPTrump (or others from the XRP Army/community) that there are large numbers of fake/bot accounts which support XRP/Ripple, because, frankly, it requires lots of work.About 6 weeks ago, however, something happened that compelled me to finally take on this task.Enter @JoelKatzOn Jul 14th, 2018 (the day after @XRPTrump shared what he referred to as two \u201cvery dodgy\u201d accounts with me), I resurfaced some older tweets, retweeting the previously mentioned graph and data tweets.Immediately, @haydentiff \u2014 who was following my account at the time \u2014 replied to the (two-month) old thread with the following:Note the surge of (fake) followers above @haydentiff\u2019s reply/retweetWithin minutes, my Twitter account was being hit with fake followers. Given the timing, I (naturally) suspected the XRP Army was behind it. Shortly thereafter, I went ahead and shared what was happening with a friend, Mike Dudas, who I knew similarly has had his fair share of dealings with the XRP Army.When I next grabbed my phone, I noticed there were a ton of Twitter notifications. After seeing this tweet from Mike, it all made sense (side note: thanks for throwing me under the bus, Dudas!):Tweet from @mdudas on July 14th, 2018Ripple\u2019s CTO, @JoelKatz, who is very active on Twitter, joined the discussion this go-around. On the one hand, David expressed cynicism re: XRP/Ripple fake/bot Twitter accounts (\u201cseems like a crazy conspiracy theory to me\u201d); on the other hand, he didn\u2019t rule out the possibility (\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that some number of fake/bot accounts exist\u201d):David was kind enough to agree to a silly little bet I proposed: if I can prove that XRP/Ripple fake/bot accounts exist, then he has to change his profile image to a robot (if I can\u2019t, then I have to change mine to the XRP logo)Thanks to @XRPTrump for the suggestion (re: @GiantGox)!Profile of @GiantGox (August 26th, 2018)Dissecting @GiantGoxBefore we jump into the network graph, let me explain what we\u2019ll be reviewing.When the data was collected (July 21st, 2018), @GiantGox was following ~19K accounts and had ~36K followers.

Similar to as was mentioned earlier re: @emy_wng earlier \u2014 I am simply letting the data speak here.Allegations of market manipulation coupled with the account losing more than 2 million \u201csuspicious\u201d accounts during the Twitter Purge, one would think that Twitter would conduct a thorough audit on the account.The fact that it appears Twitter has not done so doesn\u2019t surprise me one bit.In fact, there have been numerous occasions where I have reported networks of fake/bot accounts spreading political propaganda on Twitter, where I was ignored (in some cases for months) by Twitter until the press would cover said networks:To be fair, the @6BillionPeople account follows 4.7M accounts, hence it shouldn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise that it is so central in relation to the accounts connected to @GiantGox (most of which are fake/bot accounts). It is, however, noteworthy.At the very least, what is clear is this: Twitter has a long ways to go until their platform is no longer propped up by misleading/inflated follower/following countsModularity Class = 3There are 3,260 nodes/accounts (2,755 @GiantGox followers) in this mod class/community:Notable accounts viewable above include: @tanjaplayner, @75fM1, @ABOALLAIL2, @ALGOAHRH1, @nalmtery, @O8z__, @RetrieverPlanet, @alywh, @dla3noof, @__sI1, @u_m305, @a4_u8, @kse_2030, @Dorsetghost, @soulskiller94, @77_ss7, @lessonlisa, @n__nony, @Ayed_Honey, @w_z_e, @VIP_G5, @ndr_7rb, @itslovesnotes, @Itsworldpost, @rffoi4, @retj_m, @SA2__0Here are the accounts from mod class = 3 which share the most connections with accounts connected to @GiantGox (descending, starting with most connections shared):Where modularity class = 3 and limited to accounts which are followers of @GiantGox.

It brought the Ripple Effect as a form of touch feedback, doing away with fully opaque selectors, but omitted an easy way to customize both the ripple and background color via xml attributes. I built the CustomRippleView library to create a seamless ripple customization starting with the TextView.The ripple is clever design because it buys time for an event to occur. The user\u2019s attention shifts to the button to gauge if the event is happening, and not to the operation itself. The effect produces perceived performance of a system. Also, it mimics nature; anyone seeing such a ripple would expect the ripple to dissipate naturally. It\u2019s a powerful concept, unfortunately relegated to trivial, but that is false. The best companies care about these details, not because they have the resources, but because beauty, aesthetics, form and function all matter in the end.See the Quick Implementation section directly below to quickly add the CustomRippleView to your app, and/or read on for more on how it is built.Quick ImplementationDeclare the library in gradle and call the desired files.build.gradle (app module)compile 'com.ebay.customrippleview:customrippleview:1.1'Define the rippleColor and backgroundColor attributes. If you don\u2019t specify the attributes below the view will use the default value of gray.recycler_headercell.xmlRetroRecycler Sample App (API level > 21, left and API level < 21, right)How Custom Ripple View Is MadeI built a library in order to implement custom ripples by adjusting 2 attributes in the XML layout. To implement the custom ripple effect for the type of view desired, create a custom view and extend the desired view type. I implemented this with the RippleTextView to start. There\u2019s a myriad of views the ripple effect would be useful for. Code contributions to the GitHub project are welcome!Alternative SolutionsPrior to this library one could implement a default gray ripple using a background or foreground xml attribute, create numerous drawable xmls for customization, or define a style to a view.Background or Foreground XMLThe downside here is the inability to customize the background or ripple.android:background=\"?attr/selectableItemBackground\"android:foreground=\"?attr/selectableItemBackground\"orandroid:background=\"?attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless\"android:foreground=\"?attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless\"and android:clickable=\"true\"DrawablesBy building drawables you have the customization, but it takes more time and creates more resources than needed.API Level 21API Pre 21Selector in normal stateSelector in pressed stateStyleSetting a view\u2019s style is almost as quick as using this library and achieves the custom ripple effect.Set the ripple effect with the background attribute. I just discovered the foreground attribute and am updating this post. You should also be able to set the effect with the foreground attribute, but I have not implemented this yet to ensure it will work.Define the custom ripple color with the colorControlHighlight attribute. For some reason, this attribute needs to be called from a separate style in order to work.Behind The Scenes: Custom Ripple ViewCreating a Custom View \u2014 Step 1 of 4Create a Custom View extending the type of View you\u2019d like to implement the Ripple Effect on.

What Is Ripple?As per ripple.com :Ripple connects banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges and corporate via RippleNet to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally.Ripple is quite different from other cryptocurrencies as it doesn\u2019t have its own public blockchain. Internally, the XRP Ledger network runs on an internal blockchain which they call an \u201cEnterprise blockchain\u201d ledger, it doesn\u2019t use proof-of-work and little else is known about it.Ripple functions like RTGS and is a digital currency exchange developed by Ripple company . Ripple was released officially in 2012 with an intent to enable instant & secure financial transactions of any size with no chargeback. It is currently a world third largest digital currency.Is Ripple More Like a Bitcoin:Ripple does share some technical similarities with bitcoin but it is quite different from it. Like many digital currencies it uses cryptography to secure transactions, but it doesn\u2019t actually have a public blockchain like Bitcoin or Litecoin. And it came into existence to mainly transform the payment transfer system, for the purpose of sending instant and secure transactions across network participants and that what is more known for.Ripple is more like payment system, remittance network, and currency exchange & now Ripple has built its network that includes its own cryptocurrency Ripple, or XRP.RTXP:Ripple Transaction Protocol or simply we can call Ripple Payment Protocol uses distributed open source Internet Protocol, consensus ledger & native crypto called XRP(Ripples). Ripples circles around shared database or public ledger which uses a consensus mechanism to allow payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.The goal of the ripple system, according to its official web portal, is to enable people to break free of the \u201cwalled gardens\u201d of financial networks \u2014 ie, credit cards, banks, PayPal and other institutions that restrict access with fees, charges for currency exchanges and processing delays.How Ripple Works ?sourceLet\u2019s understand its working mechanism through simple example. Here Sender will send $=500 To the Receiver, Both parties involved in transaction lives in a different city.Where,Sender =Jim, Receiver = Rony , Senders Side Agent = Krish, Receiver Side Agent= Tim.Jim gives Krish the money to send to Rony with a transaction password that Rony is required to answer correctly to receive the amount. Krish alerts Rony\u2019s agent, Tim about the transaction details- of amount of funds to be transferred to Rony and the required password to be validated at Rony\u2019s side by him. Here rony has to respond with the right password, then only Tim will release the fund from his side . Once Rony does so he gets the required amount. But here Krish owes $500 to Tim . Tim can record a journal of Krish\u2019s Debt or IOUs which Krish would pay on the agreed date or can make immediate counter transactions to balance out the debt he owe to Tim.This explanation would have given you some basic idea of how ripple transaction systems work. The key here is that there is a trust based mechanism working here between sender, receiver, and the local agents involved as security agentsWhat the original Ripple project sought to accomplish is effectively the democratization of this idea: everyone can be their own bank, issuing, accepting and acting as a conduit for loans all at the same time.Ripples Use Case :Let\u2019s Discuss its Use Case Sector Wise :Image Source1.

Brian Rankin, technology operations and client services specialist in blockchain and distributed ledgers and a former VP of Clients Services at Ripple (XRP), led the original Ripple\u2019s 21-person international team that includes project management, business architecture, integration engineering, and customer success. He built Ripple\u2019s professional services team from the ground up, leading enterprise delivery of blockchain solutions to Tier-1/2/3 multinational banks across NAM, EMEA, and APAC.Rankin was also a Head of the Global Payments Steering Group (GPSG), a consortium composed of Tier-1 Multinational banks focused on redefining an international cross-border payments network as an alternative to the SWIFT payments network. The group, under his leadership, leveraged blockchain technologies to reduce correspondent banking relationships and allow near-real-time cryptographically validated settlements.As the VP in Ripple, Rankin established delivery best practices and built a customer-oriented PMO, created SOW and MSA templates based on blockchain LOE, and best practices for technical, legal, compliance, infosec, and functional standard requirements in the financial services sector.

While the price has recently dropped after a sudden spike, it hasn\u2019t caused anywhere near as much drama as the 234 obituaries hiding under Bitcoin\u2019s belt.Ripple\u2019s token, XRP, which had been trading at around $0.006 this time last year, now hovers at around $2.00.\u201cThere is limited upside in Ripple,\u201d argued Alexander Kravets, a guy who has not known about cryptocurrency for a full year yet.Why Is Ripple Rising?Reason #1: Decentralization. Rather than naively view centralization/decentralization as binary, Ripple recognizes that decentralization can take many forms and likely resembles more of a spectrum than a dichotomy. \u201cThe view that something is either decentralized or centralized is harmful and draws attention away from what we should actually care about \u2014 to what extent particular systems have particular beneficial characteristics,\u201d said David Schwartz, Chief Cryptographer at Ripple. Schwartz said making massive progress on decentralization in 2018 is his number one priority. Accordingly, Ripple recently released their Decentralization Strategy Update.Reason #2: There was a change in how prices are calculated. The crypto exchange Coinmarketcap.com made a change this week, excluding many Korean exchanges from its price calculations. Previously, CMC did not reflect what U.S. holders could actually sell for, and that caused a lot of confusion. The new price is more accurate and meaningful.Reason #3: XRP\u2019s appeal to businesses is strengthening. After announcing that three of the top five money transfer companies worldwide will be implementing Ripple\u2019s XRP token in their payment flow systems this year, Ripple and MoneyGram announced they had partnered.\u201cMoneyGram is the latest example of Ripple\u2019s masterful cadence of announcements of deals with large companies,\u201d said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital.Oliver Isaacs, cryptocurrency investor and influencer, proclaimed that Ripple is \u201cgaining momentum.\u201d He spoke to the digital currency\u2019s growing visibility, stating:\u201cEvery cryptocurrency investor and hedge fund I have spoken to have asked me about Ripple\u2019s potential in the market.\u201d.Tiffany Hayden", "responses": 8, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ripple", "Xrp", "Media", "Banking"]}, {"title": "Where Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, And Other Cryptocurrencies Be Twenty Years From Now?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/forbes/where-will-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-and-other-cryptocurrencies-be-twenty-years-from-now-27763f5f0cbf?source=search_post", "author_name": "Forbes", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@forbes", "publish_date": "2018-02-05", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-14", "readtime": "2.36", "claps": 623, "voters": 93, "content": "Where Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, And Other Cryptocurrencies Be Twenty Years From Now?ForbesFollowFeb 5, 2018 \u00b7 3 min read(Photo Illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images)By Panos MourdoukoutasBitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies have been on a roller coaster lately.

We\u2019ll use Animated API, which is a part of React Native.An IconToggle component is included in open source react-native-material-ui library. I\u2019m using this library for booking system by Reservio.The idea \u2026We\u2019ll make three Views. One of them as a container for IconToggle component. Another one as a container for ripple effect and last one as a container for Icon. We\u2019ll wrap them in React Native\u2019s TouchableWithoutFeedback component that fires onPressIn and onPressOut events.Why do we need both of these events? Because there are two different animations. A scale animation and an opacity animation. They may run together, of course. So, is the onPressIn event enough? No. Because there could be a situation when user presses the button for a longer time. Then we need scale animation to run first and wait for onPressOut event that runs opacity animation. It\u2019s exactly how the icon button\u2019s ripple effect works. I simulated that with red star icon in the last example above.Let\u2019s code \u2026First of all, we\u2019ll create blank page for this example. Then we\u2019ll create IconToggle component and the ripple effect animation. Finally, we\u2019ll make some correlation.Now, we have a view with Toolbar which is known from Material Design by Google. The Toolbar is not a goal of this tutorial, so we took it from react-native-material-ui library. Then, we put the IconToggle components and implement it in the following Gist.Again, we took Icon component from react-native-material-ui. So, we have something like this. And now, the animation.Let\u2019s animate \u2026On lines 14 and 15 we created two Animated.Values. One of them for scale animation and second for opacity animation. We pass them to Animated.View via its props. The scale animation begins inside of onPressedIn function, that is fired after user presses icon. It starts from 0.01 (not zero) because there is an issue in React Native. Later, when user releases the button, the opacity animation will start. It doesn\u2019t matter if the scale animation is still running or not. After the opacity animation is done, we need Animated.Values to be set to init values (line 34). That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole ripple effect.In this code, we just added a colour for icon and ripple effect. Look at line 12 and 18. We would like to use native thread for Android platform because then the animation doesn\u2019t block the JS thread. In real application we\u2019ll probably fire onPress callback and there will be another code to run. We don\u2019t want to block it, so it\u2019s better to use native thread for animation.Last word \u2026You can find the whole code in my github account. Note that it\u2019s not ready for production. For this purpose you can use react-native-material-ui that I\u2019m developing as an open source and using it for our booking system created in Reservio.com.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["React Native", "React", "Animation", "Android", "iOS"]}, {"title": "Bonus of $20 (In Xrp) for First 200 Bcnex Wishlist Investors", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@bcnex/bonus-of-20-in-xrp-for-first-200-bcnex-wishlist-investors-ff7b9743889a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bcnex", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bcnex", "publish_date": "2019-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-20", "readtime": "1.55", "claps": 625, "voters": 82, "content": "Bonus of $20 (In Xrp) for First 200 Bcnex Wishlist InvestorsBcnexFollowJun 20 \u00b7 2 min readDear Bcnex supporters,Bcnex ICO will end in less than 7 days.

Yesterday it became known that the large American investment bank JPMorgan in the next few months will begin testing its own digital currency \u2014 JPM Coin.JPMorgan makes daily transfers of more than 6 trillion dollars worldwide. It is expected that a small part of settlements between customers of the bank\u2019s payment unit will be carried out using JPM Coin.The investment bank is gradually creating a foundation for the transition to the future, where all cross-border payments will be carried out using blockchain technology. However, in order for such a future to come, banks must create an appropriate infrastructure that will allow making payments with lightning speed. In such a reality, there will be no room for old technologies, such as electronic money.In a conversation with the CNBC channel, the head of the blockchain development department at JPMorgan Umar Farooq identified 3 main areas of application of bank tokens: international payments with the ability to instantly make payments that are made between large corporate clients; operations with securities, which will minimize the time lag between the settlement of the transaction and its payment; and the replacement of dollars that are at the disposal of the divisions of corporations that use the services of JPMorgan stores.\u201cMoney sloshes back and forth all over the world in a large enterprise,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cIs there a way to ensure that a subsidiary can represent cash on the balance sheet without having to actually wire it to the unit? That way, they can consolidate their money and probably get better rates for it.\u201dJPM Coin is a stablecoin provided by the US dollar. Clients will receive this token immediately after the payment of fiat money to the bank. Once all the calculations have been completed successfully, JPMorgan will burn JPM Coin and return the corresponding amount of fiat dollars to the deposit to the owner. According to preliminary data, access to the token can be obtained only by tested large institutional clients, for example, corporations, banks, and broker-dealers.Faruk also admits that it is likely that in future the bank will be used to perform settlements between devices connected to the Internet:\u201cBut we can talk about this after the application of the blockchain technology is finally tested, and we will be sure that this direction is promising\u201d.Recall that the head of JPMorgan Jamie Dimon has relatively recently been one of the most ardent opponents of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. However, he subsequently stated that he regretted the past negative comments about Bitcoin.Today JPMorgan is not only one of the main supporters of cryptocurrency technologies but is actively involved in the development of this area. A week ago, JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said that the cryptocurrency market had gone through a \u201cbubble\u201d phase and looked quite reliable.Is JPM Coin Serious Competition for Ripple?The launch of JPMorgan, the financial giant\u2019s own digital asset, has sparked fierce discussions in the international crypto sector. Some experts see a great opportunity in this step, other prominent voices such as the CEO of Ripple sees the project is not sustainable.Already In 2016, four major banks entered into a cooperation agreement to launch the Utility Settlement Coin, a digital asset designed to streamline cross-border transactions, reduce fees and speed up processing of remittances. UBS presented the idea too, among others, Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon. NEX, Barclays, CIBC, Credit Suisse, HSBC, and MUFG are also on board. The test phase was already started in the middle of last year, but only a few results have been leaked to daylight.Ripple boss, Brad Garlinghouse, sees bank-issued digital assets as an unrealistic and misguided solution for the industry. In an article on his LinkedIn profile, Garlinghouse explains why bank-sponsored cryptocurrencies are doomed to failure. Here are two different scenarios conceivable:\u201cA bank-issued digital asset can only really efficiently settle between the banks who issued it. Then, two scenarios can play out. Scenario one: all banks around the world put aside competitive and geopolitical differences, adopt the same digital asset, agree on its rules, and harmoniously govern its usage. Fat chance. Scenario two (the more likely scenario): banks not in the issuing group issue their own digital assets with their own sets of rules and governance.We\u2019re kinda seeing this already, as the FT points out, with Citi\u2019s Citicoin and Goldman Sachs\u2019 SETLcoin. The result would be an even more fragmented currency landscape than what we have today. If banks of different digital asset groups want to settle trades with one another, they\u2019ll have to make markets between their unique digital assets or trade between their digital assets and a common fiat currency. What a mess!The second big problem with the \u2018utility settlement coin\u2019 is it seems it\u2019ll be backed by a basket of currencies. Once backed by cash, it\u2019s no longer an asset; it\u2019s a liability. Trading liabilities then ultimately requires moving cash across borders, re-creating today\u2019s system but adding more friction!\u201dIf each bank launches its own digital asset to handle payments across the globe, over time it could create a wealth of new currencies that flood the market. Ripple tries to prevent this and therefore provides an infrastructure that can be used easily and quickly by any financial institution worldwide:\u201cWe strongly believe banks need an independent digital asset to enable truly efficient settlement and we believe XRP is best positioned for that role. It goes back to the fundamentals of what makes digital assets unique and special \u2014 they\u2019re universal currencies, meaning anyone can use them as units of value anywhere in the world. That universality gives digital assets global reach and the ability to settle much faster than traditional assets.Compared head to head with other independent digital assets (like Bitcoin or Ether), XRP settles the most efficiently cross-border, in just seconds. In fact, we\u2019ve run tests with global banks to prove XRP can lower liquidity costs for cross-border trades.\u201dAuthor: Marko Vidrih@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

His Ripple holdings also briefly made Larsen the 5th richest man in the world as Ripple prices surged more than 30,000% in a year.Larsen was richer than the founders of Google.How Ripple Became a SensationRipple was actually created in 2004 by Ryan Fugger (then called Ripplepay) to be a peer-to-peer payment network that centered around debt and was in essence a network of imaginary credit lines. Ripple\u2019s founding in 2004 makes it older than Bitcoin, which Satoshi Nakamoto first dreamed up in 2009.While Ripple showed some adoption in its early years, it was inherently limited in scale by its centralized network (in which you had to be invited in by someone already in the network) and so Ripple never entered mainstream conversations until 2012 when Ripple decided to revamp its business. Enter the A-list management:Jed McCaleb \u2014 a programmer responsible for the creation of the first Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, one bound to infamy with a hack of 850k stolen Bitcoin before Mt. Gox\u2019s dissolution forever marring its nameChris Larsen \u2014 a serial entrepreneur, the co-founder of E-Loan, an online mortgage lender, and Prosper, a peer-to-peer lender.Together, Larsen and McCaleb envisioned Ripple tokens to be a replacement to Bitcoin, a replacement that was faster and more efficient with its transactions as all of the Ripple tokens are pre-mined. According to the Ripple website, Ripple can settle payments in 4 seconds, compared to 2 minutes for Ethereum, over an hour for Bitcoin, and 3\u20135 days for traditional systems.In total 100 billion Ripple coins were created when the Ripple network we know today launched in 2012, but the powers that be at Ripple decided not to release all of the tokens to the public at once, but instead to release fractions of the hoard over time. Larsen and McCaleb kept 20 billion coins for themselves, and the rest went to the company. To date, Ripple still holds nearly 50 billion Ripple in escrow.However, the XRP token is only a fraction of Ripple\u2019s business. The buzziest element of Ripple, and its true appeal, is not its token, but its business. RippleNet is an open-source software that enables money transfers between wallets globally. The Ripple token is just one of many currencies that can be transferred through RippleNet.Revolutionary? Not quite. But it is efficient across international borders, which is what caught the eye of the banks, including Santander and American Express, among a hundred or so others. However, it\u2019s worth noting that banks can use RippleNet without actually using XRP tokens, which is a fact that is lost on many investors. Speaking of investors\u2026The lawsuit that could unravel RippleOn May 3rd 2018, Ryan Coffey filed a class action suit against Ripple. Ryan is an investor who purchased Ripple at $2.60 as an investment when the token was exploding in value in January 2018. Coffey lost $585 when he sold his Ripple tokens at $1.30.You could argue so what? Who cares that an investor lost $500. This is a small amount, and investors lose money all the time. What\u2019s the fuss? Usually, you\u2019d be right that the story ends here because the old adage \u201cinvestor beware\u201d holds true to this day. Losing money on an investment is par for the course in the speculation of early-stage companies. If every investment was guaranteed to not lose money or investors would get their money back, then there would be no sellers; there would only be buyers.What is unusual about this situation and this particular class action suit is Coffey\u2019s claim that Ripple sold unregistered securities to investors. That is fraud, if true. With this kind of claim, an ordinary investor can easily go to court and be made whole with their losses. Because this is a class action suit, it in theory represents all of the U.S. based investors who purchased Ripple.This can amount to billions of dollars in claims that investors can ask the company to repay. This would demolish Ripple and its founders, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse (McCaleb left Ripple and started Stellar, and Larsen is now the executive chairman after stepping down as CEO last year). This lawsuit names others with the ambition to sue every single person in the Ripple food chain, including those who marketed it to investors.According to the lawsuit, the suit \u201carises out of a scheme by Defendants to raise hundreds of millions of dollars through the unregistered sale of XRP to retail investors in violation of the registration provisions of state and federal securities laws.\u201dThe lawsuit further alleges that the \u201cDefendants have since earned massive profits by quietly selling off this XRP to the general public, in what is essentially a never-ending initial coin offering.\u201d The lawsuit goes on to use Ripple\u2019s attempts to bribe exchanges to list XRP as well as their conflation of XRP with RippleNet as further evidence of misleading investors and attempts to inflate the price of XRP, which is directly tied to the amount of money Ripple Labs brings in.Since Coffey (and likely the majority of XRP investors) purchased the tokens with reasonable expectations of profit, and Ripple Labs itself marketed XRP as a promising investment, then XRP is indeed a security to the eyes of the SEC.If Coffey\u2019s lawsuit succeeds, this is a serious blow to the crypto industry. Not only does it beg the question of how many cryptocurrencies are actually securities, but it also means that every exchange that listed XRP is in trouble unless they are an exchange registered with the SEC or a broker dealer using an ATS. Hint: that is zero of the exchanges that list XRP.As the clamor for regulation grows, this lawsuit could very well be the tipping point that changes the name of the game for crypto and cleans the house of unregistered exchanges. If the third largest coin isn\u2019t safe, then no one down the list is.", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ripple", "ICO", "Utility Token Icos", "Utility Token"]}, {"title": "Ethereum Core Developer and Original Ripple Creator Join Bluzelle Advisory Board", "post_link": "https://blog.bluzelle.com/ethereum-core-developer-and-original-ripple-creator-join-bluzelle-advisory-board-cf9cb59b353e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Pavel Bains", "author_link": "https://blog.bluzelle.com/@pavelbains", "publish_date": "2017-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-26", "readtime": "2.97", "claps": 565, "voters": 42, "content": "Ethereum Core Developer and Original Ripple Creator Join Bluzelle Advisory BoardPavel BainsFollowDec 11, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readAlong with experts in security, encryption and more.A couple of months ago, we introduced you to our first group of advisors.

This is inaugural episode \u2026 This is episode zero, right?Jay Kang: Yeah, it is generation zero of our crypto kitties podcast experience.Aaron Lammer: You\u2019re inside the genesis block here. I\u2019m Aaron Lammer. Across the crypto cave from me, Mr Jay Caspian Kang.Jay Kang: Hello.Aaron Lammer: Just to give a little background here. I do podcasts, I have a podcast called Longform. I have another podcast about weed, called Stoner. Jay, what do you do?Jay Kang: I\u2019m a journalist. I write for the New York Times Magazine. I\u2019m a correspondent for VICE News Tonight on HBO.Aaron Lammer: This show has almost nothing to do with what we do with our actual lives. It has to do with what we do with our shadow lives.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Our pseudo lives.Jay Kang: We should probably say that it has absolutely nothing to do with any of the companies that we work for.Aaron Lammer: Couldn\u2019t have less to do with anything else we do. In fact, I think the origins of this show, at least from my perspective, are the, we got into cryptocurrencies around the same time. We started talking about them obsessively. As usual, I just try to feed my addictions into a podcast format.Jay Kang: Yeah, same. You introduced me into crypto. I had known about it before. But I had never thought about-Aaron Lammer: If you could go back to that moment, would you just have me not tell you about cryptocurrency?Jay Kang: Well you\u2019ve tried a few times. You\u2019ve tried a few times. The first time I was like, \u201cNo.\u201d And then the second time, I believe I also told your wife, \u201cAarom keeps talking to me about cryptocurrency.\u201dAaron Lammer: \u201cPlease ask him to stop.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah. But then at a barbecue at your house, you showed me some of this stuff in a very Roger Ver sort of way.Aaron Lammer: Oh, I\u2019m the Roger Ver in your life.Jay Kang: Roger Ver being known as Bitcoin Jesus. He would walk around and show people how to store Bitcoin on a phone, which is essentially what you did.Aaron Lammer: As a bald man, I will take any comparison to Jesus.Jay Kang: Yeah. You came to me and said, \u201cLook, this is how you do it. This is how it works.\u201d Some degenerate gambling past stuff kicked up in my brain. The endorphins started running and here we are.Aaron Lammer: You have a little bit of a background in gambling. You\u2019ve covered high-stakes online poker players. I have a little bit of a background in technology. I have failed to raise money for a startup previously. So we\u2019re coming to this from slightly different points of view. But I think it\u2019s important for listeners to the show to realize, we don\u2019t really know very much about cryptocurrency. Everything we\u2019ve learned, we learned in the last six months. Through a pretty haphazard education.Jay Kang: That was always the idea that we had about the podcast. Which was that, when people download Coinbase and they say, \u201cI\u2019m going to buy cryptocurrency.\u201d And then they\u2019re like, \u201cWell, I would like to make an informed decision.\u201d This is all stuff that we did. Wading through Reddit posts and shitposts on Twitter and people who are angry, and people if you don\u2019t know they\u2019re trying to scam you or not. That\u2019s all very intimidating. We wished that we had a sort of inviting, easy, and somewhat dumbed down version of everything to listen to. That\u2019s what we decided.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019re your guide, your Sherpa.Jay Kang: Yes. But a Sherpa that was not scaling the mountain at incredible paces, but was like, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve done this once before and I think we\u2019re going to be okay.\u201dAaron Lammer: And as part of the lucky and privileged position we have living in New York here and being involved in the media and journalism and stuff like that, we do have access to people who do know what they\u2019re talking about. Those people are journalists, they are developers, they\u2019re gamblers, speculators, Wall Streeters, we\u2019re going to have them all on this show to tell us all the things that we are getting wrong as we talk through the week\u2019s news.Jay Kang: Exactly. So when we have a question, when Aaron and I looked at some crypto news or something like that, and we ask each other, \u201cHey, what is this?\u201d We generally do-Aaron Lammer: \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah. Or we pretend to get it and then 10 minutes in we\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d We generally default to asking some people that we know, how to disentangle this and what it actually means. We would like for you, the listener, to go through that process with us as we have these discussions.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, and let us know how we\u2019re doing, what your questions are, what\u2019s confusing you. Jay helped start Grantland, which is a sports site that ESPN did with Bill Simmons. I think that the way that we regard the Bitcoin, crypto space is from a sports-like background. It reminds me a little of fantasy sports or something like that.Aaron Lammer: We see this as an entertaining field full of weirdos and interesting personalities. We want to cover it from every angle. You\u2019re probably not going to hear breaking news on this show. But if you don\u2019t want to sit there on every Reddit forum and every Discord chat channel following every project along-Jay Kang: Reading every single white paper.Aaron Lammer: If you don\u2019t want to get yelled at. If you want to get involved in crypto without getting yelled at, we\u2019re willing to not yell at you.Jay Kang: Yeah, because we will get yelled at for you. We\u2019ll try and disseminate the parts that are not yelling.Aaron Lammer: One more thing before we get going, I want to send a shout out to Medium. This show is produced in partnership with Medium. They\u2019re helping us do things like put up transcripts of every episode, live show notes, which is a reading list. There\u2019s a ton of amazing crypto stuff happening on Medium.Jay Kang: Yeah. There is really \u2026 I mean I\u2019m sure that if you have waded into this space and you have read a good article or somebody coherently laying out their thoughts, chances are that it was on a Medium page.Aaron Lammer: You can actually find all of the best crypto writing on Medium at me.dm/crypto again, me.dm/crypto that\u2019s a landing page with all sorts of crypto related content. Our page is medium.com/cointalk, we\u2019ll have all the new shows there. You can either subscribe there or you can subscribe there in the pod catcher of your choice. It\u2019s all the same.Jay Kang: What is a pod catcher?Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s a podcast app.Jay Kang: A podcast app?Aaron Lammer: Pod catcher.Jay Kang: It feels vaguely-Aaron Lammer: It catches the podcast.Jay Kang: Vaguely gross.Aaron Lammer: As a special bonus, would be down to do a little mini-show today, Jay?Jay Kang: Yeah, let\u2019s do it. There\u2019s a lot of news.Aaron Lammer: What should we talk about?Jay Kang: Let\u2019s talk about the only thing that people in crypto seem to be talking about over the past week, which is Ripple.Aaron Lammer: Cue the theme music.Aaron Lammer: This episode was taped Sunday, January 7th at 6pm. The Bitcoin price index was $14,780.Aaron Lammer: Welcome back to Crip Talk-Jay Kang: Welcome to Crap-topia. What is your pin number? I don\u2019t know anymore. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t buy this shit coin.Aaron Lammer: Okay, we clearly had our brains scrambled by crypto. But we want to give you a little preview of the show. Let\u2019s do a few topics. What do you want to talk about today?Jay Kang: I think we have to talk about Ripple.Aaron Lammer: Can\u2019t not talk about Ripple (XRP).Jay Kang: Yeah, which is a little disappointing. But we should.Aaron Lammer: Let\u2019s also talk about, I just saw that people are trading accounts. I don\u2019t know if this is real. But it appears that some of these exchanges, the smaller exchanges have shut down new accounts and people are trading in accounts on those exchanges.Jay Kang: Yeah, they\u2019re trying to pimp them out, they\u2019re saying, \u201cI\u2019ll sign this account over to you for five Bitcoin.\u201dAaron Lammer: And then I think we\u2019re going to tie things up talking a little bit about our own relative, emotional weaknesses as crypto traders.Jay Kang: That previews of a year of content, I think.Aaron Lammer: Without getting too deep into what Ripple is, what\u2019s going on with Ripple right now?Jay Kang: Well, the reason why it\u2019s in the news is because for a very short period of time, when Ripple was around $3.84 here, Chris Larsen, who is the former CEO of Ripple, not even the current CEO, was supposedly worth 59 billion dollars. Which made him the fifth richest man in America.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s kind of incredible this murderers row of people behind Ripple. You\u2019ve got him, he\u2019s briefly richer than Larry Ellison. This is the guy who doesn\u2019t even work at the company Ripple anymore. He\u2019s the former CEO. One of the other guys was the original guy who started Mt. Gox before he sold it to Mark Karpeles. That guy is filthy fucking rich. There\u2019s a new CEO who is beefing with Nathaniel Popper on Twitter, \u2019cause Nathaniel Popper called a bunch of banks and they were like, \u201cYeah, we might work with Ripple some day, I guess.\u201dJay Kang: I think that people in crypto almost never agree on anything. Like it it seems like there\u2019s never really any agreement about anything in crypto.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: But it does seem like all sides, any type of coin that you\u2019re into, everyone has banded together to hate Ripple. You hate Ripple. Why do you hate Ripple?Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t. Look, I\u2019ve owned Ripple before. So I can\u2019t have hated it that much. Generally the rap it gets is, well for starters, it\u2019s not really decentralized. There\u2019s the company Ripple. There\u2019s the token Ripple. The company Ripple has locked up something like 60% of the Ripple tokens. But look, I\u2019m not some decentralization ideologue. So that doesn\u2019t really explain why I would dislike it.Aaron Lammer: I think what gets under my skin about Ripple is it seems like this Ripple run is playing on people\u2019s worst instincts, which is, people want to buy a coin that\u2019s really cheap. Ripple is pre-mined. So all the coins are out there, available, except for the ones that have been locked up by the founders and for their future bank partners. There\u2019s 100 billion of them.Aaron Lammer: They seem really cheap. People have bought it up from cents up to over $3. The idea that Ripple is worth that much, where you multiply its price by the number of tokens, seems misleading at best. It feels almost like it was designed to take advantage of pyschology. Sort of in the way of Zinga games used to feel that way to me.Jay Kang: Yeah, or junk bonds. Where there\u2019s value that\u2019s almost made out of thin air. I\u2019ll say that the association with banks, there\u2019s this great detail in this Financial Times story, where the author, Izabella Kaminska meets the people at Ripple at Davos.Jay Kang: I think that when you read about Ripple, it\u2019s been in the news all week. The one thing that keeps coming up is that for Ripple to work this network that they want to do between banks, they need banks to buy in.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, and they\u2019ve held a bunch of tokens up to lure the banks in.Jay Kang: Yeah. They\u2019re like, \u201cYou know my 59 billion. We\u2019ve got some for you too. But not for them.\u201dAaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: That bothers me a little bit. And I will say that I also am not some Austrian school Libertarian who believes that everything should be decentralized. But I do agree that there\u2019s this sort of shell game here. If I printed a million Kang Coin (KCO) and I held 999,000 of them and I sold them to you for 50 cents, I\u2019m not worth the one billion Kang Coins plus whatever, wait that doesn\u2019t make sense. Let me try again. If I print a billion Kang Coins.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Jay, where can I buy those Kang Coins?Jay Kang: I sell you one for $1.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: That one Kang coin is worth a dollar. I\u2019m not worth a billion dollars at that point.Aaron Lammer: Exactly. And I further think that even if you accept these hijinx, potentially as clever, at one point I think they had passed Toyota in market cap size. When you\u2019re bigger than Toyota and all you\u2019ve really done is introduce the idea of, \u201cWe\u2019re going to disrupt the SWIFT money transfer system.\u201d What is the incentive to actually do it? How much would you have to actually achieve to justify that value? And how much would you just be like, \u201cHey, things are going great. Tokens trading for $3. What else do we need to do here?\u201dJay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Why build an actual company? The guy who\u2019s the richest isn\u2019t even the CEO anymore. I almost feel like these pre-mined coins ought to be categorized differently than the minable coins. \u2019Cause I think that their supply represents something different. It represents something different if there\u2019s a mining community that feels like it\u2019s worthwhile. I will not be buying Ripple. Will you be buying Ripple?Jay Kang: Well, I mean, like you, I already bought Ripple. And then I sold it for about a penny more than it was after I \u2026 As you\u2019ll learn from us, we do a lot of that.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I think that\u2019s something worth addressing as we get going here on the show, which is, Jay and I, not only should you not take our investment advice. You should consider going the opposite of the way we\u2019re going.Jay Kang: Oh yeah. I\u2019m sure you guys have listened to Sports Gambling Podcast, where you just say, \u201cI\u2019m going to bet the opposite of that guy, because that guy never wins.\u201d That\u2019s a good idea to us.Aaron Lammer: We really don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. I will say, just to tie this up. That both of our original assumptions, \u2014 we\u2019ve been taping fake episodes of this fake podcast previousl \u2014 both of us thought that Ripple would never have a meteoric rise because it\u2019s usefulness as this middle man in money transfers, which is basically what it\u2019s designed for, is somewhat ebbed away if you have it making 50% or 80% swings on a single day.Jay Kang: Yeah, I recall this was an impassioned case I made during one of our Basement Tapes. With you being like, \u201cYou can\u2019t have a transfer between banks if the thing is plunging 20% in a day. Therefore it\u2019s never going to go up.\u201d And I think that I cost you a lot of money that way.Aaron Lammer: Jay, how many different accounts do you have for exchanges?Jay Kang: Right now?Aaron Lammer: Yeah. What are you? I assume we\u2019re both-Jay Kang: I\u2019m ashamed to say.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019re both on Coinbase/GDAXJay Kang: I\u2019m ashamed to say it. I think I\u2019m at six.Aaron Lammer: Okay, wow. Did you ever think it would come to this?Jay Kang: I had hoped not. Because like most people who are getting into crypto at some point, you want to be almost like a knight of crypto and stand for what\u2019s good in crypto.Aaron Lammer: That has never been my ambition.Jay Kang: That certainly does not mean signing into six different exchanges so that you can chase shitcoins all over the world.Aaron Lammer: We both started on the Coinbase/GDAX axis, which is, I think where most people start, at least Americans. I know that both of us made the jump to Bittrex, which seems like the logical first place to go. A lot of these bigger name alt coins are available at Bittrex. It\u2019s a place where you can pick up Zcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR). Actually I think I did some ShapeShifting before I did that.Jay Kang: Yeah, that was before I entered your crypto world.Aaron Lammer: I lost two Monero in a ShapeShift calamity that\u2019s still unexplained. Come on the show and talk about it ShapeShift makers. I got to Bittrex and we both stopped for a while.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: And then there\u2019s been a rush in the last week or so, where it seems like everyone got \u2026 A lot of people have to have gotten onto some exchange or we couldn\u2019t see all this Ripple (XRP) trading.Jay Kang: Yeah, there seemed to be a domino effect. Because first, everyone signed up for Coinbase and then Litecoin (LTC) surges. Ethereum (ETH) surges and then Bittrex says, \u201cWhoa, we\u2019ve got a lot of people. We can\u2019t handle all of you.\u201d And then Binance, which is a Chinese exchange, they say, \u201cWhoa, we can\u2019t handle all your people. There\u2019s no new signups.\u201dJay Kang: And then on and on and on, it seems like every single day now, a new exchange is saying, \u201cWe\u2019re shutting down new registration signups.\u201d I don\u2019t know. It seems like either there\u2019s a massive, massive amount of people who are trying to signup for these things. Or something really bad is about to happen.Aaron Lammer: Well, the way I\u2019m reading it, as a buyer. Is, if there\u2019s more people trying to get on these exchanges than can fit through the door. I\u2019m buying alts, because those people are going to come after me and they\u2019re going to want to buy alts and eventually they\u2019re going to get accounts. I mean, it\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t know if this is really going to sell. But there was someone who was selling a account for $25,000 on eBay. All that account does is give you the right to transfer in Bitcoin and trade.Jay Kang: Yeah, and for how long? \u2019Cause it\u2019s not like this is a permanent, it\u2019s not like they capped a country club and they\u2019re like, \u201cNo more people in this country club. Someone has to die.\u201d I\u2019m sure that Binance will allow new people in the next couple months. Or Bittrex might in the next couple weeks.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know. Cryptopia got knocked offline by DOT trading, I think, today.Jay Kang: Yeah, Cryptopia is another one that shut down new registrations as well.Aaron Lammer: It makes sense, if you\u2019re just chasing the high, Cryptopia is the closest to a video game experience that you\u2019re going to get out there right now.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know, KcCoin is close. They\u2019re very similar.Aaron Lammer: I haven\u2019t been on Kucoin.Jay Kang: They\u2019re very similar.Aaron Lammer: Okay. Tell me what are the differences, for people out there that haven\u2019t checked them out, what\u2019s Kucoin like? Is that Korean?Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know the country of origin. But when you sign in there is a phishing warning and it\u2019s in English, but every word is conjugated wrong. It inspires a lot of customer security in me.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: But no, it\u2019s like a lot of other exchanges in the sense that it lists the coins. They have these flashing banner ads that say, \u201cIt\u2019s Kucoin Christmas.\u201d Mind you, this is today.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: They\u2019re like, \u201cIf you sign up. If you tweet out Kucoin we\u2019ll give you this.\u201d So the whole thing looks like an online poker site from 2004 or something like that. Where everything is bonus incentive. It does not look like an investment tool at all.Aaron Lammer: For me, my experience at Cryptopia was I started dragging on the bottom. I started to buy the strange off-brand things.Jay Kang: Yeah, I remember this.Aaron Lammer: Things I previously turned my nose up to.Jay Kang: You texted me and you were like, \u201cI bought this, this, this, and this.\u201d And I was like, \u201cHuh, I have not heard of any of those.\u201d And then I Googled them. That really didn\u2019t help that much either.Aaron Lammer: The way I originally approached Cryptopia was \u2014 so, everyone knows that I have a soft spot in my heart for Monero (XMR),Jay Kang: This is the first episode. So nobody knows that.Aaron Lammer: No one knows it yet. But you\u2019re going to learn all about my affection for Monero. I like to put an extra \u201cO\u201d in it, call it Moonero. I started looking at the guys here who are the biggest Monero \u201cStans.\u201d The guys who are just shilling Monero left and right. Which are a dying breed actually, there used to be more of them. They were showing their bags. They were showing some pretty far down the chart anonymity coin. Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) were the first anonymity coins that I read about.Aaron Lammer: I find the use case for anonymity coins pretty compelling. But Zcash and Monero and I also have some Zcoin (XZC). These are pretty stable now. They\u2019re coming up. But you\u2019re not going to double them tomorrow. So I started looking and seeing some of these smaller anonymity coins that were available. Picked up little Sumokoin (SUMO), a little Zoin (ZOI).Jay Kang: And yet you somehow missed the biggest one of all, ZClassic (ZCL).Aaron Lammer: Well Zclassic was already pumping when I got there.Jay Kang: Not where it is now.Aaron Lammer: Not where it is now, but I was looked at it and I said, \u201cOkay, how \u2026 I think now, Zclassic (ZCL) is worth a third as much as Zcash (ZEC), which is insane.Jay Kang: It\u2019s like $200.Aaron Lammer: But at the time, Sumokoin (SUMO) was trading for a buck 80 and Monero (XMR) was trading for $300 something. It seemed like a good idea to check out Sumokoin, which is a Monero clone, low price, \u201cK\u201d in the title. Sumokoin, with a K. (laughter)Jay Kang: What actually made you go down this route? Because I think that what \u201csmart\u201d or shark investors would tell you is, \u201cDon\u2019t bother with that stuff. Eventually Monero (XMR) will win out. You might be able to catch a small burst in these things. But eventually you\u2019re going to lose enough on those where it\u2019s not even worth it.\u201dAaron Lammer: I don\u2019t find that compelling.Jay Kang: You don\u2019t find that compelling?Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know. I think that we\u2019re in the throws of a mania and people are looking to bid up these tiny, low-market cap, low price coins. Look, I don\u2019t expect to be trading these coins for the rest of my life. But I do feel like there\u2019s some short term gains to be had.Jay Kang: Yeah, look, the market has proven that.Aaron Lammer: Wait a minute.Jay Kang: No, no, no, I\u2019m not saying-Aaron Lammer: Oh, you\u2019re playing devil\u2019s advocate over here.Jay Kang: I\u2019m playing devil\u2019s advocate here. I\u2019m on your side.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. We need an actually conservative person on this show, because I feel like we\u2019re both just egging each other to a lower and lower common denominator.Jay Kang: Yeah, look I think that anything to fill out your Monero (XMR) \u201cStan\u201d-dom is good. If any of you play HQ trivia and you look in the chat and you see the words Monero, Monero, Monero over again-Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s me.Jay Kang: That\u2019s definitely Aaron.Aaron Lammer: That one\u2019s me.Jay Kang: That\u2019s almost always Aaron.Aaron Lammer: I think I have driven about 10% of the volume of Monero, just with my own fandom.Jay Kang: Based on HQ Trivia, yeah. I actually do shill my own coins on HQ trivia chat too.Aaron Lammer: Here\u2019s the funny thing that happened with Sumo. You\u2019ve gotten to witness this all. Which Sumokoin, right after I buy, and I wasn\u2019t thinking I was going to hold this for years. I was thinking, \u201cWell maybe Sumokoin will double in the next week or two, sell a tidy profit back to Bitcoin.\u201dAaron Lammer: Instead, it went up five X, four or five X, pretty quickly, right after I bought it. I was like, \u201cHoly shit. I got a winner. I got a winning lottery ticket.\u201d And then, I started talking about how I was a Sumokoin baron. And how I-Jay Kang: I think you Tweeted it several times.Aaron Lammer: All about Sumokoin. And then I got kind of, it became part of my identity, that I was a Sumokoin dude. And then I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to run into people and they\u2019ll be like, \u2018Hey, how\u2019s your Sumokoin doing?\u2019 And I\u2019d be like, \u2018I don\u2019t have that Sumokoin anymore.\u2019\u201dJay Kang: Yeah. I think what you\u2019re talking \u2026 I mean, look this happens to me too. I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s some behavioral economics terms for it. But I think that when we luck into a decision in crypto and it works out for us and we feel like we\u2019ve been on that ship a long time.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: We won\u2019t cut bait because the only thing that convinces us that we\u2019re not complete idiot gamblers is the fact that we bought this coin at 14 cents and now it\u2019s like 10 times that value. And then we have to ride it out. Because if it\u2019s not in our portfolio then we just looking at a river of shit.Aaron Lammer: The way I feel also now with SUMO. Sumo\u2019s back to almost its high again.Jay Kang: I know about it.Aaron Lammer: So now I know. I told myself, \u201cNext time it\u2019s up there, you gotta sell it. You gotta get out of this.\u201dJay Kang: You\u2019re not selling it. You\u2019re not going to sell it.Aaron Lammer: But now I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat if SUMO goes to $100 and I\u2019m known as the SUMO guy?\u201d And I don\u2019t have it anymore and then I have to go buy it again on the expensive. And then I\u2019m like, \u201cI only have five Sumokoin guys. Sorry. I used to have a lot.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, you\u2019ll never be able to show your face in the sumo baron lounge anymore and they\u2019ll just be like, \u201cYeah, he used to have it. But he doesn\u2019t have it anymore.\u201d I would actually say that again, none of this is investment advice, to you either.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. My investment advice to people is to just turn off the show now, unsubscribe to the podcast and never listen to anything Jay and I say.Jay Kang: Why would you sell it?Aaron Lammer: I\u2019d sell it \u2019cause I made a big profit on it. As you said, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to lose in the long run, with these shitty coins?\u201dJay Kang: I don\u2019t know. I feel like at some point, you just gotta ride it out. Obviously, every single thing is saying that you probably should have sold it the second that you hit 3X, you know?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: But look, part of crypto is just having fun with it. I don\u2019t know. What would you text me if it wasn\u2019t the price of SUMO every four hour updates?Aaron Lammer: And I feel like, of all the things to become the baron of, am I going to find something as good as Sumokoin, with a \u201cK\u201d?Jay Kang: No, no, no. Names do matter.Aaron Lammer: And the logo\u2019s not bad either.Jay Kang: No, the logo is terrible.Aaron Lammer: I would say that the logo for Sumokoin looks like something that the designer of Insane Clown Posse graphics designed in the late 90s.Jay Kang: It\u2019s a terrible logo. I think the name is good though.Aaron Lammer: So we\u2019ve established that my weakness is buying things based on their name, narrative, icon, logo.Jay Kang: Logo.Aaron Lammer: What\u2019s your weakness?Jay Kang: Oh man.Aaron Lammer: Gambling?Jay Kang: Yeah. Well sports. Sports betting. Bitcoin is a whole different thing. I have no idea if it\u2019s legal or not. I\u2019m pretty sure it is.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not.Jay Kang: Well, can I report it on my taxes?Aaron Lammer: We\u2019ve been planning this show for a couple months.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Taping demos. And my biggest fear was that you were going to get completely rekt sports gambling, to the point where you no longer had any Bitcoin, nor were you interested in it. And that would be the end of this flagship partnership. That has not happened.Jay Kang: I will say in my defense, actually, this is not in my defense, but almost it\u2019s non sequitur that I will wrestle into my own defense. The gambling space in crypto is actually pretty interesting with smart contracts through Ethereum and with just the idea of a decentralized sports book is also interesting.Aaron Lammer: If you ask me right now, of all the ICOs, what are the highest percentage chance of these to actually succeed? I\u2019d be like, \u201cAll of the casino and gambling ones.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, \u2019cause there\u2019s a use case. And people will use it.Aaron Lammer: Yes. People love to gamble.Jay Kang: I will say that I\u2019ve now been probably putting occasional sports bets down in Bitcoin for three to four months. The experience is a lot different than using an offsite book or going to Las Vegas and putting down a bet. And certainly a lot different than using a bookie. It\u2019s something about the fact that you are putting, when you want to put down, let\u2019s say you\u2019re putting down $150 bet, right now that\u2019s .001 btc.Aaron Lammer: Do you worry that every gambling loss you have for the rest of your life that was made in Bitcoin, you will be calculating it based on the price of Bitcoin, which could be over $100,000 at that point?Jay Kang: No. I am thinking that every bet that I make is adding to my Bitcoin stash when it goes to $100,000.Aaron Lammer: So you\u2019re basically doing the same thing gambling on sports that I\u2019m doing gambling on Sumokoin?Jay Kang: Yeah. And I think that\u2019s where the corollary is, right?Aaron Lammer: But why? Do you feel like you\u2019re better at sports gambling than alt coin trading?Jay Kang: No, because I think at this point you could actually make a reasonable bet. You would say that I will probably win this bet, much more so than I will beat the coin spread here. That if you bought 10 random coins on Cryptopia this week, or on Kucoin or on HitBTC, that some of them would go down quite a bit. But one of them would go way up and that you would probably end up doubling the money. I\u2019m only talking about this week.Aaron Lammer: Not that many went down though. That\u2019s the crazy part.Jay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s what I mean though. That\u2019s just this week, right? I will just say that, ask somebody who has a compulsive need to gamble that I found that this is probably both the dumbest but also the easiest and most painless way to do it so far, that I\u2019ve found.Aaron Lammer: See, for me, I\u2019m not really a gambler. This is as close as I\u2019ve come to gambling, is buying crap coins.Jay Kang: And the question that I think is, if I had hit a Sumokoin, like you did, if I hit something that in one day went up five times what I bought it for, would I be more interested in just gambling on shit coins? Yeah, probably. But it hasn\u2019t happened to me yet. Don\u2019t know what it feels like to be a SUMO Baron,.Aaron Lammer: Jay, I want you to become Baron. I want your feudal estate to be right next to mine and both of us to ride it to victory. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do on this show. We\u2019re not going to tell you how much money we have in coins. Both of us have been involved with journalism. So you can guess, it\u2019s not that much.Jay Kang: Neither of us are really-Aaron Lammer: We\u2019re taping this in the basement and Jay said, \u201cWould it be possible for us to get heat at some point?\u201d earlier.Jay Kang: We are both basically wearing scarves right now.Aaron Lammer: But we want to keep you up as to what we\u2019re trading. Our failures and quasi successes as we go. We\u2019ll be telling you what\u2019s in our bag. You can write and tell us what\u2019s in your bags. Hopefully, I feel like the show might get us some good tips, right?Jay Kang: Yeah, please, if at all possible. Let us know anything. Things that you hate about the show. If there were things that you wish that we did more. Especially if there are people who you think that we should talk to, to have on as guests.Aaron Lammer: If you want to get in touch it\u2019s hi@cointalk.show \u2014 this show is kind of typical of what an episode will be like, except usually we\u2019ll have a guest on and they will weigh in on those topics and we will interview them a bit about what their experiences around crypto have been. Which is a fascinating topic to me. \u2019Cause people come to this with totally different life experiences. I want to have on cryptographers and I want to have on people who\u2019ve been day-traders. I want to have on people who are tech journalists. All those perspectives I feel like are colliding in this world.Jay Kang: What if we bring on the competing SUMO baron. What if he has more sumo than you and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re a fake SUMO baron.\u201d?Aaron Lammer: A friend of SUMO is a friend of mine.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to feel that way, or she.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019ll have a new episode for you every week and maybe even more than that. You down to do more than that sometimes?Jay Kang: Whenever news breaks, which is a lot in crypto, let\u2019s say the market crashes or Satoshi comes forward or the market crashes, we\u2019ll be here.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019ll be here with you. You can subscribe in any podcast app, you can also follow us on Medium at medium.com/cointalk. Medium is going to have a transcript of every show, in case you want to read our stupid ideas, so you can go through them faster.Jay Kang: Yes, if you want a written down version of every coin that we\u2019ve talked about and said that we liked, just so that you can go against them, it will be on the site.Aaron Lammer: And we\u2019ll also publish along with it a little reading list. We didn\u2019t cite it when we were talking about Ripple (XPR), but both of us really enjoyed Ryan Selkis\u2019 piece, I think he\u2019s at @twobitidiot on Medium. His piece on Ripple really was the background reading that at least got me to understand what Ripple was so I wasn\u2019t blindly hating it.Jay Kang: Yeah, and Izabella Kaminska\u2019s piece in the Financial Times, which I thought was a very good case as to why Ripple might have a long road ahead for bank integration, that also was great. We\u2019ll put that in the show notes as well.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, okay. Subscribe, say hi at hi@cointalk.show and we will see you very shortly.Jay Kang: CoinTalk.Aaron Lammer: CoinTalk.

CEO Under Fire at Disrupt SFCue the Rolling Stones.Martine ParisFollowSep 13, 2018 \u00b7 7 min readWhen Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, took the stage at Disrupt SF last week, he was met by TechCrunch\u2019s Mike Butcher with an unrelenting line of questioning into the activities of the controversial fintech company. It was a masterful interview focused on clarifying whether Ripple has been manipulating the market to boost the XRP price, which is now down 90% from its 2018 high.Ripple Labs, which offers enterprise global payments on the blockchain, is the issuer of XRP, the world\u2019s third largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The company has been sued for securities fraud by irate investors who lost money in the recent crash and allege that Ripple created the XRP token to fund its operations and the development of the XRP ecosystem. Under the Howie Test, based on investor expectations and how it was marketed, XRP could be ruled an unregistered security in violation of SEC regulations.Are you in fact the devil?\u201cI\u2019m not the devil,\u201d Garlinghouse replied laughing. \u201cPeople who say that Ripple is somehow the devil, it\u2019s because we\u2019re partnering with the man. Cross border payments today are slow and expensive. Ripple invented a series of technologies built upon the XRP ledger that allows institutions, banks and even in some cases, government to dramatically accelerate the nature of transactions.\u201dMike Arrington, Founder of TechCrunch and Arrington XRP Capital agreed, \u201cXRP is a fantastic currency to use for among other things, funds. We need to move a lot of money very quickly. We make investments all over the world. Using banks to move money is a pain. Have you ever sent money in an international wire? You gotta call, did you get it? And what? No I didn\u2019t get it. It takes a day or two to move money around the world. With XRP, our very first close was $50 million. We moved that money in like three seconds and I think it cost 20 or 30 cents.\u201dArrington discussed his longtime friendship with Garlinghouse. \u201cWhen TechCrunch originally sold to AOL, and eventually became part of the Verizon behemoth, Brad was at AOL. He\u2019s the primary person that make that deal happen. He made me wealthy, not as wealthy as him, but wealthy. And it turns out now he\u2019s the fifth richest person in California or something. When Brad first joined Ripple, I went to him for advice and he helped me raise the fund by introducing me to most of our large LPs that hold large amounts of XRP.\u201d Arrington noted that Ripple isn\u2019t an LP and XRP is now only a small part of their portfolio.How much is too much?Garlinghouse tops the Forbes list of crypto billionaires, along with Ripple founders Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb (also the founder of Mt. Gox and Stellar).Ripple has not only been in the news for lawsuits, it\u2019s also been in the news for charity. Ripple investor Ashton Kutcher of Sound Ventures has been speaking on behalf of the company, announcing high profile donations by Ripple to celebrity-backed charities like Madonna\u2019s Raising Malawi campaign and Ellen Degeneres\u2019 Wildlife Fund. On March 26, Ripple made history with the largest single cryptocurrency donation ever, giving away a stunning $29 million in XRP to fund all 35,647 campaigns on DonorsChoose benefiting 16,500 schools and over 28,000 teachers.Butcher questioned whether the XRP infusion was truly philanthropic or merely a desperate attempt to pump excess XRP from the pre-mine into the ecosystem to boost prices. \u201cSo, you come up with a fantastic ability to move money around the planet, but XRP prices are crashing. You\u2019re trying to get the banks to use the actual currency. They\u2019re using the Ripple protocol but they\u2019re not using XRP, are they? You pre-mined all this currency and made a heck of a lot of money. You\u2019re trying to get people to use XRP. \u201d Butcher said.Garlinghouse responded, \u201cSilicon Valley doesn\u2019t do enough to give back. We may be accused of being the devil in terms of how we partnered with the system. I\u2019ve never been accused of being the devil for, you know, being philanthropic and supporting causes that are actually good for the planet.\u201dWhen asked, Arrington said he was never offered free XRP to seed his fund.Butcher then asked Garlinghouse if he paid social media influencers to hype XRP. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the XRP fanboys on Twitter. Are you paying them to shill? Are they just trying to boost the currency?\u201dGarlinghouse replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t pay them.We have a lot of advocates.\u201dArrington added, \u201cOne of the most interesting books I\u2019ve read is Guns, Germs and Steel. We are naturally tribal and form teams. Fanboys for Bitcoin and Fanboys for XRP are saying almost the same thing, they\u2019re actually enthusiasts who have changed their lives and the lives of their family.\u201dButcher continued, \u201cYour criticism of Ethereum is it\u2019s got a big developer network, and you\u2019re trying to boost the amount of developers using XRP with Xpring. You\u2019re trying to boost the market, do you think?Garlinghouse replied, \u201cThe observation I\u2019d make about the Ethereum ecosystem today is that there is a lot of experimentation. There\u2019s not a lot of successfully deployed, solving real problems. There\u2019s one project that I find very interesting called Augur.\u201d Garlinghouse added that he didn\u2019t own any ether, but he did own bitcoin.Regarding Ripple, Garlinghouse said, \u201cRipple has very specifically decided to go very deep in a particular vertical with a clear customer, a clear value proposition in solving a clear problem.\u201d He discussed his Peanut Butter Manifesto which he wrote at Yahoo about companies that spread themselves too thin. \u201cI was meeting with some of the IBM team and they were talking about using a blockchain to track flower freshness. I don\u2019t get it. More often than not a database is going to be more efficient than a blockchain. People use words like blockchain and crypto as catnip for the investors.\u201dPointing at EOS, Arrington said, \u201cI think that these projects that come out and raise a lot of money, in some cases billions of dollars, don\u2019t need that much money, and so I always think that\u2019s odd. If you look at the history of Silicon Valley, there are as far as I know, zero examples of companies that have raised massive amounts of funding before launching a product and being successful.\u201dAbout that air gapGarlinghouse went on to explain why XRP could not be considered a security, \u201cA security is something that represents ownership in a company that gives you rights to dividends, gives you rights to governance. XRP and Ripple are two separate things. We have shareholders, we have investors that include Google Ventures, we have banks that have invested their own share of Ripple the company. When you buy XRP, that doesn\u2019t give you any rights to the profits or ownership of Ripple the company. If Ripple the company shutdown tomorrow, the XRP ledger would continue to operate.\u201dResponding to claims that Ripple maintains a centralized XRP ledger, he said, \u201cPeople are saying the XRP ledger is centralized. It\u2019s factually not true. The XRP ledger is fully decentralized. Ripple the company cannot control the XRP ledger apart from the fact that you control a handful of nodes. We control, I think, 7% of all of the public nodes on the XRP ledger. In contrast, you have (three) miners in China that control north of 50% of the Bitcoin blockchain. By any measure, the Bitcoin blockchain is more centralized that the XRP ledger. People say Ripple can block a transaction. Not true. Can we rollback a transaction? We actually can\u2019t.\u201dAnd the crash\u2026Addressing concerns about the drop in XRP price, Garlinghouse commented, \u201c18 months ago the entire crypto market was worth $20 billion. Today it\u2019s worth $230 billion. In between it hit about $850 billion. If we drew a straight line from 18 months ago to today you\u2019d say it\u2019s been a huge bull market. There have been in the last five or six years multiple crashes that have been effectively reconsolidation. You\u2019re going to see a separation between those that are purely speculative and those that are actually solving real utility problems in the marketplace.\u201dUnintended consequencesArrington shared his thoughts on what will happen if the U.S. continues with their lack of support for the blockchain ecosystem. \u201cI\u2019m Libertarian. I don\u2019t like the government in general. 80\u201390% of our investments are in Asia, Europe and Israel right now, because they\u2019re actually countries where there\u2019s enough regulatory certainty that entrepreneurs feel safe starting their blockchain companies there. Here they don\u2019t. There\u2019s so much regulatory uncertainty. And then add to that the tax burden and the visa burdens of coming here. And then our current federal government\u2019s stance on immigration in general. They\u2019re just saying f*ck it, and they\u2019re staying in Singapore, Israel and Europe, instead of coming here and starting companies. The SEC needs to get their act together. If they had done that with the Internet in 1994, 1995, none of us would be here. We\u2019d all be living in Shanghai or somewhere else. They\u2019re single-handedly wrecking the stage of technology development.\u201dGarlinghouse added, \u201cThere are unequivocally bad actors in the ICO ecosystem. There have been frauds and massive scams. Hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars have been heisted and if anything, I\u2019m surprised the SEC hasn\u2019t been more aggressive going after some of those bad actors. I agree that there is a risk that a lot of this development ends up non-US. The impact on the United States economy for having the Internet that we think of today being very U.S. centric has been very positive for the United States.\u201dThe Future Is CryptoButcher closed by asking Arrington to share his thoughts on the next 10 years in crypto and blockchain.\u201cI\u2019m a little tired of the VC game,\u201d said Arrington. \u201cIt\u2019s all new players in crypto. It\u2019s younger, fresher, more interesting people from all over the world. The VC game has gotten very tiring to me. Crypto moves much more quickly than the tech world, which already moves quickly. But a few months feels like a year or two in crypto. And I actually like that. I think it\u2019s keeping me young. It\u2019s keeping me excited. And it\u2019s just a lot more fun.\u201dOriginally posted in The FinTech Times, September 13, 2018, by me!", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Ripple", "Technology", "Bitcoin"]}]
