And revealing the truth is important for everyone looking to be a part of the next big innovation.Ripple is dominatingYou\u2019ve heard the news. Ripple has the 2nd highest market cap out of all cryptocurrencies \u2014 a whopping $128 billion USD. A valuation higher than Uber, Airbnb, and Slack combined with $20 billion left over in pocket change. Ripple was the best performing cryptocurrency of 2017, with a staggering 36,000% increase from the beginning of the year!Coinmarketcap.com Jan-Dec 2017Things have certainly been going well for Ripple. And to some it\u2019s no surprise. They\u2019ve been killing it for years. From 2012\u20132016, Ripple raised $93.6 million from Andreessen Horowitz, GV (Google Ventures), and many more of the top VC firms in Silicon Valley. These are the kinds of the firms that routinely invest in startups like Facebook, Slack, and Uber when they\u2019re starting up. Them backing Ripple means they believe in the mission and they believe in the team.Major banks using the Ripple platformAnd Ripple is everywhere online. Successful pilot programs, working with 100+ financial institutions, and even the Japanese government seems to be behind them.Everything is perfect.A textbook case of a company with innovative technology that\u2019s taking the market by storm.And this would be true, if it wasn\u2019t for some of the finer details that have HUGE IMPLICATIONS.1. XRP is not RippleWhen people hear Ripple they instantly think of their coin XRP. This makes sense since other communities and coins are one and the same. When you buy ETH you are betting on Ethereum and when you buy BTC you\u2019re betting on Bitcoin. Why would Ripple be any different?Well, this is where things become interesting. To understand the differences between XRP and Ripple, first we need to examine Ripple the company.Ripple was founded in 2012 as Opencoin, renamed to Ripple in 2015, and is currently based in San Francisco, California. They have more than 150 employees, a nice office, and they sell banking software that uses blockchain.Ripple headquarters in CaliforniaWhat does Ripple do? They have 3 products \u2014 xCurrent, xRapid, and xVia.xCurrent is their flagship product. It gives banks the ability to efficiently move money across borders. It uses RippleNet, the Ripple blockchain, but does NOT use XRP. Banks like this software because it allows them to save money and time when sending payments, without introducing much risk or changes to their workflow.xRapid helps banks improve liquidity when trading in emerging markets. It is the only Ripple product that does use XRP. Banks like it because it helps them free up mountains of money they\u2019re stuck sitting on, but dislike it because it introduces unknowns \u2014 such as the volatility of XRP.xVia is still in development and scheduled to come out in early 2018. It\u2019s similar to xCurrent, but allows entities besides banks (such as corporations and payment providers) to send money through banks. xVia also does NOT use XRP.Remember that impressive 100+ list of financial institutions Ripple is working with? Guess what, they are all using xCurrent. And xCurrent does not use XRP. Of the 100+ partnerships Ripple has, ONLY ONE actually uses XRP the cryptocurrency. There is just one small \u201cnon bank financial institution\u201d from Mexico called Cuallix that is using xRapid.This means that the headlines showcasing Ripple\u2019s partnerships with more and more banks are good \u2014 Ripple the company is succeeding \u2014 but also don\u2019t mean much for XRP gaining adoption.Now this isn\u2019t to say that banks will never adopt xRapid (and start using XRP). In fact, this has been a part of the Ripple business plan from the very beginning. Get banks using xCurrent and then cross-sell them into xRapid. Banks may come to love xRapid.Or they might not.For Ripple this difference doesn\u2019t matter much. For investors in XRP, this is the difference that makes or breaks their investment.2. XRP is not the currency of the futureWhen people hear Bitcoin, they think digital money. As in, you can send money to anyone in the world without limitations.XRP might become this in the future, but right now XRP is stuck in banking. And Ripple has made no mention of changing this anytime soon.This is completely fine and makes perfect sense for Ripple as a company to choose. By focusing on just banks and financial institutions, they can provide value and create a profitable venture.The problem for XRP investors is that XRP can become overbought by people that think it will beat Bitcoin, replace fiat, and become the world currency. This means the market cap can be artificially higher and undergo a correction when this becomes common knowledge.Given that Ripple is going after global bank payments, their real goal is to replace SWIFT, the 45 year old society responsible for moving money between banks internationally.In 2016, SWIFT earned $31 million in profit, sending a huge amount of money through their system. Yet this was small compared to the over >$1,000,000,000,000 in monetary assets around the globe.Being limited to the SWIFT market reduces the opportunity of XRP by many orders of magnitude below that of a true digital world currency.3. XRP is not disruptive technologyRipple isn\u2019t the only company interested in revolutionizing banking.R3 is doing the exact same thing as Ripple. They\u2019ve raised $107 million from top venture capitalists and are using blockchain to help banks move money internationally. They\u2019re currently in 70 of the world\u2019s largest banks and the reason you might not have heard of them is simply because they have been doing this WITHOUT their own coin.SWIFT is working with more than 11,000 institutions and employs over 2600 people. To capture this market, Ripple will have to 100x. The challenge here is that there is no reason SWIFT couldn\u2019t develop their own blockchain technology and use their already established relationships to roll it out faster than Ripple can grow.SWIFT Headquarters in La Hulpe, BelgiumWill SWIFT develop their own blockchain? Harry Newman, SWIFT\u2019s global head of banking seems unphased. He looks at blockchain as simply a new technology which can be integrated into their existing systems if the benefits outweigh the cons.\u201cIf it makes sense to build it into our global payments innovation offering over the next few years then we will. That is why I don\u2019t see this as a disruption. I see these as constructive technologies that can be examined and adopted and used.\u201dAnd their actions align with their words. They have completed a proof-of-concept with 22 banks using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to help them free up capital stored in their nostro accounts. They have also tested smart contracts.Maybe we should all jump on SWIFT\u2019s coin if they come out with one?Stellar Lumens (XLM) was created by the founder of Ripple, Jed McCaleb, in 2014 to solve the problems he saw with Ripple.Stellar has since grown to number 8 in total market cap and is boasting deals with IBM and payment providers in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Korea.By expanding their focus outside of banks, Stellar has the potential to be much larger than Ripple. And the Stellar protocol supports smart contracts, a key component of the popular Ethereum network. A recent win for them on this front was Kik, the $1B messaging app, committing to moving their KIN tokens from Ethereum to Stellar in 2018.4. XRP is not decentralizedRipple controls RippleNet and they own a whopping 62% of the total XRP coins in existence. This has understandably worried XRP investors and Ripple\u2019s response was to lock up 55 billion coins in escrow.As with any centralized system, investors now have to trust Ripple to keep their word.And they most likely will. Given their strategy is to release 1 billion each month for the next 55 months, they stand to gain a lot of money by selling these 55 billion XRP tokens at the current market price.But the risks of being centralized extend beyond simply whether or not you trust Ripple to keep your best interests in mind and play fairly.The issue is also resilience. The reason digital currency have failed in the past is because a centralized digital currency is too easy to kill with regulation. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization is one of the reasons it\u2019s survived when digital coins of the 2000s (like E-gold, Liberty Reserve and Tencent) failed.Ripple faces the same weaknesses of these early digital currencies. It is one entity to attack legally when things inevitably go wrong.5. XRP adoption \u2260 price increaseAssume everything goes according to plan. Ripple works with 100x more banks. The banks love using blockchain and xCurrent, then decide to take a chance on XRP through xRapid. They love xRapid and feel confident enough in it to process all of their transactions through it \u2014 even ones in the millions of dollars. SWIFT drops the ball hard and completely fails to innovate, losing all of their customers and shutting down.You\u2019re happy. There are more than $5 trillion dollars being transacted daily in XRP. The price of XRP should be to the moon. Right? Well, not necessarily.The value of XRP is driven upwards by people holding the asset and believing it will be worth more in the future. Banks looking to move money across borders are not speculating. In fact, they have a disincentive to hold XRP, since they take on risk due to natural XRP volatility.This means banks will hold XRP for the absolute minimum amount of time they can. And given the speed of the Ripple network; that time is 4 seconds. With banks \u2014 the actual users of XRP \u2014 not holding onto their coins, XRP\u2019s market cap will decrease and EVEN AT SWIFT LEVELS will only result in approximately $230 million.This is worlds apart from the current speculative value of $128 billion.ConclusionRipple is good, but XRP\u2019s success for investors is an uphill battle.First Ripple the company needs to do well. Since XRP is centralized, if Ripple dies so too does XRP.Next Ripple needs to sign up 100x as many banks and financial institutions on xCurrent to become as big as SWIFT at sending payments internationally. Then the banks need to start using xRapid and settling transactions with XRP.In this process, SWIFT, a 45 year old group that has been evolving with technology over that time, needs to fail to offer a competitive product to Ripple and lose their entire market share. Also R3 and other startups breaking into this space have to fail too.And only at this time will all 100 billion XRP coins be worth approximately $231 million, or $0.0023 per coin.This being said, Ripple is still an amazing company. Even if they fail to capture the entire SWIFT market, they could still offer a valuable suite of products to banks. They could still generate significant revenue and command a high price per share.This just might not be the outcome XRP investors are hoping for.Enjoy this article?

Install Atomic.Ripple and XRPRipple is a funds transfer company that created RippleNet and XRP. XRP is a digital asset running on it\u2019s own blockchain. The main purpose behind XRP was to create a decentralized custodial free payment system which will use another consensus algorithm than Bitcoin. The project was initially based on the idea that you can exchange any asset or goods by using XRP ane currency bridges (exchange your currency to XRP and then transfer it to the other address via public ledger in just a couple of seconds).Ripple featuresIn XRP the system is handles by the verified or trusted nodes from the UNL (unique node lits) owned by the Ripple company and third parties. Two years ago it was possible to critise the project, but nowadays XRP is working hard to make their network more decentralized and trustless. Don\u2019t trust, verify!More than 150 nodes are running all over the globe right now and only 10 are governed by Ripple. In the past there were only 10 nodes and the whole XRP Ledger was governed by Ripple company. To decrease the risk of any failures in the validation Ripple decided to make a devirsification of nodes by their region, computing powers and other requirements. They validate tranasctions and protect the network from any maliscious actions. For example, to make changes into the blockchain the whole majority of nodes (80%) should vote for two weeks for these changes. Every node has only one vote, it\u2019s fair and trustless.The next step for centralization will be to decrease Ripple nodes from validation. Ripple will decrease the number of self-governed nodes with every two newcomers to the UNL (unique node list). Then every node will receive their own Token (unique number) that will be used for Vailidators Rotation. And the final step for the nearest future will be implementing Cobalt consensus algorithm.Sound impressive, isn\u2019t it?XRP real world use casesRipple is working with different financial institutions (banks and etc.) to provide a better and faster option for cross-border money transfer and exhange.Buy XRP (Ripple) instantlyNow you can Buy Ripple with a bank card easily!

To control these assets fully, you need to get familiar with some nuances.These assets use Destination Tag technology, the purpose of which is to assign the specific recipient of the transaction.What is Destination Tag?For example, some trader gives you their XRP address to send coins to, and you suddenly notice that this is the same XRP address as yours. How\u2019s that possible?It happens since exchanges often use a one XRP address for all their XRP traders. The only difference is the Destination Tag, a short complimentary code piece that assigns your transaction to a certain account.The Destination Tag is mandatory for the overwhelming majority of transactions. Once you set random numbers or inappropriate values instead of the required combination, you\u2019ll lose your funds. Either the funds will be sent to any other user having that combination as the tag, or to the exchange storage as an unassigned transaction.The Destination Tag purpose is to identify a transaction recipient.It\u2019s like the numbers of rooms. If you live in the same building, you\u2019ll need to use exactly your room number. If you live in a private house, you won\u2019t need one.How to use Destination Tag?The Destination Tag is not needed if you have your own personal wallet address for these coins. Atomic Wallet provides every user with their own wallet address. However, when it comes to exchanging your coins using centralized services, the Destination Tag becomes mandatory.Don\u2019t use the name of an exchange service as a Destination Tag! Otherwise, your transaction will get stuck as unassigned.In Stellar, the Destination Tag is called \u00abMemo ID\u00bbIn Monero, the Destination Tag is called \u00abPayment ID\u00bbIt\u2019s just the different names of the same feature.XRP Destination Tag in Atomic Wallet UIDestination Tag freeIf you want to use the custody-free wallet for Ripple, Stellar, Monero and other altcoins and tokens, download and install Atomic Wallet at atomicwallet.io.

(For a fun twist, you can pronounce it wipple in your head the whole time.)Ripple makes payment software for banks; their flagship product, xCurrent, doesn\u2019t even use XRP, because it doesn\u2019t need to.An upcoming product (xRapid) will use XRP as a way to \u2018source liquidity\u2019 \u2014 it will allow a customer to have access to a fiat currency without previously amassing a big pile of that currency. The big boss says one or two banks should be doing the money shuffle with xRapid by the end of 2018, and dozens by the end of 2019.Ripple owns lots of XRP. That XRP is locked up and will be released over the next 4.5 years. Each month, 1 billion XRP are released (about $500m) \u2014 available for Ripple to sell on the market. For the last 6 months, they have chosen to return 90% of that into the lock up, keeping a cheeky fifty mil as walkin\u2019 around money.If Ripple the company went away, XRP and the network it sits upon would be just fine \u2014 although the price of XRP would tank since so many people think that XRP is Ripple.Interledger is the protocol that sits under RippleNet. It is being developed as a potential web standard under the watchful eye of the W3C, you can find the unofficial draft specification here.In the xCurrent product (with no XRP), it is used to join the ledgers of banks together into a network. It could also be used to join XRP, or any other, ledgers together.The CTO, Stephan, has left Ripple to be with Coil, a company that will use Interledger to create a way of allowing money to flow from consumers to creators on the internet, kicking ads to the curb in the process. This is the part that gets my juices flowing.I was originally going to say that Ripple doesn\u2019t really compete with the likes of Bitcoin, but then I heard that they want to make the \u201cXRP ledger more decentralised than Bitcoin or Ethereum\u201d. Shots fired!(Although at the moment, to be more decentralised than Bitcoin, you just need more than three Chinese factories.)Ripple is quite a different beast to all the other cryptocurrencies out there. They\u2019re up to almost 300 employees, have truckloads of money at their disposal, and are unapologetically running a business that services banks.It\u2019s no wonder they draw a lot of ire.But at the same time, Interledger is not only open source, but hopefully on its way to becoming a web standard (or part of one), meaning that it can then be incorporated into browsers.If this happens (Interledger becoming a standard that is then built into the major browsers) we will then effectively have money baked into the web and I think that\u2019s pretty interesting.I\u2019d like to do a deep dive into Interledger at some point. All I\u2019ll say here is that if you\u2019re interested in the Oyster Protocol and Brave and the Basic Attention Token, then you\u2019ll probably be pretty interested by Interledger.A web of misinformationAs always, for my research I searched for things such as \u201cthe problem with ripple\u201d, \u201cwhy ripple is a scam\u201d and so on. And wow, there\u2019s a lot of stuff out there that is not correct.Luckily, all one needs to do is spend 25 minutes reading the Ripple website (you don\u2019t even have to believe what they tell you), and it will become easy to detect fake news.The article 5 alarming reasons Ripple might not be what you think accidentally did a good job of summarising the misinformation out there. Here\u2019s the five super-alarming reasons, paired with my thoughts on the matter:\u201cXRP is not Ripple.\u201d This is correct. It\u2019s on the Ripple website. In fact there\u2019s a whole page for it. And the poor CEO Brad Garlinghouse repeats \u201cXRP is not Ripple, Ripple is not XRP\u201d in every single interview he\u2019s ever done.I am not alarmed.\u201cXRP is not the currency of the future.\u201d Well that\u2019s just opinion. I think VR won\u2019t catch on and that cheese is pointless, but I don\u2019t expect you to be alarmed about it.\u201cXRP is not disruptive technology.\u201d Oh no, the authors appear to have forgotten their first point, and have confused Ripple\u2019s xCurrent product with XRP. They are saying that Ripple xCurrent, (which does not use XRP) is not disruptive, and has some decent competition. Sure. Whatever.\u201cXRP is not decentralised\u201d. Not true. If Ripple the company were to disappear, the XRP network would not be affected. XRP can operate just fine without Ripple in the same way that Ethereum can operate just fine without the Ethereum foundation. Because (say it with me) Ripple is not XRP, XRP is not Ripple.\u201cXRP adoption \u2260 price increase\u201d. For this to be true, then the following must also be true: \u201cBTC adoption \u2260 price increase\u201d, \u201cXLM adoption \u2260 price increase\u201d, \u201cADA adoption \u2260 price increase\u201d, and so on. They again appear to be forgetting that XRP isn\u2019t Ripple and they\u2019re assuming that the only use case for XRP is Ripple using XRP for xRapid.But anyone can use XRP just like anyone can use Bitcoin.On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rank my alarmedness at a solid zero.There\u2019s misinformation in both directions, of course. Such as with the Reddit post Apple implements interledger in safari on iOS, which says \u201cApple announced they support of the W3C payment request API in Safari. It uses Ripple\u2019s Interledger\u201dThis got almost 500 upclaps.Also, this is not true.The Payment Request API is an established web specification. It has been implemented in Chrome and Edge and Safari and has nothing to do with crypto.It does not use Interledger and the specification makes no reference to Interledger.The person who made the post shows a screenshot of a document called the Interledger Payment Method (which is an unofficial draft written by a Ripple employee) which references the aforementioned Payment Request API (as in \u201cmaybe one day Interledger will be used by the Payment Request API\u201d).Interledger is exciting, but it\u2019s not in your phone just yet. If you\u2019re super keen (you should be!), there\u2019s a reference implementation in JavaScript called Interledger.js that\u2019s just waiting for you to tinker with it.The verdict: XRP as an investmentI\u2019m quite sure that no one knows how much the price of XRP will reflect the success of Ripple the company.In a technical sense, they are disconnected (did I mention that already?), but in reality there is probably some significant correlation between the success of Ripple and the price of XRP.The question is, I suppose, how will that correlation hold over the years?Later this year Ripple plan to go live with xRapid, their first product to actually use XRP. I\u2019ve gotta believe that this will have a positive effect on the price.Iterledger also has the potential to be huge. It doesn\u2019t rely on XRP to function (it\u2019s inter-ledger) but Ripple believe that people will choose XRP because it\u2019s fast and cheap.Maybe five years from now, browsers will ship with Interledger abilities built in, people will default to using XRP because that\u2019s what\u2019s in the readme, and hey presto, XRP becomes the most used currency in the world.So, even though I\u2019ve gone on and on (and on) about Ripple and XRP being different. I\u2019m going to go right ahead and grab $500 worth of XRP because I like Ripple.Suck it, common sense.I\u2019m starting to get it about moneySomething clicked this week and I can see quite clearly now that something is wrong with digital money. (Let the mocking begin.)I can\u2019t buy a sandwich and directly pay the shop owner in money, unless it\u2019s physical. I can\u2019t pay my electricity bills over the internet straight from me to the power provider, and even shifting funds to my llama cleaner requires a third party.I have money, I want someone else to have that money, but we can\u2019t work it out, just the two of us. We need this massive piece of fiscal machinery just to move $4 over the counter in exchange for a coffee.The more I think about it, the weirder this seems.Crypto-angerHaving spent the week researching Ripple, I\u2019ve come across a fair amount of anger, so I thought I\u2019d give that topic a once-over.I have a theory that the people who are really interested in the technology don\u2019t get angry. I mean, it\u2019s all pretty interesting, this crypto stuff.But a certain subset of \u2018the community\u2019 appear to think of all this like some sort of sporting event (coinmarketcap is the leaderboard). They have picked their favourite team and root for them with great fervour.For these people it isn\u2019t about the technology, it\u2019s about the drama and the characters and the competition.I think these are the people getting mad on Twitter (the world\u2019s #1 platform for seeking approval).It\u2019s a little bit comical to watch someone get really worked up about one particular cryptocurrency that they don\u2019t like, because it doesn\u2019t fit with what they believe a cryptocurrency should be.It\u2019s like someone going shopping for a car and yelling at boats.I mean, I really hate sun dried tomatoes, but I don\u2019t go writing blog posts bout it.Maybe I should. Perhaps I\u2019d make it a vlog. I\u2019d call it \u201cDavid yells at food\u201d and start every episode by saying \u201cWhat. Is. Up. YouTube\u201d and do that thing where I talk to one camera but also film from another camera so you can see what I look like from a slightly oblique angle talking to a camera. Do they teach that on the first day of film school or something? It makes me very mad.OK that\u2019s enough of that.Proof of usefulnessOne of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest downsides is the fact that it uses \u2014 some might say \u2018wastes\u2019 \u2014 an enormous amount of electricity.So I\u2019ve been wondering, what if you could take the proof-of-work mechanism \u2014 with thousands upon thousands of processing machines doing work that is ultimately discarded \u2014 and somehow get it to do some useful work.Have you have heard of Folding@home?\u201cFolding@home is a project focused on disease research. The problems we\u2019re solving require so many computer calculations \u2014 and we need your help to find the cures\u201d.Now you\u2019ve heard of Folding@home.Doesn\u2019t it seem wrong to you that on one hand there is a need for computing power that will ultimately save lives, and on the other hand there is a mass of computing power being \u2018wasted\u2019 to secure a cryptocurrency?How hard could it be to combine the two?Maybe it\u2019s possible to break down the protein folding work that Folding@home does into chunks that take a predictable amount of time (e.g. 10 minutes). If you automate that process of building 10-minute chunks of work, then you could have a difficultly adjustment just like there currently is.Maybe that\u2019s not possible \u2014 to get the timing reliable enough \u2014 so perhaps you could have something in the consensus mechanism like: You must earn the right to mine a block by solving a protein folding problem.Your overall chances of mining a block in a given day would stay the same, since everyone must follow the same rule. The protein folding might take 2 minutes or an hour, it wouldn\u2019t matter in the long run provided the work is evenly distributed.Maybe it just isn\u2019t possible to break down protein-folding work. But maybe it is possible for SETI work, or something else I haven\u2019t heard of.Lastly, you\u2019d need a way to submit work to the network, perhaps to be voted on by nodes. Since you probably don\u2019t want to be instrumental in cracking passwords, you might require proof of who the person is. So a proposal to submit proof-of-usefulness puzzles to the network might take the form: \u201cwe are Folding@home and our signed proof is at https://foldingathome.org/pou-proof-key.\u201d \u2014 they then have a licence to publish puzzles for 1 month, or something like that.Details details.Anyway, that\u2019s just some thoughts that have been rattling around in my skull. I\u2019m sure this has already been discussed in great detail somewhere.Next weekI\u2019ve been itching for a while now to get my hands dirty with IPFS. And as of this week, I\u2019ve also been itching to get my hands to a similar state of uncleanliness with Interledger (then Ripple and Protocol Labs can duke it out over who gets to hire me).But these posts take about 8 hours to write and the research is probably another 10\u201320, which is most of my time outside my day job.Also, I\u2019ve looked at most of the coins that seem promising and I\u2019ve got no interest heading into ICO town because that\u2019s just straight up gambling.Even heading further down into the top 200 seems like a whole lotta guesswork \u2014 I reckon I\u2019m pretty good at spotting crap, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m any good at picking what the rest of the world will think is great.So, I\u2019m considering taking a break from the weekly write-ups of cryptoassets, and instead actually building something of substance and writing about that.Maybe if I stumble across something interesting (Tezos keeps doing a little dance in my peripheral) I\u2019ll dive into that and do a write-up.We will see. (I\u2019ll continue to do the $500/week into BTC, ETH and XRP.)One last thing, did anyone do that memory thing last week? Did it stick? Impact, galaxy \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 stomach \u2026 ancient?

Ripple is aiming to bridge the remittance cost-gap between institutions across the globe \u2014 Financial Institutions. something that has torn the cryptocurrency community due to the decentralized nature /ideals of the markets.Why has Ripple been such a major topic in the cryptocurrency community?Well, take a look at the image below. I don\u2019t have a clue when this picture was created, but Bitcoin fees and Credit Card Processing fees continue to take center-stage topic as more and more retail consumers enroll in the markets. Why fees? I thought the magic of Bitcoin was in it\u2019s Decentralised Organisational Structure? It is, still. Bitcoin will not be regulated by any government and cannot be shut down unless governments in every country across the globe shutdown electricity to every individual supporting the network via Bitcoin Mining. More below.The reason Bitcoin still has such high-fees is because the network is currently developing different technological solutions to solve this problem, allowing Bitcoin to scale. Instead of staying patient, a faction of the original Bitcoin community led by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu decided to continue supporting the old fork which, today, is known as Bcash (short for Bitcoin Cash), in an effort to expedite the process of Bitcoin becoming a tool for payment processing and Remittances.Looking above at the original Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto, we can see the title clearly states:\u2018Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u2019Key-word = Peer-to-Peer. While Bitcoin Cash is still a decentralized Blockchain (database), it is very, very heavily influenced by a centralized force of commercial Bitcoin miners. This takes away the original peer-to-peer ideals out of the BCash network because it is so centralized \u2014 the miners are controlled by a couple people which gives a major threat to 51% attacks on the Proof Of Work (POW) Bitcoin Network.51% attacks are prevented by having a majority of the network\u2019s mining hash power distributed across individuals as opposed to running ASICS-powered mining rooms in one building, centralized. Since BCash is a centralized blockchain network, it can be compared with Ripple \u2014 another centralized blockchain aiming to create a remittance system for institutions who will ultimately allow their customers to make low-cost remittances through the Ripple payment network.Now that we know the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash when it comes to the nature of the blockchain, we can look at Ripple through a similar lens that we look at Bitcoin Cash through \u2014 a company using blockchain technology strategically to increase the quality of service for companies using their service, but in a centralized manner.For the purpose of this article, it\u2019s important to know the difference between a truly decentralized blockchain network and one that is centralized, but using blockchain technology to power the network. The hurry to become a payment processing network will likely impede BCash\u2019s growth progress because security is far, far more important than being first-to-market. Look at the recent Equifax Data Leak (September 2017). This is one of, if not THE, world\u2019s biggest Credit Rating Agencies in the world \u2014 the WORLD.You can look into the statistics yourself, but over 150 million customer\u2019s information was stolen \u2014 yours, mine, your parents, etc. This is an issue Blockchain Technology aims to solve by using Public-key Cryptography to thwart hackers\u2019 ability to steal mass amounts of data in one fowl swoop. As soon as the Lightning Network is established and Atomic Swaps become more stable, the Bitcoin Economy will be easily integrated into other blockchain networks as it continues to become more efficient.A major lack of patience is what caused the Bitcoin Cash chain to continue running after the Bitcoin Cash Hard-Forks From Bitcoin (August 2017) \u2014 that and the sometimes uncontrollable characteristic of human-greed.Anyway, let\u2019s dive into Ripple and how this centralized blockchain network may have the ability to garner Visa, MasterCard\u2019s, or any other Credit Card Processing company\u2019s business, and what type of price movement this could create for the Ripple (payment network).One of the pictures above displays that Ripple already has a much, much lower fee than the distributed Bitcoin network and Visa\u2019s current fee schedule. Even Bitcoin\u2019s currently inefficient network beats Visa\u2019s payment processing fees. Ripple has a highly-dedicated team of Finance and experienced technology professionals fueling their growth and they are either aiming to integrate with credit card processors like Visa OR simply take their market-share. Either way, it should be interesting to watch Ripple\u2019s price in the process!The sheer statistical figures below give us some interesting potential scenarios that I will have fun projecting below in this article!Okay so 16,600 Financial institution clients\u2026do we really need to go through every single stat? I don\u2019t think so\u2026we all know Visa owns a significant portion of the market so let\u2019s have fun diving into potential Ripple projections!According to CoinMarketCap\u2019s Ripple profile, there are currently 38,739,144,847 XRP in circulation with a total of 100 billion XRP in max supply, held by Ripple leadership and a fund of XRP used to ease the price growth of XRP as the company increases the volume and attention on their products. I will keep all figures the same as they are now in the projections below:38,739,144,847 XRP.$8,900,000,000,000 is Visa\u2019s yearly total payment processing volume.Now, keep in mind that Ripple will be used for payment PROCESSING. Meaning, Ripple will not always be held for the entire time it is being used to send value, right? For example, you or I might send U.S. Dollar to somebody in Europe where the USD is instantly converted into XRP, sent to the final destination at a bank in Europe, and then settled in Euro (currency) or the proper tender in the country sent to. However, Visa will not be the only provider that would use Ripple, it would be major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan and other behemoths.Since Ripple is a Digital Currency/Virtual Currencies, financial institutions and especially Assets Under Management institutions can add it as an Asset Diversification strategy in their client Portfolios. So we don\u2019t know how much volume will be transacted in XRP by these institutions, so let\u2019s have some fun!$8,900,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= $229.742 XRP.Kind of cool to think about, heh? The equation above is IF Ripple\u2019s XRP captured ALL of the value of the Visa payment network, something unlikely to occur. However, as mentioned, Visa isn\u2019t the only company Ripple can serve. What about Mastercard?Interestingly, I could not find a single number that made sense to include in this article because one source says that Mastercard was processing $5.5 trillion in transactions as of 2003 and another source (image above) says 10\u2013years later, in 2013, Mastercard is processing $3.5 trillion \u2014 companies do not usually shrink over time, but maybe Visa or other payment processors took some Mastercard volume? I don\u2019t know, but let\u2019s use the $3.5 trillion figure from the image above.$3,500,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= $90.35 XRPIf, somehow, Ripple was able to capture all of the value of both Mastercard and Visa processing volume, XRP price might look something like below:$3,500,000,000,000 + $8,900,000,000,000= 12,400,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= $320.09 XRPKeep in mind, the Assets Under Management (AUM) market is currently a $71 trillion market as per PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)\u2019s Assets Under Management 2020: A Brave New World report, and expected to grow to $101 trillion by 2020. Considering Mastercard and Visa\u2019s payment processing equates to something like $12.4 trillion in annual volume, that\u2019s just a drop in the bucket compared to the large and separate $71 trillion AUM market.What if, say, all major asset funds used the \u20185% rule\u2019 to diversify into 5 different major currencies, one of them being Ripple\u2019s XRP? This assumption means that 1% of the overarching $71 trillion AUM market share would go to Ripple\u2019s XRP.0.01 x $71,000,000,000,000= $710,000,000,000 ($710 billion)Just the $710 billion would increase the $320.90 XRP price by:$710,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= $18.33 XRP$320.90 + 18.33= $339.23 XRPRemember, PwC projects the AUM market to reach $101 trillion by 2020, just 2-years away. What might this $18.33 price increase be if it were 1% of a $101 trillion market?0.01 x $101,000,000,000,000= $1,010,000,000,000 \u00f7 38,739,144,847 XRP= 26.07 XRP$320.90 + 26.07= 346.97 XRPThese are some pretty \u2018brave\u2019 and potentially over-zealous projections to make for Ripple\u2019s XRP price and is not meant to be taken as a forecast of what will happen or advice for that matter. You, me, nor anybody else truly knows what will happen in the future of this financial revolution we are currently in the process of experiencing and are an integral part of. However, the dynamics discussed in this article are potential forces that will affect the price of XRP in the potentially near-future.If you\u2019re interested in trading Ripple\u2019s XRP, you can find it at the following exchanges:Binance ExchangeCEX ExchangeEXMO ExchangeBittrexBitfinexKrakenHuobiPoloniexPlease clap for this article and follow my blog as I continue to write about various thought-provoking topics in the cryptocurrency market!

During the .com bubble this manifested itself in anything related to the internet soaring and companies like etoys.com or letsbuyit.com commanding hefty valuations only to later succumb to their fates. There is currently a very strong move going on in the cryptosphere which mirrors this bubble characteristic.Top 10 \u201cCoin\u201d Assets by TOTAL Supply market cap, Coinmarketcap.comLet\u2019s look at the current Top 10 Crypto \u201cCoins\u201d in market cap by total supply (ie not just circulating supply, which is a misrepresentation that is prevalent in the entire space, see my previous articles on the topic). I am not a coder at all, but even my simplest of technical minds is able to grasp the following example.The big surprise is that the highest market cap coin in the world is actually not bitcoin, but Ripple at this point in time. In short, Ripple aims to take the blockchain technology to large financial institutions in a scalable way in order to compete with and possibly replace SWIFT. Lofty goals for sure and the number and names of banks said to be clients of Ripple certainly lend some sort of credibility to the firm. However, it is important to note a few points regarding Ripple\u2019s valuation.The public blockchain of Ripple is currently valued at over $200bn or more than Goldman Sachs, Pfizer or General Electric (let that sink in for a second). This public blockchain currently has zero use for anyone. It is a centralized ledger and thereby unattractive to anyone believing in the crypto value proposition of decentralized, trustless transactions. It is in effect simply another centralized system not that different from SWIFT in many ways. The company behind Ripple owns c. 62% of the total Ripple supply directly (escrow not withstanding) and there are no decentralized miners. Other people far more qualified than myself have written about the reasons for decentralization, but suffice it to say, this key difference makes it impossible for Ripple to be valuable the way bitcoin is.Fair enough you might say, given Ripple has reportedly gained well-known financial institutions as clients, there is no need for Ripple to be decentralized in order for it to have enourmous value that might easily outshine bitcoin if the banking industry were to start using it as an alternative to SWIFT. Banks certainly won\u2019t mind centralization. While that is true, note that this has nothing whatsoever to do with the Ripple coins that you can buy on crypto exchanges and that constitute the market cap that currently ranks number one in the world above bitcoin. None of the banks will use the public blockchain as their means to transfer money. When they become clients of the company behind Ripple, they are asking them to build (or rather to explore building) a PRIVATE, in-house blockchain based on Ripple technology. To avoid any doubt, that blockchain, just like SWIFT will be internal to the banks and there will not be any transactions taking place from banks using the public Ripple blockchain. Yes, that might (this is a very small chance in my view) at some point still happen for some smaller banks, but it is not the likely use case and certainly not what is happening currently. Therefore at this point, \u201cdumb money\u201d mostly at home on Coinbase and some of the other \u201centry-level\u201d exchanges is currently attributing a valuation of $200bn+ to something that is quite literally hot air. None of this is to say that the team behind Ripple might not one day build a replacement for SWIFT, but let it sink in again that this has no relation whatsoever to the coin people are trading now. It is not equity in the Ripple company, it is a share in a useless network. (Edit: don\u2019t believe me? here s the FT: read)A final thought on Ripple for everyone who claims the protocol still has a value for people not minding the centralization who want fast and cheap transactions. To those people I say: use raiblocks \u2014 it is decentralized, lightning fast and most importantly free. There are no transaction fees. This value proposition is unlikely ever to be bettered by a for-profit organization\u2019s centralized public blockchain. Should that public blockchain (again \u2014 not the company\u2019s equity) really be worth more than Pfizer?! Let me throw in that Uber\u2019s latest investment round was valueing the company at just under $50bn. A fourth of the value of Ripple\u2019s useless coins.Some good commentary on this whole Ripple issue can be found in this discussion of Tone Vays and Jimmy Song from c. minute 6 onwards for 10 minutes or so: link. Also, a full cryptoscam episode here.Other coins with similar issues where the companies behind these coins might easily have an attractive product to offer to corporate clients, but suffering of very much the same issues as Ripple or where the entire coin very much looks like a scam that we can currently find in the Top 10 (!) of Crypto market cap are IOTA, Bitcoin Cash, ATMcoin and potentially Solarcoin. I have not done enough digging on the latter two, so they might be wrongly added to the list, but you can do your own research. Even just looking at the \u201cnormal\u201d Circulating supply market cap (basically the start page of coinmarketcap.com), you have several of these centralized, useless public chains as well as scams listed with $0.5bn+ valuations. To name a few, we can find Ripple, IOTA, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitconnect, Tether, Veritasaeum and Digibyte all in the Top 50.The fact that the market currently does not seem to distinguish between strong projects with coins that will actually have a use case and potentially a value to investors like Syscoin, Raiblocks, Monero, bitcoin, Sumokoin or Lisk and the aforementioned scams or useless \u201chot air\u201d token in terms of valuation shows only one thing: a lot of \u201cdumb money\u201d that buys anything blockchain related and hyped by potentially malignant actors with a hidden agenda (nota bene: this refers to pump and dump schemes, never to the people behind the projects) has recently entered the crypto markets. That is very often the final stage of a bubble and I do not believe that \u201cthis time is different\u201d.Crypto valuation levels are now getting relatively close to .com levelsCrypto and bitcoin adoption \u2014 How far along are we really in this rally?I recently read this interesting article by Ari Paul on Forbes, which basically argues that in terms of adoption of\u2026medium.comAn (Institutional) Investor\u2019s Take on CryptoassetsIMPORTANT NOTICE: This document is intended for informational purposes only. The views expressed in this document are\u2026medium.comI pasted the above two articles here as I try to use some small-town analytics in the first one to compare the .com bubble in size to the current crypto bubble and the second article is an excellent paper by John Pfeffer that clearly makes the case for the long term value of bitcoin and other crytpo assets coming to the same conclusion as myself (namely, bitcoin might be a rational addition to an investor\u2019s portfolio, but current valuation levels do not support any other crypto asset to be added).In the first article I conclude that the .com bubble was worth approximately $4trn, but that about 90% of that was institutional money. The share that is comparable to crypto is probably much smaller as the institutional side to crypto investing will need much clearer regulations and asset custody security to really take off. I am of the opinion this will happen only after the current, private individual-driven bubble bursts.At this point in time, the combined total supply market cap (ie not the circulating supply, but the supply that includes the founders/team\u2019s allocation of token, which is only sensible, please see an earlier aricle here) of all crypto assets has surpassed $1trn. That is one trillion US Dollars for \u201cassets\u201d that offer a share in network dynamics but no ownership in the underlying blockchains or development teams at all. I am not saying many of these projects won\u2019t disrupt the economy, much like the internet did, but they currently certainly are not (much like internet stocks did not yet in 1999/2000).That means the current bubble in crypto of $1trn compares to approximately $400bn fueled by private individuals in the .com bubble. As I say in my earlier article, of course the crypto assets are valuable so not all of this is bubble, but by now it is relatively safe to assume that the part of crypto valuations driven by bubble-mania has reached at least the level of the .com bubble in terms of private individuals\u2019 involvement. I encourage everyone to read John\u2019s excellent paper I linked above on the valuation aspect.The Coinbase issueWhat I describe as the Coinbase issue is a bit special to crypto. The management of digital assets is much more difficult at this stage for the individual user than it is to buy some stocks or even an ETF. There are things like wallets, cold storage, multiple different exchanges and transaction fee settings to worry about, aside from maneuvering the scams like VERI, John McAfee\u2019s coin shills or BCASH.Therefore, people caught in the mania typically buy whatever is easy for them to manage. This means that any coin (rumored to be) added to Coinbase, which is the world\u2019s most likely entry point exchange for most people starting off now, goes parabolic in price for no apparent reason. Ripple is an example of this, while BCash and Litecoin are others.This extends to public, established markets, where the Bitcoin Trust trades at a 20% to 150% premium to its underlying coin holdings (ie people are paying double the price to gain exposure to bitcoin via an easyily tradeable security than what they would have to pay if they simply bought bitcoin directly).Overall, the typical Coinbase user, in my opinion rarely invests in established assets like stocks, bonds and ETFs and might very well be making his or her first experiences with gaining money and losing money on Coinbase trading crypto. I remember well how agonizing and thrilling those times were for me. Currently however, this fraction of the market is dominating the moves of assets and no regulations are in place to prevent malicious behaviour (if crypto is not defined as an asset class like equities etc then insider trading and wash trading are actually not illegal and the market is currently aflush with these activities), so the results are sometimes downright scary. It does not help that mainstream financial media like CNBC, at times, look very much like beginners in the space as well.All of the above make me yet more certain that the current mania will not last and that we will see a massive correction before the cryptomarkets, much akin to Amazon, Ebay, Google or Facebook will truly take off after the wash out is over. It is, by the way, not a valid counter point to say that crypto has been called a bubble many times over and always came back stronger. There is no reason whatsoever the same asset (bitcoin for example) should not experience multiple bubbles after which it falls 80\u201390% and then recovers. So yes, I believe the earlier bitcoin bubbles where indeed also bubbles, but on a smaller (much smaller) scale. But that is debatable.The all important bitcoin price \u2014 where are we going now?I feel like this post would not be complete without updating my previous post on bitcoin price prediction below.Elliot Wave prediction for bitcoin price move from hereThis is to follow up with my earlier price prediction posts. In my last one I said that bitcoin would first correct to\u2026medium.comIn the article above I specifically said that bitcoin was at (in my opinion) the end of its current, years-long bull cycle and that a strong wave 5 (Elliot waves) was in process at the time. I went on to say that this wave was likely to take bitcoin above $15,000 and would be followed by a strong correction that should show the complete A-B-C pattern typical for Elliot Wave corrections. Bitcoin went a bit further up than predicted but sure enough started its correction. I have posted two updated charts below.Medium TermLong TermThe medium term chart is the more relevant in my view and shows two negative developments. Firstly, wave A (itself made up of a-b-c moves) is clearly in process and therefore a correction has begun. What is more worrying is that a Shoulder-Head-Shoulder (S-H-S) formation indicated by the red line has also been triggered with bitcoin falling below $13,500 (if it closes there today). The reasonable target for both wave A as well as the S-H-S is somewhere around $8,000 per bitcoin. Given this would also represent a c 60% correction from the highs, it should serve the market well in sweeping out all the \u201cweak hands\u201d that recently joined crypto and are buying indiscriminately across the board. Afterwards, a recovery to B should follow and a final sell off should test $6,000 to $8,000 levels again. I personally at the very least expect bitcoin to test the $10,000 level soon. With a lot of luck or tether printing it could turn around then and leave all my lower targets untouched.As always, I cannot be even remotely sure this is actually how it plays out, but I find it not too unlikely that this sequence of events is triggered by weak hands exiting (move to A), a few insitutions cautiously buying (move to B) and then government regulation causing another move down (to C). Also as always, given Tether can just conceive new US Dollars out of thin air at this point and push bitcoin price higher on its own, it is just as likely we take off to a new all time high from here, given we are still at the early stages of a very manipulative market.I fully expect the next wave of crypto assets to start making a mark in their respective industries after this correction and institutions to drive prices much higher than the current levels. I also want to re-iterate that I am generally positive on bitcoin and the cryptosphere, but at this point in time I would tread carefully.As always, a short but important disclaimer: none of what I write here is to be construed as advice to buy or sell any kind of asset. It is merely my personal and not my professional opinion. Any asset can go to zero. I also want to add that any negative opinions expressed about the blockchains of brilliant development teams are just that \u2014 opinions.

Lately I\u2019ve been getting a few questions from followers on why I\u2019m still holding XRP after the (~36,000%) returns in 2017, and why it\u2019s still the only digital asset I own. There are a few reasons which I\u2019m happy to share publicly:#Progress. Most people see MoneyGram\u2019s recent announcement to adopt XRP as a brave and spectacular management decision. But it really isn\u2019t. What alternatives are there? MoneyGram could keep on processing crossborder payments through SWIFT and the correspondant banking system, which takes days, is unpredictable, expensive and ties up some >$900MM in interest bearing liquidity. Or it could try and utilize eg Bitcoin, having transaction fees of around $20+, no settlement finality and whose throughput and scalability isn\u2019t anywhere close to allow for commercial implementations. So in the end, adopting XRP (4 second settlement time, 1500 transactions per second and fees of around 1/100th of a cent) is actually \u2018just\u2019 a very rational and economic decision. What\u2019s driving MoneyGram is also driving other money transmitters. So I do expect a constant and positive newsflow of XRP-adopting institutions in the upcoming months and years, fueled by a \u2018disclosure incentive\u2019:#DisclosureIncentive. Ripple continues to have a very strategic and long term approach when it comes to XRP. Working with financial institutions usually is a lenghty process, covered by non-disclosure-agreements (\u2018NDA\u2019). Note that first rumours of a MoneyGram partnership came up in 2015(!). As much as I understand the reason for NDA\u2019s, it does hold down market prices, because the public isn\u2019t aware of potential heavyweight partnerships and how the overall \u2018pipeline\u2019 looks like. But something remarkable happened recently. While cryptocurrencies had a negative connotation (\u2018bubble!\u2019), hindering corporates to disclose respective partnerships, they are now being rewarded by capital markets for making their ties to Ripple and XRP public. Recent examples are Seagate, WesternUnion, SBI Holdings, and MoneyGram.#UtilityValue. It\u2019s an unpopular view because XRP also profits from overall (rallying) market developments, but in my view it\u2019s almost certain that today\u2019s market for cryptocurrencies is in bubble territory: 1,380 cryptocurrencies are heavily traded, complexity is high, beliefs are strong, utility usually not in sight. All strong bubble indicators. I\u2019m not having a view when useless tokens finally disappear. Could be next week, could be 2020. Encouraging sign: with the world\u2019s second largest money transmitter planning (besides two other TOP5 names) to integrate XRP into its core payment flows, Ripple scored a \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d. Via Ripple\u2019s liquidity offering \u2018xRapid\u2019, XRP has reached a turning point, now building true utility value. Evidence is there, that xRapid already works for small Mexican money transmitter Cuallix (the first confirmed xRapid customer), including the desired impact on XRP. It\u2019s important for an investor, as natural buyers act as a downside protection. Imagine you are MoneyGram and need to transfer a $1MM payment from the US to Europe. Today you\u2019d need 500k XRP for it (XRP/USD = $2). If the exchange rate drops to $1.90, you\u2019d now need 526k XRP to bridge the next $1MM payment, generating 26k XRP outright demand, driving the exchange rate back up. Of course this also works in the other direction, but overall it entails stability. Decreasing volatility attracts a new set of financial institutions and corporates. And there are quite a few on the sidelines (~30,000 banks globally + a decent number of payment providers).#Potential. Speculative value is dominant in every crypto, including XRP. Utility value is hardly existant, maybe non-existant. As an investor I try to minimize my downside, so I like to think of a scenario in which all speculative value has vanished. How big could the utility value of a given crypto grow? XRP is unique in a way that its potential utility value by far exceeds today\u2019s market/ speculative value. XRP would need to bridge a fraction of today\u2019s $155tn annual crossborder payment volumes and/or to replace a fraction of the $27tn of stuck capital in global nostro accounts. I\u2019m not talking the dimension of eg a company that successfully built a global social network with some billions of quarterly ad-based revenues. I\u2019m talking about an asset that is intended to move around a share of the entire world\u2019s monetary value.#VirtuousCircle. Ripple is the biggest holder of XRP and also intends to use its pile to incentivize adoption. Ripple also incentivizes market makers to quote competitive spreads against XRP, so more payment volume is bridged through XRP, so network effects keep on building. In other words: every rise in XRP\u2019s price makes it more likely to succeed. Having a >$100bn (XRP equivalent) holder whose goal is to make XRP the world\u2019s primary value transfer vehicle is something very powerful.#Holders. The majority of XRP investors understand the overall strategy, and they are in it for the long run (enabling an even more powerful virtuous circle).#Hedge. To me XRP has become the perfect short/medium term hedge for every investor\u2019s portfolio. Interest rates are at historical lows. Global central banks are becoming more vocal on raising main refinancing rates. It\u2019ll make equities, bonds, commodities and real estate suffer at the same time once interest rates rise. It\u2019ll also make opportunity costs for $27tn of (stuck) capital in nostro accounts rise, which should put XRP in heavy *demand*. It\u2019s a second order effect, but it should enable you to watch everyone\u2019s net worth going down while yours is going up.", "responses": 9, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Xrp", "Ripple", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "What is Ripple?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@haydentiff/what-is-ripple-efc179bc02ae?source=search_post", "author_name": "Tiffany Hayden", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@haydentiff", "publish_date": "2017-05-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-14", "readtime": "3.20", "claps": 1353, "voters": 239, "content": "What is Ripple?A study guide for Cryptocoins NewsTiffany HaydenFollowMay 19, 2017 \u00b7 4 min read\u201cThe technical description of Ripple is rather ambiguous.\u201dIt was once said that it would take the average person around 6 months to fully understand Ripple. I have to agree. I can understand why people would shy away from putting in the effort. What I can\u2019t understand is why uninformed people keep choosing to write about it though. Hopefully, I can help clarify things a bit.To start, it\u2019s helpful to look at Ripple as something completely different from Bitcoin. Ripple is back-end infrastructure and not a consumer facing product. Ripple is not a currency. It\u2019s an open-source, global exchange. Anyone can access it and everyone has an equal right to use it. Ripple, the company, does not control the network, collect fees, or limit access.Ripple is a distributed, real-time payment protocol for anything of value. It\u2019s a shared public database, with a built-in distributed currency exchange, that operates as the worlds first universal translator for money. Ripple is currency agnostic and has a foreign exchange component built right into the protocol. Ripple acts as a pathfinding algorithm to find the best route for a dollar to become a euro or airline miles to become Bitcoin. It will look at all the orders in the global order book. ANYBODY can put a bid-ask on anything of value. The Ripple protocol is designed to route every transaction to the cheapest price available in the market.XRPThere is a transaction fee to use the exchange (~.00001XRP) and it must be paid in XRP, the native asset of the network. This transaction fee is not collected by anyone; the XRP is destroyed and ceases to exist. Having a cost associated with ledger entries helps prevent ledger flooding attacks. Like Bitcoin, XRP has no counterparty risk. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP transactions clear in 4 seconds or less. XRP is a digital asset with verifiable mathematical properties, similar to how we can reliably verify gold as a substance made of 79 protons. XRP also serves as a currency of last resort that can bridge between any currency, asset, or thing of value in the world. If every currency is liquid to XRP, it is also liquid to other currencies. By design, 100 billion XRP were created at Ripple\u2019s inception, and per the protocol rules, no more XRP can ever be created.Nostro AccountsTied-up capital accounts for more than 80% of payment costs for every industry. Worldwide, businesses have more than $27 trillion in capital sitting idle in nostro accounts. Ripple aims to free up this capital by using its global exchange as a market place for float. Financial brokers, market makers, anyone, really, can offer up their cash positions. With a marketplace for cash inventory, businesses no longer need to keep funded positions in every country they send payments to. This also means that the payments will be sent from a local provider, allowing businesses to avoid hitting the international SWIFT rail, which is expensive, slow, and doesn\u2019t scale.Global SettlementThe global foreign exchange market does $5.7 trillion per day and that\u2019s the market Ripple is after. Ripple Consensus Ledger can handle 1,000 transactions per second and XRP Payment Channels allow transaction throughput to increase to tens of thousands of transactions per second, bringing scalability to the same level as Visa.XRP is not the core utility of Ripple. External currencies are the focus of the protocol. Ripple is a global settlement network.There\u2019s been a lot of quasi-religious Bitcoin nonsense spewed, ever since the price of XRP started to rise. Alleged free market capitalists are horrified that Ripple, the company, wants to make a profit and doesn\u2019t plan to distribute XRP in any sort of socialist, utopian manner.Because Ripple is a payment network first and foremost, XRP will be used to make the network as healthy as possible, which will most likely mean managing liquidity with XRP.", "responses": 21, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Blockchain", "Ripple", "Hypocricy", "Fintech"]}, {"title": "XRP is now available on Coinbase", "post_link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/xrp-is-now-available-on-coinbase-d884e33fa8b7?source=search_post", "author_name": "Coinbase", "author_link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/@coinbaseblog", "publish_date": "2019-02-28", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-01", "readtime": "1.16", "claps": 1216, "voters": 220, "content": "XRP is now available on CoinbaseCoinbaseFollowFeb 28 \u00b7 2 min readStarting today, Coinbase supports XRP at Coinbase.com and in the Coinbase Android and iOS apps.

After launching their blockchain in 2012, Ripple Labs has been working with financial organizations to build one of the largest payment networks in the ecosystem, proving one of the first B2B use cases for the fledgling industry.Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have used this as a sign that XRP will be very valuable in the future. In order for these financial institutions to run any operation on the blockchain, they need to spend a small amount of XRP to complete the transaction. And according to the market, this means high value for XRP:Just this year, the value of XRP has grown from below $.01 per token to it\u2019s currency price of $.25, a 25X jump that rivals even the growth of BTC.So why would someone believe that XRP wouldn\u2019t be worth very much in the future? In this article, I\u2019m going to make the case that despite Ripple Labs impressive growth and strong partnership network, XRP has already become obsolete due to the emergence of permissioned blockchains in their market.What is Ripple?Before we can understand the problem, we need to understand what the Ripple does. Ripple is an open-source, semi-permissioned blockchain run by Ripple labs. On the surface, there\u2019s a lot that Ripple offers that\u2019s not too different form other blockchain applications: It has a distributed ledger, a variety of wallet applications and a native asset, XRP.Where Ripple decided to differentiate itself from blockchains like Bitcoin is in it\u2019s use of gateways, issuance and trust lines. Here is a basic overview of these features:A blockchain gateway is feature to allow for transfer of non-native assets (blockchain or otherwise) onto a particular blockchain. This includes a bank being able to lock USD, Yen, or even another blockchain asset like BTC/LTC and be able to transact with it on the Ripple Network.An issuance is a method for an individual account holder on the blockchain to \u2018lock\u2019 a particular asset (let\u2019s say Gold) on the blockchain ledger. Similar to a gateway, after an issuance is made to the blockchain, you can then send it to other accounts, thus taking advantage of Ripple low fees.Trust lines are Ripple\u2019s way of securing issuance transactions between individual parties. As opposed to XRP, which can be sent to anyone, an issuance can only be sent to parties who both agree to open a line of communication. So while I can send and receive XRP from anyone in the world, I can only send the gold I claim to have to accounts that actually trust my word.These three features are special, because they gave Ripple the momentum to move into the financial world in a big way. By allowing banks to create their own network of partners and allow them to transact assets on the blockchain, they introduced a new way to cut transaction costs.This is the secret sauce behind Ripple\u2019s success: by being able to create low cost transactions on the network, financial institutions were able to take advantage of the blockchain. And by using XRP to secure every transaction, Ripple gave a powerful incentive for these institutions to use XRP.Who Is Ripple\u2019s Competition?In the emerging blockchain industry, every value driver is creating a small industry. Monero and Zcash are leading the way for the privacy focused cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, NEM, Waves and a plethora of other blockhains are competing to be the top platform blockchain. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are competing to be the \u2018top\u2019 cryptocurrency overall. There are other markets forming as well.When you look at the market for Ripple and try to find their competitors, something odd jumps out. Despite being one of the oldest cryptocurrencies with the clearest use case, there are surprising lack of direct competitors for financial payments\u2026 at least financial payments for large corporate banks. Platforms easily have 20+ blockchains all competing for Ethereum\u2019s place, but Ripple only seems to be competing with the Stellar Network and few other organizations. For as mature as Ripple is in the ecosystem, you would expect more. So where are Ripple\u2019s competitors?It turns out that Ripple has very stiff competition\u2026 but you\u2019re not going to find them on CryptoMarketCap. Ripple\u2019s chief competition today is coming from the new class of cryptocurrencies called \u2018permissioned blockchains\u2019. As opposed to permission-less system, where anyone globally can join, permissioned blockchains require an invitation from an organization before you\u2019re allowed to join.Today, there are a handful of permissioned blockchains that are offering similar services that Ripple offers. These organizations include R3 Corda, Hyperledger, the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) and SWIFT(Ripple\u2019s chief rival, at least according to Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas). These businesses are creating products similar enough to Ripple\u2019s feature set and partnership network that these organizations constitute the financial payment network market.Why Ripple\u2019s Market Matters for XRPIf you accept that Ripple\u2019s competitors are permissioned blockchains, then it\u2019s useful to compare their features to understand how, say, SWIFT\u2019s blockchain payment network might be more useful than Ripple. One thing that jumps out immediately about every permissioned blockchain is that these networks don\u2019t have native assets, despite offering the same basic services that Ripple can offer.Here\u2019s a statement about SWIFT and considering native asset:One area SWIFT will not be considering is generating its own digital assets, or cryptocurrency, Grainger said. This is at odds with other cross-border payment services, notably Ripple, whose digital currency XRP is used to conduct payments over its distributed ledger network.Here\u2019s another analysis from Philipp Sandner, comparing Hyperledger, Corda and Ethereum:Even Ethereum through the EEA are creating permissioned blockchains (such as JP Morgan\u2019s Quorum) that do not require the need for native assets.If part of the market was split, and only half the market had native assets, this might be less odd. Diesel engines were still produced even after alternatives appeared on the market. But that fact that every major competitor has opted out of having a native asset, one that has allowed Ripple to control billions in value through XRP, signals a change in the market.What A Lack Of Native Assets MeanLet\u2019s think about the implications of this: strong competition has appeared in the market, as to be expected. But instead of creating a native asset to secure the network, these competitors have decided to use another method (Native Identity Management, in this case) that secures the network. These blockchains can offer similar features without the need for an XRP-like component.We can argue whether SWIFT, R3 Corda or Hyperledger really have a better set of features than Ripple, but that is beside the point. What these projects have shown by universally disregarding native assets is that that component of Ripple is no longer required to provide value. It\u2019s an obsolete component of Ripple\u2019s blockchain. In the same way that CD drives were slowly eliminated from new PC\u2019s after flash drives became more common, native assets for blockchain payment networks have a better alternative.Even if Ripple remains the best payment network for financial institutions, XRP remains a vestige of what Ripple Labs thought the market would become. But the market changed. Ripple\u2019s competitors will get better and strong, and financial institutions will start considering alternatives, with XRP sticking out as a sore thumb. Even if Ripple is the best, it is not because XRP offers some great advantage. If anything, it\u2019s an additional cost that none of their competitors will have.How Does This Affect XRP?Ripple still has a better partnership network, a more mature product line and strong leadership. But with competitors like IBM and R3 Corda entering the industry, it is only a matter of time before the competition will get stronger. In this race, XRP offers no competitive advantage and only represents an additional cost.At the end of the day, Ripple Labs is valuable because of their ability to provide great value to financial institution. But if an organization like SWIFT begins to win the market, Ripple Labs will be forced to respond. As Ripple already owns 55% of all XRP, it would be easy for their organization to either sell XRP as a market discount, or give it away entirely to new organizations who want to join their network. Increasing the price of XRP does not strengthen their position in winning the financial institutions market. When competition get intense, XRP will be one of the first factors to be eliminated, either through devaluing XRP significantly or giving it away entirely.This is ultimately the fate of XRP is: at best, a potential incentive to have new organizations join their business, at worst, an additional cost that is completely eliminated by giving away XRP (or close to it). In either case, the value of XRP is simply not supported by it\u2019s use case and will be unlikely to retain it\u2019s value.", "responses": 15, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ripple", "Xrp", "Ripple Currency Problem", "Permissioned Blockchains"]}, {"title": "XRP Is A Cryptocurrency Like The USS Zumwalt Is A Boat", "post_link": "https://code.likeagirl.io/xrp-is-a-cryptocurrency-like-the-uss-zumwalt-is-a-boat-3b25be5226b8?source=search_post", "author_name": "Tiffany Hayden", "author_link": "https://code.likeagirl.io/@haydentiff", "publish_date": "2017-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-13", "readtime": "4.26", "claps": 1256, "voters": 179, "content": "XRP Is A Cryptocurrency Like The USS Zumwalt Is A BoatTiffany HaydenFollowSep 14, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readImage stolen and altered from a presentation given by Stefan Thomas.XRP is a cryptographically secured digital asset with verifiable mathematical properties, similar to how we can reliably verify gold as a substance made of atoms with 79 protons. The XRP ledger\u2019s headers are like Bitcoin\u2019s block headers, both chain & incorporate transactions by hash.]The XRP Ledger is a cryptographic system. Accounts are identified by cryptographic identities. Transactions are authorized by cryptographic signatures matching these identities. Users can use cryptographically signed transactions to store and transfer almost anything (euros, gold, company shares, etc).Among other things, XRP is a cryptocurrency.By design, 100 billion XRP were created at Ripple\u2019s inception and, per the rules of the protocol, no more XRP can ever be created. Transactions are verified through Consensus, in which the entire network agrees on the same ledger. All of this happens independent of a central bank.Some people claim that XRP is \u201cpre-mined.\u201d That\u2019s inaccurate. Ripple Consensus does not involve proof-of-work (commonly referred to as \u201cmining\u201d) therefore XRP cannot be \u201cpremined.\u201dCryptocurrencies are created from code by coders. Crypotcurrencies are not divine gifts from God. Whoever conceives of the idea has full control over distribution. It\u2019s the philosophical underpinning of a new currency that determines whether the first 5% will be \u201cmined\u201d right away by its creator, while everyone else is forced to jump through hoops for the next 131 years, or whether the new currency will be generated and available immediately, or somewhere in between.It has also been said that \u201creal\u201d cryptocurrencies have their own blockchain. XRP meets this requirement. It exists natively on the XRP Ledger as a counterparty-free asset, similar to Bitcoin. XRP forms a core part of its blockchain as part of an incentive scheme. There is a transaction fee to use the XRP Ledger (~.0001XRP) and it must be paid in XRP. This transaction fee is not collected by anyone; the XRP are destroyed and cease to exist. Having a cost associated with ledger entries helps prevent ledger flooding attacks.https://ripple.com/xrp/XRP consistently handles 1,500 transactions per second, 24x7, and can scale to handle the same throughput as Visa. (50,000 transactions per second, as of July 15, 2017.)XRP transaction fee = 1/100th of a cent!UTILITYXRP comes with a utility that most people fail to recognize. Aside from providing an anti-spam mechanism, XRP comes equipped with GPS! The XRP Ledger has a pathfinding algorithm designed to route every transaction to the cheapest possible path. It\u2019s currency agnostic and even has a built-in foreign exchange component.To illustrate how important (and unsolved) pathfinding is for other projects, take a look at misguided comment by Greg Maxwell\u2019s (Blockstream CTO) about using Ripple\u2019s pathfinding method for the Lightning Network. (Hint: They can\u2019t.)https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/43kyev/greg_maxwell_accidentally_tells_the_truth/czjh0s5/XRP was designed as a settlement asset. It\u2019s quick, scalable, and cheap. While banks may use the Ripple network to swap their own private IOUs, only a digital asset without counter-party risk can provide instant settlement.So Much FUDXRP CANNOT BE FROZEN!The XRP Ledger has no administrative functions.Issuers of assets (IOUs) on the XRP Ledger can freeze their own assets, but XRP is not an issuance and nobody can freeze it. Additionally, Ripple can\u2019t freeze ANYTHING because Ripple doesn\u2019t issue assets.https://ripple.com/build/freeze/Ripple doesn\u2019t issue any assets on the ledger and there are no trust lines that end at Ripple.The XRP Ledger is a tool, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain. KYC tools cannot be built into a global ledger because nobody has that kind of jurisdiction. Any business that chooses to build on either of these protocols is responsible for complying with their jurisdiction\u2019s anti-money-laundering regulations and they would add compliance features ON TOP OF THE PROTOCOL.Permissioned? Hell no.Similar to the Blockchain, the XRP Ledger is an open-source protocol, with globally distributed validators. Anyone can access the protocol and everyone has an equal right to use it. It\u2019s a system with no central authority. Ripple does not control the network, collect fees, or limit access.Moreover, Ripple validators do not have the ability to censor transactions. The rules of the protocol determine whether or not a transaction is valid. Validators order transactions using deterministic rules. They do not have the power to make arbitrary decisions.With Bitcoin, however, miners have complete freedom to select which transactions to include in a block.Anybody who wants to participate in the network is free to do so. Running a Ripple validator is similar to running a Bitcoin full node. By running your own, you don\u2019t have to rely on somebody else. Ripple doesn\u2019t pay people to run validators, so rent-seekers will have to look elsewhere.Setting up a validator is easy. My validator synced to the network in 130 seconds and proposed in 401 ledgers before I finished my beer.Cheers!", "responses": 9, "tags": ["Xrp", "Bitcoin", "Blockchain", "Codelikeagirl", "Tech Talk"]}, {"title": "Create a Material Design ripple effect without JS", "post_link": "https://codeburst.io/create-a-material-design-ripple-effect-without-js-9d3cbee25b3e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vaibhav Khulbe", "author_link": "https://codeburst.io/@vaibhavkhulbe", "publish_date": "2018-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-19", "readtime": "3.87", "claps": 646, "voters": 158, "content": "Create a Material Design ripple effect without JSGoodbye JavaScript \ud83d\udc4bVaibhav KhulbeFollowJun 15, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readGIF credits: GiphyOkay, so this one will be real quick to implement.

I used to think \u201cWhy do we even need such a language which had lots of declarations, loops, functions and what not while making just the front-end of a website?\u201d . Yeah, I was so wrong and wrong about this. Why not just eliminate the need of JS for a moment and focus more on our beautiful CSS?What will I make? \ud83e\udd14This:Not this:Huh. Wow.

This is the only point, no JS only CSS, and uh, of course HTML\u2026What is a Material Design\u2754Honestly, this design theme is brought to you by Google years back at their Google I/O 2014 event. Now you\u2019re using this theme on your Android smartphones, some websites and yes, all other \u2018Googly\u2019 things from sometime. It\u2019s like some flat elements on top of a website or app, but it\u2019s not limited to that.What exactly \u2018Material\u2019 means?Well, if we were to believe Envato,Google\u2019s Material design considers material to be a homogeneous digital \u201cfabric\u201d created with pixels. Users can tap, swipe, or pinch this material fabric and it will move according to user interaction.You can learn more about the same in Daniel Hollick\u2019s blog post or refer to Google Design publication.What will I need? \ud83d\udee0\ufe0fH\u0338a\u0338m\u0338m\u0338e\u0338r\u0338 \u0338a\u0338n\u0338d\u0338 \u0338w\u0338r\u0338e\u0338n\u0338c\u0338h\u0338Your already wonderful HTML and CSS skills.A text editor (I\u2019ll be using Atom just because for my last tutorial on Flutter I used VS Code\u2026)Shall we\u2026ripple?You don\u2019t really need to blow your fingers like that\u2026 GIF credits: GiphyLet\u2019s do what we had done before. Create a folder, add two files namely index.html and style.css. Start with HTML. I hope you\u2019re already familiar with Atom\u2019s shortcuts. I think this one is really handy:Just start typing \u2018html\u2019 and hit enter when you see the autocomplete. Smooth!Now we have the most basic structure of a HTML file you can think of. A head, a title, a meta and the body tag. First, we gonna link our CSS file in this. That means, using <link rel=\u201dstylesheet\u201d href=\u201dstyle.css\u201d> inside our <head>. Give it a suitable <title> like Material Ripple Effect.We\u2019ll now add a class, say container in the <body> . Just like this:Another cool feature of Atom :\u2019) Type \u2018div.class\u2019, hit tab and there you have it.Inside this container class, we\u2019ll add a button element. Don\u2019t forget to add a class like class=\u201dbtn ripple\u201d . Both the btn and ripple will be used individually in our styling.At last, this will be our final HTML code:Let\u2019s hover to styling. All the materialistic magic will happen here. I\u2019ll only write what all you need to make the button materialistic on click. So, your style.css file should have the following:Container: display property set to flex to make it of same length regardless of the content.Ripple: transform property set to translate3d to define a 3D translation.Ripple-after: this is where the ripple effect ends. We can show something like a text but it doesn\u2019t make sense here. Therefore the content has been set to \"\".background-image's value has been set to the radial-gradient function which takes in a circle as its shape, #fff or white as the start-color and last-color as transparent 10.01%.transition is used along with transform with its corresponding timing and opacity.If that felt too overwhelming for you in first go, try to implement the same again and use the documentation links to dive deeper in those elements. Obviously, there is some more code other than this. Take a look at our final style.css file:That\u2019s it! No JS! Run the .html in your favorite web browser and see for yourself. You\u2019ll have a container and a button with Material ripple effect!Where to next? \ud83e\udd14You can experiment more with the .container, .ripple, .ripple:after and .ripple:active:after in your style sheet. Or if you want to be more like a ninja \ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\udc64, you can tell me how to start the ripple from different places on the button. Like, if I click on lower left side of the button, the ripple should originate from there.The source code for this project is hosted on GitHub (and not GitLab \ud83d\ude09):Kvaibhav01/Ripple-without-JSRipple-without-JS - Create Material Design ripple effect in your HTML without using a single line of JavaScript code.github.comYou can now see LIVE DEMO here, thanks to GitHub Pages.Liked this story?

Many cryptocurrency experts believe it will take another ten years before this form of currency goes mainstream.However, cryptocurrencies are already making their way quickly into society and although skeptcism is still a barrier to adoption, the road to trust and real-world utility is getting shorter as many cryptocurrency projects prove to the world their real-world use cases, such as Ripple\u2019s XRP for inter-banking transfers and remittances. XRP is of great benefit to those who send money back home to their families in developing countries by drastically reducing the cost of remittances.Last month, Ripple announced a partnership with MoneyGram which serve millions of people who send money to their families. In their press release, they claimed they would reduce the fees for remittances from circa $30 to fractions of a penny.Non-governmental organisations are catching on as well. They have begun to see the benefits of accepting crypto donations and some of the most reputable in existence have gradually gone from scepticism and wariness to trust and confidence.Only 1% of NGOs currently accept cryptoStill, only 1% of organisations currently accept cryptocurrency as donations, according to a 27-page 2018 Global NGO Technology Report.\u201cWhile 72% of the 5,352 NGOs surveyed accept website donations, only 1% accept (cryptocurrencies),\u201d the report reads. \u201cEarly adopters of cryptocurrencies will gain an advantage in a fundraising landscape that is increasingly competing for new donors.\u201dThe report anticipates, however, that although, \u201ccredit cards, PayPal, and direct debit are the most accepted forms of payment \u2026 digital wallets and cryptocurrency, are likely to become more widely accepted in the coming years.\u201dA rise in cryptocurrency prices may also spark donations. That was the case in late December 2017, when Bitcoin peaked. At that time, the Pineapple Fund, a philanthropic project created by an anonymousindividual, donated 5,104 Bitcoin to 60 NGOs.Ahead of the gameLate last year, Blake Rizzo, head of charity affairs for Tour de Crypto, said NGOs that accept cryptocurrencies are ahead of the game. He mentioned Houston Area Women\u2019s Centre (HAWC), for example, who accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero.\u201cThey (NGOs) are immediately able to tap into a previously-formed, global social media network of crypto enthusiasts that are searching for ways to do good and promote mass adoption through good intentions,\u201d Rizzo added.Rizzo agrees that as the cryptocurrency industry further matures, more donations will pour into NGOs, who have to prepare for this in order to stay ahead of the fundraising game.Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong told Hacker Noon before becoming involved in crypto, he had \u201cspent about a decade of my careerworking on social problems like global poverty, and my first reaction wasskepticism.\u201dOn the riseIn November 2018, Forbes wrote that \u201ccharities accepting crypto donations is on the rise. UNICEF began accepting crypto in March 2018.\u201dThe following is a list of some of the notable organisations that according to Bitcoin Wiki accept cryptocurrency donations, mostly in Bitcoin.The Charities Aid Foundation wrote a 22-page report praising blockchain as a revolutionary way to make NGOs more transparent and bring trust back to philanthropic organisations.In the paper, the CAF said they had previously explored \u201cthe potential opportunities and risks for charities and donors associated with the rise of cryptocurrencies.\u201dHowever, CAF say the \u201cmost interesting thing about the current crop of cryptocurrencies is not actually the currencies themselves, but rather the mechanism that underpins them: blockchain.\u201dThe organisation spoke of how blockchain and smart contracts could \u201coffer a form of radical transparency that can overcome public scepticism and lack of trust.\u201dTaking it one step furtherCurrently, many organisations have implemented blockchain, but only one on record has taken it a step further by mining cryptocurrency, implementing blockchain and accepting donations in crypto.Ubuntu Pathways recently announced its association with Electroneum and their cryptocurrency ETN, which they mine for block rewards they use to further their cause in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, where for over 20 years they have delivered long-term assistance to thousands of children and their families.The organisation, which channels over 80% of the donations it receives to their work on the ground, have received recognition from many international personalities, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu (1984 Nobel Peace Prize) and former US President Bill Clinton.\u201cWe were initially very skeptical about cryptocurrencies,\u201d says Beth Honig, UK Director for Ubuntu Pathway. \u201cThere are so many scams out there, and we personally heard of so many bad actors out there that we were hesitant to work with crypto.\u201dHonig also says that immediately after announcing Ubuntu\u2019s association with Electroneum, the organisation have received overwhelming support from the public.\u201cThe response has been amazing across all media platforms. Visits to our website of people interested in donating have doubled as has engagement across all our social media platforms,\u201d she said. \u201cIn less than 24 hours, we\u2019ve had people pledging to make donations in crypto.\u201dWhile cryptocurrency is making its way into many sectors of society, the likes of Electroneum and Ubuntu Pathways, as well as XRP and MoneyGram, to mention only a couple, are leading the way in helping people in developing countries live more.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum", "Likecoin"]}, {"title": "Meet The Crypto Billionaires Getting Rich From Ripple\u2019s XRP", "post_link": "https://medium.com/forbes/meet-the-crypto-billionaires-getting-rich-from-ripples-xrp-b5fce50c84c1?source=search_post", "author_name": "Forbes", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@forbes", "publish_date": "2018-01-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-14", "readtime": "3.02", "claps": 837, "voters": 127, "content": "Psst... there\u2019s an audio version of this story.

The path to QRC status will need to include demonstrable growth within the following areas:Liquidity and market makersInstitutional derivatives that would allow banks to hedge foreign exchange exposure on their balance sheetOn-boarding financial institutions onto xCurrent + xRapid in both exotic and non-exotic corridorsShort Term XRP Trading AnalysisThe crypto space is in a speculative \u201cfrothy\u201d frenzy currently. Under these circumstances, fundamental analysis becomes less important in the short term since speculators will trade on emotion and greed compared to fundamentals. Pugilist made an XRP trading recommendation to our internal investor network right after we released our report last month. We stated that despite XRP\u2019s long term hurdles, their price action and technical analysis charts were setting up nicely for a price spike. At that time, XRP was trading between $0.25 \u2014 $0.30. We did not forecast a specific price target given we don\u2019t own a crystal ball, but we did see an interesting dichotomy forming.DichotomyPugilist Ventures maintains its speculative fundamental evaluation AND positive short term trading view for XRP; simultaneously. Furthermore, if XRP maintains its exponential growth during 2018, then its long term fundamentals may change for the positive according to the Theory of Reflexivity a la George Soros.Reflexivity TheoryBy simple definition, Reflexivity is a three part process whereby an asset\u2019s price increase drives investor expectations higher which positively changes the asset\u2019s fundamentals, resulting in further price appreciation. Rinse and repeat.Reflexivity for XRPReflexive price appreciation and expectations may substantially increase demand and mainstream adoption for XRP. For example, imagine if XRP supersedes bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) market cap in 2018. This speculative demand spike would dramatically increase liquidity and potential derivatives coverage, which would help Ripple on-board more banks (fewer objections to adoption) onto xCurrent + xRapid, thus improving XRP\u2019s fundamentals, i.e. the path to QRC status.SummaryXRP is being driven primarily by speculation in our opinion. However, this speculation may actually increase the long term probability of success for XRP by increasing market liquidity, derivatives coverage, and mainstream adoption as medium of exchange and store of value; while planting the seeds of a future QRC debate. All of which provide fuel to Ripple\u2019s most important business goal of growing financial institutions using both xCurrent and xRapid for global payments. Only time shall tell if this path bears fruit for Ripple and XRP.\u2014 \u2014 Disclaimer: Neither the author of this article, nor Pugilist Ventures, provide investment, financial, or legal advice.

The insinuation being: \u201cif this piggy doubles after listing, you could pocket a cool $100mm in the trade.\u201dLess standard by public equities standards, but this dynamic isn\u2019t unique in crypto.Earlier this week, Autonomous Research published a report that claimed the average listing fee charged by top crypto exchanges stretched up to $3mm, 10x what you\u2019d expect in the public markets.The problem is crypto companies tend to want things both ways.Act like a securities offerer when it\u2019s convenient from a capital formation perspective or when you\u2019re doling out \u201cfounders\u2019 rewards\u201d. Pretend you\u2019re actually selling a currency or commodity when it becomes markedly less convenient from an investor disclosures standpoint.There\u2019s a reason for public equities listing fees, by the way. They usually carry with them the expectation that listees will be regulated and subject to some level of standardized reporting. They only get to list in the first place if they\u2019ve abided by widely accepted rules.In that case, I suppose we should welcome this week\u2019s news!I look forward to working with Ripple on standardizing disclosures around how they (and other token teams) manage their treasuries.I\u2019m sure board members like Gene Sperling (former Economic Advisor to Presidents Clinton and Obama) and Ben Lawsky (creator of the infamous NYS BitLicense) would push fervently for better disclosures around XRP\u2019s treasury management and distribution.Especially given Lawsky\u2019s mandate at the company:Here\u2019s a starting point for disclosures:+ How is Ripple paying its strategic partners? What are the terms with respect to discounts, lock-ups, etc? How do the rebate programs work for companies testing XRP? Are they like Coinbase offers\u2026free money \u201cloans\u201d?+ Why did the company implement a programmatic selling program where they aimed to sell 25 bps of global XRP volume per quarter only to ratchet that back in Q4? Did the $91.5mm in XRP sales look like it might set off alarms, so they stopped short of selling $300mm?+ Why does the company write about XRP price appreciation as if it\u2019s a milestone? Why do they do little to tamp down speculation around XRP enterprise adoption? No, why do they actively insinuate big news is coming by writing things like \u201cXRP markets began to connect the dots once again?\u201d+ What are Ripple\u2019s insider trading policies with respect to XRP? Are any employees or advisors paid in XRP? If so, what are the terms?It might seem annoying to pester the company like this, and indeed it would be more convenient to approach their marketing team \u2014 who is doubling as investor relations, but we can\u2019t call it that \u2014 to answer these questions in private.But the company is managing a \u201cbridge currency\u201d that they package to retail investors, who buy on the assumption that they are front-running big bank purchasers.That makes this a public conversation. How about an analyst call, Brad?****Note: I hope they will sit down with a real journalist soon and answer macro questions about their policies. A good interviewer wouldn\u2019t let them off the hook because \u201cconfidentiality agreements.\u201d NDAs prevent a company from discussing specific deals. They do not preclude you from discussing general distribution strategy. That cop out should be called out.*Speaking of disclosures, I wanted to write more about an A+ post from Meltem Demirors re investor disclosures in crypto, but I got carried away with the XRP stuff.

Several Iranian government officials have publicly called for Telegram to be banned in the country, believing the platform shouldn\u2019t be the country\u2019s dominant social app. Their main concern is linked to national security, since the assumption is that the app played an undeniable role in igniting the December 2017 protests across the country. In response, Iran\u2019s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani declared his opposition to such a ban, noting that blocking access to messaging platforms was not a solution.

China\u2019s crypto ban in late 2017 resulted in the boom of underground traders known as \u201cbitcoin mules\u201d. These traders buys cryptocurrencies in other markets (such as Thailand or Japan) and sells them at a premium to investors in China, who cannot otherwise get them. Aside from the geographical arbitrage, the traders also exploit lesser known exchanges by buying cryptocurrencies cheaply on lesser-known exchanges and selling them for a profit on more liquid and widely used platforms. With the downturn in recent crypto markets combined with the flood of traders in the space, the premium for crypto has fallen from 30\u201340% at its height to around 7% or so.

The interesting thing about Ripple technology is its currency independence. Basically, a transaction in the Ripple network can be processed in any currency imaginable. In this way, Ripple wants to solve a fundamental problem in the international monetary system. This is because complicated currency exchanges lead to high fees, especially for transactions across national borders, and banks must remain constantly liquid and have so-called Nostro accounts in the receiving countries. (I get commissions for purchases made through links in this post.)The technology behind RippleRipple plays a special role in the world of blockchain technologies. While other projects follow a path that rejects the classical banking system, Ripple tries to cooperate with them. To this end, RippleLabs, the organization behind Ripple, has launched several products, xRapid, xCurrent and xVia, which can be used by banks to process their global transactions. The XRP token, which is used to process the transactions, serves as the bridge currency in the Ripple network.In plain text, this means that an input currency is exchanged in XRP and transmitted over the network prior to a transaction. Once it reaches the recipient, it is exchanged back into the output currency. This means that transactions in two different currencies are also possible. XRP is currently the only coin used in RippleNet. Nevertheless, it would theoretically be possible for banks to create their own coins and use them in the network.So-called gateways operate in the network and take on the role of intermediaries. These have the function of an intermediate station that receives an incoming payment and forwards it accordingly. A transaction can also run over several gateways. This is even the rule, especially in the case of a currency change. As soon as a transaction in the ripple network runs across several gateways, the borrower\u2019s notes (IOUs \u2014 \u201cI owe you\u201d) are created that must be settled by the subsequent party. This allows transactions to be quickly routed through the network without having to wait for the IOUs to settle.The Function of the XRP TokenAs already mentioned, the XRP tokens are used for currency balancing and payment of transaction fees. Each transaction is subject to a fee of 0.00001 XRP, which is then destroyed and no longer available. This is to avoid spam attempts in the highly frequented RippleNet. In this context, the transaction fee is often referred to as 10 drops. A drop is the smallest unit in relation to the XRP token. It is important to know that XRP is not mined, but is already fully distributed. A total of 100 billion XRP were issued, of which 63 billion are owned by RippleLabs. The XRPs held serve to finance the project and network.The XRP token is independent of the organization behind Ripple and will continue to exist even if RippleLabs closes. As with a traditional SWIFT transfer, a transaction with XRP involves some price risk and is affected by price fluctuations. However, since an average transaction in RippleNet is completed after approximately 5 seconds, the risk of a strong fluctuation is significantly lower than with a SWIFT transfer that takes several days. Investors and users can save their XRP in the official online wallet, but also unofficial desktop wallets.The Functionality of the ProtocolMost modern payment systems are based on trust in the state or in financial institutions such as banks. This applies in particular to digital accounts of government currencies, since the money is not possessed here in principle and an institution watches over the amount and disposes of it. Ripple is an attempt to transfer this mechanism of trust to digital currency by storing all transactions and liabilities between users and institutions in a public register.Behind this system are so-called IOUs. The abbreviation stands for the English phrase \u201cI owe (yo)u\u201d and is a kind of promissory note. In the Ripple Register, the user\u2019s promissory notes are stored, i.e. which person owes how much of which currency to another individual and vice versa. In addition to the debt system, the protocol also enables an extensive foreign exchange market in a similar way, which is constantly evolving.Advantages and Disadvantages of RippleAdvantages of the Ripple Protocol:Almost forgery-proofFast transactions within secondsOpen standardCan act in its final stage as a universal translator of any currencyEnables quick lending and borrowing of money amountsLoans by IOU (a type of promissory note)Simple connection of payment networksMany new possibilities due to maximum compatibilityDisadvantages of the Ripple protocol:Ripple not only had positive developments to report but the company behind the protocol, in particular, was often criticized for various business practices. Among others, it is stated that although the company promised to pass on a large proportion of the XRP to the users of the network, so far only small amounts have been transferred. In addition, Ripple Labs has retained nearly half of all existing XRP to benefit from value creation.Distribution of RippleRippleLabs\u2019 largest customers include the major Spanish bank Santander, American Express, UniCredit and Western Union. Some financial services providers also use technology for their internal transactions. All banks use Ripple to process their global transactions, saving up to 70% of the usual transaction and management fees. Most companies and banks use the xCurrent and xRapid products developed by RippleLabs, which directly address the complex needs of financial institutions.If you like what you read be sure to \u2665 it below \u2014 as a writer it means the world.

Two days prior to that, Laura Shin tweeted a link to an episode of her podcast (Unchained) where she was joined by Ryan and Matt Leising:This was my first experience observing the XRP Army on the attack. To get a better sense of what that entails, I would encourage you to scroll through the replies to Laura\u2019s tweet (there are hundreds!). I have included a few of those replies below:On May 10th, 2018, Ryan shared some thoughts re: XRP/Ripple:Ripple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, replied (almost immediately) with this tweet:Ryan\u2019s Twitter account was hacked at some point later that day. Given the timing, I can totally understand why he would suspect that XRP was behind this attack:Intrigued, I decided to acclimate myself with the XRP Army:Later in the thread I highlighted 100+ accounts which contain \u201cXRP\u201d or \u201cRipple\u201d in their usernames:XRP-supporting accounts chimed in with questions about the graph/data and to state they know some/most of the accounts:I would soon learn that two core members of the XRP Army/community are @haydentiff and @XRPTrump. Despite my best efforts, members of the XRP Army have always twisted my words.Fortunately, it seemed that @XRPTrump \u2014 an anonymous account which is highly knowledgeable re: XRP/Ripple \u2014was (finally) interpreting my words based on what had actually been stated:I was encouraged by the change in their tone (see below tweet) and opted to continue the discussion via Twitter DM:The Calm Before The StormLater that same day, @XRPTrump suggested that I \u201c[come] forward with a list of people that [I am] confident [are] bots and share with Tiffany [@haydentiff] and [him] privately\u201d (side note: between May 11th and Jul 14th, 2018, I traded quite a few DMs with @XRPTrump; discussion was always civil):That exchange took place while my Twitter account was getting bombarded by the XRP Army (for tweeting this graph and data earlier that day). Hence, I was in no rush to identify/share accounts with @XRPTrump (even privately) which I was confident were fake/bot accounts, as I wanted to halt the attack (rather than prolong it).Instead, I would later share a handful accounts with @XRPTrump, which, to me, appeared suspicious. I never stated that I was confident they were bots, although the XRP Army would later twist my words (they love to gaslight!).Two of those accounts \u2014 namely, @Ripple_Expert (username has since been changed to @California_luve) and @xrptips (58.6K followers) \u2014 were presented to @XRPTrump on May 15th, 2018:@Ripple_Expert had a substantial following (23.2K followers) and only followed 171 accounts. One of those accounts happened to be @XRPTrump:@Ripple_Expert has since changed their username to @California_luve; screenshot from May 15th, 2018; at that time, @XRPTrump was one of 171 accounts being followed by @Ripple_ExpertWhen asked, @XRPTrump stated they were not familiar with @Ripple_Expert, yet they engaged with the account (@California_luve below) on Jan 26th, 2018:Above @XRPTrump likes a tweet from @California_luveAlthough @XRPTrump wasn\u2019t quite to the point where they were ready to acknowledge the presence of fake/bot accounts, they certainly appeared to be warming up to the idea:In fact, on July 13th, 2018, @XRPTrump even shared two accounts which they referred to as being \u201cvery dodgy\u201d:I didn\u2019t actively pursue proving to @XRPTrump (or others from the XRP Army/community) that there are large numbers of fake/bot accounts which support XRP/Ripple, because, frankly, it requires lots of work.About 6 weeks ago, however, something happened that compelled me to finally take on this task.Enter @JoelKatzOn Jul 14th, 2018 (the day after @XRPTrump shared what he referred to as two \u201cvery dodgy\u201d accounts with me), I resurfaced some older tweets, retweeting the previously mentioned graph and data tweets.Immediately, @haydentiff \u2014 who was following my account at the time \u2014 replied to the (two-month) old thread with the following:Note the surge of (fake) followers above @haydentiff\u2019s reply/retweetWithin minutes, my Twitter account was being hit with fake followers. Given the timing, I (naturally) suspected the XRP Army was behind it. Shortly thereafter, I went ahead and shared what was happening with a friend, Mike Dudas, who I knew similarly has had his fair share of dealings with the XRP Army.When I next grabbed my phone, I noticed there were a ton of Twitter notifications. After seeing this tweet from Mike, it all made sense (side note: thanks for throwing me under the bus, Dudas!):Tweet from @mdudas on July 14th, 2018Ripple\u2019s CTO, @JoelKatz, who is very active on Twitter, joined the discussion this go-around. On the one hand, David expressed cynicism re: XRP/Ripple fake/bot Twitter accounts (\u201cseems like a crazy conspiracy theory to me\u201d); on the other hand, he didn\u2019t rule out the possibility (\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that some number of fake/bot accounts exist\u201d):David was kind enough to agree to a silly little bet I proposed: if I can prove that XRP/Ripple fake/bot accounts exist, then he has to change his profile image to a robot (if I can\u2019t, then I have to change mine to the XRP logo)Thanks to @XRPTrump for the suggestion (re: @GiantGox)!Profile of @GiantGox (August 26th, 2018)Dissecting @GiantGoxBefore we jump into the network graph, let me explain what we\u2019ll be reviewing.When the data was collected (July 21st, 2018), @GiantGox was following ~19K accounts and had ~36K followers.

Similar to as was mentioned earlier re: @emy_wng earlier \u2014 I am simply letting the data speak here.Allegations of market manipulation coupled with the account losing more than 2 million \u201csuspicious\u201d accounts during the Twitter Purge, one would think that Twitter would conduct a thorough audit on the account.The fact that it appears Twitter has not done so doesn\u2019t surprise me one bit.In fact, there have been numerous occasions where I have reported networks of fake/bot accounts spreading political propaganda on Twitter, where I was ignored (in some cases for months) by Twitter until the press would cover said networks:To be fair, the @6BillionPeople account follows 4.7M accounts, hence it shouldn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise that it is so central in relation to the accounts connected to @GiantGox (most of which are fake/bot accounts). It is, however, noteworthy.At the very least, what is clear is this: Twitter has a long ways to go until their platform is no longer propped up by misleading/inflated follower/following countsModularity Class = 3There are 3,260 nodes/accounts (2,755 @GiantGox followers) in this mod class/community:Notable accounts viewable above include: @tanjaplayner, @75fM1, @ABOALLAIL2, @ALGOAHRH1, @nalmtery, @O8z__, @RetrieverPlanet, @alywh, @dla3noof, @__sI1, @u_m305, @a4_u8, @kse_2030, @Dorsetghost, @soulskiller94, @77_ss7, @lessonlisa, @n__nony, @Ayed_Honey, @w_z_e, @VIP_G5, @ndr_7rb, @itslovesnotes, @Itsworldpost, @rffoi4, @retj_m, @SA2__0Here are the accounts from mod class = 3 which share the most connections with accounts connected to @GiantGox (descending, starting with most connections shared):Where modularity class = 3 and limited to accounts which are followers of @GiantGox.

It brought the Ripple Effect as a form of touch feedback, doing away with fully opaque selectors, but omitted an easy way to customize both the ripple and background color via xml attributes. I built the CustomRippleView library to create a seamless ripple customization starting with the TextView.The ripple is clever design because it buys time for an event to occur. The user\u2019s attention shifts to the button to gauge if the event is happening, and not to the operation itself. The effect produces perceived performance of a system. Also, it mimics nature; anyone seeing such a ripple would expect the ripple to dissipate naturally. It\u2019s a powerful concept, unfortunately relegated to trivial, but that is false. The best companies care about these details, not because they have the resources, but because beauty, aesthetics, form and function all matter in the end.See the Quick Implementation section directly below to quickly add the CustomRippleView to your app, and/or read on for more on how it is built.Quick ImplementationDeclare the library in gradle and call the desired files.build.gradle (app module)compile 'com.ebay.customrippleview:customrippleview:1.1'Define the rippleColor and backgroundColor attributes. If you don\u2019t specify the attributes below the view will use the default value of gray.recycler_headercell.xmlRetroRecycler Sample App (API level > 21, left and API level < 21, right)How Custom Ripple View Is MadeI built a library in order to implement custom ripples by adjusting 2 attributes in the XML layout. To implement the custom ripple effect for the type of view desired, create a custom view and extend the desired view type. I implemented this with the RippleTextView to start. There\u2019s a myriad of views the ripple effect would be useful for. Code contributions to the GitHub project are welcome!Alternative SolutionsPrior to this library one could implement a default gray ripple using a background or foreground xml attribute, create numerous drawable xmls for customization, or define a style to a view.Background or Foreground XMLThe downside here is the inability to customize the background or ripple.android:background=\"?attr/selectableItemBackground\"android:foreground=\"?attr/selectableItemBackground\"orandroid:background=\"?attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless\"android:foreground=\"?attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless\"and android:clickable=\"true\"DrawablesBy building drawables you have the customization, but it takes more time and creates more resources than needed.API Level 21API Pre 21Selector in normal stateSelector in pressed stateStyleSetting a view\u2019s style is almost as quick as using this library and achieves the custom ripple effect.Set the ripple effect with the background attribute. I just discovered the foreground attribute and am updating this post. You should also be able to set the effect with the foreground attribute, but I have not implemented this yet to ensure it will work.Define the custom ripple color with the colorControlHighlight attribute. For some reason, this attribute needs to be called from a separate style in order to work.Behind The Scenes: Custom Ripple ViewCreating a Custom View \u2014 Step 1 of 4Create a Custom View extending the type of View you\u2019d like to implement the Ripple Effect on.

What Is Ripple?As per ripple.com :Ripple connects banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges and corporate via RippleNet to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally.Ripple is quite different from other cryptocurrencies as it doesn\u2019t have its own public blockchain. Internally, the XRP Ledger network runs on an internal blockchain which they call an \u201cEnterprise blockchain\u201d ledger, it doesn\u2019t use proof-of-work and little else is known about it.Ripple functions like RTGS and is a digital currency exchange developed by Ripple company . Ripple was released officially in 2012 with an intent to enable instant & secure financial transactions of any size with no chargeback. It is currently a world third largest digital currency.Is Ripple More Like a Bitcoin:Ripple does share some technical similarities with bitcoin but it is quite different from it. Like many digital currencies it uses cryptography to secure transactions, but it doesn\u2019t actually have a public blockchain like Bitcoin or Litecoin. And it came into existence to mainly transform the payment transfer system, for the purpose of sending instant and secure transactions across network participants and that what is more known for.Ripple is more like payment system, remittance network, and currency exchange & now Ripple has built its network that includes its own cryptocurrency Ripple, or XRP.RTXP:Ripple Transaction Protocol or simply we can call Ripple Payment Protocol uses distributed open source Internet Protocol, consensus ledger & native crypto called XRP(Ripples). Ripples circles around shared database or public ledger which uses a consensus mechanism to allow payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.The goal of the ripple system, according to its official web portal, is to enable people to break free of the \u201cwalled gardens\u201d of financial networks \u2014 ie, credit cards, banks, PayPal and other institutions that restrict access with fees, charges for currency exchanges and processing delays.How Ripple Works ?sourceLet\u2019s understand its working mechanism through simple example. Here Sender will send $=500 To the Receiver, Both parties involved in transaction lives in a different city.Where,Sender =Jim, Receiver = Rony , Senders Side Agent = Krish, Receiver Side Agent= Tim.Jim gives Krish the money to send to Rony with a transaction password that Rony is required to answer correctly to receive the amount. Krish alerts Rony\u2019s agent, Tim about the transaction details- of amount of funds to be transferred to Rony and the required password to be validated at Rony\u2019s side by him. Here rony has to respond with the right password, then only Tim will release the fund from his side . Once Rony does so he gets the required amount. But here Krish owes $500 to Tim . Tim can record a journal of Krish\u2019s Debt or IOUs which Krish would pay on the agreed date or can make immediate counter transactions to balance out the debt he owe to Tim.This explanation would have given you some basic idea of how ripple transaction systems work. The key here is that there is a trust based mechanism working here between sender, receiver, and the local agents involved as security agentsWhat the original Ripple project sought to accomplish is effectively the democratization of this idea: everyone can be their own bank, issuing, accepting and acting as a conduit for loans all at the same time.Ripples Use Case :Let\u2019s Discuss its Use Case Sector Wise :Image Source1.

Brian Rankin, technology operations and client services specialist in blockchain and distributed ledgers and a former VP of Clients Services at Ripple (XRP), led the original Ripple\u2019s 21-person international team that includes project management, business architecture, integration engineering, and customer success. He built Ripple\u2019s professional services team from the ground up, leading enterprise delivery of blockchain solutions to Tier-1/2/3 multinational banks across NAM, EMEA, and APAC.Rankin was also a Head of the Global Payments Steering Group (GPSG), a consortium composed of Tier-1 Multinational banks focused on redefining an international cross-border payments network as an alternative to the SWIFT payments network. The group, under his leadership, leveraged blockchain technologies to reduce correspondent banking relationships and allow near-real-time cryptographically validated settlements.As the VP in Ripple, Rankin established delivery best practices and built a customer-oriented PMO, created SOW and MSA templates based on blockchain LOE, and best practices for technical, legal, compliance, infosec, and functional standard requirements in the financial services sector.

While the price has recently dropped after a sudden spike, it hasn\u2019t caused anywhere near as much drama as the 234 obituaries hiding under Bitcoin\u2019s belt.Ripple\u2019s token, XRP, which had been trading at around $0.006 this time last year, now hovers at around $2.00.\u201cThere is limited upside in Ripple,\u201d argued Alexander Kravets, a guy who has not known about cryptocurrency for a full year yet.Why Is Ripple Rising?Reason #1: Decentralization. Rather than naively view centralization/decentralization as binary, Ripple recognizes that decentralization can take many forms and likely resembles more of a spectrum than a dichotomy. \u201cThe view that something is either decentralized or centralized is harmful and draws attention away from what we should actually care about \u2014 to what extent particular systems have particular beneficial characteristics,\u201d said David Schwartz, Chief Cryptographer at Ripple. Schwartz said making massive progress on decentralization in 2018 is his number one priority. Accordingly, Ripple recently released their Decentralization Strategy Update.Reason #2: There was a change in how prices are calculated. The crypto exchange Coinmarketcap.com made a change this week, excluding many Korean exchanges from its price calculations. Previously, CMC did not reflect what U.S. holders could actually sell for, and that caused a lot of confusion. The new price is more accurate and meaningful.Reason #3: XRP\u2019s appeal to businesses is strengthening. After announcing that three of the top five money transfer companies worldwide will be implementing Ripple\u2019s XRP token in their payment flow systems this year, Ripple and MoneyGram announced they had partnered.\u201cMoneyGram is the latest example of Ripple\u2019s masterful cadence of announcements of deals with large companies,\u201d said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital.Oliver Isaacs, cryptocurrency investor and influencer, proclaimed that Ripple is \u201cgaining momentum.\u201d He spoke to the digital currency\u2019s growing visibility, stating:\u201cEvery cryptocurrency investor and hedge fund I have spoken to have asked me about Ripple\u2019s potential in the market.\u201d.Tiffany Hayden", "responses": 8, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ripple", "Xrp", "Media", "Banking"]}, {"title": "Where Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, And Other Cryptocurrencies Be Twenty Years From Now?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/forbes/where-will-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-and-other-cryptocurrencies-be-twenty-years-from-now-27763f5f0cbf?source=search_post", "author_name": "Forbes", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@forbes", "publish_date": "2018-02-05", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-14", "readtime": "2.36", "claps": 623, "voters": 93, "content": "Where Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, And Other Cryptocurrencies Be Twenty Years From Now?ForbesFollowFeb 5, 2018 \u00b7 3 min read(Photo Illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images)By Panos MourdoukoutasBitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies have been on a roller coaster lately.

We\u2019ll use Animated API, which is a part of React Native.An IconToggle component is included in open source react-native-material-ui library. I\u2019m using this library for booking system by Reservio.The idea \u2026We\u2019ll make three Views. One of them as a container for IconToggle component. Another one as a container for ripple effect and last one as a container for Icon. We\u2019ll wrap them in React Native\u2019s TouchableWithoutFeedback component that fires onPressIn and onPressOut events.Why do we need both of these events? Because there are two different animations. A scale animation and an opacity animation. They may run together, of course. So, is the onPressIn event enough? No. Because there could be a situation when user presses the button for a longer time. Then we need scale animation to run first and wait for onPressOut event that runs opacity animation. It\u2019s exactly how the icon button\u2019s ripple effect works. I simulated that with red star icon in the last example above.Let\u2019s code \u2026First of all, we\u2019ll create blank page for this example. Then we\u2019ll create IconToggle component and the ripple effect animation. Finally, we\u2019ll make some correlation.Now, we have a view with Toolbar which is known from Material Design by Google. The Toolbar is not a goal of this tutorial, so we took it from react-native-material-ui library. Then, we put the IconToggle components and implement it in the following Gist.Again, we took Icon component from react-native-material-ui. So, we have something like this. And now, the animation.Let\u2019s animate \u2026On lines 14 and 15 we created two Animated.Values. One of them for scale animation and second for opacity animation. We pass them to Animated.View via its props. The scale animation begins inside of onPressedIn function, that is fired after user presses icon. It starts from 0.01 (not zero) because there is an issue in React Native. Later, when user releases the button, the opacity animation will start. It doesn\u2019t matter if the scale animation is still running or not. After the opacity animation is done, we need Animated.Values to be set to init values (line 34). That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole ripple effect.In this code, we just added a colour for icon and ripple effect. Look at line 12 and 18. We would like to use native thread for Android platform because then the animation doesn\u2019t block the JS thread. In real application we\u2019ll probably fire onPress callback and there will be another code to run. We don\u2019t want to block it, so it\u2019s better to use native thread for animation.Last word \u2026You can find the whole code in my github account. Note that it\u2019s not ready for production. For this purpose you can use react-native-material-ui that I\u2019m developing as an open source and using it for our booking system created in Reservio.com.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["React Native", "React", "Animation", "Android", "iOS"]}, {"title": "Bonus of $20 (In Xrp) for First 200 Bcnex Wishlist Investors", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@bcnex/bonus-of-20-in-xrp-for-first-200-bcnex-wishlist-investors-ff7b9743889a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bcnex", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bcnex", "publish_date": "2019-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-20", "readtime": "1.55", "claps": 625, "voters": 82, "content": "Bonus of $20 (In Xrp) for First 200 Bcnex Wishlist InvestorsBcnexFollowJun 20 \u00b7 2 min readDear Bcnex supporters,Bcnex ICO will end in less than 7 days.

Yesterday it became known that the large American investment bank JPMorgan in the next few months will begin testing its own digital currency \u2014 JPM Coin.JPMorgan makes daily transfers of more than 6 trillion dollars worldwide. It is expected that a small part of settlements between customers of the bank\u2019s payment unit will be carried out using JPM Coin.The investment bank is gradually creating a foundation for the transition to the future, where all cross-border payments will be carried out using blockchain technology. However, in order for such a future to come, banks must create an appropriate infrastructure that will allow making payments with lightning speed. In such a reality, there will be no room for old technologies, such as electronic money.In a conversation with the CNBC channel, the head of the blockchain development department at JPMorgan Umar Farooq identified 3 main areas of application of bank tokens: international payments with the ability to instantly make payments that are made between large corporate clients; operations with securities, which will minimize the time lag between the settlement of the transaction and its payment; and the replacement of dollars that are at the disposal of the divisions of corporations that use the services of JPMorgan stores.\u201cMoney sloshes back and forth all over the world in a large enterprise,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cIs there a way to ensure that a subsidiary can represent cash on the balance sheet without having to actually wire it to the unit? That way, they can consolidate their money and probably get better rates for it.\u201dJPM Coin is a stablecoin provided by the US dollar. Clients will receive this token immediately after the payment of fiat money to the bank. Once all the calculations have been completed successfully, JPMorgan will burn JPM Coin and return the corresponding amount of fiat dollars to the deposit to the owner. According to preliminary data, access to the token can be obtained only by tested large institutional clients, for example, corporations, banks, and broker-dealers.Faruk also admits that it is likely that in future the bank will be used to perform settlements between devices connected to the Internet:\u201cBut we can talk about this after the application of the blockchain technology is finally tested, and we will be sure that this direction is promising\u201d.Recall that the head of JPMorgan Jamie Dimon has relatively recently been one of the most ardent opponents of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. However, he subsequently stated that he regretted the past negative comments about Bitcoin.Today JPMorgan is not only one of the main supporters of cryptocurrency technologies but is actively involved in the development of this area. A week ago, JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said that the cryptocurrency market had gone through a \u201cbubble\u201d phase and looked quite reliable.Is JPM Coin Serious Competition for Ripple?The launch of JPMorgan, the financial giant\u2019s own digital asset, has sparked fierce discussions in the international crypto sector. Some experts see a great opportunity in this step, other prominent voices such as the CEO of Ripple sees the project is not sustainable.Already In 2016, four major banks entered into a cooperation agreement to launch the Utility Settlement Coin, a digital asset designed to streamline cross-border transactions, reduce fees and speed up processing of remittances. UBS presented the idea too, among others, Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon. NEX, Barclays, CIBC, Credit Suisse, HSBC, and MUFG are also on board. The test phase was already started in the middle of last year, but only a few results have been leaked to daylight.Ripple boss, Brad Garlinghouse, sees bank-issued digital assets as an unrealistic and misguided solution for the industry. In an article on his LinkedIn profile, Garlinghouse explains why bank-sponsored cryptocurrencies are doomed to failure. Here are two different scenarios conceivable:\u201cA bank-issued digital asset can only really efficiently settle between the banks who issued it. Then, two scenarios can play out. Scenario one: all banks around the world put aside competitive and geopolitical differences, adopt the same digital asset, agree on its rules, and harmoniously govern its usage. Fat chance. Scenario two (the more likely scenario): banks not in the issuing group issue their own digital assets with their own sets of rules and governance.We\u2019re kinda seeing this already, as the FT points out, with Citi\u2019s Citicoin and Goldman Sachs\u2019 SETLcoin. The result would be an even more fragmented currency landscape than what we have today. If banks of different digital asset groups want to settle trades with one another, they\u2019ll have to make markets between their unique digital assets or trade between their digital assets and a common fiat currency. What a mess!The second big problem with the \u2018utility settlement coin\u2019 is it seems it\u2019ll be backed by a basket of currencies. Once backed by cash, it\u2019s no longer an asset; it\u2019s a liability. Trading liabilities then ultimately requires moving cash across borders, re-creating today\u2019s system but adding more friction!\u201dIf each bank launches its own digital asset to handle payments across the globe, over time it could create a wealth of new currencies that flood the market. Ripple tries to prevent this and therefore provides an infrastructure that can be used easily and quickly by any financial institution worldwide:\u201cWe strongly believe banks need an independent digital asset to enable truly efficient settlement and we believe XRP is best positioned for that role. It goes back to the fundamentals of what makes digital assets unique and special \u2014 they\u2019re universal currencies, meaning anyone can use them as units of value anywhere in the world. That universality gives digital assets global reach and the ability to settle much faster than traditional assets.Compared head to head with other independent digital assets (like Bitcoin or Ether), XRP settles the most efficiently cross-border, in just seconds. In fact, we\u2019ve run tests with global banks to prove XRP can lower liquidity costs for cross-border trades.\u201dAuthor: Marko Vidrih@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

His Ripple holdings also briefly made Larsen the 5th richest man in the world as Ripple prices surged more than 30,000% in a year.Larsen was richer than the founders of Google.How Ripple Became a SensationRipple was actually created in 2004 by Ryan Fugger (then called Ripplepay) to be a peer-to-peer payment network that centered around debt and was in essence a network of imaginary credit lines. Ripple\u2019s founding in 2004 makes it older than Bitcoin, which Satoshi Nakamoto first dreamed up in 2009.While Ripple showed some adoption in its early years, it was inherently limited in scale by its centralized network (in which you had to be invited in by someone already in the network) and so Ripple never entered mainstream conversations until 2012 when Ripple decided to revamp its business. Enter the A-list management:Jed McCaleb \u2014 a programmer responsible for the creation of the first Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, one bound to infamy with a hack of 850k stolen Bitcoin before Mt. Gox\u2019s dissolution forever marring its nameChris Larsen \u2014 a serial entrepreneur, the co-founder of E-Loan, an online mortgage lender, and Prosper, a peer-to-peer lender.Together, Larsen and McCaleb envisioned Ripple tokens to be a replacement to Bitcoin, a replacement that was faster and more efficient with its transactions as all of the Ripple tokens are pre-mined. According to the Ripple website, Ripple can settle payments in 4 seconds, compared to 2 minutes for Ethereum, over an hour for Bitcoin, and 3\u20135 days for traditional systems.In total 100 billion Ripple coins were created when the Ripple network we know today launched in 2012, but the powers that be at Ripple decided not to release all of the tokens to the public at once, but instead to release fractions of the hoard over time. Larsen and McCaleb kept 20 billion coins for themselves, and the rest went to the company. To date, Ripple still holds nearly 50 billion Ripple in escrow.However, the XRP token is only a fraction of Ripple\u2019s business. The buzziest element of Ripple, and its true appeal, is not its token, but its business. RippleNet is an open-source software that enables money transfers between wallets globally. The Ripple token is just one of many currencies that can be transferred through RippleNet.Revolutionary? Not quite. But it is efficient across international borders, which is what caught the eye of the banks, including Santander and American Express, among a hundred or so others. However, it\u2019s worth noting that banks can use RippleNet without actually using XRP tokens, which is a fact that is lost on many investors. Speaking of investors\u2026The lawsuit that could unravel RippleOn May 3rd 2018, Ryan Coffey filed a class action suit against Ripple. Ryan is an investor who purchased Ripple at $2.60 as an investment when the token was exploding in value in January 2018. Coffey lost $585 when he sold his Ripple tokens at $1.30.You could argue so what? Who cares that an investor lost $500. This is a small amount, and investors lose money all the time. What\u2019s the fuss? Usually, you\u2019d be right that the story ends here because the old adage \u201cinvestor beware\u201d holds true to this day. Losing money on an investment is par for the course in the speculation of early-stage companies. If every investment was guaranteed to not lose money or investors would get their money back, then there would be no sellers; there would only be buyers.What is unusual about this situation and this particular class action suit is Coffey\u2019s claim that Ripple sold unregistered securities to investors. That is fraud, if true. With this kind of claim, an ordinary investor can easily go to court and be made whole with their losses. Because this is a class action suit, it in theory represents all of the U.S. based investors who purchased Ripple.This can amount to billions of dollars in claims that investors can ask the company to repay. This would demolish Ripple and its founders, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse (McCaleb left Ripple and started Stellar, and Larsen is now the executive chairman after stepping down as CEO last year). This lawsuit names others with the ambition to sue every single person in the Ripple food chain, including those who marketed it to investors.According to the lawsuit, the suit \u201carises out of a scheme by Defendants to raise hundreds of millions of dollars through the unregistered sale of XRP to retail investors in violation of the registration provisions of state and federal securities laws.\u201dThe lawsuit further alleges that the \u201cDefendants have since earned massive profits by quietly selling off this XRP to the general public, in what is essentially a never-ending initial coin offering.\u201d The lawsuit goes on to use Ripple\u2019s attempts to bribe exchanges to list XRP as well as their conflation of XRP with RippleNet as further evidence of misleading investors and attempts to inflate the price of XRP, which is directly tied to the amount of money Ripple Labs brings in.Since Coffey (and likely the majority of XRP investors) purchased the tokens with reasonable expectations of profit, and Ripple Labs itself marketed XRP as a promising investment, then XRP is indeed a security to the eyes of the SEC.If Coffey\u2019s lawsuit succeeds, this is a serious blow to the crypto industry. Not only does it beg the question of how many cryptocurrencies are actually securities, but it also means that every exchange that listed XRP is in trouble unless they are an exchange registered with the SEC or a broker dealer using an ATS. Hint: that is zero of the exchanges that list XRP.As the clamor for regulation grows, this lawsuit could very well be the tipping point that changes the name of the game for crypto and cleans the house of unregistered exchanges. If the third largest coin isn\u2019t safe, then no one down the list is.", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ripple", "ICO", "Utility Token Icos", "Utility Token"]}, {"title": "Ethereum Core Developer and Original Ripple Creator Join Bluzelle Advisory Board", "post_link": "https://blog.bluzelle.com/ethereum-core-developer-and-original-ripple-creator-join-bluzelle-advisory-board-cf9cb59b353e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Pavel Bains", "author_link": "https://blog.bluzelle.com/@pavelbains", "publish_date": "2017-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-26", "readtime": "2.97", "claps": 565, "voters": 42, "content": "Ethereum Core Developer and Original Ripple Creator Join Bluzelle Advisory BoardPavel BainsFollowDec 11, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readAlong with experts in security, encryption and more.A couple of months ago, we introduced you to our first group of advisors.

This is inaugural episode \u2026 This is episode zero, right?Jay Kang: Yeah, it is generation zero of our crypto kitties podcast experience.Aaron Lammer: You\u2019re inside the genesis block here. I\u2019m Aaron Lammer. Across the crypto cave from me, Mr Jay Caspian Kang.Jay Kang: Hello.Aaron Lammer: Just to give a little background here. I do podcasts, I have a podcast called Longform. I have another podcast about weed, called Stoner. Jay, what do you do?Jay Kang: I\u2019m a journalist. I write for the New York Times Magazine. I\u2019m a correspondent for VICE News Tonight on HBO.Aaron Lammer: This show has almost nothing to do with what we do with our actual lives. It has to do with what we do with our shadow lives.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Our pseudo lives.Jay Kang: We should probably say that it has absolutely nothing to do with any of the companies that we work for.Aaron Lammer: Couldn\u2019t have less to do with anything else we do. In fact, I think the origins of this show, at least from my perspective, are the, we got into cryptocurrencies around the same time. We started talking about them obsessively. As usual, I just try to feed my addictions into a podcast format.Jay Kang: Yeah, same. You introduced me into crypto. I had known about it before. But I had never thought about-Aaron Lammer: If you could go back to that moment, would you just have me not tell you about cryptocurrency?Jay Kang: Well you\u2019ve tried a few times. You\u2019ve tried a few times. The first time I was like, \u201cNo.\u201d And then the second time, I believe I also told your wife, \u201cAarom keeps talking to me about cryptocurrency.\u201dAaron Lammer: \u201cPlease ask him to stop.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah. But then at a barbecue at your house, you showed me some of this stuff in a very Roger Ver sort of way.Aaron Lammer: Oh, I\u2019m the Roger Ver in your life.Jay Kang: Roger Ver being known as Bitcoin Jesus. He would walk around and show people how to store Bitcoin on a phone, which is essentially what you did.Aaron Lammer: As a bald man, I will take any comparison to Jesus.Jay Kang: Yeah. You came to me and said, \u201cLook, this is how you do it. This is how it works.\u201d Some degenerate gambling past stuff kicked up in my brain. The endorphins started running and here we are.Aaron Lammer: You have a little bit of a background in gambling. You\u2019ve covered high-stakes online poker players. I have a little bit of a background in technology. I have failed to raise money for a startup previously. So we\u2019re coming to this from slightly different points of view. But I think it\u2019s important for listeners to the show to realize, we don\u2019t really know very much about cryptocurrency. Everything we\u2019ve learned, we learned in the last six months. Through a pretty haphazard education.Jay Kang: That was always the idea that we had about the podcast. Which was that, when people download Coinbase and they say, \u201cI\u2019m going to buy cryptocurrency.\u201d And then they\u2019re like, \u201cWell, I would like to make an informed decision.\u201d This is all stuff that we did. Wading through Reddit posts and shitposts on Twitter and people who are angry, and people if you don\u2019t know they\u2019re trying to scam you or not. That\u2019s all very intimidating. We wished that we had a sort of inviting, easy, and somewhat dumbed down version of everything to listen to. That\u2019s what we decided.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019re your guide, your Sherpa.Jay Kang: Yes. But a Sherpa that was not scaling the mountain at incredible paces, but was like, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve done this once before and I think we\u2019re going to be okay.\u201dAaron Lammer: And as part of the lucky and privileged position we have living in New York here and being involved in the media and journalism and stuff like that, we do have access to people who do know what they\u2019re talking about. Those people are journalists, they are developers, they\u2019re gamblers, speculators, Wall Streeters, we\u2019re going to have them all on this show to tell us all the things that we are getting wrong as we talk through the week\u2019s news.Jay Kang: Exactly. So when we have a question, when Aaron and I looked at some crypto news or something like that, and we ask each other, \u201cHey, what is this?\u201d We generally do-Aaron Lammer: \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah. Or we pretend to get it and then 10 minutes in we\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d We generally default to asking some people that we know, how to disentangle this and what it actually means. We would like for you, the listener, to go through that process with us as we have these discussions.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, and let us know how we\u2019re doing, what your questions are, what\u2019s confusing you. Jay helped start Grantland, which is a sports site that ESPN did with Bill Simmons. I think that the way that we regard the Bitcoin, crypto space is from a sports-like background. It reminds me a little of fantasy sports or something like that.Aaron Lammer: We see this as an entertaining field full of weirdos and interesting personalities. We want to cover it from every angle. You\u2019re probably not going to hear breaking news on this show. But if you don\u2019t want to sit there on every Reddit forum and every Discord chat channel following every project along-Jay Kang: Reading every single white paper.Aaron Lammer: If you don\u2019t want to get yelled at. If you want to get involved in crypto without getting yelled at, we\u2019re willing to not yell at you.Jay Kang: Yeah, because we will get yelled at for you. We\u2019ll try and disseminate the parts that are not yelling.Aaron Lammer: One more thing before we get going, I want to send a shout out to Medium. This show is produced in partnership with Medium. They\u2019re helping us do things like put up transcripts of every episode, live show notes, which is a reading list. There\u2019s a ton of amazing crypto stuff happening on Medium.Jay Kang: Yeah. There is really \u2026 I mean I\u2019m sure that if you have waded into this space and you have read a good article or somebody coherently laying out their thoughts, chances are that it was on a Medium page.Aaron Lammer: You can actually find all of the best crypto writing on Medium at me.dm/crypto again, me.dm/crypto that\u2019s a landing page with all sorts of crypto related content. Our page is medium.com/cointalk, we\u2019ll have all the new shows there. You can either subscribe there or you can subscribe there in the pod catcher of your choice. It\u2019s all the same.Jay Kang: What is a pod catcher?Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s a podcast app.Jay Kang: A podcast app?Aaron Lammer: Pod catcher.Jay Kang: It feels vaguely-Aaron Lammer: It catches the podcast.Jay Kang: Vaguely gross.Aaron Lammer: As a special bonus, would be down to do a little mini-show today, Jay?Jay Kang: Yeah, let\u2019s do it. There\u2019s a lot of news.Aaron Lammer: What should we talk about?Jay Kang: Let\u2019s talk about the only thing that people in crypto seem to be talking about over the past week, which is Ripple.Aaron Lammer: Cue the theme music.Aaron Lammer: This episode was taped Sunday, January 7th at 6pm. The Bitcoin price index was $14,780.Aaron Lammer: Welcome back to Crip Talk-Jay Kang: Welcome to Crap-topia. What is your pin number? I don\u2019t know anymore. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t buy this shit coin.Aaron Lammer: Okay, we clearly had our brains scrambled by crypto. But we want to give you a little preview of the show. Let\u2019s do a few topics. What do you want to talk about today?Jay Kang: I think we have to talk about Ripple.Aaron Lammer: Can\u2019t not talk about Ripple (XRP).Jay Kang: Yeah, which is a little disappointing. But we should.Aaron Lammer: Let\u2019s also talk about, I just saw that people are trading accounts. I don\u2019t know if this is real. But it appears that some of these exchanges, the smaller exchanges have shut down new accounts and people are trading in accounts on those exchanges.Jay Kang: Yeah, they\u2019re trying to pimp them out, they\u2019re saying, \u201cI\u2019ll sign this account over to you for five Bitcoin.\u201dAaron Lammer: And then I think we\u2019re going to tie things up talking a little bit about our own relative, emotional weaknesses as crypto traders.Jay Kang: That previews of a year of content, I think.Aaron Lammer: Without getting too deep into what Ripple is, what\u2019s going on with Ripple right now?Jay Kang: Well, the reason why it\u2019s in the news is because for a very short period of time, when Ripple was around $3.84 here, Chris Larsen, who is the former CEO of Ripple, not even the current CEO, was supposedly worth 59 billion dollars. Which made him the fifth richest man in America.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s kind of incredible this murderers row of people behind Ripple. You\u2019ve got him, he\u2019s briefly richer than Larry Ellison. This is the guy who doesn\u2019t even work at the company Ripple anymore. He\u2019s the former CEO. One of the other guys was the original guy who started Mt. Gox before he sold it to Mark Karpeles. That guy is filthy fucking rich. There\u2019s a new CEO who is beefing with Nathaniel Popper on Twitter, \u2019cause Nathaniel Popper called a bunch of banks and they were like, \u201cYeah, we might work with Ripple some day, I guess.\u201dJay Kang: I think that people in crypto almost never agree on anything. Like it it seems like there\u2019s never really any agreement about anything in crypto.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: But it does seem like all sides, any type of coin that you\u2019re into, everyone has banded together to hate Ripple. You hate Ripple. Why do you hate Ripple?Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t. Look, I\u2019ve owned Ripple before. So I can\u2019t have hated it that much. Generally the rap it gets is, well for starters, it\u2019s not really decentralized. There\u2019s the company Ripple. There\u2019s the token Ripple. The company Ripple has locked up something like 60% of the Ripple tokens. But look, I\u2019m not some decentralization ideologue. So that doesn\u2019t really explain why I would dislike it.Aaron Lammer: I think what gets under my skin about Ripple is it seems like this Ripple run is playing on people\u2019s worst instincts, which is, people want to buy a coin that\u2019s really cheap. Ripple is pre-mined. So all the coins are out there, available, except for the ones that have been locked up by the founders and for their future bank partners. There\u2019s 100 billion of them.Aaron Lammer: They seem really cheap. People have bought it up from cents up to over $3. The idea that Ripple is worth that much, where you multiply its price by the number of tokens, seems misleading at best. It feels almost like it was designed to take advantage of pyschology. Sort of in the way of Zinga games used to feel that way to me.Jay Kang: Yeah, or junk bonds. Where there\u2019s value that\u2019s almost made out of thin air. I\u2019ll say that the association with banks, there\u2019s this great detail in this Financial Times story, where the author, Izabella Kaminska meets the people at Ripple at Davos.Jay Kang: I think that when you read about Ripple, it\u2019s been in the news all week. The one thing that keeps coming up is that for Ripple to work this network that they want to do between banks, they need banks to buy in.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, and they\u2019ve held a bunch of tokens up to lure the banks in.Jay Kang: Yeah. They\u2019re like, \u201cYou know my 59 billion. We\u2019ve got some for you too. But not for them.\u201dAaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: That bothers me a little bit. And I will say that I also am not some Austrian school Libertarian who believes that everything should be decentralized. But I do agree that there\u2019s this sort of shell game here. If I printed a million Kang Coin (KCO) and I held 999,000 of them and I sold them to you for 50 cents, I\u2019m not worth the one billion Kang Coins plus whatever, wait that doesn\u2019t make sense. Let me try again. If I print a billion Kang Coins.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Jay, where can I buy those Kang Coins?Jay Kang: I sell you one for $1.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: That one Kang coin is worth a dollar. I\u2019m not worth a billion dollars at that point.Aaron Lammer: Exactly. And I further think that even if you accept these hijinx, potentially as clever, at one point I think they had passed Toyota in market cap size. When you\u2019re bigger than Toyota and all you\u2019ve really done is introduce the idea of, \u201cWe\u2019re going to disrupt the SWIFT money transfer system.\u201d What is the incentive to actually do it? How much would you have to actually achieve to justify that value? And how much would you just be like, \u201cHey, things are going great. Tokens trading for $3. What else do we need to do here?\u201dJay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Why build an actual company? The guy who\u2019s the richest isn\u2019t even the CEO anymore. I almost feel like these pre-mined coins ought to be categorized differently than the minable coins. \u2019Cause I think that their supply represents something different. It represents something different if there\u2019s a mining community that feels like it\u2019s worthwhile. I will not be buying Ripple. Will you be buying Ripple?Jay Kang: Well, I mean, like you, I already bought Ripple. And then I sold it for about a penny more than it was after I \u2026 As you\u2019ll learn from us, we do a lot of that.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I think that\u2019s something worth addressing as we get going here on the show, which is, Jay and I, not only should you not take our investment advice. You should consider going the opposite of the way we\u2019re going.Jay Kang: Oh yeah. I\u2019m sure you guys have listened to Sports Gambling Podcast, where you just say, \u201cI\u2019m going to bet the opposite of that guy, because that guy never wins.\u201d That\u2019s a good idea to us.Aaron Lammer: We really don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. I will say, just to tie this up. That both of our original assumptions, \u2014 we\u2019ve been taping fake episodes of this fake podcast previousl \u2014 both of us thought that Ripple would never have a meteoric rise because it\u2019s usefulness as this middle man in money transfers, which is basically what it\u2019s designed for, is somewhat ebbed away if you have it making 50% or 80% swings on a single day.Jay Kang: Yeah, I recall this was an impassioned case I made during one of our Basement Tapes. With you being like, \u201cYou can\u2019t have a transfer between banks if the thing is plunging 20% in a day. Therefore it\u2019s never going to go up.\u201d And I think that I cost you a lot of money that way.Aaron Lammer: Jay, how many different accounts do you have for exchanges?Jay Kang: Right now?Aaron Lammer: Yeah. What are you? I assume we\u2019re both-Jay Kang: I\u2019m ashamed to say.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019re both on Coinbase/GDAXJay Kang: I\u2019m ashamed to say it. I think I\u2019m at six.Aaron Lammer: Okay, wow. Did you ever think it would come to this?Jay Kang: I had hoped not. Because like most people who are getting into crypto at some point, you want to be almost like a knight of crypto and stand for what\u2019s good in crypto.Aaron Lammer: That has never been my ambition.Jay Kang: That certainly does not mean signing into six different exchanges so that you can chase shitcoins all over the world.Aaron Lammer: We both started on the Coinbase/GDAX axis, which is, I think where most people start, at least Americans. I know that both of us made the jump to Bittrex, which seems like the logical first place to go. A lot of these bigger name alt coins are available at Bittrex. It\u2019s a place where you can pick up Zcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR). Actually I think I did some ShapeShifting before I did that.Jay Kang: Yeah, that was before I entered your crypto world.Aaron Lammer: I lost two Monero in a ShapeShift calamity that\u2019s still unexplained. Come on the show and talk about it ShapeShift makers. I got to Bittrex and we both stopped for a while.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: And then there\u2019s been a rush in the last week or so, where it seems like everyone got \u2026 A lot of people have to have gotten onto some exchange or we couldn\u2019t see all this Ripple (XRP) trading.Jay Kang: Yeah, there seemed to be a domino effect. Because first, everyone signed up for Coinbase and then Litecoin (LTC) surges. Ethereum (ETH) surges and then Bittrex says, \u201cWhoa, we\u2019ve got a lot of people. We can\u2019t handle all of you.\u201d And then Binance, which is a Chinese exchange, they say, \u201cWhoa, we can\u2019t handle all your people. There\u2019s no new signups.\u201dJay Kang: And then on and on and on, it seems like every single day now, a new exchange is saying, \u201cWe\u2019re shutting down new registration signups.\u201d I don\u2019t know. It seems like either there\u2019s a massive, massive amount of people who are trying to signup for these things. Or something really bad is about to happen.Aaron Lammer: Well, the way I\u2019m reading it, as a buyer. Is, if there\u2019s more people trying to get on these exchanges than can fit through the door. I\u2019m buying alts, because those people are going to come after me and they\u2019re going to want to buy alts and eventually they\u2019re going to get accounts. I mean, it\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t know if this is really going to sell. But there was someone who was selling a account for $25,000 on eBay. All that account does is give you the right to transfer in Bitcoin and trade.Jay Kang: Yeah, and for how long? \u2019Cause it\u2019s not like this is a permanent, it\u2019s not like they capped a country club and they\u2019re like, \u201cNo more people in this country club. Someone has to die.\u201d I\u2019m sure that Binance will allow new people in the next couple months. Or Bittrex might in the next couple weeks.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know. Cryptopia got knocked offline by DOT trading, I think, today.Jay Kang: Yeah, Cryptopia is another one that shut down new registrations as well.Aaron Lammer: It makes sense, if you\u2019re just chasing the high, Cryptopia is the closest to a video game experience that you\u2019re going to get out there right now.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know, KcCoin is close. They\u2019re very similar.Aaron Lammer: I haven\u2019t been on Kucoin.Jay Kang: They\u2019re very similar.Aaron Lammer: Okay. Tell me what are the differences, for people out there that haven\u2019t checked them out, what\u2019s Kucoin like? Is that Korean?Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know the country of origin. But when you sign in there is a phishing warning and it\u2019s in English, but every word is conjugated wrong. It inspires a lot of customer security in me.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: But no, it\u2019s like a lot of other exchanges in the sense that it lists the coins. They have these flashing banner ads that say, \u201cIt\u2019s Kucoin Christmas.\u201d Mind you, this is today.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: They\u2019re like, \u201cIf you sign up. If you tweet out Kucoin we\u2019ll give you this.\u201d So the whole thing looks like an online poker site from 2004 or something like that. Where everything is bonus incentive. It does not look like an investment tool at all.Aaron Lammer: For me, my experience at Cryptopia was I started dragging on the bottom. I started to buy the strange off-brand things.Jay Kang: Yeah, I remember this.Aaron Lammer: Things I previously turned my nose up to.Jay Kang: You texted me and you were like, \u201cI bought this, this, this, and this.\u201d And I was like, \u201cHuh, I have not heard of any of those.\u201d And then I Googled them. That really didn\u2019t help that much either.Aaron Lammer: The way I originally approached Cryptopia was \u2014 so, everyone knows that I have a soft spot in my heart for Monero (XMR),Jay Kang: This is the first episode. So nobody knows that.Aaron Lammer: No one knows it yet. But you\u2019re going to learn all about my affection for Monero. I like to put an extra \u201cO\u201d in it, call it Moonero. I started looking at the guys here who are the biggest Monero \u201cStans.\u201d The guys who are just shilling Monero left and right. Which are a dying breed actually, there used to be more of them. They were showing their bags. They were showing some pretty far down the chart anonymity coin. Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) were the first anonymity coins that I read about.Aaron Lammer: I find the use case for anonymity coins pretty compelling. But Zcash and Monero and I also have some Zcoin (XZC). These are pretty stable now. They\u2019re coming up. But you\u2019re not going to double them tomorrow. So I started looking and seeing some of these smaller anonymity coins that were available. Picked up little Sumokoin (SUMO), a little Zoin (ZOI).Jay Kang: And yet you somehow missed the biggest one of all, ZClassic (ZCL).Aaron Lammer: Well Zclassic was already pumping when I got there.Jay Kang: Not where it is now.Aaron Lammer: Not where it is now, but I was looked at it and I said, \u201cOkay, how \u2026 I think now, Zclassic (ZCL) is worth a third as much as Zcash (ZEC), which is insane.Jay Kang: It\u2019s like $200.Aaron Lammer: But at the time, Sumokoin (SUMO) was trading for a buck 80 and Monero (XMR) was trading for $300 something. It seemed like a good idea to check out Sumokoin, which is a Monero clone, low price, \u201cK\u201d in the title. Sumokoin, with a K. (laughter)Jay Kang: What actually made you go down this route? Because I think that what \u201csmart\u201d or shark investors would tell you is, \u201cDon\u2019t bother with that stuff. Eventually Monero (XMR) will win out. You might be able to catch a small burst in these things. But eventually you\u2019re going to lose enough on those where it\u2019s not even worth it.\u201dAaron Lammer: I don\u2019t find that compelling.Jay Kang: You don\u2019t find that compelling?Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know. I think that we\u2019re in the throws of a mania and people are looking to bid up these tiny, low-market cap, low price coins. Look, I don\u2019t expect to be trading these coins for the rest of my life. But I do feel like there\u2019s some short term gains to be had.Jay Kang: Yeah, look, the market has proven that.Aaron Lammer: Wait a minute.Jay Kang: No, no, no, I\u2019m not saying-Aaron Lammer: Oh, you\u2019re playing devil\u2019s advocate over here.Jay Kang: I\u2019m playing devil\u2019s advocate here. I\u2019m on your side.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. We need an actually conservative person on this show, because I feel like we\u2019re both just egging each other to a lower and lower common denominator.Jay Kang: Yeah, look I think that anything to fill out your Monero (XMR) \u201cStan\u201d-dom is good. If any of you play HQ trivia and you look in the chat and you see the words Monero, Monero, Monero over again-Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s me.Jay Kang: That\u2019s definitely Aaron.Aaron Lammer: That one\u2019s me.Jay Kang: That\u2019s almost always Aaron.Aaron Lammer: I think I have driven about 10% of the volume of Monero, just with my own fandom.Jay Kang: Based on HQ Trivia, yeah. I actually do shill my own coins on HQ trivia chat too.Aaron Lammer: Here\u2019s the funny thing that happened with Sumo. You\u2019ve gotten to witness this all. Which Sumokoin, right after I buy, and I wasn\u2019t thinking I was going to hold this for years. I was thinking, \u201cWell maybe Sumokoin will double in the next week or two, sell a tidy profit back to Bitcoin.\u201dAaron Lammer: Instead, it went up five X, four or five X, pretty quickly, right after I bought it. I was like, \u201cHoly shit. I got a winner. I got a winning lottery ticket.\u201d And then, I started talking about how I was a Sumokoin baron. And how I-Jay Kang: I think you Tweeted it several times.Aaron Lammer: All about Sumokoin. And then I got kind of, it became part of my identity, that I was a Sumokoin dude. And then I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to run into people and they\u2019ll be like, \u2018Hey, how\u2019s your Sumokoin doing?\u2019 And I\u2019d be like, \u2018I don\u2019t have that Sumokoin anymore.\u2019\u201dJay Kang: Yeah. I think what you\u2019re talking \u2026 I mean, look this happens to me too. I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s some behavioral economics terms for it. But I think that when we luck into a decision in crypto and it works out for us and we feel like we\u2019ve been on that ship a long time.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: We won\u2019t cut bait because the only thing that convinces us that we\u2019re not complete idiot gamblers is the fact that we bought this coin at 14 cents and now it\u2019s like 10 times that value. And then we have to ride it out. Because if it\u2019s not in our portfolio then we just looking at a river of shit.Aaron Lammer: The way I feel also now with SUMO. Sumo\u2019s back to almost its high again.Jay Kang: I know about it.Aaron Lammer: So now I know. I told myself, \u201cNext time it\u2019s up there, you gotta sell it. You gotta get out of this.\u201dJay Kang: You\u2019re not selling it. You\u2019re not going to sell it.Aaron Lammer: But now I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat if SUMO goes to $100 and I\u2019m known as the SUMO guy?\u201d And I don\u2019t have it anymore and then I have to go buy it again on the expensive. And then I\u2019m like, \u201cI only have five Sumokoin guys. Sorry. I used to have a lot.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, you\u2019ll never be able to show your face in the sumo baron lounge anymore and they\u2019ll just be like, \u201cYeah, he used to have it. But he doesn\u2019t have it anymore.\u201d I would actually say that again, none of this is investment advice, to you either.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. My investment advice to people is to just turn off the show now, unsubscribe to the podcast and never listen to anything Jay and I say.Jay Kang: Why would you sell it?Aaron Lammer: I\u2019d sell it \u2019cause I made a big profit on it. As you said, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to lose in the long run, with these shitty coins?\u201dJay Kang: I don\u2019t know. I feel like at some point, you just gotta ride it out. Obviously, every single thing is saying that you probably should have sold it the second that you hit 3X, you know?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: But look, part of crypto is just having fun with it. I don\u2019t know. What would you text me if it wasn\u2019t the price of SUMO every four hour updates?Aaron Lammer: And I feel like, of all the things to become the baron of, am I going to find something as good as Sumokoin, with a \u201cK\u201d?Jay Kang: No, no, no. Names do matter.Aaron Lammer: And the logo\u2019s not bad either.Jay Kang: No, the logo is terrible.Aaron Lammer: I would say that the logo for Sumokoin looks like something that the designer of Insane Clown Posse graphics designed in the late 90s.Jay Kang: It\u2019s a terrible logo. I think the name is good though.Aaron Lammer: So we\u2019ve established that my weakness is buying things based on their name, narrative, icon, logo.Jay Kang: Logo.Aaron Lammer: What\u2019s your weakness?Jay Kang: Oh man.Aaron Lammer: Gambling?Jay Kang: Yeah. Well sports. Sports betting. Bitcoin is a whole different thing. I have no idea if it\u2019s legal or not. I\u2019m pretty sure it is.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not.Jay Kang: Well, can I report it on my taxes?Aaron Lammer: We\u2019ve been planning this show for a couple months.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Taping demos. And my biggest fear was that you were going to get completely rekt sports gambling, to the point where you no longer had any Bitcoin, nor were you interested in it. And that would be the end of this flagship partnership. That has not happened.Jay Kang: I will say in my defense, actually, this is not in my defense, but almost it\u2019s non sequitur that I will wrestle into my own defense. The gambling space in crypto is actually pretty interesting with smart contracts through Ethereum and with just the idea of a decentralized sports book is also interesting.Aaron Lammer: If you ask me right now, of all the ICOs, what are the highest percentage chance of these to actually succeed? I\u2019d be like, \u201cAll of the casino and gambling ones.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, \u2019cause there\u2019s a use case. And people will use it.Aaron Lammer: Yes. People love to gamble.Jay Kang: I will say that I\u2019ve now been probably putting occasional sports bets down in Bitcoin for three to four months. The experience is a lot different than using an offsite book or going to Las Vegas and putting down a bet. And certainly a lot different than using a bookie. It\u2019s something about the fact that you are putting, when you want to put down, let\u2019s say you\u2019re putting down $150 bet, right now that\u2019s .001 btc.Aaron Lammer: Do you worry that every gambling loss you have for the rest of your life that was made in Bitcoin, you will be calculating it based on the price of Bitcoin, which could be over $100,000 at that point?Jay Kang: No. I am thinking that every bet that I make is adding to my Bitcoin stash when it goes to $100,000.Aaron Lammer: So you\u2019re basically doing the same thing gambling on sports that I\u2019m doing gambling on Sumokoin?Jay Kang: Yeah. And I think that\u2019s where the corollary is, right?Aaron Lammer: But why? Do you feel like you\u2019re better at sports gambling than alt coin trading?Jay Kang: No, because I think at this point you could actually make a reasonable bet. You would say that I will probably win this bet, much more so than I will beat the coin spread here. That if you bought 10 random coins on Cryptopia this week, or on Kucoin or on HitBTC, that some of them would go down quite a bit. But one of them would go way up and that you would probably end up doubling the money. I\u2019m only talking about this week.Aaron Lammer: Not that many went down though. That\u2019s the crazy part.Jay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s what I mean though. That\u2019s just this week, right? I will just say that, ask somebody who has a compulsive need to gamble that I found that this is probably both the dumbest but also the easiest and most painless way to do it so far, that I\u2019ve found.Aaron Lammer: See, for me, I\u2019m not really a gambler. This is as close as I\u2019ve come to gambling, is buying crap coins.Jay Kang: And the question that I think is, if I had hit a Sumokoin, like you did, if I hit something that in one day went up five times what I bought it for, would I be more interested in just gambling on shit coins? Yeah, probably. But it hasn\u2019t happened to me yet. Don\u2019t know what it feels like to be a SUMO Baron,.Aaron Lammer: Jay, I want you to become Baron. I want your feudal estate to be right next to mine and both of us to ride it to victory. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do on this show. We\u2019re not going to tell you how much money we have in coins. Both of us have been involved with journalism. So you can guess, it\u2019s not that much.Jay Kang: Neither of us are really-Aaron Lammer: We\u2019re taping this in the basement and Jay said, \u201cWould it be possible for us to get heat at some point?\u201d earlier.Jay Kang: We are both basically wearing scarves right now.Aaron Lammer: But we want to keep you up as to what we\u2019re trading. Our failures and quasi successes as we go. We\u2019ll be telling you what\u2019s in our bag. You can write and tell us what\u2019s in your bags. Hopefully, I feel like the show might get us some good tips, right?Jay Kang: Yeah, please, if at all possible. Let us know anything. Things that you hate about the show. If there were things that you wish that we did more. Especially if there are people who you think that we should talk to, to have on as guests.Aaron Lammer: If you want to get in touch it\u2019s hi@cointalk.show \u2014 this show is kind of typical of what an episode will be like, except usually we\u2019ll have a guest on and they will weigh in on those topics and we will interview them a bit about what their experiences around crypto have been. Which is a fascinating topic to me. \u2019Cause people come to this with totally different life experiences. I want to have on cryptographers and I want to have on people who\u2019ve been day-traders. I want to have on people who are tech journalists. All those perspectives I feel like are colliding in this world.Jay Kang: What if we bring on the competing SUMO baron. What if he has more sumo than you and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re a fake SUMO baron.\u201d?Aaron Lammer: A friend of SUMO is a friend of mine.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to feel that way, or she.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019ll have a new episode for you every week and maybe even more than that. You down to do more than that sometimes?Jay Kang: Whenever news breaks, which is a lot in crypto, let\u2019s say the market crashes or Satoshi comes forward or the market crashes, we\u2019ll be here.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019ll be here with you. You can subscribe in any podcast app, you can also follow us on Medium at medium.com/cointalk. Medium is going to have a transcript of every show, in case you want to read our stupid ideas, so you can go through them faster.Jay Kang: Yes, if you want a written down version of every coin that we\u2019ve talked about and said that we liked, just so that you can go against them, it will be on the site.Aaron Lammer: And we\u2019ll also publish along with it a little reading list. We didn\u2019t cite it when we were talking about Ripple (XPR), but both of us really enjoyed Ryan Selkis\u2019 piece, I think he\u2019s at @twobitidiot on Medium. His piece on Ripple really was the background reading that at least got me to understand what Ripple was so I wasn\u2019t blindly hating it.Jay Kang: Yeah, and Izabella Kaminska\u2019s piece in the Financial Times, which I thought was a very good case as to why Ripple might have a long road ahead for bank integration, that also was great. We\u2019ll put that in the show notes as well.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, okay. Subscribe, say hi at hi@cointalk.show and we will see you very shortly.Jay Kang: CoinTalk.Aaron Lammer: CoinTalk.

CEO Under Fire at Disrupt SFCue the Rolling Stones.Martine ParisFollowSep 13, 2018 \u00b7 7 min readWhen Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, took the stage at Disrupt SF last week, he was met by TechCrunch\u2019s Mike Butcher with an unrelenting line of questioning into the activities of the controversial fintech company. It was a masterful interview focused on clarifying whether Ripple has been manipulating the market to boost the XRP price, which is now down 90% from its 2018 high.Ripple Labs, which offers enterprise global payments on the blockchain, is the issuer of XRP, the world\u2019s third largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The company has been sued for securities fraud by irate investors who lost money in the recent crash and allege that Ripple created the XRP token to fund its operations and the development of the XRP ecosystem. Under the Howie Test, based on investor expectations and how it was marketed, XRP could be ruled an unregistered security in violation of SEC regulations.Are you in fact the devil?\u201cI\u2019m not the devil,\u201d Garlinghouse replied laughing. \u201cPeople who say that Ripple is somehow the devil, it\u2019s because we\u2019re partnering with the man. Cross border payments today are slow and expensive. Ripple invented a series of technologies built upon the XRP ledger that allows institutions, banks and even in some cases, government to dramatically accelerate the nature of transactions.\u201dMike Arrington, Founder of TechCrunch and Arrington XRP Capital agreed, \u201cXRP is a fantastic currency to use for among other things, funds. We need to move a lot of money very quickly. We make investments all over the world. Using banks to move money is a pain. Have you ever sent money in an international wire? You gotta call, did you get it? And what? No I didn\u2019t get it. It takes a day or two to move money around the world. With XRP, our very first close was $50 million. We moved that money in like three seconds and I think it cost 20 or 30 cents.\u201dArrington discussed his longtime friendship with Garlinghouse. \u201cWhen TechCrunch originally sold to AOL, and eventually became part of the Verizon behemoth, Brad was at AOL. He\u2019s the primary person that make that deal happen. He made me wealthy, not as wealthy as him, but wealthy. And it turns out now he\u2019s the fifth richest person in California or something. When Brad first joined Ripple, I went to him for advice and he helped me raise the fund by introducing me to most of our large LPs that hold large amounts of XRP.\u201d Arrington noted that Ripple isn\u2019t an LP and XRP is now only a small part of their portfolio.How much is too much?Garlinghouse tops the Forbes list of crypto billionaires, along with Ripple founders Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb (also the founder of Mt. Gox and Stellar).Ripple has not only been in the news for lawsuits, it\u2019s also been in the news for charity. Ripple investor Ashton Kutcher of Sound Ventures has been speaking on behalf of the company, announcing high profile donations by Ripple to celebrity-backed charities like Madonna\u2019s Raising Malawi campaign and Ellen Degeneres\u2019 Wildlife Fund. On March 26, Ripple made history with the largest single cryptocurrency donation ever, giving away a stunning $29 million in XRP to fund all 35,647 campaigns on DonorsChoose benefiting 16,500 schools and over 28,000 teachers.Butcher questioned whether the XRP infusion was truly philanthropic or merely a desperate attempt to pump excess XRP from the pre-mine into the ecosystem to boost prices. \u201cSo, you come up with a fantastic ability to move money around the planet, but XRP prices are crashing. You\u2019re trying to get the banks to use the actual currency. They\u2019re using the Ripple protocol but they\u2019re not using XRP, are they? You pre-mined all this currency and made a heck of a lot of money. You\u2019re trying to get people to use XRP. \u201d Butcher said.Garlinghouse responded, \u201cSilicon Valley doesn\u2019t do enough to give back. We may be accused of being the devil in terms of how we partnered with the system. I\u2019ve never been accused of being the devil for, you know, being philanthropic and supporting causes that are actually good for the planet.\u201dWhen asked, Arrington said he was never offered free XRP to seed his fund.Butcher then asked Garlinghouse if he paid social media influencers to hype XRP. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the XRP fanboys on Twitter. Are you paying them to shill? Are they just trying to boost the currency?\u201dGarlinghouse replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t pay them.We have a lot of advocates.\u201dArrington added, \u201cOne of the most interesting books I\u2019ve read is Guns, Germs and Steel. We are naturally tribal and form teams. Fanboys for Bitcoin and Fanboys for XRP are saying almost the same thing, they\u2019re actually enthusiasts who have changed their lives and the lives of their family.\u201dButcher continued, \u201cYour criticism of Ethereum is it\u2019s got a big developer network, and you\u2019re trying to boost the amount of developers using XRP with Xpring. You\u2019re trying to boost the market, do you think?Garlinghouse replied, \u201cThe observation I\u2019d make about the Ethereum ecosystem today is that there is a lot of experimentation. There\u2019s not a lot of successfully deployed, solving real problems. There\u2019s one project that I find very interesting called Augur.\u201d Garlinghouse added that he didn\u2019t own any ether, but he did own bitcoin.Regarding Ripple, Garlinghouse said, \u201cRipple has very specifically decided to go very deep in a particular vertical with a clear customer, a clear value proposition in solving a clear problem.\u201d He discussed his Peanut Butter Manifesto which he wrote at Yahoo about companies that spread themselves too thin. \u201cI was meeting with some of the IBM team and they were talking about using a blockchain to track flower freshness. I don\u2019t get it. More often than not a database is going to be more efficient than a blockchain. People use words like blockchain and crypto as catnip for the investors.\u201dPointing at EOS, Arrington said, \u201cI think that these projects that come out and raise a lot of money, in some cases billions of dollars, don\u2019t need that much money, and so I always think that\u2019s odd. If you look at the history of Silicon Valley, there are as far as I know, zero examples of companies that have raised massive amounts of funding before launching a product and being successful.\u201dAbout that air gapGarlinghouse went on to explain why XRP could not be considered a security, \u201cA security is something that represents ownership in a company that gives you rights to dividends, gives you rights to governance. XRP and Ripple are two separate things. We have shareholders, we have investors that include Google Ventures, we have banks that have invested their own share of Ripple the company. When you buy XRP, that doesn\u2019t give you any rights to the profits or ownership of Ripple the company. If Ripple the company shutdown tomorrow, the XRP ledger would continue to operate.\u201dResponding to claims that Ripple maintains a centralized XRP ledger, he said, \u201cPeople are saying the XRP ledger is centralized. It\u2019s factually not true. The XRP ledger is fully decentralized. Ripple the company cannot control the XRP ledger apart from the fact that you control a handful of nodes. We control, I think, 7% of all of the public nodes on the XRP ledger. In contrast, you have (three) miners in China that control north of 50% of the Bitcoin blockchain. By any measure, the Bitcoin blockchain is more centralized that the XRP ledger. People say Ripple can block a transaction. Not true. Can we rollback a transaction? We actually can\u2019t.\u201dAnd the crash\u2026Addressing concerns about the drop in XRP price, Garlinghouse commented, \u201c18 months ago the entire crypto market was worth $20 billion. Today it\u2019s worth $230 billion. In between it hit about $850 billion. If we drew a straight line from 18 months ago to today you\u2019d say it\u2019s been a huge bull market. There have been in the last five or six years multiple crashes that have been effectively reconsolidation. You\u2019re going to see a separation between those that are purely speculative and those that are actually solving real utility problems in the marketplace.\u201dUnintended consequencesArrington shared his thoughts on what will happen if the U.S. continues with their lack of support for the blockchain ecosystem. \u201cI\u2019m Libertarian. I don\u2019t like the government in general. 80\u201390% of our investments are in Asia, Europe and Israel right now, because they\u2019re actually countries where there\u2019s enough regulatory certainty that entrepreneurs feel safe starting their blockchain companies there. Here they don\u2019t. There\u2019s so much regulatory uncertainty. And then add to that the tax burden and the visa burdens of coming here. And then our current federal government\u2019s stance on immigration in general. They\u2019re just saying f*ck it, and they\u2019re staying in Singapore, Israel and Europe, instead of coming here and starting companies. The SEC needs to get their act together. If they had done that with the Internet in 1994, 1995, none of us would be here. We\u2019d all be living in Shanghai or somewhere else. They\u2019re single-handedly wrecking the stage of technology development.\u201dGarlinghouse added, \u201cThere are unequivocally bad actors in the ICO ecosystem. There have been frauds and massive scams. Hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars have been heisted and if anything, I\u2019m surprised the SEC hasn\u2019t been more aggressive going after some of those bad actors. I agree that there is a risk that a lot of this development ends up non-US. The impact on the United States economy for having the Internet that we think of today being very U.S. centric has been very positive for the United States.\u201dThe Future Is CryptoButcher closed by asking Arrington to share his thoughts on the next 10 years in crypto and blockchain.\u201cI\u2019m a little tired of the VC game,\u201d said Arrington. \u201cIt\u2019s all new players in crypto. It\u2019s younger, fresher, more interesting people from all over the world. The VC game has gotten very tiring to me. Crypto moves much more quickly than the tech world, which already moves quickly. But a few months feels like a year or two in crypto. And I actually like that. I think it\u2019s keeping me young. It\u2019s keeping me excited. And it\u2019s just a lot more fun.\u201dOriginally posted in The FinTech Times, September 13, 2018, by me!", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Ripple", "Technology", "Bitcoin"]}, {"title": "Analysis between Dash, Zcash, Ripple (XRP) and BRAVO Pay", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@BRAVOPay/analysis-between-dash-zcash-ripple-xrp-and-bravo-pay-134dc925edf0?source=search_post", "author_name": "BRAVO Pay", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@BRAVOPay", "publish_date": "2018-10-08", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-08", "readtime": "4.03", "claps": 2674, "voters": 59, "content": "Analysis between Dash, Zcash, Ripple (XRP) and BRAVO PayBRAVO PayFollowOct 8, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readWith the emergence of new technologies, many individuals are gearing towards cash-free systems for the sake of convenience and ease. This means that privacy, speed, and security have become the base on which money is rooted.The BRAVO Hybrid Consensus Protocol offers a Hybrid Blockchain solution which fulfils all three of these fundamental requirements without compromising on its key focus: to offer an easy, cash-free payments protocol for P2P payments and enterprises to facilitate everyday payments.In order to fully appreciate the features that BRAVO offers, one can look at other similar cryptocurrency projects to see how the blockchains match up.A detailed comparison can be found in BRAVO\u2019s whitepaper of the differences between BRAVO\u2019s Blockchain application platform interface (API) and that of Ripple, ZCash, and Dash. These tokens, like BRAVO, are also highly focused on privacy and strive to offer quick transactions times.Several fundamental features are explored in order to show how the BRAVO Protocol performs next to the three cryptocurrency companies.Ease of use and consumer app:BRAVO\u2019s first DApp (BRAVO Pay) introduces a user friendly experience that for the first time will allow users to have a similar experience as in our current Fiat version where you find the user either by proximity or via a username or a private 4 digit code (no long keys or long wallet addresses needed). It is a simple experience that will allow adoption at the mainstream level of cryptocurrency (no longer for the tech-savvy people). BRAVO pay app supports instant and private transactions. We eliminated the use of long keys to permit for a simple experience in the front-end thanks to our hybrid blockchain technology. The experience of paying with BVO is instant and allows privacy on demand. The only other company offering a mobile app payment tool for instant payments is Dash, but there are several important differences with BRAVO. With the Dash app, you can have an \u201cinstant send\u201d which is supported by the Masternodes to confirm the transactions preventing the \u201cdouble spent\u201d problem, but their phone wallets cannot support private send.Blockchain Protocol:With regard to the blockchain protocol, both Zcash and Dash are Proof-of-Work (POW) protocols, while XRP uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus protocol, such as BRAVO except that BRAVO is a Hybrid Blockchain that not only uses FBA but also an anonymizing Proof-of-Stake protocol.Transactions per second (TPS):Both Zcash and Dash complete between 23\u201326 successful transactions per second on their public blockchain, while Zcash completes 6 transactions per second using its private blockchain. Ripple and BRAVO complete between 1500\u20131800 successful transactions per second, but unlike XRP, BRAVO has a private blockchain that completes nearly 30x the transactions per second than that of Zcash. BRAVO\u2019s FBA block time is a short 3.5 seconds and PoS block time is 1 minute. This, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 10-minute block time, makes for exceptionally speedy transactions. BRAVO\u2019s confirmation time is even more impressive. XRP user\u2019s face 3.5 seconds before transactions are confirmed, Dash transactions are confirmed within 15 minutes and BRAVO\u2019s FBA transactions take a further 3.5 seconds to be confirmed. That\u2019s a maximum of 7 seconds for a full transaction to take place on the FBA blockchain.Privacy and Compliance with KYC/AML:BRAVO has created a solution that allows users to utilize an option for an anonymous payment, but also the option for a lower fee public payment is they choose. Make no mistake, this process is for the those who prefer to keep their personal details undisclosed day-to-day public transactions. BRAVO creates high priority in vetting their users and places a great sense of priority in remaining KYC/AML complaint at all times. Dash, Zcash and XRP do not use KYC/AML for onboarding users who use their payments mechanism although Dash offers independent businesses to use the AML/KYC features if they choose.Scalability:XRP is a strong competitor to BRAVO as it provides a scalable solution, unlike Dash and Zcash. However, after much analysis it is clear that BRAVO dominates as a solution for peer-to-peer, business-to-business and peer-to-business solution and targets more verticals and markets beyond that of just general payments such as settling bets, tipping, live and instant payments to streamers.BRAVO is the first Hybrid Blockchain of its kind and the only between the four analyzed coins. It is also the only blockchain of the four that will be offering an API for developers to use the Protocol to build applications of the future that require low fees, fast transactions and on-demand anonymity in the transfer of value.The BRAVO Pay app has a successful proof of concept which will also become their first blockchain integrated app deployed on the BRAVO Hybrid Blockchain early next year. This will be sure to migrate all tens of thousands of users to the new app which will have fully enabled crypto payments solutions with the option of a fiat payments too. As a business that is focused on bringing crypto to the mass market, this is a recipe for success after having already captured a piece of the market and to soon introduce a solution of further enhanced features to entice them into the world of blockchain.In general, BRAVO\u2019s blockchain is a unique blend of fast scalable technology with privacy and regulatory compliance. Many coins will fall victim to regulatory backlash due to a lack of compliance, but BRAVO Pay has found the balance between enhanced game-changing features and full compliance throughout all of their business to ensure they reach the goal of bringing crypto payments to the masses.Our ICO is open to Non-U.S. persons only & other restrictions apply \u2014 see disclaimer: http://bvo.trybravo.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Crypto", "ICO", "Btc"]}, {"title": "Cryptocurrency \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin \u2014 Everything You Need to Know in 2017", "post_link": "https://medium.com/cryptolinks/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-litecoin-everything-you-need-to-know-in-2017-28109d927037?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ruzbeh Bacha", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ruzbehb", "publish_date": "2017-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-01", "readtime": "11.4", "claps": 171, "voters": 63, "content": "Cryptocurrency \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin \u2014 Everything You Need to Know in 2017Ruzbeh BachaFollowMay 22, 2017 \u00b7 12 min readWe have come a long way since the days of a barter system. It hasn\u2019t been necessary to have a specific good and trade it for some other specific good for a long time. For most of written history, there were only two types of currency: fiat or commodity. Fiat currencies have been the dominant currency since the 1970s, when the US ended the Bretton Woods system and abandoned the gold standard.Fiat currencies are great because they don\u2019t require physical commodity reserves and countries can control their own money supply. Currencies can be valued constantly against each other in floating exchanges. As for integrity and widespread implementation, governments are generally trustworthy and are a central regulating force that ensures transactions are fair, accurate, and not manipulated.Today, with the advent of cheap computing power and networked systems (i.e., the Internet), there is a new contender to the currency game. The new guy to disrupt the duopoly of currency is the cryptocurrency. These are Bitcoin and its peers that have only become feasible in the last twenty years or so.You can track personalised news for these cryptocurrencies on our award-winning platform CityFALCON here.What Cryptocurrencies are, and their benefitsCryptocurrencies exist only in computers. This shouldn\u2019t scare you, though, because the majority of most fiat currencies also only exist as numbers in a computer system. They require distributed systems to ensure integrity and reliability, and they can be a good alternative to national currencies. They are, in the simplest terms, digital records held by many parties that track how much currency any single wallet holds.Some of the benefits of cryptocurrencies include decentralisation, deregulation, anonymity, increased transaction transparency, and the facilitation of cross-border trade. Cryptocurrencies are not based in any single country or jurisdiction, because the ledgers and servers are spread out over the globe. Since there is no central bank, the system is distributed and therefore not easily manipulated either by large institutions or by governments. This means there is little regulation and more freedom on who spends how much on what and where. This benefit is enhanced by the fact that there is less private information attached to each transaction. There are even cryptocurrencies whose main goal is to provide an untraceable, secure, and anonymous means of payment.Payments are transparent because every transaction can be verified by anyone. This means fraud is more difficult because there are many copies of the transaction record available for anyone to see. Furthermore, everyone knows how much every wallet contains (though real names are not included). The public balances come from the way in which balances are implemented in the technology.As for cross-border trade, since cryptocurrencies are non-national, anyone can pay anyone anywhere without needing to convert currencies. This raises interesting questions on conversion and payments, as owning 1 BTC (Bitcoin\u2019s currency symbol) in France and owning 1 BTC in Thailand are not the same. If converted to a local currency, it means much different buying power in the two host countries.How they workThere is a distributed ledger or a publicly viewable list of transactions. Since they are distributed, there is more than one copy (there are actually a lot of copies). There are \u201cminers\u201d, who are like the keepers of the system.Whenever a transaction is made, the keepers of the system broadcast the transaction to everyone. The transaction is placed in a pool of pending transactions, whose order of addition to the chain is determined by competing miners. Participants choose a transaction and solve a math problem linking it to the last recorded transaction. Whichever miner can solve their problem first gets to add their transaction to the end of the chain, effectively determining a unique order.If two miners finish different blocks at the same time, the blockchain branches. Each node keeps its own copy of the transaction set and works from that. Once the next block is solved, all nodes switch to the transaction set used by the last solve.Since transactions are simply messages with the sender, receiver, and an amount, it is essential that all transactions are signed. This is completed using the sending wallet\u2019s private key, and the signature is unique for each transaction, so it cannot be duplicated. Furthermore, a message cannot be altered or the resulting signature will no longer be valid. Even more, since transactions are lumped together in blocks, if one transaction changes, the hash output of the entire block changes, and hence doesn\u2019t link correctly with the next block \u2014 i.e., it is not possible to modify blocks undetected.Balances are not stored in the system, but they are based on previous transactions (basically add prior transactions A + B + \u2026 to determine if you have enough for transaction 1). This requires that \u201cunspent\u201d transactions be added every time one wants to send money, but it does not require the processing of the entire blockchain (that would be rather inefficient).Where does Cryptocurrency get its valueLike fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. They\u2019re just numbers stored on a system somewhere, much like the way modern digital banking treats national currencies. Fiat currencies then derive their value from the collective faith of a society using them. If A believes B will accept USD, then A will accept USD for whatever they want to trade, too. B will only accept USD if s/he thinks C will also take USD, and from this collective faith, the value of USD arises.Cryptocurrencies are similar. They are only worth as much as everyone deems them to be worth. One advantage for national fiat currencies is that a central authority issues and regulates them, and one can generally trust the government in this regard. Furthermore, governments require that taxes be paid, and they will usually only accept their own currency for this. Hence, to be a citizen of a country, one must deal with the national currency. This is a good basis to simply use the same currency for every transaction within the country.Major Price Gains (and a major adoption event)One major reason for the generally increasing value of cryptocurrencies is more widespread interest. While cryptocurrencies may not be prevalent, they do have a following on the Internet, and many people will ask for cryptocurrencies donations or payments. If the demand for such currencies increases faster than units are added the price will rise.Looking at the charts of the four largest cryptocurrencies after conversion to USD, it looks like there has been a significant increase recently in all four (not all the same scale, as these are the lifetime charts). This is a phenomenon that is clear in 2017.Fears over capital restrictions and government spying may be pushing up the price. A renewed interested in privacy, especially after the Snowden leaks, might be a reason. The increasingly watchful eye of Big Data by both Google et al. and the banks and credit card companies may be a reason. The wider general acceptance is almost certainly a reason.Chart Source: Highcharts.comChart Source: Highcharts.comChart Source: Highcharts.comChart Source: Highcharts.comGovernment Acceptance?This acceptance extends to governments. Most notably, Japan, a market highly accepting of innovative technologies, recognised Bitcoin on April 1st, 2017. It is also set to standardise blockchain technology. This acceptance by the world\u2019s third largest economy is a huge boon to cryptocurrencies. There is a clear uptrend for the four largest cryptocurrencies around the time of recognition. Russia is also attempting to legitimise, as it would help the government crack down on money laundering.Why is cryptocurrencies value always fluctuating against national currenciesIt is important to note that national fiat currencies are valued against other currencies based on the state of the issuer\u2019s economy. If it is expected that many people will want to buy Korean products, there is more demand for KRW. This means each KRW costs more JPY, whether the central bank of Korea does anything or not. Cryptocurrencies are really no different, but they fluctuate much more.Looking at any charts of cryptocurrencies against a national currency (usually the USD, but it doesn\u2019t matter), one can see there are huge fluctuations. Since there is no central authority, there is no one to stabilise cryptocurrencies against national currencies. One of the libertarian goals of many cryptocurrencies is exactly this fact: market forces are the only forces that influence the value.Advocates of a global cryptocurrencies system argue that as it becomes more popular the value should stabilise on its own. The main driver of upside movements so far has been more interest, i.e., more demand. It is somewhat similar to real estate. If someone buys 100 acres in a secluded area, it may not be worth much at first. However, if the area starts to become populated, the original owner can divide the 100 acres, unchanged in physical size, into smaller pieces, each worth as much as the original 100 acres. However, there is an upper limit to the divisions, because people can\u2019t build houses on one one-hundredth of an acre (let\u2019s ignore building up for this example).Cryptocurrencies may appreciate over time, but there is also an upper limit to the number of units that are available in a currency. For example, Bitcoin miners will no longer receive coins for solving the blockchain linking problem around 2140. This is when the supply is expected to hit 21 million BTC, which is the set upper limit. At this point, coins will probably start to fall out of circulation without a replacement.Each cryptocurrency has an associated \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d, or what the entire exchange would trade for in a national currency equivalent. This can be a determinant in which system to use because someone trying to move large amounts wouldn\u2019t be able to trade on a small exchange or currency.Differences between Various CurrenciesNote: the charts in this section reflect MARKET CAPITALIZATION over the last year (as of May 17, 2017). The previous section was prices over the last few years. These are not in exact lockstep because the number of coins (units) increases with time.There are many cryptocurrencies out there. They have different features for different users. This is actually one major problem for widespread adoption \u2014 without a dominant currency, which one should people adopt? Small ones inveigle people with potentially large gains, but big ones have a better chance of acceptance by more people. Being early on a new social network could give you star status later, or you could forever be confined to a quiet corner of the social media space.Here are the four largest ones, each with a market capitalisation over 1B USD.Bitcoin (BTC, MC: ~30B USD) \u2014 by far the largest and most well-known, this is the cryptocurrency that really kicked off the revolution. Its market cap (MC) is around 30B USD, and it has reached 350k transactions per day on busy days. The currency has an upper limit on the number of possible coins (21 million), but you can trade as little as one one-hundred-millionth of a BTC, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it becoming too expensive to do daily transactions.Chart Source: Highcharts.comLitecoin (LTC, MC: ~1.6B USD) \u2014 this cryptocurrency\u2019s main feature is that it is much faster to transact. Since each transaction takes so much calculation, BTC transactions take upwards of 10 minutes to confirm. This is not feasible for paying on-the-go. LTC gets the time down to about 2.5 minutes, though that is still much longer than the seconds it takes for credit cards or cash.Chart Source: Highcharts.comEthereum (ETH, MC: ~8B) \u00ad\u2013 ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, sitting at about 8B USD. ETH was originally designed to be a platform and not really a cryptocurrency. The transaction time is on the order of 10\u201315 seconds for confirmation, which is a huge improvement. ETH are also released every year, so there is no hard upper limit of ETH like with other cryptocurrencies. This means that not all the coins are in the hands of early miners.Chart Source: Highcharts.comRipple (XRP, MC: ~7.2B USD) \u2014 XRP has no public ledger, but instead uses an \u201citerative consensus process\u201d. The result is a much shorter transaction time (a few seconds), and it uses much less computing power. Ripple is its own exchange, and hence there is no fear of an exchange vanishing (like the fiasco that was Mt. Gox).Chart Source: Highcharts.comThere are many more cryptocurrencies, and here I mention a couple with interesting features. This is by no means an extensive list, as there are literally hundreds of CCs. These are just a couple that have interesting features (both I and others (1, 2) think they\u2019re interesting).Monero (XMR, MC: ~420M USD) \u2014 the interesting feature here is that there is a \u201cring\u201d of signatures for enhanced privacy. Fake signatures are mixed in with real ones, so it isn\u2019t possible to tell which account sent which request.Chart Source: Highcharts.comQuarkcoin (QRK, MC: ~2M USD) \u2014 claimed to be a more secure cryptocurrency compared to BTC, with 9 rounds of hashing from 6 different functions. This means there is even less ability for fraudsters to change transaction history. It is also meant for consumer miners, so its maintenance does not require massive server farms. The CC peaked in early 2014 but has since fallen very farChart Source: Highcharts.comPeercoin (PPC, MC: ~50M USD) \u2014 designed for large PPC holders to get even more. Its system to ensure integrity implies those that have a bigger stake are more likely to win the mining competitionChart Source: Highcharts.comDangers to Widespread AdoptionThe greatest barrier to widespread adoption is acceptance. If you can\u2019t use it to buy a coffee at your local shop or a train ticket at the station, no one will use it. The first step in expanding acceptance is for large companies to accept them, and some do. Here is a list, longer than one might expect, of companies that accept at least Bitcoins. Unfortunately, there are not many big names on there. Once your local shops start to accept it, it will become more feasible for the average person to adopt it.Another major problem is fragmentation. Currently, Bitcoin is the largest one, but there are many competitors that take market share. One must be adopted as a standard \u2014 people don\u2019t want to use five different currencies, all fluctuating against each other, in their everyday life. Businesses also don\u2019t want to have to set up all the tech to accept five different currencies and always adjust their prices.It not only exposes businesses to wild fluctuations between customer cash inflow and material buying cash outflow, but sovereign nations will also be open to the fluctuations of the global market without a means to control the money supply in their own economies. This is something hardcore libertarians champion, but the average person is probably not interested in his country losing control of such an important affair as the economy.Technical issues are another issue. Of course, it is possible that a bank\u2019s electronic accounting system fails, but CC systems are very new. Do we really want to risk a potentially catastrophic meltdown of our economy because there was some exploit? At least with fiat currencies, people can still trade physical notes of cash to buy food and water even in a disaster.ConclusionSo, what do we make of cryptocurrencies? They are an interesting technological novelty for now. If they can be completely secured, beyond doubt, and many people start to adopt them, it is entirely possible the future will be transacted in cryptocurrency. At this time, though, they are really only useful as a speculative investment tool for early capital gains or FX traders who think they can guess the direction.You can track personalised financial news for these cryptocurrencies on our award-winning platform CityFALCON here.", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Fintech", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Will Ethereum, Tron & Ripple Pave the Way for a Crypto Spring?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/will-ethereum-tron-ripple-pave-the-way-for-a-crypto-spring-1e7b7ff12425?source=search_post", "author_name": "Faisal Khan", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@khanfk", "publish_date": "2019-02-27", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-31", "readtime": "5.05", "claps": 821, "voters": 59, "content": "Will Ethereum, Tron & Ripple Pave the Way for a Crypto Spring?Upgrades in the former two & Coinbase listing of the latter may provide a boost to the CryptosFaisal KhanFollowFeb 27 \u00b7 6 min readOne thing that you as traders, investors or just someone interested in Cryptos may or may not like is how intertwined the prices of the Alt. coins are with the crypto kingpin Bitcoin. All you need to do is look at the BTC chart & it will more or less tell you the price action in the rest of the digital coins.Having said that there are exceptions sometimes like we saw Ripple diverging from the rest of the lot on the news of it getting listed on the popular U.S based exchange Coinbase. More on that later, let\u2019s talk about two other significant events that are lined up for the popular dApp platforms of Ethereum & Tron \u2014 both of which are the members of the Top Ten Crypto Elite club sitting at Number 2 and Number 9 by market cap respectively.Ethereum (ETH)The much-awaited system-wide upgrade Constantinople & St. Petersburg is finally scheduled to go live during Ethereum\u2019s 7,280,000 mined block sometime on Feb. 28th. The proposed hard fork which was originally planned for mid-January by its team of developers had the deadline pushed forward after a security vulnerability in one of the five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) was found by the smart contract audit firm ChainSecurity.According to the official blog post of Ethereum, the transition could take place a little earlier or later depending on the block times. You can follow the countdown timer or monitor the system-wide network upgrade in real-time. There have been previous upgrades on the Ethereum network as well like Spurious Dragon and Byzantium, however this time it is a bigger deal since the upgrade combo of Constantinople & St. Petersburg is taking place together on the same block.It is easier said than done since the decentralized nature of the blockchain networks demands that consensus be reached among the developers, community members & network clients. Also, the change in the underlying consensus protocol from PoW to PoS is a fundamental shift which requires additional technical upgrades.So far, the upgrade has been relatively non-contentious which is good news for the second most popular blockchain network. Ethereum Miners & Node operators should beware that they risk getting stuck on an incompatible chain if they don\u2019t participate in the upgrade. For my techie friends here are changes that are going to be implemented via the EIP.EIP 145: Bitwise shifting instructions in EVMEIP 1014: Skinny CREATE2EIP 1052: EXTCODEHASH opcodeEIP 1234: Constantinople Difficulty Bomb Delay and Block Reward AdjustmentREMOVING EIP 1283: Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty mapsTRON (TRX)The dApps platform has presented itself as a serious challenger to the hegemony of Ethereum ever since its inception \u2014 improving on the shortcomings of the Ethereum network especially with its high scalability claiming processing speed of 2000 TPS as compared to ETH\u2019s 25 TPS. No wonder Tron CEO, Justin Sun has been an open critic of the Ethereum network \u2014 we will leave \u2018which one is better\u2019 for some other day & stick with the hard forks.Coincidentally, TRX will be undergoing Tron Odyssey 3.5 hard fork the same day (Feb. 28) Ethereum upgrades to its next-gen version. The announcement was made by Sun on his Twitter account. Tron has grown in stature & popularity under the leadership of Sun with his sharp business acumen. However, he has been criticized vehemently by the Ethereum proponents for his public condemnation of Tron\u2019s predecessor & main competitor.Tron made headlines last June with the high-profile acquisition of the P2P file-sharing BitTorrent platform with a claimed subscription base of over 100 million users. The file-sharing company last month decided to issue its own native cryptocurrency called BitTorrent Token (BTT), which will run on the Tron protocol \u2014 TRC 10 token (comparable to the ERC-20 tokens that run on top of ethereum).This follows the announcement of Project Atlas in Aug. 2018. Project Atlas enables users to earn & spend digital coins while sharing files.

The Coinbase blog lists the details of the listing process & the availability of trades for users in detail. Coinbase, which has one of the biggest user-bases for a regulated digital exchange & most synonymous with crypto trading has been on a listing spree recently with the addition of BAT, 0x, USDCoin among others.It had, however, shied away from listing XRP on regulatory concerns previously. Finally, it caved into the demand of its user base & continued adoption and popularity of the cross border remittance currency. XRP immediately jumped 12% as a result (figure above). Although it has retreated to its pre-listing lows with the rest of the Cryptoverse, the so-called \u2018Coinbase effect\u2019 has sprung life in the digital asset.Hard forks have been historically known to cause a spike in volatility \u2014 a twin platform upgrade on the same day could provide an interesting day of price movements in the Cryptos. Speculatively speaking, if the hard forks in both digital assets go ahead without any incident, they should see healthy gains. Listing of Alt. coins on big-name exchanges have had a similar impact \u2014 as we saw in the case of Ripple. Will these three provide the way to a Crypto spring?

The Ripple protocol enables direct and instant value transfer between two parties anywhere in the world with negligible fee.Gateways in the Ripple system issue and facilitate transfer of anything from USD, gold to airmiles and mobile minutes using the Ripple Protocol also known as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP). Validation of transactions in Ripple happens with the help of consensus among the validating nodes unlike mining in Bitcoin. If you\u2019re not familiar with how cryptocurrencies work, we suggest you to first check out our guides on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.HistoryBack in 2004, Ryan Fuger a web developer from Canada, came up with the idea of a peer to peer decentralized monetary system \u2014 RipplePay. The main intent was to create a global financial network without intermediaries like banks involved. Jed McCaleb creator of Mt Gox and now co-founder of Stellar was working on his own currency system where the validation of transactions on the network would happen using consensus among the members unlike the proof of work system in Bitcoin which requires mining. He, along with Chris Larsen now Chairman of Ripple and the richest man in crypto, approached Ryan with an idea of a digital currency and then together formed a new company called OpenCoin.OpenCoin started with the development of the Ripple Transaction Protocol for solving the problems they found in the banking system. They introduced the system of the validating server where trusted nodes on the network could come to consensus and validate transactions on the network. They also introduced XRP, the digital asset native to the Ripple protocol which could be used for instant value transfer anywhere in the world.OpenCoin changed its name to Ripple Labs in 2013 and open sourced the protocol code under the ISC license. XRP became the second largest cryptocurrency overtaking Litecoin in 2014. Over this period Ripple Labs received funding from various VC firms and banks, including Google Ventures and Santander. The name was changed once again and this time it was changed from Ripple Labs to Ripple. Over the years, Ripple has partnered with more than 100 banks and payment services companies. XRP now is one of the most liquid assets with easy buying/selling access worldwide.How is Ripple different from Bitcoin?Bitcoin vs RippleBitcoin aims to be the global decentralized digital currency while Ripple aims to be the payment system that disrupts networks like SWIFT. There are more differences than similarities.DistributionBitcoin is distributed to the miners that solve the mathematical puzzle and include transactions in a block every ten minutes. There can only be 21 million Bitcoins ever. XRP distribution is different. When XRP was introduced, 100 billion XRP units were created. While some of the supply was distributed early among the founders and Ripple, most of it is now held in an Escrow.XRP SupplyFaster and CheaperXRP is very fast compared to other cryptocurrencies. Your transaction on Ripple will go through in less than 4 seconds. Ripple claims to process more than 1500 transactions per second on its network.Ripple on TwitterSuch fast transactions make it attractive for people looking for micropayments and remittance solutions. The minimum transaction fee is just 0.00001 XRP.Validation and VerificationBitcoin is a proof-of-work system. Miners who want to participate in mining have to provide extensive hardware and software resources at the networks disposal. Ripple works differently. In order to include transactions into the ledger, all the validators in the network need to reach a specific quorum in order to accept a transaction and add it to the XRP Ledger. In order to maintain security and reliability of the network, Ripple uses trusted validator nodes. These nodes are diversified all around the world so that any risks with single point of failure can be mitigated.XRP, Ripple, RippleNet etc, what\u2019s the difference?People are sometimes confused about the relationship between these entities and how the adoption of Ripple Protocol affects the demand for XRP the token. Here\u2019s an easy breakdown of how these are interconnected:Ripple: This is a private company that looks after the development of the Ripple Protocol and also holds a significant share of XRP. Ripple provides solutions to banks and payment companies.XRP Ledger: This is the public ledger that is used to transact in different currencies. Users can issue currencies, commodities or any other assets and use it for value transfer anywhere in the world using this ledger.XRP: XRP is the digital asset native to the above mentioned XRP Ledger. XRP serves the purpose of being a medium of exchange and anti-spam measure for the ledger. XRP is also needed for using some advanced features on XRP like payment channels and escrow services.RippleNet: This is a private implementation of Interledger Protocol (IPL) by Ripple which provides it as a service to its partners. RippleNet consists of solutions like xCurrent, xRapid, xVia.It has to noted that only one of these solutions, xRapid, requires an absolute necessity to use XRP. xVia and xCurrent doesn\u2019t need XRP to work efficiently.PriceXRP for most of its existence has spent time below $1. It\u2019s in 2017, when it first hit parity with a dollar. Following that, it went into a parabolic trajectory reaching all time highs of $4 on some exchanges.XRP has always maintained its position in the top 10 on coinmarketcap since 2013. The first major spike we saw in 2013 was during the end of the year where it went from $0.01 to $0.05 rising more than 400% in two weeks making it reach just shy of $500 million market cap.2013\u20132014It reached an all time high market cap of $800 million for the first time in January 2015. The price for the next two years kept bouncing between $0.005 and $0.01.It was in 2017, when with more partnerships and investment announcements, the price of XRP took a huge surge. It went more up than 4000%, starting at < $1 billion market cap and < $0.001 a unit in March 2017 to $0.4 at all time highs and $15 billion in market cap by the end of May.In the same year it broke new records. In the first week of December 2017, it crossed $1 for the first and went ahead to go upto $4 the next week making it much more valuable than Ethereum for few days in terms of market cap reaching $120 billion at its peak. XRP at the time of writing trades at Rs 75 on Zebpay.2017FutureUAE Exchange recently partnered with Ripple to use one of its RippleNet solutions for cross border payments as they slowly start to come out of beta. Even giant banks and payment companies like Santander, American Express, Barclays, HSBC and even India\u2019s Axis Bank, Yes Bank have teamed up with Ripple. The company seems to be doing great but the topic of actual usage of XRP between these partners is doubtful and has faced strong criticism. That being said, how Ripple grows and is used in day to day life is yet to be seen. To learn more about Ripple, visit the official site.

Innovators and entrepreneurs are constantly introducing new cryptocurrencies, each promising new and varying characteristics to attract investors and users. Global official sector reaction to cryptocurrencies varies as the decentralized technology does not fit easily into existing regulatory definitions and structures. This sector will likely continue to be cautious as it monitors the risks to financial integrity, consumer protection, financial stability, tax evasion and treatment, and monetary policy. Leaders in regulation, like Japan, are likely to set the standard for the rest of the world in a scenario where the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies requires a cohesive and collaborative effort.The cryptocurrency world is an unstable and volatile place, constantly shift between bear market and bull market periods. Some investors are taking advantages of this and others not so much. Reaching a stable value cryptocurrency has long been the target of many projects that aim to take crypto a step beyond just a middle of exchange and into the land of a store of value. If I put $10.000 into Bitcoin, ETH (Ethereum) or XRP (ripple) today, nobody can be guaranteed what it will be worth tomorrow which puts off businesses and everyday users that want to use crypto beyond just a speculative investment as a method to accept payments or pay salaries. Mass adoption is the ultimate aim for cryptocurrencies, but a stable cryptocurrency is needed in order to achieve that. Cryptocurrencies are reacting more like stocks and less like currency with their incredible volatility. They give more incitements to trade with them, not to pay with them. The concept of making a stable cryptocurrency is complicated. Many have tried to create such a coin and failed. In time the crypto markets will get well founded, leading to a more stable nature of the top cryptocurrencies. The crypto markets are becoming increasingly more competitive, because they are some of the easiest to trade on.The justification for the big fluctuation of cryptocurrency prices is the supply and demand. The supply is more or less fixed but the demand is always changing due to people\u2019s behavior and speculation. A normal currency can have a broad use, it can store value and be a unit of exchange. You can\u2019t have a currency that isn\u2019t backed by value. Fiat currencies are collateralized by assets and gold. If they weren\u2019t, they would depreciate fast. Though most banks are printing money at some rate, the US dollar is the only currency that can be printed without limit from the US central bank. But the problem with printing infinite amounts of money is that they will depreciate, without being backed by value. The US dollar is experiencing something like this. Compared to the stable Euro, the US dollar is losing value at an alarming rate. A solution for this problem is currently being talked about and is planned for the future. But a solution for the stability of cryptocurrencies is something else.With all of the talk of cryptocurrencies in today\u2019s news, there are necessarily always going to be questions raised about \u201cwhy does this have any value?\u201d Even at face value, it\u2019s definitely not the case when talking about cryptocurrencies as a movement generally, but even on top of that, there are certain cryptocurrencies that carry a lot more weight to them \u2014 and that\u2019s where the INGOT Coin system comes into play.Though there is plenty of fair skepticism of any new asset class in the expanding world of FinTech and cryptocurrencies, there are also certain coins that stick out a lot more than others. While plenty of coins and tokens rely mainly on public perception of value or speculation about the potential for value in the future, the INGOT family of coins is the first to come to the market to offer real, tangible value for the cryptocurrency.INGOT Coin will create a complete solution by integrating 6 core ecosystem components and providing a one-stop-shop for the digital asset, traditional asset and currency markets to solve all the above-mentioned challenges, thus, creating a link between the crypto market and the traditional market. The IC Ecosystem will establish 6 different components to work hand in hand under one umbrella, providing all community members the chance to capitalize on upcoming opportunities in all markets. The Ecosystem\u2019s components, as shown below, are the IC Wallet, IC Exchange, IC Brokerage, IC Digital Bank, IC Certifier and IC ICO Accelerator.INGOT Coin will provide a platform that meets the needs of beginner as well as advanced traders to trade with minimal initial capital. IC will also provide its own cryptocurrency, which will be available on different exchanges for all investors and market participants to purchase. IC will show no bias towards any market participant and will provide fair and equal opportunities to all participants regardless of size of trade, type of order or initial capital.To ensure no means for market manipulation and leakage of unethical or illegal money in the Ecosystem, the KYC and AML policies must suffice and exceed the needs of all parties, whether its regulators, banks, brokers or exchanges. The KYC and AML compliance may seem strict to some investors; however, this is a necessary procedure to ensure the safety of the Ecosystem and all stakeholders. This is done to make the Ecosystem trustworthy, secure, transparent and compliant; consequently, filling the Ecosystem\u2019s singular KYC allows participants to open one account in the IC Digital Bank, the IC Exchange, the IC Brokerage, and the IC wallet simultaneously to trade crypto, fiat, and traditional instruments hereon after.Website: https://www.ingotcoin.io/Whitepaper: https://www.ingotcoin.io/documents/en/white-paper.pdfFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ICOINGOT/twitter: https://twitter.com/ICOINGOTTelegram: https://t.me/INGOTCoin", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "ICO", "Tech", "Technology", "Women In Tech"]}, {"title": "Kavanaugh\u2019s Fate Will Have a Massive Ripple Effect", "post_link": "https://medium.com/the-atlantic/kavanaughs-fate-will-have-a-massive-ripple-effect-94d622ea6d47?source=search_post", "author_name": "David A.

We got Material Design UI backported to API7. What\u2019s not to love?Actually, there is. The only one thing I find it\u2019s incredibly hard to accomplish. Yes, that\u2019s right, styling the button! I hate it when I have to create a StateListDrawable for every color I want and I have to separate the drawable-v21 ripple and the plain color one. Ugh.After a lot of trial and error, stackoverflow, blog post and the official documentation, I finally found the simple solution for it.This solution is based on AppCompat version 25.1.0, tested on API25, API16 emulators and a Google Pixel running Nougat 7.1.1.Change the background color using android:backgroundTint<Button    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"    android:backgroundTint=\"@color/yellow\"    android:text=\"Yellow Tint Button\" />By using the android:backgroundTint, your button gets the color and the ripple effect. Unfortunately, this works only on API21+.On previous version of AppCompat (not sure which)\u00a0, app:backgrountTint works fine on all API levels, you get a ripple on post-API21 and a StateListDrawable on pre-API21. Now if you try to use app:backgroundTint\u00a0, the linter will complain and you don\u2019t get a StateListDrawable on pre-API21. I don\u2019t know if this is a bug or intentional but since the linter complains, I\u2019m not comfortable using app:backgrountTint anymore.2. Change the background color using android:themeAnother option is using theme. You can specified <item name=\u201dcolorButtonNormal\u201d>@color/yellow</item> in your AppTheme and every button in your app gets the same color with a ripple effect on post-API21 and a StateListDrawable on pre-API21.<!-- styles.xml --><style name=\"AppTheme.YellowButton\">    <item name=\"colorButtonNormal\">@color/yellow</item></style><!-- layout.xml --><Button    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"    android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme.YellowButton\"    android:text=\"Yellow Tint Button\" />Now we want to change a color of one particular button. What we can do is creating a new theme (preferably extended from AppTheme) and apply it to a single button. That\u2019s it, this works on all API levels.3. Ripple color<!-- styles.xml --><style name=\"AppTheme.GreenRipple\">    <item name=\"colorControlHighlight\">@color/green</item></style><!-- layout.xml --><Button    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"    android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme.GreenRipple\"    android:text=\"Green Ripple Button\" /><FrameLayout    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"    android:background=\"?selectableItemBackground\"    android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme.GreenRipple\" />This works the same way colorButtonNormal does but with colorControlHighlight the ripple color got changed.You can also apply the theme and the android:background=\u201d?selectableItemBackground\u201d (or android:foreground) to any view and get the ripple effect.On pre-API21 Button you get a StateListDrawable with a state pressed set to colorControlHighlight you specified.Of course you can specify colorButtonNormal and colorControlHighlight together in a theme to get something like a green ripple on a yellow button.4. Lowercase button textIn case your designers decided they don\u2019t want an all caps text on a button.<Button    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"    android:text=\"textAllCaps=false\"    android:textAllCaps=\"false\" />5. FloatingActionButton<android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"    android:layout_gravity=\"bottom|end\"    android:layout_margin=\"16dp\"    app:backgroundTint=\"@color/red\"    app:rippleColor=\"@color/green\"    app:srcCompat=\"@android:drawable/ic_dialog_email\" />Things behave differently for FAB, you can simply use app:backgroundTint and app:rippleColor (special thanks to Wanchuda Sukarrom)They work perfectly on all API levels. But if somehow they don\u2019t, this will.<!-- styles.xml --><style name=\"AppTheme.RedFabGreenRipple\">    <item name=\"colorAccent\">@color/red</item>    <item name=\"colorControlHighlight\">@color/green</item></style><android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"    android:layout_gravity=\"bottom|end\"    android:layout_margin=\"16dp\"    android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme.RedFabGreenRipple\"    app:srcCompat=\"@android:drawable/ic_dialog_email\" />That\u2019s it for today, guys.

ShutterstockAs you may remember on December 22nd, 2017 just before X-mas, Bitcoin fell from above $17000 to $12500. Not to mention we were used to its volatility by then, it was still a 1400% for the year.What happend next, showed the decentralized globalization that cryptocurrencies represent. Ripples in one part of the world, influences the whole (no pun intended).As cryptocurrencies were plummeting, something extraordinary happend to Ripple due to South Korea and Japan. Ripple overtook Ethereum to become the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. Today it stands at $78 Bn. as opposed to Ethereum behind at $73 Bn.East Asia Gives Ripple a LiftRipple bills itself as the:One Frictionless Experience To Send Money GloballyHow is that for a tag-line? As Millennials globally are storing an increasing amount of their investments in late 2017 in crypto stores of value that may have high ROI, Ripple has shown itself to be a big winner.When three of Japan\u2019s big credit card companies signed up to use Ripple\u2019s technology, it was simply more evidence of Japan leading the way in BTC and XRP adoption. Like Bitcoin futures, this is a FOMO wave, where many other countries will have to follow.The Market Cap of Cryptocurrencies is SkyrocketingRipple\u2019s XRP token climbed to above $2 for the first time. That\u2019s an increase YOY of more than 20,000% in 2017. Thought of another way, if you didn\u2019t think cryptocurrencies were for real \u2014 consider this: Ripple\u2019s current market value would put it among the world\u2019s 30 biggest banks, ahead of the likes of UK\u2019s Lloyds Banking Group or Japan\u2019s Mizuho Financial Group.The market cap of crypto assets and currencies may even be the beginning of a change in the financial order of how we store, invest and exchange our funds. Witness the rise in 2017 of Coinbase\u2019s app. Cryptocurrencies have broken into the mainstream, and banks will have a hard time competing against cryptocurrency exchanges in many respects in the not-so-distant future.If you think of how blockchain scales before 2020, you must consider how major institutions adopt cryptocurrencies. Ripple Labs is already five years old, working hard to sign up legacy financial orgs to build one seamless payment network ecosystem on the blockchain. When in mid 2018, the blockchain scales, who do you suppose will have a competitive advantage with B2B use cases in what once felt like a fledgling industry?Sure 2017 has been a stunning year for several altcoins: bitcoin (1,500%), litecoin (5,000%), or ethereum (8,000%). But who has the scope to bridge the gap between mainstream finance and the new financial world? It\u2019s Ripple.If the Bitcoin ponzi scheme is fueling consumer interest and Ethereum is fueling the smart contract era of the blockchain, Ripple certainly has a lot of potential as well.In early 2018, I\u2019d wager Ripple, Cardano and Stellar all scan scale very well. In terms of the quality of ICOs we are also witnessing more innovative projects such as SingularityNET, Filecoin \u2014 Blockchain data storage network which raised $257 million, and Kik\u2019s Kin Token. This means as cryptocurrency, blockchain and smart contracts become more mainstream, so too will the quality of ICOs we will bear witness to.This isn\u2019t just Crypto futures we are talking about, this means that to keep up with innovation, how we fund our startups might completely change as Venture Capital is investing less and less early startup funds that\u2019s crippling innovation in North America. This is especially true when we compare the pace of innovation, R&D funding and new unicorns in China.2018 is the Year of how Blockchain ScalesForget Bitcoin reaching 20,000 for a moment, to the future of blockchain, Ripple hitting 2$ is much much more relevant.This is because 2018 is all about how the blockchain scales, not just in terms of application but in terms of speed of transaction per second. The blockchain platform wars between Ethereum, NEO and Cardano is just getting started.You cannot just anticipate the future, you have to build it. You have to hit tight deadlines to keep up, and as the rest of cryptocurrencies catches up with Bitcoin; we will witness the blockchain revolution and we still don\u2019t fully imagine all that it will entail.The Best Use-Case of Blockchain is SpeedRipple\u2019s cross-border payments system is electronic record-keeping system on the blockchain, that is, instantaneous transactions. As it\u2019s a low cost between countries and currencies; it\u2019s a force for globalization and decentralization that few can predict the precise outcome if it wins. If the American dollar is the gold standard of value pre 2020, what will be that same standard post 2020? The entire global economy is changing, and the next recession may be a proving ground.If it takes legacy banks between 2 to 5 days to transfer fees across borders, with red tape and added fees and it takes Ripple a matter of seconds, who do you suppose will win?In a world that\u2019s going cashless (China is already there), we see WeChat Pay, Walmart Pay, Apple Pay, Amazon Pay and Alipay all gaining traction. Paypal is still around and Stripe is growing fast, the future of payments is getting seriously interesting.The winner of payment ubiquity is likely to transform banking, forever.Cross border payment solutions and peer-to-peer solutions are transforming the way we think of transactions and avoiding expensive bank fees. Transferwise, Venmo, Zelle and Ripple along with many others, will continue to change how we think of P2P and CBP.There\u2019s zero chance ethical consumer Millennials will just keep trusting banks ahead of all of these more convenient and faster alternatives. And, it should terrify legacy financial institutions.The Key Use Case of the Blockchain is the Intersection with AIAs Ethereum seeks in 2018 to move in the direction of becoming a decentralized world computer that replaces server farms, the sweetspot is the intersection of the blockchain and AI.The future of the blockchain then, has become so much more than just transactions or cryptocurrencies. In that decentralized world computer, the future of consensus and collective decision making, might mark the most radical political innovation since many thousands of years.There\u2019s no hiding that Government, politicians, the media networks, banks and many other domains could all seriously use an overhaul. Blockchain mediated by smart contracts and AI could be the answer.The idea of physical banks, just like corruptible politicians, will soon become obsolete. It\u2019s ironic maybe that it will take advances in AI, for us to implement the next levels of social justice, equality and improved well-being for all in a blockchain society. Ripple will play its part, and as cryptocurrencies scale in 2018 at faster frequencies per second, we might see suddenly the end of many legacy systems in favor of blockchain solutions and iteratives. Consider the classical example:Bitcoin is processing ~7 transactions / secondEthereum is processing ~15 transactions / secondPaypal is processing ~200 transactions / secondVisa is processing ~2,000 transactions / second but has the capacity to process 56,000 transactions / secondAs the tech and consumption adoption continues in 2018, the Crypto Singularity will start to have more widespread B2B and B2C implications.Correct me if I\u2019m wrong?If Ripple is a metaphor for blockchain transactions, 2018 might be its year.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ripple", "Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain", "Payments"]}, {"title": "HOW TO: create the ripple effect from Material Design", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@jh3y/how-to-create-the-ripple-effect-from-google-material-design-c6f993e1d39?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jhey Tompkins", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jh3y", "publish_date": "2015-06-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-15", "readtime": "3.04", "claps": 353, "voters": 49, "content": "Photo by Julian B\u00f6ck on UnsplashHOW TO: create the ripple effect from Material DesignJhey TompkinsFollowJun 16, 2015 \u00b7 4 min readI was reading through the Material Design spec today and thought \u201chow would I create that ripple type effect for user interaction from scratch?\u201dFor those in camp TL;DR here\u2019s some code and a demo!What\u2019s Material Design?It\u2019s a new design spec from Google and it\u2019s pretty nice IMO.For those not in the mood for videos check out google.com/design/spec/material-designThe ripple effect\u201cWhere\u2019s the ripple effect?\u201d you might ask.Google has specified a nice section regarding responsive interaction with particular concern to user input. That can been seen here. Note the nice demo animations.Enough already, let\u2019s make it!DOMI\u2019ve opted to implement the effect we are aiming for with a \u201cripple\u201d attribute. The demo will use buttons.<button ripple>Interact with me</button>Thinking about the effect. We need some form of container for our ripples.<button ripple>  Interact with me  <div class=\"ripple--container\"></div></button>Each ripple will be a span element within the container.We could do this with CSS pseudo elements but the effect won\u2019t be as anticipated as we can only use one instance of :before/:after at a time.The solution we are going to use is that on mousedown the ripple effect will fire from the point where our user clicks within a button. This involves creating a span whose default styling will animate the ripple.Imagine a user spam clicks our button, the effect would be similar to<button ripple>  Interact with me  <div class=\"ripple--container\">    <span style=\"top: 5px; left: 20px;\"></span>    <span style=\"top: 5px; left: 20px;\"></span>    <span style=\"top: 5px; left: 20px;\"></span>    <span style=\"top: 5px; left: 20px;\"></span>  </div></button>JSThink what we need to do with our script.Add the ripple container to our buttons.Upon mousedown, add spans with the correct positioning to that container.Debounce the mouseup event to allow our ripple effect to fully animate before cleaning out all the span tags from our buttons.(Note; I\u2019ve implemented a simple debounce function for the code which I won\u2019t cover here but you could use something like lodash for this. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with debouncing a function call, you can check out some info here.)var ripples = document.querySelectorAll(\u2018[ripple]\u2019),  rippleContainer,  ripple;for (i = 0, len = ripples.length; i < len; i++) {  ripple                    = ripples[i];  rippleContainer           = document.createElement('div');  rippleContainer.className = 'ripple--container';  ripple.addEventListener('mousedown', addRipple);  ripple.addEventListener('mouseup'  , debounce(cleanUp, 2000));  ripple.rippleContainer    = rippleContainer;  ripple.appendChild(rippleContainer);}We iterate over our buttons and add the ripple container to each, binding our mousedown/mouseup events.addRipple = function(e) {  var ripple = this,    size     = ripple.offsetWidth,    pos      = ripple.getBoundingClientRect(),    rippler  = document.createElement('span'),    x        = e.pageX - pos.left - (size / 2),    y        = e.pageY - pos.top  - (size / 2),    style    = 'top:' + y + 'px; left:' + x + 'px; height: '              + size + 'px; width: ' + size + 'px;';  ripple.rippleContainer.appendChild(rippler);  rippler.setAttribute(\u2018style\u2019, style);};Our addRipple function grabs the element position and uses this in conjunction with the click coordinates to calculate the new span positioning within the button.For example, if a user clicked in the middle of a 100 by 100px button, the span positioning would be 50px both top and left.cleanUp = function() {  var container = this.rippleContainer;  while (this.rippleContainer.firstChild) {    container.removeChild(container.firstChild);  }};The cleanUp function will clear out the span elements once the last ripple animation has finished. This is ensured via the use of a debounce.CSSThe styling is relatively simple. We just need to ensure that our container and button will contain our animated rippling span elements and that our spans produce the correct ripple effect.[ripple] { position: relative; overflow: hidden;}[ripple] .ripple--container { position: absolute; top     : 0; right   : 0; bottom  : 0; left    : 0;}[ripple] .ripple--container span { transform       : scale(0); border-radius   : 100%; position        : absolute; opacity         : 0.75; background-color: #fff; animation       : ripple 1000ms;}@keyframes ripple { to {   opacity  : 0;   transform: scale(2); }}Span elements will start off at a scale size of 0 and the animation will scale them up to double their size.To concludeVisual feedback for users when they interact with your applications can be effective.We\u2019ve had a look at a solution for creating the ripple effect for responsive user input feedback.For some, including myself, it\u2019s easier to see some code in action, so feel free to check out a demo:As always, any questions or suggestions, please feel free to leave a response or tweet me \ud83d\udc26!", "responses": 4, "tags": ["JavaScript", "Front End Development", "Web Development", "UI", "CSS"]}, {"title": "Highest Trader Kaun: XRP Tonight", "post_link": "https://medium.com/wazirx/highest-trader-kaun-xrp-tonight-5894d4c2306f?source=search_post", "author_name": "WazirX Bitcoin Exchange", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@wazirx", "publish_date": "2018-04-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-15", "readtime": "1.17", "claps": 575, "voters": 43, "content": "Highest Trader Kaun: XRP TonightWazirX Bitcoin ExchangeFollowApr 13, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readNamaste Tribe!

SpencerFollowMar 6, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readFrom Korea to Coinbase, Ripple appears to be in good shape in 2018.What a day, first Amazon announced it was teaming up with Wall Street banks to formalize an Amazon branded checking account type program for young people. Meanwhile PayPal filed for a patent related to Bitcoin.The company\u2019s patent filing was for an \u201cexpedited virtual currency transaction system\u201d. PayPal is definately eyeing a way to boost the speed of cryptocurrency payments; with speculation even the likes of Facebook might enter the cryptocurrency realm. Coinbase has seen customer complaints more than double in January, as its number of users surged in December 2017.Bitcoin\u2019s rebound from an ugly start to 2018 is up to its highest point in a while at $11,677.80 but it\u2019s Ripple that is truly surging of late up again over $1.04.Coinbase Will Likely Start Supporting RippleRumours that Coinbase will start to support Ripple have added to the fuel of speculation around it\u2019s progress. South Korean banks have okayed Ripple as it enters the mainstream already there after reports of successful tests of Ripple remittance.The price of the third-largest cryptocurrency Ripple, was up by total value is up 16 percent based on the Coinbase rumor.Cross Border Payments set to be DisruptedIt\u2019s safe to say that major U.S. exchange could be next on the list to add support for XRP trading. We know that in terms of order of magnitude, the dollars transferred in the cross-border payment market unsurprisingly, dwarfs the value of every market in existence. This means of course that Ripple could integrate into the mainstream banking infrastrucutre the easiest of any cryptocurrency since the value proposition in the real-world is so high.As recently as the end of 2015, balances tied up globally in nostro accounts exceeded $27 trillion. As the world shifts from wealth stranded in the fossil fuel economy and moves to the green tech economy, that will represent a major shift of funds. In that sense, Ripple could have a very concrete future.The traditional cross-border payment systems was always going to be one of the ways that distributed ledger technology as going to disrupt, enter blockchain solutions.There are over 39 Billion XRP coins already in circulation so it makes perfect sense for Coinbase to start to integrate with them. Stellar and Ripple are hot in 2018, and the price is right. It\u2019s market cap is now about $41.05 billion. So far Coinbase offers trading for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ether, so by adding XRP, it could enable a new outlet for retail trading.Coinbase is the leading U.S. marketplace for buying and selling major digital currencies, though this could change as the cryptocurrency markets and apps are still very nascent.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Ripple", "Business"]}, {"title": "Ripple Effects, No, and Chips On Shoulders\u2026", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/ripple-effects-no-and-chips-on-shoulders-a4037b683f81?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Cutler", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@johnpcutler", "publish_date": "2018-07-25", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-27", "readtime": "3.15", "claps": 233, "voters": 42, "content": "Ripple Effects, No, and Chips On Shoulders\u2026John CutlerFollowJul 25, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readA little narrative\u2026.I\u2019m not sure the C-suite truly understand how their decisions impact the team! It\u2019s easy to ask for that in a conference room\u2026but someone will need to DO the work. The just don\u2019t stop to think about the blast radius for their decisions.Interesting. Did someone push back and explain the impact on the team?Not really. We did hint at it though, but they kept pushing and we retreated. First, it would take a while to explain. Second, by opening that door, you open the door to tons of micromanagement. I\u2019d have to answer \u201cso what is X working on\u201d for every member of the team. Or we\u2019ll have to go line by line and give a wishy washy estimate on every line-item.That all makes sense. So it sounds like you just want to say \u201cnot now\u201d, and for that to be taken on face value. You want leadership to just trust you?Sure. I mean who doesn\u2019t want to be trusted? I just think they\u2019re not aware of how much we actually have on our plate at the moment. And that what they\u2019re asking for isn\u2019t as simple as they think.Why don\u2019t they know what you have on your plate? I\u2019m assuming the team isn\u2019t slacking, right?We\u2019ve got a TON on our plate. And I\u2019ll be honest, it isn\u2019t moving all that quickly. Part of the reason we have a ton on our plate, is that we keep saying yes to this stuff. There\u2019s a ton of support needed for legacy decisions. And the slower we go, the more time they have to come up with new ideas. Honestly, I somehow feel it is not in my best interest to say no\u2026we have a culture of being proactive here.Is anyone slacking?No. Not at all. I mean\u2026well, ok, I have doubts about this one team, and we did have this embarrassing misstep\u2026but overall\u2026OK. And about the complexity? Why would they assume it is simple?Ugh. When we bring up the complexity, we have to bring up all of the tech debt we\u2019re currently managing. And the complexity of the current org structure\u2026all of these handoffs. They\u2019re tired of hearing about it. I mean on some level it SHOULD be simpler, but not nearly as simple as they think. Honestly, the last time they did something similar was like 20 years ago. The world has changed. They just don\u2019t get it\u2026BUT, there\u2019s an ounce of truth in what they\u2019re saying.Backing up I\u2019m hearing a couple things. I\u2019m hearing that you should probably say No, but that saying No doesn\u2019t feel like an option. You\u2019ve dropped hints, and they aren\u2019t biting. Leadership has some cause to ask questions, but they\u2019re also somewhat complicit in the problem. You\u2019re eager to please and don\u2019t want to be pegged as obstructionist. It sounds like a wicked loop of sorts.Who will break the cycle? Someone should break the cycle, right? As long as this persists, things will just get worse and trust and confidence will degrade further.Hmmm. I see what you mean. Someone needs to take the high road it sounds like. And swallow their pride. I guess I could do that?At the moment they have absolutely no sense of the business impact of their decisions. I\u2019d say that as a first step you need to establish some flow in the system, even if that means putting some items on hold. And then lower utilization rates such that emerging opportunities like this can be addressed with minimal disruption.But I mean that will require us to be way more transparent. And tell stakeholders that their work in on hold. I\u2019m worried they will micromanage everything. They\u2019ll think we are crazy!You have to start. You have to take the high road. They don\u2019t know how this works. You do. You need to show the way. You need to ask them to take a risk on you, and then\u200a\u2014 in return\u200a\u2014 show them some positive results. I know having the burden of proof SUCKS. It probably seems unfair.It does. It just feels like I should be trusted to do what I am trained to do\u2026Stepping back, have your explained, for example, how much all those legacy product decisions cost to maintain? How do these interruptions impact throughput capacity? How have cycle times suffered as debt increased? How is high WIP impacting the team?Not really\u2026So now is a good time to start.

I\u2019ve always been a loner and that could be attributed to the times I spent in my room as a child \u2014 finding ways to entertain myself. The first words I shared came in the form of poetry \u2014 even before I understood the stylings.The sublet I\u2019ve been inhabiting for about a year \u2014 suddenly became too small this past week \u2014 when I was up every night \u2014 battling a sinus congestion. We\u2019ve battled the symptoms of very bad colds \u2014 that leave us restless for any level of relief. This time my nostrils were closing in on me with the audacity of something much more potent and deadly.Around 11:49 pm on a Thursday night \u2014 I began to perspire with urgency as the panic attack of labored breathing and sporadic dizziness tossed me out of bed and into the arms of nothing but the air that I couldn\u2019t breathe.As I paced around the tiny studio in the dark \u2014 I started imagining a scenario that would put me near someone who lives for the moments of distress that call for that tender loving care. For the first time in like forever \u2014 I felt truly rejected and vulnerable to the inconsistencies of being conveniently single \u2014 until it\u2019s no longer ideal.The breathing exercise didn\u2019t work and I was back at my bedside searching for my phone. I found it on the floor and picked it up as I turned on the light and noticed that it was way past midnight. The silence was deafening as my beating heart provided the soundtrack to my impending doom.What if I died here \u2014 all alone \u2014 in my tank top and roomy underwear \u2014 with my eyes wide open in disbelief and my cold skin \u2014 damp with the sweat that I worked up for nothing?We spend every waking hour keeping ourselves occupied with the tools that are tasked with that exact mission \u2014 and when push comes to shove \u2014 and we\u2019re faced with the reality of our common existence \u2014 there\u2019s a deep sadness that erupts at the prospect of suffering alone.I survived the long and weary night with the growing suspicion that I was either suffering the effects of a mold-infested compartment \u2014 or my nostrils were chronically dried out from the over-indulgence of a favorite habit.Either way \u2014 I needed to get out.I found the exit via my one of my oldest friends who looks twenty-five but is actually much older. She got the call and readily answered \u2014 and so off I went.Los Angeles isn\u2019t New York City.You can\u2019t spontaneously hop on a train and end up where you need to be in record time. But, I managed to get the bus to appear just when I needed it the most \u2014 and the ride was a haze of stuffiness and the triumph of keeping my eyes open long enough to spot my stop at the bottom of the hill.When the door swung open \u2014 the relief of familiarity overcame me as I stumbled in and plopped on the couch with no words and a face featuring a thousand words. Her adorable grandson \u2014 who was already used to me was in the bedroom \u2014 gaming.The peace of not being alone in a time of confusion borne from a crisis that was unfolding into unknown territory was both comforting and loving.Some people turn to social media for the attention of strangers that can possibly relate to the current storm that doesn\u2019t seem to be passing by \u2014 regardless of time limits. I could\u2019ve been sprawled out on my couch \u2014 heaving from the dry air \u2014 and posting threads of how and why I was still active \u2014 at an ungodly hour.Instead, I chose to be around the support system of a a dear friend who made me feel like I wasn\u2019t the loneliest girl in The Valley.The next day \u2014 brought new adventures \u2014 as my physical calamity was still very much in effect \u2014 but not as stifling as it would\u2019ve been if I were trudging along with no witnesses.We decided to head out to the J. Paul Getty Museum \u2014 a gorgeously erected haven that caters to anyone with enough time and energy to spare. It\u2019s an impressive spread that has enough charm to envelop the attention of amazingly hyper eight-year-olds.The three of us entered the tram and watched the traces of our movements against the picturesque backdrop. Once we disembarked it was straight to the business of mid-afternoon exploration under the tutelage of a kid that reminded me so much of who I was when our ages matched.As with most young boys \u2014 he wanted to stay outside \u2014 with the elements that he could dance with to our thunderous applause. Outside sculptors, pillared fountains and ornamented structures \u2014 glistened in the sun and provided the fanciful maze that we adhered to \u2014 with the assistance of a boy who was too young to comprehend how his privilege could possibly be handicapped \u2014 at short notice.I couldn\u2019t stop smiling outwardly as I nursed the renderings of Tamir Rice \u2014 and how he would have enjoyed a day like this \u2014 if only he hadn\u2019t been sucked into the betrayal of his controversial demeanor.My nostrils were slowly making way for some much needed deep breaths and the reassurance of an overdue break-through. My friend and I were eager to head inside \u2014 but her little one needed more time to make wishes \u2014 with the aid of coins and pebbles that needed to be dramatically thrown into the fountain.When he ran out \u2014 I provided more and the ritual continued \u2014 only this time \u2014 I paid attention.I gleefully mentioned \u201cthe ripple effect\u201d and he immediately jumped into the contest of creating the best there ever was. His childish reaction only helped to intensify the imagery of hits. I could see the waves of love responding on contact \u2014 and confirming my healing disposition.The security of family that can be man-made when the feelings are easy enough to define. I had to recall the first time I met one of the most important women in this boy\u2019s life. It was a little over a decade ago \u2014 we were two of four Black women working at one of the top talent agencies in the business and she was the only one who stopped by to introduce herself.I was sold after that. We bonded and even during trying times \u2014 we managed to forge a sisterhood that saw us through the periods of duress, which inadvertently created the seal of life-long commandments.After the coin tossing stint wore off \u2014 we veered off to other pastures and during a short interlude \u2014 I observed my darling friend with the grandson who naturally looks like her son \u2014 and made the mental snapshot.Nice view!Family extends past the blood vows that are uttered without consent.I have my people and I love them dearly \u2014 and even though they are far away \u2014 I still summon the validity of how they apply when nostalgia creeps in. But, when the present leaves you scarily breathless and in need of care \u2014 you are bound to a commitment that brews more satisfaction than a last minute booty call.The ripple effect is no coincidence and it happens from learned interference and the openness of strangers who can\u2019t wait for your ever-evolving profile to complete its desired numbers \u2014 before reaching out.They choose to add you to the spreading virus of humanity and the possibility of a casual lunch turning into the building blocks of life\u2019s offerings.She had a child who had a child \u2014 and being able to partake in that joy was heart-wrenchingly symbolic in a way that evoked my feelings of dread as I ceremoniously conceded my inability to ever replicate what she has conceived.Despite the regrets of not being impregnated at just the right time or not being able to recruit the crush from back when such a thing was my thing \u2014 I was still able to breath again with the help of open spaces and the two champs that surrounded me with tender loving care.At the end of the day \u2014 the lowered sun led us to separate places and I was controlled by the calm of knowing that no matter how alone I will feel when I step out of the car and wave goodbye \u2014 there was no escaping the effect of being embedded in the memory of the boy \u2014 who created a masterpiece when he threw the pebble in the water and walked away with pride.The love continues without me and when he remembers I will be alive again \u2014 and it won\u2019t require millions of dollars or million dollar installations.It\u2019s the ripple effect. It\u2019s art teaching art how to be artfully humane. If you ever need to perfect the technique \u2014 let the love flow past blood and into the crevices of an eight-year-old boy who has already mastered the ties that bind.The effects are staggering.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Relationships", "Family", "Life Lessons", "Friendship", "Parenting"]}, {"title": "Ripple (XRP) Coin Review", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/ripple-xrp-coin-review-6b13b7b19c13?source=search_post", "author_name": "Best of ICOs", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@BestofICOs", "publish_date": "2018-01-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-12", "readtime": "15.9", "claps": 307, "voters": 39, "content": "Image Caption: Before reading this review, please read our disclaimer at the bottom of the article or here.

Making Ripple\u2019s co-founder, Chris Larsen, the 8th wealthiest man on earth as he holds the equivalent of about $55B USD (as of January 4th, 2018 at 16:00 hrs EST).How did this happen? Why now? What\u2019s Ripple? This article will answer those questions, and shed some light on both the positive, and negative aspects of the cryptocurrency, as well as the historical reasons that made this token jump from the 9th to the 2nd most valuable cryptocurrencies in a couple of hours. Even though this looks like an overnight success, this is a story 14 years in the making.Note: The price of this currency increased by 10 times during the hours writing and editing this article. Woah. If you want to read our shorter, 5 minute summary of Ripple, click here.IntroductionRipple as a token has been in circulation since 2012. During this time ICOs were essentially non-existent so this will be the first time we do a review on a company that didn\u2019t have an ICO, but a strategy that involved multiple partnerships, clients, and movement of tokens.Ripple is trying to revolutionize payment systems through its platform. They described the current banking system as \u201cslow, limited in transparency and expensive\u201d. And therefore claim that it is also inadequate as a Global Payment System. Their idea is to reduce these barriers of entry to enable global payment to become a truly worldwide activity. And so RippleNet was born.Talk is cheap, but Ripple has been able to deliver on their promises by partnering with some of the most successful investors in silicon valley, as well as multiple international banking institutions, regulators, and leaders in technology, such as Google and MIT.RippleNetRippleNet is the name given to the Global Payment System of Ripple. It creates a global network of banks in which people can send and receive payments through Ripple technology. They claim the system to have real-time messaging, clearing, and \u201cgross settlement certainty\u201d of transactions.Gross Settlements is the name given to the transfer of funds or securities between two banks. Gross refers specifically to the ability to enable those transactions to happen one-by-one instead of sending them as a bulk, for example if banks sent all their transactions of one day at the end of each day.The way it works is by forming partnerships between banks to have access to the RippleNet network. Once a participating bank is part of the network, users around the world can interact with that bank through their own local RippleNet-enabled Bank. Users refers to corporations, individuals, and other organizations looking to participate in banking activities.The advisory team alone for RippleNet includes members of 6 different banks (and counting).Image under caption: RippleNet Banking advisory members, from Page 14 of RippleNet Brochure (PDF)Furthermore RippleNet has a series of products:xCurrent: Payment ProcessingxRapid: Source of liquidityxVia: Payment originationxCurrentEnables payment processing between banks.

Anyone can come up with an idea, but execution is the real difficulty. As a two-sided market business, Ripple requires both Supply (Banks) and Demand (Users, Businesses). In order to succeed they need to get the Supply side first, and that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve done.The list of banks that Ripple has as customers continues to grow, the current list is quite impressive, and it is one of the main reasons that the price of Ripple has been shooting as high as it is.Image Caption: Ripple Customer Sample from Page 15 of RippleNet BrochureHistoryPrice of Ripple from January 2014 to January 4th, 2018. Price from CoinMarketCap.com found here.Ripplepay14 years ago, in 2004, before bitcoin was created, Ripplepay was a service created by Ryan Fugger to allow swapping of credit between trusting participants. Essentially if someone owed you $10, they could create an IOU worth $10 and if someone else trusted that person, you could then use that as IOU as $10 with that third party. This is also the way current banks operate and is one of the building blocks of the current financial system. This is a relatively simple concept and even cash notes are essentially IOUs just all issued by the same entity, i.e a bank/govt.This is very different from bitcoin, which is a trustless cash system, where you don\u2019t require trust between two transacting parties, but you do require some form of verification that the asset being traded (in this case bitcoin) cannot be double-spent. If you could double-spend the same bitcoin, it is essentially like counterfeiting banknotes and obviously that is a problem.However, in the above a payment system described by ripple, you do need trust. If I owe Bob money, a third party, Alice does not need to trust Bob to believe that my debt is valid, she only needs to trust me. You can\u2019t issue debt to someone who does not trust you. So, you need to set a trust line, or a credit limit, that defines to what extent you trust which participant. Trust lines can \u201cripple\u201d through a network, allowing trading of IOUs with participants you may not know, but with whom you share trusted intermediaries. If Bob and Alice both trust me, Bob could pay Alice with an IOU that I issued to Bob.Ripple on the BlockchainAfter the introduction of bitcoin to the world, Ripple began development of a blockchain based payment network similar to their existing product, however instead of bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work ripple used something called global consensus to verify trust, which they explain in the whitepaper leads to faster transaction times and lesser transaction fees.This implementation of global consensus was new, even though the problem it was solving is well established in computer science literature. The validation of trust through consensus is a problem known as the \u201cByzantium general problem\u201d and there are a few protocols which generated a solution for the problem, one of which was ripple\u2019s new global consensus protocol. Another company, Stellar implemented a very similar protocol and came under heat for it in 2014 when a serious bug resulted in transactions being unconfirmed forever, however Ripple vehemently denied that their protocol was the one to blame and that it was an incorrect implementation. However leading cryptologists currently do not agree on whether the protocol is sound or not.The IdeaAs explained in the history section Ripple started out as Ripplepay, a simple debt exchange platform which did not involve any counterparty risks however it required trust between the participants on the network. Thus if Bob trusted Alice and Alice trusted Charlie, the line of trust between Bob and Alice could \u201cripple\u201d through to Charlie and thus allowed Bob\u2019s debt/credit be passed on to Charlie and vice versa.While there was no issue of double-spending with debt (the same person could issue the same debts to two different people and they would just owe two different people money.) However once Ripple started working on a blockchain based verification network. Now a simple problem of having a payment network without any counter-party risk now became a problem of having a system that does not only require trust amongst the network, but also a way to ensure that double spending does not happen (i.e XRP cannot be counterfeited). However how these two pieces fit together is quite complicated so we shall break it down into the following separate sections.The TokenRipple purports these settlement issues are caused by manual settlement done in order to translate one bank\u2019s ledger system\u2019s transactions into another bank\u2019s ledger system. Ripple however introduces something called the interledger protocol which uses a new cryptocurrency (ripple [ XRP]) to settle accounts across two banks differing ledgers, allowing for much faster settlement times.Ripple\u2019s White PaperRipple submitted multiple documents and white papers. Some focused on the business development side, such as Ripple Solutions Guide (PDF), and the RippleNet Brochure (PDF). But the company also submitted technical white papers that go very deep into their technology, Consensus algorithm (PDF) , and the Interledger Protocol (PDF).Consensus AlgorithmRipple does not use bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work rather it uses a consensus protocol to validate transactions, this new consensus protocol is states in Ripple\u2019s whitepaper for their consensus algorithm. The consensus algorithm was new and unproven when it was initially presented but since then Ripple has carried out several validations for the transactions. This together with the fact that they have partnered with many banks has shown that the consensus algorithm works well for validations of transactions. These validations ensure that there are no double-spends of XRP, however why this needs to be the currency is the real question.Interledger ProtocolThe interledger protocol is specified in Ripple\u2019s whitepaper and is basically the way the ripple network allows for cross-currency remittances. In order to understand the interledger protocol, we need to explain how banks currently issue international remittances. They use different databases as ledgers to make sure that credit and debt assets are tallied in the local native currency. What Ripple does is it settles transactions across multiple ledgers by settling each separate ledger by using XRP as an intermediary currency.ValidatorsIn order to distribute the amount of control that the Ripple corporation exerts over the network, and more importantly, to enable the network to operate, even if Ripple fails as a company, a series of validators have been put in place.Validators (Unique Node Lists) are organizations and/or individuals that can verify a transaction on the Ripple network, so they act as a semi centralized agency. Validators also make sure transactions are not \u201cdouble spent\u201d by agreeing in the order of transactions.Amongst the current validators of the Ripple protocol there are:MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)MicrosoftCGI (Canadian Global Information)And many moreUnfortunately this list is not extensive, and there is a series of nodes and addresses that are not public. So there could be a risk of decentralization, due to the fact that we don\u2019t know if Ripple investors, employees, or the board of directors is part of this elite validators.Token DistributionThis is one of the most criticized aspects of the Ripple protocol. Ripple controls over 50% currently, and once all the XRP have been released into circulation, the ripple company will own exactly 50%.Blockchain TestThe Blockchain test refers to the question of whether or not a company requires the use of the Blockchain in order to be successful. This test was a result of a lot of companies abusing the ICO hype in order to just add the word \u201cToken\u201d after their name. \u201cThe Token for X\u201d model.In principle Ripple needs the Blockchain as an improvement on current banking financial standards. The question is whether or not it was necessary for ripple to create their own cryptocurrency, and whether or not it was a good idea for them to do so in a semi-centralized way with obscure validators. Undoubtedly they could have used bitcoin or any other already pre-existing cryptocurrency to fulfill this role and the introduction of a native currency like XRP leads to a lot of questions as to why the extra currency is necessary.Furthermore, hyperledger which is an open source protocol very similar to the interledger protocol provided by Ripple existed prior, so why Ripple chose not adopt that is a reasonable question. Ripple claims that it is hard to do the kinds of international remittances that it does through the hyperledger protocol due to lack of atomic book transactions, however hyperledger is currently working on exactly that problem, and thus it is an important point to note.Ripple has also created solutions in order to easily transfer their token for others. In 2013 OpenCoin created the \u201cBitcoin Bridge\u201d, which essentially allows users to transfer funds in any currency to a Bitcoin address. Essentially enabling anyone in the world to purchase items in exchange of Bitcoin, without having to own Bitcoin in the first place.The Bridge is one of the most interesting aspects of the Blockchain test for Ripple. It shows a great use of the technology, and also something that almost only Ripple would be able to do, since their global partnerships with banks allow them to provide the multi-currency liquidity and network to provide those services.Traction \u2014 PerformanceBesides all the activities, products, partnerships, investors, and clients that Ripple has, it is also important to discuss how the token has been performing over the last years in order to demonstrate traction and the validity that people have given the token since its inception.2013\u20132016During this period of time, one of the main engines moving cryptocurrencies forward was the rise and rise of Bitcoin. In the period of August 2013 until December, Bitcoin increased in price from around $80 USD to over $1,000 USD. by March of 2014 the bubble burst, and the price of Bitcoin continued to decline until it reached less than $200 at the beginning of 2015.For many, Ripple was \u201cThe Next Bitcoin\u201d and while Bitcoin was at an all time high people saw the potential for Ripple to become the next best option. As Bitcoin prices crashed, people also lost hope on Ripple, so you can see a very similar price pattern for Ripple during the period of 2013\u20132015. However, during the all-time low of Bitcoin in 2015, many thought Ripple would replace Bitcoin to become the preferred worldwide cryptocurrency, so the price increased inversely to that of Bitcoin.Ripple Price Graph from Coin Market\u2019s Ripple found here.Bitcoin Price Graph from Coin Market\u2019s Bitcoin during the same period found here.2017This was by far the best year for the Cryptocurrency, and probably the reason you are reading the article now. 2017 became the most important year for investment in cryptocurrencies, so people started looking at the largest and most important ones in the market.Graph from Coin Market\u2019s Ripple found here.For many Ripple was going to become the defacto banking cryptocurrency so a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy occurred. In the span of 12 months, the price off Ripple went from $0.006 USD (or about 0.6 cents) to over $3 for every token. This is an increase of about 50,000%. Of course, as the price kept increasing, people kept saying that the price would continue to do so, so more people invested in the currency, and the cycle continued.Part of the reason the token has become so popular recently is social media. As ICOs are becoming more popular and people are investing more, the price of cheap altcoins is attracting a lot of people to invest in it.One of the reasons that Ripple seems to be such a \u201ccheap\u201d token, is due to the massive volume of Ripple tokens that exists in production. Price is relative, and does not take into consideration a tokens total token volume. There are 100 billion tokens, so the price fluctuates much less than if there were 1 million tokens, in comparison there are 16 million Bitcoins, out of the total possible maximum of 21 million.Lately, criticisms have stopped the price from continuing to rise, these criticisms include the centralized nature of the network, the amount of tokens that the team gave to themselves and partners, and technical decisions that put in question the need for Ripple in the first place.TeamTeam History5 years before Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s famous original Bitcoin paper \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d there was Ripplepay (2004). The project was originally created by Ryan Fugge, a software developer from Vancouver.The idea came from working at a stock trading exchange and development began 2004. A year later, Fugge had a working product that enabled consumers to be able to secure transactions over the internet, just 5 years after the internet boom.6 years later, software developers Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz development began to build their own digital currency system through a consensus algorithm. The following in year, in 2012, the new system was incorporated into the new company OpenCoin Inc. Fugge transitioned into helping with the creation of the credit network section of Ripple.As OpenCoin continued to grow and develop Ripple, the team continued to acquire veterans from the finance, software, and venture capital markets. The team now is heavily stacked and connected to both cryptocurrencies and Fintech, which is one of the reasons that has justified their valuation and quick rise so far. Ripple was co-founded by Angel Investor Chris Larsen, and Software Programmer Jed McCaleb. Fugge left his role as a developer at Ripple, and is currently working ICO advisor. His websites mentions he doesn\u2019t have intentions to take new projects related to health conditions (We won\u2019t link his website, as we are sure he currently appreciates privacy).On September of 2013 OpenCoin Inc. changed its name to Ripple Labs Inc. Which is currently the name for the company and main holder of Ripple, and with Chris Larsen as a CEO.The TeamThere are an estimated 2,000 billionaires in the world. Ripple as a company has created at least 3. We find that this is an important point to mention, since our criticism section talks about the distribution of the cryptocurrency amongst its founders, which could potentially created complicated incentives within the company.Ripple\u2019s CEO is Brad Garlinghouse, he\u2019s worked at executive levels at AOL, Yahoo, SBC, and act as CEO of Hightail, and Dalpad Communications. Brad currently owns 6.3% of Ripple, making his net worth a considerable $9.5 billion dollars.Chris Larsen is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, he helped co-found Ripple, as well as multiple FinTech related companies such as E-Loan, OpenCoin, and Prosper Marketplace.Jed McCaleb, is well known for creating largest Bitcoin exchange ever by volume of BTC, the now defunct Mt Gox (hacked after McCaleb sold the company to Mark Karpeles). Jed is now worth $20B from his Ripple\u2019s token and is on the top 40 richest people on the world.The InvestorsRipple has a series of renowned technical investors in silicon valley and worldwide, includingGoogle VenturesAndreessen HorowitzCME VenturesAccentureSantanderNeedless to say the Board of Directors is equally as impressive, and extremely well connected in the financial and banking sectors.How to BuyAs one of the largest tokens, Ripple is readily available in a multitude of exchanges. From their website, the exchanges that trade Ripple are:Bitstamp (XRP/USD,EUR,BTC)Kraken (XRP/USD,EUR,BETC)CoinOne (XRP/KRW,BTC)Bitso (XRP/MXN,BTC)Coincheck (XRP,JPY,BTC)Korbit (XRP/KRW)Qryptos (XRP/BTC)Bitbank (XRP/JPY)Bitsane (XRP/USD,EUR,BTC)BTC Markets (XRP/AUD,BTC)LikeBit (XRP/EUR)Bitcoin Co Ltd (XRP/THB)Gatehub (XRP/USD,JPY,CNY,EUR,,BTC,ETH)Bitcoin.co.id (XRP/BTC)Note: different exchanges have different authorization stages, so in some it may become much more difficult to obtain Ripple or other currencies to ultimately obtain Ripple.CriticismsBusiness Decision CriticismsThe amount of Ripple tokens that the cofounders have decided to reward themselves with has been heavily obfuscated by the company. Two of the founders are now billionaires, and one is the 10th wealthiest man in the world now. That money does not come from sales, but instead from the expectation that people have in how the cryptocurrency will behave.In order to mitigate this situation, the founders decided to escrow a large portion of their funds. This way the money will be frozen until certain events trigger the smart contracts to pay the founders. Even with this, hacking incentives to unlock these smart contracts could create incredible greedy situations. Just think about this, what would you do if you knew you are technically the 8th wealthiest people on earth, how far would you go to protect that investment?In May of 2015, the United States\u2019 Financial Crimes Enforcement Network fined Ripple $700,000.\u201cRipple Labs willfully violated several requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by acting as a money services business (MSB) and selling its virtual currency, known as XRP, without registering with FinCEN, and by failing to implement and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program designed to protect its products from use by money launderers or terrorist financiers. XRP II later assumed Ripple Labs\u2019 functions of selling virtual currency and acting as an MSB; however, like its parent company, XRP II willfully violated the BSA by failing to implement an effective AML program, and by failing to report suspicious activity related to several financial transactions.\u201d \u2014 FinCEN fines Ripple, through an immediate release found here.Technical CriticismsAs mentioned in the above explanation of how Ripple works, XRP merely acts as the intermediary currency between cross-border ledgers to settle assets for the various banks. Initially this started off as a very centralized version of their consensus protocol with only Ripple as a validator and every transaction was verified by them. However in an effort to decentralize the trust-validation of the currency, they have started to slowly add other validators to the network and begun to dismantle the validators that they control. However this does not mean that the control over the currency is decentralized! Since Ripple (the company) controls the majority of the XRP supply, the power of usage with the currency is very centralized in the company and they control the pricing by controlling the demand/supply market.ConclusionNo matter what happens, Ripple will have a formidable story. It will either become one of the largest financial assets in the next decade, or it will have an incredible implosion and hundreds of millions of dollars will be lost to competitors, corruption, unsolved technological challenges, unused technologies, or a combination of all of these.We are not sure what the future will be, but we will definitely be watching with excitement what happens in this space. We hope this review gives you enough information to start doing your own research in the token, and your own decisions.Certainly one of the most interesting stories, and an incredible series of partners, clients, and team members.Looking to help?Support us on Bountey! https://www.bountey.com/bestoficosWant to stay up to date in ICOs?Visit us at https://thebestoficos.comHave an interesting story?Write us at info@bestoficos.comDisclaimerThis website and the information contained herein is not intended to be a source of investment, financial, technical, tax, or legal advice.

SpencerFollowMar 29 \u00b7 3 min readAs of early January 2019, Ripple had announced that it surpassed 200 partners as it adds 13 financial institutions as customers for its payment network, RippleNet.Ripple consolidating traditional financial markets is an interesting use case for blockchain for the real world.Federal Bank in India has partnered with blockchain payments company Ripple to facilitate cross-border payments, according to reports. Here we are talking about Private bank, Federal Bank Ltd. in India.Ripple bills itself as a frictionless way to send money globally. Ripple has been aggressive with partnerships yet it\u2019s still debatable how well it\u2019s performing. In a world where three billion people are connected online, Ripple feels more like a real-world blockchain pioneer than a decentralized crypto with XRP.India like China has a complicated relationship to crypto. It isn\u2019t known if the partnership will include cryptocurrency or not, especially since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country\u2019s central bank, issued a statement saying it wouldn\u2019t support the digital currency.The announcement that Ripple has over 200 partners reflects the recently rapid growth of their network of users of their xRapid and xCurrent products, especially among traditional financial companies and banks. So Ripple is essentially a live use case of blockchain tech for remittances and cross-border payments. I\u2019d say that in 2019 the verdict is still out.The confusion between Ripple and XRP really is a sour point of how companies that are totally centralized pretend to have a decentralized aspect. This is the same dynamic that Block.One has with EOS. A certain category of blockchain entrepreneurs decided to play both sides and it\u2019s always made me leary of Ripple and EOS as actually innovative projects.Regardless of the specifics this deal shows India is very pro blockchain. Central banks around the world are looking to bring a digital equivalent of their fiat dollars on the blockchain. We live in a world of banking consortium sand enterprise blockchain systems where places like Japan and China are leading the charge in blockchain integration. It\u2019s great to see Ripple partnering with India.XRP has been declared centralized because the plurality of XRP is in fact owned by Ripple, which created it. However this business model might after all be appropriate for partnerships with banks who might trust this arrangement more. It\u2019s entirely likely Ripple might not be what we think it is.XRP is currently ranked 3rd on Coinmarketcap.com with a price of USD $0.31 and a total market cap of nearly $13 Billion or 17.8% of Bitcoin\u2019s own market cap.

Ripple has a clever way of allowing banks to do this without using exchanges (which they would absolutely hate), but the result is the same.The $230 million comes from the absolute minimum the market cap would need to be in order to send $5 trillion per day using all 100 billion ripple coins and assuming transactions take 4 seconds.Simply $5trillion per day/24 hours per day/3600 seconds per hour* 4 seconds. This was designed to be a back-of-the-envelope calculation just to get a relative sense of magnitude.In reality it would actually be higher than $230 million because some people will be holding and there will be fluctuations in supply/demand.

Indeed, while we may refer to both a token and an equity\u2019s \u201cmarket cap\u201d as the number of shares or tokens in circulation multiplied by the share or token\u2019s price, this apparent similarity only serves to obfuscate the fundamental difference between these types of assets and leads to misunderstandings and mistakes in the valuations of cryptoassets.Note: For the sake of this article, I\u2019ll be referring to utility rather than security tokens. Security tokens function in a very similar way to equities and are not really subject to the same distinctions and problems (i.e. they aren\u2019t as interesting).Equities represent legal ownership of an underlying company, whereas tokens represent the currency used to pay for a certain utility in an underlying protocol, platform or ecosystem. As such, when valuing an equity we need only analyse the underlying company and its ability to generate cashflows as we are assured to possess a legal ownership claim on the company\u2019s cashflows. On the other hand, when valuing a token we must look not just at supply and demand for the underlying protocol, but also at the token\u2019s economic model to ensure the price of the token is correlated to demand for the underlying protocol.In this article I\u2019ll cover this fundamental difference between equities and tokens in more depth before going over some real world examples of how this applies in practice when valuing tokens.The difference between equities and tokensWhat is an equityOwning an equity (also known as stock or share) is effectively equivalent to owning a percentage of the underlying company represented by that stock. This ownership itself is a legal construction in that the legal system recognises certain rights for equity holders which are enforceable in court. Effectively, an equity gives its owner a legal claim to a proportionate amount of a company\u2019s cashflows, whether that be in the form of actual cashflows such as dividends or \u201cfrozen\u201d cashflows in the form of assets.Valuing an equitySince an equity represents ownership which the legal system defines as giving right to a claim on a company\u2019s cashflows, its no wonder that equity valuation is based primarily on a company\u2019s ability to produce cashflows. Indeed, if a company is making a profit or in other words has positive earnings, investors may look at a company\u2019s Price to Earnings ratio which is simply the price paid for a company\u2019s cashflows. In case a company doesn\u2019t have earnings or has negative earnings, investors may speculate on the probabilities and magnitudes of the company\u2019s future cashflows (as venture capitalists and other early stage investors do) or otherwise look at a company\u2019s assets (as value investors do), which can be seen as \u201cfrozen\u201d cashflows to be unlocked either willingly or forcefully in the case of liquidation. In every case, investors are focussed on the ability of the company to produce cashflows as the primary valuation metric.While investors may also look at revenues, they are only of interest alongside an analysis of the company\u2019s ongoing cost structure such that investors can determine whether the company will be able to earn a profit on those revenues at some point in the future and generate cashflows for shareholders. As Peter Thiel famously said: a company creates X dollars of value and captures Y% of that value. X and Y are independent variables. As such, revenues can be seen as the value created by a company whereas earnings/profits can be seen as the value captured by the company.Big piece of a small pie: Value is created through revenue and captured through profit. Whereas all US airlines put together created much more value than google, they were 100x worse at capturing that value and their market cap (valuation) was thus only a quarter of Google\u2019s.What is a token?A token, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t represent any ownership in an underlying company. In fact, a token may not even necessarily have an underlying company or legal entity. So what are tokens? Most broadly, tokens can be seen to represent currency used to pay for a certain utility in an underlying protocol, platform or ecosystem which they power. Specifically, tokens either have a certain use case in the protocol (i.e. Steem\u2019s token used to stake in order to be able to work for the network) or otherwise serve as medium of exchange in the project\u2019s ecosystem (i.e. Powerledger\u2019s POWR token used to buy and sell energy on the platform).An example of a medium of exchange token is casino chips which are used as currency which can only be used to pay for gambling at the casino.Store credit such as Sainsbury\u2019s nectar points is another example of a utility token which can only be used to pay for goods at Sainsbury\u2019s.Valuing a tokenSince a token represents utility or currency in the protocol, token valuation must be based on the supply and demand for that particular protocol. However, this alone isn\u2019t enough. Because, unlike an equity, a token doesn\u2019t entitle its owner to any legal ownership of the underlying protocol (and the protocol itself may not even generate cashflow) but is rather simply the currency used to pay for a certain utility in the protocol, a token\u2019s value must depend not just on demand for the protocol but also on the degree of correlation between demand for the protocol and demand for the token itself.To put this in different terms, we can say that a given protocol creates X dollars of value but only Y% of X is captured through its token. X and Y are independent variables. Effectively, we can think of the value created by the protocol as the \u201crevenue\u201d and the value captured by the token as \u201cprofits\u201d. Just as with equities, it\u2019s not enough to merely look at X, the value created by the protocol but we must also to look at Y, the value created by the protocol which is captured by the token.In order to determine what Y is for an equity, we must look at it the underlying company\u2019s cost structure. To determine what Y is for a token, we must look at the token\u2019s economic model (more on this later).Practical consequences and examplesThis may all seem slightly arcane and theoretical so I\u2019ll now give some examples of how this distinction applies in practice, using particular projects as examples. Specifically, I\u2019ll be looking for projects in which the correlation between demand for the protocol and demand for the token is weak or in other words the protocol creates $X of value but only a small % of that X is captured by the token.Example 1: RippleThe best example of this is probably Ripple. Ripple Labs (i.e. the company behind the XRP token) has invented a blockchain-based protocol called Ripple Network which aims to replace the SWIFT protocol in bank to bank transfers. Given SWIFT currently processes $5T a day in trans-country currency exchange or over a quadrillion dollars a year, Ripple\u2019s total addressable market is huge. Ripple Labs has already signed partnerships with over 100 financial institutions worldwide who pay it to use its Ripple Network service. By all accounts, Ripple Labs seems like an extremely promising and successful company.However, as we\u2019ve discussed, while the success of Ripple Labs the company raises the value of its equity, it doesn\u2019t necessarily raise the value of its token XRP. XRP doesn\u2019t represent any ownership stake in Ripple Labs and indeed all the evidence seems to indicate that demand for the XRP token is extremely uncorrelated to demand for the Ripple protocol.XRP serves three main purposes: (1) it can be used as a bridge currency for banks to settle international transactions with (2) it is burned to pay for transaction fees and (3) it is required as a small reserve for any address using the network. Of these, only (1) would provide any significant demand for XRP as the latter two serve primarily as anti-spam measures and long-term supply constraints. However, Ripple Labs doesn\u2019t force banks to use XRP as a bridge currency and as a result almost none of them do as they use digital IOUs instead. In fact, some sources indicate that Ripple\u2019s xRAPID system (the only one that uses the XRP token) currently only has one small user and one pilot.As a result, only (2) and (3) are left which provide minimal value to XRP. For (3), while each account is required to hold a small reserve, thus constraining supply and increasing price of XRP, this reserve is currently only 20XRP (~$17 as of 29/04/2018) per account. Even with 10M accounts (8x the current amount), this would only lock up 200,000,000XRP or 0.02% of total supply; a tiny deflationary force. For (2), while some XRP is burned to pay for transaction fees, thus constraining supply and increasing the price of XRP, the current transaction fee is only 0.00001 XRP which means that only 10XRP tokens need to be destroyed if a bank wants to settle 1M transactions in a year. In fact, only 0.00526% has been burned in transaction fees so far and daily destruction rate is an average of ~8K XRP. At this rate, even in 100 years only 0.29% of total supply of XRP will be burned. Even if we assumed a 100K daily destruction rate (10x more than the current daily destruction rate), in 100 years only 3.65% of total supply of XRP would be destroyed. Once again, a tiny deflationary force.As a result, this is a clear case in which demand for the protocol (i.e. Ripple Network) is only very weakly correlated to demand for the XRP token. Whereas Ripple Labs may create immense value for its customers, almost none of this value seems to be captured by the XRP token.Example 2: Celsius NetworkCelsius Network is a crypto-collateralised lending platform. For those who don\u2019t know, these platforms allow users to deposit cryptocurrency as collateral, let\u2019s say $150 of ETH, and receive loans paid into their bank account, let\u2019s say $100. If ETH drops in value such that it comes within X% of leaving me undercollateralised, the platform automatically sells my ETH, pays off the loan and sends me any leftovers. This loan model allows much lower interest rates on loans than than the credit check model as there\u2019s virtually no due diligence required which reduces costs and since collateral is provided and automatically sold through smart contracts the risk of default is also far lower. Also, once other assets (i.e. houses or cars) are registered onto the blockchain and possess liquid markets, these can be used as collateral in the same way.While this is a very promising space and I believe the platforms and protocols in it will create significant value, given the current token economics only a small percentage of this value will actually be captured by the token. This is because loans on the platform are issued and paid off in FIAT and, in the case of Celsius, only the interest rate and fees are paid in the CEL token. As such, even if Celsius is extremely successful, demand for the protocol is high and $1B worth of loans are processed through it every year, only a small percentage of this (equivalent to the 5\u20137% paid in interest rates and the 0.5% paid in fees) will actually comprise demand for the token. This is a case in which demand for the token is weakly correlated with demand for the platform and as such demand for the token is always likely to lag significantly behind demand for the platform.Sentinel Chain seeks to use RFID chips to register livestock to the blockchain and allow the unbanked in developing countries to use their livestock as loan collateral, turning \u201cdead capital\u201d into a fungible asset.Example 3: CoinseedCoinseed is a service which allows users to make micro-investments in cryptocurrencies by connecting to their credit cards and automatically collecting the \u201cspare change\u201d on their purchases, rounding them up to the nearest dollars. For instance, a user connects his credit card to CoinSeed and purchases a coffee for $2.30, his purchase is automatically rounded up to $3 and the $0.7 remainder is invested onto the platform. In addition, the platform also has a portfolio leaderboard showing the portfolios with the best returns and allows users to instantly convert their existing portfolio to any other on the leaderboard, charging a 1% fee for doing this. I\u2019ll refer to this as the \u201cportfolio conversion\u201d feature.While this is an interesting idea with many companies already successfully offering this service for the stockmarket (i.e. Acorns, Stash, Clink and Moneybox), the token economics ensure that only a small percentage of the value created by the platform will be captured by the token. The CSD token serves no purpose on the platform and will entitle holders to 50% of the revenues from the fees captured from the portfolio conversion feature. Leaving aside the fact that this token not pass the Howey test and almost certainly qualifies as a security, the token\u2019s value will rely solely on how often users actually use the portfolio conversion feature. Even if the platform becomes successful and a significant number of users sign up for the core service of micro-investing their spare change, there\u2019s no guarantee they will also want to use the portfolio conversion feature. As such, demand for the protocol itself (i.e. investing spare change into cryptocurrencies) is only very weakly correlated to demand for the CSD token. Indeed, the token\u2019s value doesn\u2019t rely on the success of the platform but rather on the success of the specific portfolio conversion fee.Example 4: Swiss Alps MiningSwiss Alps Mining is seeking, among other things, to build a P2P marketplace for the purchase of energy. However, the whitepaper mentions that its token SAM is not the sole currency used on the platform as purchasers will also be able to use FIAT to purchase energy on the marketplace. This means growth in demand for the purchase of energy on the platform will not necessarily correlate to increased demand for the SAM token as these services could be paid for in FIAT instead.In general, any project whose native token is not the sole currency on the platform/protocol creates serious problems for the token\u2019s value as users do not need the token in order to use the platform.Tokens and equity as competing value capture mechanismsAn interesting corollary of this is that equities and tokens are effectively competing for the fixed amount of value created by a company, entity or protocol. Since they are both value capture mechanisms, a company that has valuable equity will necessarily have a less valuable token and vice versa.For instance, let\u2019s take the example of Ripple vs Ethereum. Ripple Labs has valuable equity since it owns ~60 % of all Ripple in existence (worth around $18B at time of writing) and also generates significant (albeit undisclosed) revenues by charging banks to use its protocol. As a result, XRP token is necessarily less valuable since much of the value created by Ripple Network is being captured through cashflows by Ripple Labs\u2019s equity. The Ethereum foundation on the other hand owns around 1% of all ETH in circulation (worth around $457M at time of writing) and does not generate any cashflows. As a result, its equity is not nearly as valuable as Ripple Labs but the Ether token is worth much more since all the value created by it captured by the token.There are some mechanisms that can be put in place in order to increase the value of the token compared to the equity. For instance, a company can charge for its services in FIAT and use its earnings/cashflows to purchase tokens and burn them (thus reducing the supply of the token and putting upward pressure on the price), effectively transferring value from the equity to the token. Alternatively, a company could charge for its services in the native token, then sell that token on the market and distribute that money to shareholders in a dividend. This would lower the value of the token by increasing supply and putting downward pressure on price, effectively transferring value from the token to the equity.The key here is that given a limited amount of value created by a service, tokens and equity are competing to capture as much of that value as possible. As such, we can think of the token used on a protocol and the equity of the company developing the protocol as being inversely correlated, the more value is being captured by cashflows, the more the equity will be worth and the less the token will be worth, and vice versa.This is why the news of Facebook looking into cryptocurrencies is so interesting. If Facebook were to launch a utility token, unless this token created additional value or captured value that Facebook\u2019s equity could not reach, it would necessarily cannibalise the value of Facebook\u2019s equity as the token\u2019s price would effectively be absorbing potential cashflows to Facebook. This begs the question of whether fiduciary duties to shareholders would even render such a move legal.ConclusionI started by describing the differences between equities which imply ownership and a legal claim on cashflows, and tokens which are a currency used to pay for a certain utility on a protocol or platform. I then showed, using the examples of Celsius, Ripple, Coinvest and Swiss Alps Mining, that it\u2019s not enough to simply look at the demand for the protocol or platform itself as we must also consider the token economics to see how much of the value created by the protocol is captured by the token. Finally I showed that tokens and equity can be seen as being in some sense inversely correlated.", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Bitcoin", "Token Sale", "ICO"]}, {"title": "RippleNet's XRP Gets Listed On BCNEX", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@bcnex/ripplenets-xrp-gets-listed-on-bcnex-2b66c70c7944?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bcnex", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bcnex", "publish_date": "2019-08-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-22", "readtime": "1.45", "claps": 1128, "voters": 35, "content": "RippleNet's XRP Gets Listed On BCNEXBcnexFollowAug 22 \u00b7 2 min readDear Bcnex-ers,BCNEX is extremely proud to announce yet another great project coming to our trading platform.

It will make that person feel validated, and you will generate good karma as you learn from your mistake.\ud83d\udccc Keep your promises. Follow through whenever you give your word. If you make a promise to someone and then forget about it later, that lack of attention to follow through violates any trust you may have established. Remember what you promised to do and then do it.\ud83d\udccc Speak out against hateful comments. When you hear slurs or epithets hurled at someone, stand up for that person. Refuse to be complicit in the act by your inaction. Do something. Apathy is bad karma.\ud83d\udccc Forgive. Priests, psychologists, and doctors know that the act of forgiveness helps heal a person\u2019s body as well as heart, mind, and soul. You may think forgiving helps the other person, but, in fact, it helps you both.\ud83d\udccc Build a support network. Stuck is the worst place to be, both physically and psychologically.

Learn more about Ripple technology in this article.CODEX Exchange StaffFollowMar 21 \u00b7 3 min readRipple\u2019s Technology and Technical AspectsConsidering the fact, that the current banking system is running on an old technology initially created by SWIFT, it possesses complex bottlenecks when it comes to transaction settlement. For the last couple of decades, it still takes from 3\u20135 business days to settle a single bank transfer, which is caused by the legacy messaging system used across all banks globally. Moreover, on average banks take 2% fees out of each transaction, which creates enormous overheads that should be covered by individuals and corporations.Ripple aims to resolve these problems by implementing a technology which is based on the blockchain principles. They want to make all payments instant and pre-validated, source the liquidity on-demand unlocking more than $5 trillion in global liquidity, eliminate a 4% payment failure rate, and reduce global $1.6 trillion annual costs for payments down to almost zero.At the same time, their technology can\u2019t be fully considered as Blockchain. Since Ripple maintains a Unique Node List (UNL), there\u2019s a number of trusted nodes deployed solely by Ripple that preserve the integrity of the network and process all payments. The UNL imposes network rules, and if someone deploys his node, it won\u2019t work in tandem with trusted nodes. That means, technology is more centralized, rather than decentralized.What Solutions Does Ripple OfferCurrently, Ripple has 3 solutions intended for banks, SMEs, corporations, and payment providers that fix described problems: xCurrent, xRapid and xVia. We\u2019ll talk more about the first two solutions because the third one works as one standard payment interface that allows avoiding numerous payment networks integrations, which were customly designed by hundreds of banks during their existence.RippleNet by itself can be used without the XRP token, mainly because banks need a new messaging system which comes in the form of the xCurrent solution, that can replace SWIFT. This product easily resolves problems associated with transaction speeds, payment failures, immense transaction costs, but it doesn\u2019t fix low liquidity. And that\u2019s where xRapid comes into play.Breaking down the xRapid solution we can find that it uses the XRP token as the liquidity provider, which eliminates the need of banks to have nostro-accounts scattered all across the world. Nostro-accounts are simply one\u2019s bank accounts that keep a foreign currency at another bank in order to provide sufficient liquidity levels when it comes to international money transfers where foreign-to-local currency exchange is involved.Which means if banks don\u2019t store money in nostro-accounts, then trillions of dollars are released and replaced by XRP token that works as the universal liquidity provider for all financial institutions. Thereby, if banks want their currency exchanges to be liquid they have to use the XRP. That\u2019s the value proposition that Ripple boosts into the market.Price And Capitalization of XRP Token:The current XRP market cap is $13,239,875,898 and the trading volume is $797,971,69 ( 195,827 BTC) at the moment of writing this material. It is ranked 3rd on Coinmarketcap. The current price of the XRP is $0.317762.Available Trading Pairs:XRP/BTC; XRP/USDT.Disclaimer: The information provided does not constitute as a financial advice.

The terms I\u2019ll introduce are not interchangeable. Unfortunately, to grasp Ripple & XRP, we\u2019ll have to define a few fintech terms & concepts.Problem: The Backbone of Our Global Money System Is OldIn the age of Facegrams & Snapclouds developers haven\u2019t exactly flocked to revolutionize the way Goldman Sachs or the European Central Bank (financial institutions) move money. This led to these invisible, yet indispensable financial products missing out on a pivotal 10\u201320 years of advancements (such as blockchain technology).Solution: Ripple As Seen Through The Eyes of BitcoinBitcoin is a decentralized currency that settles transactions on a single blockchain (general ledger). Bitcoin\u2019s goal is to become the universal currency. Ripple is a bundle/suite of financial enterprise services & products powered by blockchain-like features that provide a centralized, universal currency transaction network. Ripple\u2019s goal is to create a new standard for how all types of \u201cmoney\u201d move. Essentially giving the $5.3T foreign exchange market & the $.12T cryptocurrency market a face-lift. Some of Ripple\u2019s exciting products deliver a real-time gross settle system (RTGS), currency exchange (this is where we\u2019ll see XRP), & a remittance network.RTGS, & The Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP)Bitcoin guarantees that value has been sent or received. That value is settled in real-time (minus bitcoin delays). In that sense Bitcoin provides a very limited (only bitcoin) real-time (again, delays) gross settlement system (RTGS).Ripple uses something like a global general ledger made up of something like a network of private blockchains. The correct name for these \u201cblockchains,\u201d that represent private & sovereign entities in the Ripple network, is \u201cGateways.\u201d These gateways are the Ripple equivalent to a digital portal that companies & governments use to join the Ripple network. Collectively, this settlement environment is known as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or RippleNet. This is where most of the real hype & fundamental value of Ripple Labs as a company currently lays.What This Means For Governments & CompaniesOnce an entity joins RippleNet, it transacts with other gateways at fractions of the current cost yet at multiple times the current speed. RippleNet also enables said entity to receive payments from any existing currency, cryptocurrency or fiat. See the larger picture here \u2014 Ripple is built to accept any type of entity that moves massive amounts of money around the globe. Such as Apple & Amazon\u2026companies already transacting billions with financial institutions.What This Means For You, I, & The Average ConsumerRipple Labs needs revenue from selling it\u2019s software to customers. People introduced to Ripple are often surprised at how non-friendly the Ripple environment is for the individual consumer. It\u2019s designed that way: don\u2019t be surprised when it\u2019s not easy to buy XRP (later). The two Ripple products we\u2019ve discussed (RippleNet & Gateways) don\u2019t provide any immediate, tangible benefit. But that doesn\u2019t mean that individual consumers won\u2019t benefit from the ripples of, uh, Ripple in one way or another.Currency Exchange, XRP, & The Remittance NetworkIndividuals & entities need to move money around as quickly, safely & cost-effectively as possible. A \u201cremittance\u201d is an individual sending money to a foreign state, where a currency exchange of dollars is required (say, to euros).Banks provide this service. For example, pretend our personal bank account is Wells Fargo. We\u2019re sending dollars to grandma in Mexico, who uses pesos. Best case scenario, Wells Fargo has an ATM where grandma lives. Our remittance remains inside the Wells Fargo network: fast, safe, & cheap. Worst case scenario, grandma lives in a small, rural city with a local bank that doesn\u2019t have dollar liquidity. Now our dollar from Wells Fargo, is forced out of the Wells Fargo network, most likely headed to one of the conglomerate Mexican banks (Banorte), who\u2019ll ultimately provide the dollar liquidity to grandma\u2019s local bank. That\u2019s three networks that our remittance had to travel through. That costs some serious time, money & security.Imagine a scenario where grandma\u2019s local bank & Wells Fargo both have gateways & are part of the RippleNet network. Our remittance stays within the existing network & is once again fast, safe, & cheap. With both global banks & central banks joining the RippleNet, it\u2019s acting as a super effective remittance network. A key function of this remittance network, as seen above, is to act as a currency exchange between all types of money. However, as you probably guessed, this means that RippleNet has to guarantee liquidity at all times.So How Does RippleNet Guarantee Liquidity Between Gateways of Different Currencies At All Times?By creating a bridge currency that\u2019s optimized for transactions in RippleNet. This cryptocurrency, of course, is none other than Ripple\u2019s own XRP. Ripple Labs markets XRP as the fastest & most scalable digital asset built for \u201cproviding source liquidity to banks, payment providers & market makers.\u201d Entities with gateways don\u2019t have to use XRP to transact on the RippleNet, BUT it\u2019s a safe bet that eventually all participating gateways will use XRP at one point.That, is where speculation for the price of XRP comes into play. As an individual consumer peeking into the world of cryptocurrencies, can Ripple provide fundamental value to you now? Unless you\u2019re frequently between currencies or a fintech founder, no; but this in no way detracts from Ripple Labs insanely ambitious goal of revolutionizing the way money moves around the world.Ripple Site \u2014 https://ripple.com/\u201cCryptos in 3 Mins.\u201d are cryptocurrency primers dedicated to presenting cryptocurrencies solving real problems in a digestible manner.We\u2019re launching an advanced cryptocurrency research platform @: https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/setcoinsIf you\u2019d like to join a Facebook group for all things cryptocurrency, you can find me at -> https://www.facebook.com/groups/182090605649890/", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain", "Altcoins", "Trading"]}, {"title": "Why I\u2019m Joining Ripple", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@warpaul/why-im-joining-ripple-bba17aa8fc40?source=search_post", "author_name": "Warren Paul Anderson", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@warpaul", "publish_date": "2016-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-22", "readtime": "1.86", "claps": 209, "voters": 32, "content": "Why I\u2019m Joining RippleDoubling Down on the Internet of ValueWarren Paul AndersonFollowJul 1, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readNext week is a big week.On the 4th of July we celebrate our nation\u2019s independence, of course.On the 5th, I\u2019m celebrating the 10th anniversary of my 21st birthday.On the 6th, I start a new chapter in my career, as a Product Manager at Ripple, the new category leader in global payments.All that before Wednesday!To some, this career move may come as sort of a surprise.

The Ripple network enables secure, instant and very low cost interbank transactions anywhere in the world.OriginTechnically it is a payment network behind the XRP cryptocurrency, which is simply known as Ripple. Like Bitcoin, Ripple runs in blockchain or blockchain.But Ripple\u2019s network differs greatly from Bitcoin in many ways. Launched in 2012, it is not intended to be used as the main payment unit. Rather, the Ripple network acts as a system to verify and record transactions of all types of assets, including its own XRP currency. And while Bitcoin was founded as a network focused on the contribution of users contributing their own power of computers to process payments in exchange for Bitcoin mining, Ripple is a company that created a number of XRP -99 billion-ready coins for be distributed. These XRP coins can be sold or marketed. Or also used as a gateway between different assets to avoid traditional rates and transaction times.XRP allows transactions at a speed of between 5 and 10 secondsConsidered the cryptocurrency of banks, Ripple is a virtual system of payments in real time based on blockchain technology that is used by financial institutions as a faster and cheaper way than their traditional backup systems, since it allows them to send and receive money and settle transactions at a speed of between 5 and 10 seconds (much faster than Bitcoin). In addition, it allows the conversion between different currencies and cryptocurrencies. This is the story of Ripple and what are its main differences with Bitcoin.The Highlight about the NetworkRipple works differently than many digital currencies. Unlike Bitcoin, which is touted as a way to get away from central banks, Ripple can be actively used as a tool for bank payments. Your network is capable of handling up to 1,500 transactions per second compared to less than 10 with Bitcoin.One of the strengths of Bitcoin is its guarantee of hundred percent encrypted transactions thanks to the blockchain. But that does not make it accessible to hundreds of thousands of potential users. The Ripple network, for its part, wants to fill this gap. Although its technology was initially fully controlled by the startup, it has now begun to distribute to third parties that verify the transactions. This control has led to greater stability during network configuration, according to Ripple.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ripple", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Win"]}, {"title": "#NewCoinAlert: XRP on WazirX!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/wazirx/newfeaturealert-xrp-on-wazirx-5c42e662e75f?source=search_post", "author_name": "WazirX Bitcoin Exchange", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@wazirx", "publish_date": "2018-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-15", "readtime": "1.31", "claps": 284, "voters": 29, "content": "#NewCoinAlert: XRP on WazirX!WazirX Bitcoin ExchangeFollowMar 27, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readNamaste Tribe!

But banks were skeptical of using XRP, the company\u2019s cryptocurrency, to move money and while some have tested \u201cRippleNet\u201d as a SWIFT replacement / complement, XRP has less traction. (That could change later this year if the xRapid system leaves the beta test stage and is used for cross-border transfers.)While the company\u2019s success in breaking into the stolid banking industry remains worth watching, most of the short-term story has been around XRP and it\u2019s unusual characteristics. First, Ripple owns about 60% of all the XRP in the world. Second, that equals around 60 billion tokens. Third, even with XRP trading at a fraction of all-time highs the total value of Ripple\u2019s XRP is approaching $20 billion. Fourth, the company periodically sells some XRP to fund itself and also build its war chest.The controversy surrounding all that XRP led Ripple to place most of it in escrow, but each quarter it can sell some tokens. And despite the drop in value, Ripple did just that in Q2 of this year. Those tokens were worth $73.5 million and the proceeds go straight to the company. If you\u2019re new to this, it\u2019s almost what it sounds: Ripple owns a printing press for money. Because they sell the XRP in the open market, without coercion, to what by all accounts are willing buyers this is all legal.But that doesn\u2019t mean everything is copacetic. The idea that a company can generate tens of millions in cash each quarter by parceling out its own \u201ccurrency\u201d is unsettling at best and terrifying at worst. When Ripple was trading north of $3 per token, the company had around $200 billion in potential resources sloshing about. It\u2019s fair to note that the market was setting the price and therefore the value but it\u2019s equally reasonable to point out that XRP is essentially an invention of a six year old company, isn\u2019t particularly useful at this point, and is pretty much under the control of its creator.Two days ago, Garlinghouse participated in an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d conversation with former Bloomberg journalist Cory Johnson as the host / guy who filtered the questions. Johnson no longer works as a journalist but instead now serves as Ripple\u2019s own Chief Market Strategist so it should come as little surprise he ran the AMA to avoid any of the controversial issues surrounding the company. BitcoinExchangeGuide did a nice job of highlighting some of Garlinghouse\u2019s answers to questions and to say it reads like corporate PR is hardly a stretch.When we at The Block heard this event was going to happen, we hypothesized a really fun version of the conversation:JOHNSON: So the company can print money almost at will, isn\u2019t that a bad thing?GARLINGHOUSE: Let\u2019s be honest Cory, if you had a legal way to just conjure money, wouldn\u2019t you use it too? I mean c\u2019mon!Alas, that moment never occurred and Johnson even admitted during the AMA that \u201csome of the questions were really mean\u201d and glossed over them. They did, however, find time to talk about Garlinghouse\u2019s socks! (See 19:05 or so in the video of the AMA)What that meant was the most insightful moment came when Garlinghouse highlighted another piece of corporate PR, this time from Ripple CTO David Schwartz. Titled \u201cThe Inherently Decentralized Nature of XRP Ledger\u201d it attempts to demonstrate that XRP isn\u2019t controlled by Ripple. Schwartz argued that despite being the \u201cgold standard\u201d for decentralization both bitcoin and Ethereum actually have far more concentrated control than XRP does.BTC and ETH were the \u201cgold standard\u201d. But the way Ripple talks up XRP, it should be considered the \u201cunobtanium standard\u201d for decentralization!But this claim has little meaning, even if it correctly notes that a handful of mining pools do have a lot of power over bitcoin. Note that a CTO for bitcoin couldn\u2019t respond to Schwartz because \u2014 of course \u2014 there is no \u201cBitcoin Inc.\u201d Ripple argues that control of the XRP Ledger requires 80% of the so-called \u201cvalidators\u201d on the network to support the change over a two-week span.Because Ripple controls just 10 of the 150 validators, the claim goes, it has no special control over XRP and can\u2019t effect changes to the network without support. But is that really true? Here\u2019s how you can become a validator on the XRP Ledger. Now, you have to earn trust of other validators but the process for doing that is mostly by being recognizable and performing well. Given Ripple\u2019s nearly unlimited resources and credibility as an XRP validator, it could surely rapidly roll out additional validators. At first, perhaps just a few to not raise too much suspicion: \u201cWe need more performance in certain regions as we expand xRapid, so Ripple is adding validators in 14 countries today.\u201d With cloud computing so readily accessible, it wouldn\u2019t take much to make this happen.By then quietly doubling that footprint, Ripple could nearly overnight have enough validators to start validating its own adds to the network without any support. Or it could win over other validators, say, by providing a bounty in XRP \u2014 or US dollars for that matter.The design in place seems to turn over control of the XRP Ledger to the community, but Ripple is somewhat uniquely equipped to seize control of the network anytime it sees fit. That\u2019s a much harder feat to perform with bitcoin, if for no other reason than the high compute power require. Schwartz highlights that as a \u201cbug\u201d of bitcoin though it\u2019s arguably a feature\u201cThose using XRP and the XRP Ledger are able to make progress without mining, saving significant compute power and time.\u201dBut even he admits that Ripple has disproportionate influence over the validation process \u2014 even without the obvious manipulation method proposed above:Users on the XRP Ledger select a Unique Node List (UNL), a list of validators trusted by that user to order transactions\u2026 The network has a number of recommended UNLs, including one list Ripple recommends, and users can choose whichever one they prefer or create their own.So basically there\u2019s a central authority that tells you who to trust. You can trust others instead of it, but why would anyone?Schwartz goes further:Nevertheless, to increase the resiliency and diversity of the network, more than half of the validators on Ripple\u2019s recommended UNL are operated by people or groups external to the company, and Ripple continues to add even more independent validators to the list.So there\u2019s a list of validators that Ripple trusts, but don\u2019t confuse this with all the validators out there apparently (again, Ripple runs 10 of 150 it says, but here it recommends just \u201cmore than half\u201d externally \u2014 presumably nowhere near the other 140). Fundamentally, belief that Ripple won\u2019t manipulate its own list to favor its own validators is a belief that the company likes enough of what\u2019s going on to leave it all be.But, again, let\u2019s look back to January and the $200 billion of XRP the company once held. Even though the money printing press still works for Ripple, its output is a lot lower at today\u2019s prices. And while it\u2019s pointless speculation to guess where the price of Ripple will go from here, it\u2019s certainly possible the tokens will again be so valuable that Ripple can\u2019t risk XRP control falling into unfriendly hands.After all, if you had a machine that could print money, wouldn\u2019t you go to almost any length to protect it? We\u2019ll try to submit a question like that to the next Ripple AMA. Maybe they won\u2019t find it too \u201cmean\u201d and give us a straight answer.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Bitcoin", "Ripple"]}, {"title": "iOS Ripple effect in React Native", "post_link": "https://medium.com/react-native-motion/ios-ripple-effect-in-react-native-30ee97a5aa8c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Ot\u00e1hal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@xotahal", "publish_date": "2017-11-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-06", "readtime": "5.30", "claps": 173, "voters": 30, "content": "iOS Ripple effect in React NativeJi\u0159\u00ed Ot\u00e1halFollowNov 29, 2017 \u00b7 6 min readHey guys! It\u2019s been a while since I wrote an article about animation. I\u2019ve needed to solve a problem with Ripple effect for iOS recently. Here\u2019s tutorial about how I\u2019ve done that.I am currently looking for a new job or project. If you need a help, with either React Native or React, let me know, please ;) I will be happy to help, learn, discuss, etc. I am available to hire right now! LinkedIn or FacebookThe goal \u2026Create a RippleFeedback component that we can use for both Android and iOS. Since the Android version is pretty easy, using TouchableNativeFeedback, we won\u2019t talk about it. Anyway, you can see it in react-native-material-ui.The idea \u2026We\u2019ll get a content for a RippleFeedback component as children. In this case it\u2019s a Button component. Then we need to create Background Layer (BL) and Ripple Layer (RL) which is represented by rounded View component (circle). Those views will be wrapped by TouchableWithoutFeedback component, because we still need to provide events like onPress, onLongPress, etc.When I tried this feature on Android I noticed it behaves slightly different for onPress and onLongPress. You will see later in this text.Immediately after onLongPress is called the BL is displayed. When user releases the button BL is animated to default value and in the same time starts Ripple animation (opacity to zero and scale value to 1).onLongPressAfter onPress is called all of these animations happen in the same time. Opacity of BL is animated to maximum value, opacity of RL is animated to zero and RL\u2019s scale value is animated to 1. After all of these animations are finished, BL is animated to default value (zero) and RL is reset to default values. Note that they are animated and reset. You will see why we don\u2019t have to animate RL\u2019s values.onPressLet\u2019s code \u2026Here\u2019s a skeleton of code with Views rendered in default mode. You can see default animated values in constructor. RL\u2019s scale value (scaleValue) is set up to zero because we want it to start as a really small point (actually hidden point). And its opacity (opacityRippleValue) is set up to maxOpacity which is value between 0 and 1 (in this case it is 0.3). Last value is BL\u2019s opacity (opacityBackgroundValue) which started as a hidden layer (value is set up to zero) and after user presses it is animated to max opacity and back to zero. It makes a blink effect.A children node is passed to this component as a content. We just need to render it inside of TouchableWithoutFeedback component.Then we have a background layer (BL) and ripple layer (RL). BL is rendered in the same size as a container and RL is rendered as a circle with zero size by default. BL makes a blink effect and RL makes a ripple effect.Notice an order of components. We don\u2019t use zIndex. If we put children as a third child it would be over both layers Background and Ripple.One more thing here \u2014 pointerEvents. For both layers BL and RL we set up this to none because we don\u2019t want to get any events like an onPress. For container View, we set box-none which means we want to get only children events not events of container itself.Let\u2019s animate \u2026First of all we need to know the point where the Ripple Effect should start.Immediately after user presses the button, we store a point where user tapped. And as you can see, in renderRippleLayer, we use this point to set up the position of RL. In other words we put a center of circle to this point. Just note that the circle has still zero size in this moment.We\u2019ll start with onPress event and only with Background Layer (blink effect). You can see Animated.parallel that runs all animations from array in the same time. It will make sense once we push RL Animation to array (next example). Line 6 animates opacity from zero (default value) to max opacity. Then after the animation is finished we need to animate value back to default. We can use start\u2019s callback which is called exactly after the animation is finished. Now, we can animate opacity of BL back to default value. Here\u2019s how the animation looks like without Ripple Animation. Blink!Only Background Layer animation (Blink)Let\u2019s animate Ripple Layer. It\u2019s the same onPress method. I\u2019ve just commented what we\u2019ve seen in previous example. Now, we animate RL\u2019s opacity from default (maxOpacity) to zero and scale value from 0 to 1.After is finished, we need to set those animations to default values to be ready on next press. That\u2019s what setDefaultAnimatedValues does. We don\u2019t have to animate the values back to defaults (we just set them). Because it\u2019s actually hidden after animation is finished. See line 11 of previous example. We animated opacity to 0. That means it\u2019s hidden and we can set those values immediately without animation. Ripple Effect without BL looks like this.Only Ripple EffectAnd that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not so complicated, is it? Here\u2019s both of animations together.Both animation togetherThere\u2019s still onLongPress animation remaining. Anyway, it\u2019s almost the same like onPress animation. We just need to separate them. When user presses and holds the button we\u2019ll display BL. That means we animate BL\u2019s opacity from zero to max opacity. It seems like user holds the BL displayed during a holding of the button.Holding of the buttonThen we make the magic in onPressOut method. Opacity and scale of RL\u2019s is the same like in onPress. Only difference is we slowly animate BL\u2019s opacity back to default value. We have done this step in start\u2019s callback. But now, we have displayed BL in onLongPress already so we animate it back to default here, together with Ripple Effect. It looks like this.onLongPress animationEasy peasy \u2026I know, I know :) I needed that to be done for Reservio application which uses react-native-material-ui. Anyway, I hope there is someone who appreciates this and maybe learn something new or just gets an inspiration. Or questions?Note that it\u2019s not ready for production. For this purpose you can use react-native-material-ui that I\u2019m developing as an open source.I am currently looking for a new job or project.

Our full review, which is about 20 minutes long and will be published on January 12th, 2018 titled \u201cRipple Coin Review\u201d found here. The purpose of this summary is to introduce to the token, traction, criticisms, and how to buy it.Ripple (XRP) just became the second largest Cryptocurrency by market cap at an astonishing $122 billion dollars. Making Ripple\u2019s co-founder, Chris Larsen, the 8th wealthiest man on earth as he holds the equivalent of about $55B USD (as of January 4th, 2018 at 16:00 hrs EST). This token has divided the crypto community and faces a lot of criticism.IdeaRipple aims to be a solution to a lot of current cross-border banking issues that are currently plaguing the financial ecosystem on a global scale. Anyone who has sent a wire transfer through the banking system knows that cross-currency settlement can take many days and is often quite slow.Ripple purports these settlement issues are caused by manual settlement done in order to translate one bank\u2019s ledger system\u2019s transactions into another bank\u2019s ledger system. Ripple however introduces something called the interledger protocol which uses a new cryptocurrency (ripple [ XRP]) to settle accounts across two banks differing ledgers, allowing for much faster settlement times.Last 3 months of Ripple\u2019s Market cap and Price in USD via CoinMarketCap found here.TractionEven though the token has been out since 2014, the last 5 weeks represented an increase of over 1500% in price. And an astonishing increase of over 30,000% this year, from about 0.007 USD per token at the beginning of the year, to over $2 USD by the end of it. Market cap saw similar increases from $200M to $130B USD. There are over 38 billion tokens and the founders have kept most of them, so the valuation and market cap are currently deflated versus if there was a full circulation of the currency.Part of the reason the token has become so popular recently is social media. As ICOs are becoming more popular and people are investing more, the price of cheap altcoins is attracting a lot of people to invest in it. Even though the massive volume of Ripple tokens is one of the main reasons that the token is so \u201ccheap\u201d, price is all relative when not accounted with total token volume. The other aspect is ripple adding major banking partners recently which has driven major interest to it.TeamRipple\u2019s team is heavily stacked and connected to both cryptocurrencies and Fintech, which is one of the reasons that has justified their valuation and quick rise so far. Ripple was co-founded by Angel Investor Chris Larsen, and Software Programmer Jed McCaleb.Chris Larsen is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, he helped co-found Ripple, as well as multiple FinTech related companies such as E-Loan, OpenCoin, and Prosper Marketplace.Jed McCaleb, is well known for creating largest Bitcoin exchange ever by volume of BTC, the now defunct Mt Gox (hacked after McCaleb sold the company to Mark Karpeles). Jed is now worth $20B from his Ripple\u2019s token and is on the top 40 richest people on the world.Besides the co-founders, the team at Ripple has a large team of crypto veterans, as well as partnerships with six international banks.How to BuyRipple can be bought on various exchanges through fiat (USD) or other cryptocurrencies. The biggest exchanges that support ripple are Bitstamp and Kraken in North America. Gatehub is also a way to acquire ripple and basically allows you to tap into ripple\u2019s global consensus network in order to exchange fiat into ripple. Some of the most well-respected exchanges, such as Coinbase, do not currently have plans to buy or sell ripple, since there are still a lot of concerns regarding its price, volatility, and team practices. For a detailed breakdown here\u2019s an article by CNBC on how to buy the token.Note: Complete step-by-step of purchasing Ripple available on full review.ConclusionRipple\u2019s future is very promising, but comes with a lot of complication since it involves simplifying the current banking industry. In our full review we expose the many concerns about the implementation and use of technology (specifically the introduction of the ripple token as opposed to another token completely decoupled from ripple\u2019s founders using the same protocols), as well as certain decisions made by the Ripple team with what we consider unsatisfactory explanations.However, the ripple team\u2019s decisions are calculated and well considered and if they do manage to fully implement their platform and onboard the global financial system, they will definitely contribute to a huge leap in international banking, making it as easy as intra-country banking is today.We will be addressing the good, the bad, and the ugly of this cryptocurrency in detail through our full review scheduled January 12th, 2018.Looking to help?Support us on Bountey! https://www.bountey.com/bestoficosWant to stay up to date in ICOs?Visit us at https://thebestoficos.comHave an interesting story?Write us at info@bestoficos.comDisclaimerThis website and the information contained herein is not intended to be a source of investment, financial, technical, tax, or legal advice.

SpencerFollowApr 16 \u00b7 5 min readCrypto tribes are like factions in the era of technology. They believe wholeheartedly that their altcoin is the best, and that Bitcoin is utterly disruptive to everything.They also petition, engage and exert a positive network effect influence of the most peculiar order.Crypto News Cycle Borders on Misinformation, Again!Take the XRP community for example. And, frankly I feel the crypto news cycle is very prone to bordering on fake news, and this for me is a weird case in point.The popular telecommunication app Skype is considering the integration of XRP for micropayment. Well, that\u2019s not exactly true. Basically XRP\u2019s community wants Skype to consider them, which isn\u2019t the same thing at all, right? This is where integrity and objective news fall apart in the crypto news cycle entirely, and it\u2019s a disgrace to how the media runs in a world of algorithms.Ripple & XRP Could be Disrupted by StablecoinsRipple has been putting in a lot of effort to net many partners and customers across various sectors in a bid to ensure that XRP stays afloat and popular. I get that, but it doesn\u2019t mean XRP has a hope of being integrated into Skype. What would be the incentives for Microsoft to even consider that? Why would they not just build their own stablecoin, like Facebook is doing for WhatsApp? It makes little sense.One XRP is worth about 3 cents, and would be an interesting way to exchange money globally on Skype. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens with Bakkt, of which Microsoft is a significant partner.I do think for global transfers, stablecoins make much more sense. I think in spite of banking partnerships Ripple could be completely disrupted in the next five years. Most cryptos born before 2017 will be, it\u2019s just how cryptoeconomics in its infancy will work. These are early days, and even if XRP seems reputable to some, it isn\u2019t even decentralized and probably is a security (just ask the SEC). This is because of the relationship between Ripple and XRP.XRP Tribe Demands Skype IntegrationWhen XRP \u201cdemands\u201d Skype integrate XRP, it\u2019s a Microsoft decision. It\u2019s also not how business transactions work. You can\u2019t strong-arm a major tech leader into doing what your own biased community wants. That sounds more like a crypto cartel than how the internet actually works.While Microsoft does a fair job of supporting open source with the acquisition of GitHub, payments or decentralization are likely not something very high on its priority list. With Amazon, it virtually owns the enterprise cloud sector. The Cloud is the very definition of enterprise software that\u2019s centralized.Ripple the company, which has built technology that uses XRP to facilitate cross-border payments sort of devalues the trustworthiness of XRP. For cross border payments, it\u2019s a crowded space and likely only to get worse. There\u2019s virtually no incentive for Skype to give in to the request (demand) of XRP\u2019s community. Skype is a legacy comms platform. Most people who use it are GenX or Babyboomer. Crypto on the other hand is a Millennial and GenZ phenomenon.Why Would Microsoft not make its own Stablecoin Instead?Microsoft is highly likely to join JP Morgan and Facebook with its own stablecoin, since it eventually needs to keep up with how younger consumers operate. If it doesn\u2019t do it, others will, which will take market share away from it. Skype is a good pilot case study for such a stablecoin pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, but I\u2019m not sure XRP is.The \u201cXRP Army\u201d is somewhat dubious as many of the crypto factions are, oblivious to real-world considerations. Airdrops and bounty programs created division in the crypto landscape, since many of these altcoins don\u2019t even have products that can scale over time. When you invest in a product, you over-value its potential, that\u2019s totally normal. But demanding BigTech adopt your solution discredits your community.Among Crypto Factions, \u201cXRP Army\u201d is UniqueSo a group of XRP community is expecting Skype, a global telecommunication application to integrate XRP as a micro payment system. Even more curiously, they drafted a post on Skype\u2019s user voice (as a new idea on Skype customer feedback) and elaborated their prospect by detailing the key aspects of why and how should Skype consider XRP micropayments. What could Microsoft do? They said they would discuss it internally.You can read their Skype idea for XRP here.Cool idea? Or spectacular act of desperation from a crypto faction in decline. Fake News or something Microsoft would actually consider seriously?This David Olliver is an interesting character.Chat Apps will Integrate Crypto But Don\u2019t Expect Skype to be Among ThemA world with competing crypto \u201carmies\u201d is highly problematic. Communities like these actually create more bureaucracy (as in the case of Ethereum) or more incentives for fraudulent profiteering. This includes remarkable propaganda and PR spam bordering on misinformation.Following the detailed proposal, the Skype team responded to the post and quickly edited its title from \u201cAdd XRP micropayments to Skype\u201d to \u201cAdd Cryptocurrency micropayments to Skype (XRP and others).\u201dI highly doubt the Skype or Microsoft team are up to date on the objectives of the various crypto factions or their benefits and cons as solutions.In 2019, crypto factions are basically getting desperate because they see the null at the end of the tunnel. The crypto winter means only the best solutions will make it into the next era of cryptoeconomics and a rising token economy.As a blockchain historian, it\u2019s a bit hard for me to read the crypto-news cycle that\u2019s so lacking a business knowledge perspective. The tyranny of the crowd and mob rule perverted with bounty programs and airdrops might end really badly for some Millennial and GenZ investors who believed they were ahead of the game.Full disclosure, I have been significantly trolled by the XRP community on Twitter, so my opinions may also be biased. I\u2019m losing faith in the crypto factions, and I\u2019m probably not alone.However integration chat and crypto is a strong use case that will be done by Telegram, Line, WhatsApp and many others. It\u2019s inevitable, just not likely to have Skype as a leader among them.", "responses": 6, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Xrp", "Cryptocurrency", "Media", "Payments"]}, {"title": "Ripple \u2014 review.

We\u2019ll be posting one article about one coin from the portfolio with #cix100coinreview hashtag.Today we would like to review Ripple. Further Perspectives.Ripple (XPR) is a cryptocurrency which was launched in 2012 and focused on the banking sector of the economy. Ripple\u2019s aim was to secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.The network is decentralized and can operate without the participation of Ripple Labs. At the end of 2017 Ripple was amongst the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, together with Bitcoin, Ethereum. In fact, Ripple has the potential to replace Visa and Mastercard, but this won\u2019t\u2019 happen. Let\u2019s see why.How did it all start and how does it work?The predecessor of the Ripple payment protocol, called \u2018Ripplepay\u2019, was first developed in 2004 by Ryan Fugger in Vancouver. Fugger came up with this idea after working on a local exchange trading system. His intention was to allow individuals and communities to create their own money. The first implementation of this system, RipplePay.com, was launched in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure transfer options for members of the online community via the Internet.This led to the idea of a new system developed by Jed McCaleb of the eDonkey network, which was designed and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz. In May 2011, they started developing an electronic payment system in which transactions were confirmed by network participants, rather than the mining process used by bitcoin.The updated version of the Ripple system differed from the existing economic infrastructure bit by bit by the lack of dependence on online exchange services. In addition, Ripple uses less electricity than bitcoin and transactions are much faster.Integration with the banking marketSince 2013, Ripple has taken a clear course to work with the banking sector. The protocol accepts all new financial institutions to \u201coffer an alternative remittance\u201d for consumers. The first bank which tried to use Ripple was Fidor Bank in Munich. In October 2013, rumors appeared in the press about Ripple\u2019s cooperation with ZipZap, which was later called a threat to Western Union.In 2014, Ripple worked with several projects, including an application for the iPhone which allowed users to make payments through the phone in a decentralized manner, without contacting the bank. Unfortunately, this project was not successful and was closed. Then, in July of the same year, Ripple Labs proposed Codius, a project to develop a new smart contract system, without reference to specific programming languages.On the 5th of May 2015, FINCEN fined Ripple Labs and XRP II for $700,000 for violating the Bank Secrecy Act, based on the addition to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of 2013. The management at Ripple tried to rectify the situation and entered into an agreement allowing XRP and Ripple Trade to operate only through registered financial service institutions (MSBs). The improvement did not change the protocol itself but added AML transaction monitoring in the network and improved transaction analysis.ConfidentialityAlthough transactional information is publicly available, information about payments is not. Thus, it is difficult to link transaction information to a particular user or corporation.Ripple \u2014 is the \u201ceternal\u201d ICO?Recently, many users stated that Ripple is an \u201ceternal\u201d ICO. The claim was filed in the same form as for other ICO startups. Ripple was accused of offering unregistered securities to retail investors.Investor Ryan Coffey who states he is acting on behalf of all buyers of Ripple tokens claims that Ripple Labs and its head Brad Garlinghouse sold him unregistered XRP tokens resulting in losses of over 32% of his initial investment.Ripple press \u2014 secretary Tom Channik commented on the trial in an e-mail:\u201cWe found out about the lawsuit filed by the judge and published on Twitter did not receive an official summons to the court. As in the case of any other civil action, we will have an opportunity to assess the validity of the charges or lack thereof. Only the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can decide whether XRP is a security token or not. We continue to believe that XRP should not be classified as a security token\u201d.For his part, the plaintiff states:\u201cXRP is a security token. The respondents themselves admitted that investors in XRP could safely rely on profit and details of this more than once publicly advertised the positive price dynamics of the token\u201d.According to the statement of claim, in January Coffey bought 650 XRP tokens at a price of approximately $2.60 per coin, spending $1690, and a few weeks later he sold at a loss of $551.The SEC\u2019s statement inJuly17 forced a discussion about whether the Ripple token XRP and its more successful competitor Ethereum could be a security token.The former chairman of the Commission for Futures Trading, Gary Jensler, said in April that XRP and the Ethereum met the criteria for securities.This event caused a public outcry and attracted the attention of the SEC and other legislative bodies. No answer was given due to the lack of regulation still within these financial markets.What to expect in the future? Growth or fall?A huge rise in the\u0441ryptocurrency market in December 2017 helped Ripple to gain a foothold at $0.5 and hold these positions for quite a long time. As for the platform itself its future is not certain.Rippleis a good competitor for VISA, Mastercard, and other payment systems, however, it lacks widespread use, ease of payment execution and adaptation to the average user.Another, severe \u201cstumbling block,\u201d is the fact that more than 20% of the total emission of tokens in 100 billion XPR is in the hands of developers, which has repeatedly been discussed in the community.Ripple has the capacity the freeze funds. The Ripple gateways protocol freezes those trading assets to which they granted access. For example, the Bitstamp exchange gateway can freeze the USD of a user who has configured the credibility of the gateway. This opportunity was introduced at the request of regulators in response to a reversal of focus on the banking sector.The freezing of funds was applied to one of the former founders when he was trying to sell a large amount of XRP in a single transaction. Ripple intervened and utilised its \u2018Balance Freeze\u2019 feature. By doing so it enabled the company to stop the movement of XRP. In this case, since XRP functions without a gateway, no one can freeze XRP, but it is possible to freeze those assets to which XRP is exchanged.ConclusionThe Ripple system has a lot of obvious disadvantages and at the same time pluses. The company has good prospects for growing, due to its bias towards the banking sector. The position of the Ripple Labs management goes between creating competition for such giants as Visa and Mastercard, but at the same time, periodically in the media, there are references to that Ripple testing as a payment system.But at the same time ,ordinary users are confused by the fact that Ripple is inherently completely centralized. For example, Ripple has the capacity the freeze funds.. The Ripple gateways protocol freezes those trading assets to which they granted access. For example, the Bitstamp exchange gateway can freeze the USD of a user who has configured the credibility of the gateway.

Knight Foundation, Eric Schmidt\u2019s Innovation Endeavors, Pejman Mar Ventures, 500 Startups, Joi Ito, Director of MIT Media Lab, and angel investors Blake Krikorian, Magdalena Yesil and Shane Smith.Ripple is a web and mobile app that shines a spotlight on local stories at the neighborhood level. These stories, says its founder Razmig Hovaghimian, go largely untold or undiscovered \u2014 but with the right amplification, they have the potential to become global narratives. Not only is Ripple a compelling media product, it\u2019s an example of the curious, tenacious, mission-driven entrepreneurship that we at Matter want to celebrate and elevate.Matter\u2019s Managing Partner, Corey Ford, says of the investment: \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you come across such an experienced founder tackling the core problem of how informed we are as a society. For us it was an absolute no-brainer to get behind Razmig and support him on his next big adventure.\u201dFrom East to West to East to WestYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a founder with a more global personal narrative than Razmig. Born and raised in Cairo to an Armenian family, he moved to LA alone when he was 16 years-old to attend high school, working the graveyard shift at a gas station and at a Subway in the evenings to fund his studies. At winter school, where he had to take extra classes to catch up with the U.S. high school curriculum, he met his future wife, an exchange student from Nagano, Japan, who\u2019s now an award-winning filmmaker.Razmig\u2019s startup education goes back to that decision to fly halfway around the world in search of opportunities in the United States.\u201cMaybe I was my first startup. I had to come and figure it out. I know I always wanted to build, and I know I wanted to do it outside of my comfort zone. I like ambiguity, fast pace and feel most creative when the difficulty level is high. You\u2019re forced to build.\u201d ~ Razmig HovaghimianAfter his first business idea (a late night pizza delivery service using a bakery\u2019s ovens after hours) flopped, Razmig was accepted to the University of California at Berkeley to study Political Economy with a minor in Business Administration. He then worked as a management consultant in Japan before attending Stanford Business School for his MBA. He and his wife have been taking turns to move for each other since high school. Their first child was born in the United States, their second child was born in Singapore. They also lived for some time in London, and have recently returned to the San Francisco Bay Area.Despite, or perhaps because of, his broad global perspective, Razmig has chosen to focus his third enterprise, Ripple, on hyperlocal news reporting. That\u2019s not only because he\u2019s convinced there is an unsatisfied appetite for it among consumers, but because he thinks it will help bridge the gap between individuals, communities and even nations.\u201cUntold stories are all around us, from yours, to your neighbor\u2019s, to those from far away who have more in common with us than we may think,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to create narratives that connect our human stories across borders.\u201dCrossing bordersThe genesis of Ripple goes back to 2006 when Razmig spent the summer between his first and second years at Graduate School with the United Nations in Sudan. This was when Sudan was one nation (in 2011 South Sudan seceded from the North and became an independent country). \u201cThere were untold stories all around me,\u201d Razmig says of his time in Juba, living in a tent. \u201cFrom seeing thugs rent guns for $5 a night, to foreign prisoners building oil rigs, to discovering that a simple rainfall insurance could solve centuries\u2019 old tribal conflicts, to seeing dozens of war children return home to Uganda and share their stories of conflicts we had never heard of. Crazy stuff that never made it to CNN or the BBC.\u201dHe dabbled with creating a citizen journalism platform for Nokia Symbian phones, which were all the rage back then, called My Voice: \u201cI thought what if I could build an app where you could just snap a photo and share the story with the world?\u201d But it was too early, so he shelved the project.Embracing EmbraceHis next venture, Embrace, was born out of a group project at the Stanford d.school where Razmig was classmates with Corey Ford. The students were applying design thinking principles such as need-finding and prototyping to entrepreneurship. Embrace, which is now part of Thrive Networks, developed a portable, reusable incubator for premature babies, decreasing the unit cost from $20,000 to $25, making them accessible to communities in developing countries.After the class ended, his team knew they had cracked a difficult problem and wanted to continue with their social enterprise. They raised money for further R&D. It took four years to bring the product to market \u2014 Razmig says they since learned that calling it a \u201cmedical device\u201d automatically created more bureaucratic hurdles \u2014 and the moved manufacturing to India, one of the nations where demand is highest. The Embrace Warmer is now distributed in 14 countries, served more than 200,000 infants, and has won international recognition.Viki: Wiki(pedia) + VideoRazmig\u2019s next venture, Viki, evolved to position him at the intersection of media and technology. He defines Viki as \u201cHulu for the rest of the world, with a community of tens of thousands of fans translating TV shows and movies into more than 200 languages.\u201d Originally intended to be a language-learning tool through subtitles, Viki developed over time into a global TV platform unlocking premium content and distributing shows to the rest of the world.In 2009, Razmig decided to quit his job as a senior VP at NBC Universal and pursue Viki full-time, having perceived the need for big studios to look aggressively outside the U.S. to new markets for growth opportunities. Propelled by a US$4.3 million series A round co-led by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman at Greylock Partners and Marc Andreessen at Andreessen Horowitz, Viki introduced its content arbitrage business model to the world.\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive to license TV shows for the home market. We began primarily licensing shows from Asia and brought them to the U.S., Europe and Latin America. Once the Viki community put subtitles in English, Spanish and other languages, we opened up the whole world to TV series and movies, increasing the content\u2019s reach by more than five times on average, and at a fraction of the cost.\u201d ~ Razmig HovaghimianBy crowdsourcing translations by up to 500 people at once, Viki can usually offer a video with subtitles in 10 languages within 24 hours. Its most popular shows regularly reach more than 50 languages. The subtitles are up-voted or down-voted and locked in by a designated moderator. Razmig says quality is so high that broadcasters are coming to Viki asking for subtitling support rather than hiring translators themselves.Viki now supports more than 200 languages, close to 20% of which are endangered. Per month, viewing time is in the billions of minutes; monthly active users surpass 40 million.Razmig says that the team started licensing content globally and learning lessons from the audience data, which sometimes revealed surprising trends: \u201cWe have North Koreans watching South Korean shows, we have Greeks watching Turkish shows, we have Egyptian films breaking first in Indonesia, we have Japanese TV series with the first language translated on it being Tagalog or Lithuanian.\u201d He refers to Viki as the \u201ctorso\u201d of the content body \u2014 Hollywood is the prominent head, YouTube is the long, fragmented tail, and Viki makes accessible all the shows in-between.Viki Data Visualization (wired.co.uk), Where Local TV Gets Seen Overseas | 03 SEP \u201814The success of Viki underscored Razmig\u2019s belief in the power of media, technology and community to act as the connective tissue of society. He fondly remembers how he and his father would watch Bollywood movies together every Saturday in Cairo. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t understand it but we would be so entertained,\u201d he reminisces. \u201c[Viki is] building this cultural bridge between great entertainment and fans elsewhere. Global content is so important because it has so many stories and layers that can cut across cultures.\u201dRakuten, the Japanese e-commerce company, acquired Viki in 2013 for more than $200 million. Razmig became the company\u2019s Senior Executive Officer of Global Content and sits on the Rakuten board as an observer. But it was time for him to revive an old passion project.Returning to Ripple\u201cWe said we\u2019ll do it if it\u2019s important, before it\u2019s big. Hopefully, it\u2019s both.\u201d ~ Razmig HovaghimianTen years after he had the My Voice idea in Sudan, Razmig got together with a couple of \u201cinspiring\u201d friends to explore it anew. He slowly recruited Ripple\u2019s founding team from his various projects, as well as from YouTube News and The State, to build out the app. They started with data science, analyzing troves of data from various sources, including Twitter, to map news sources by city.In so doing, they realized that out of millions of news and local stories breaking each day, less than 5% were tagged by location coordinates. They also found that in many cities, neighborhood-level stories were missing \u2014 the stories Razmig felt were critical to sparking real conversations in a community. The next step was to develop a pilot program to recruit local storytellers in San Francisco and Oakland, California, to report on the neighborhoods they live in. Recruitment later expanded to New York, London, Cairo and Bangkok.The Ripple team (left to right): Marcos Voltolini, Razmig Hovaghimian, Ryo Chikazawa, Dan Wascovich, Melissa Mazman, Jason Hwang, Wallace Harrison the 20th (lap), Otis Taylor Jr.The lifeblood of Ripple\u2019s platform today is its city news feeds. Ripple offers video news and stories through its community of contributors, known as Ripple Correspondents, combined with curated news from local media partners. Users in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, for example, will find daily stories from Ripple Correspondents on the ground in the Mission, who live and report from there, as well as from hyper-local news partners, such as KQED (NPR), Mission Local and Hoodline. Global content partners include VICE Media, Coconuts Media, Global Voices, News Deeply (a Matter Four company) and Bustle.Each city has about ten dedicated Ripple correspondents writing fresh, hyper-local stories. In the future, about half of their stories will be video. \u201cThink about Ripple as your \u2018nearby button,\u2019\u201d says Razmig. \u201cWherever you are you can get a feed that\u2019s very specific to your location, even within a city.\u201d Users will be able to \u201cripple\u201d stories they like to a larger audience and broader radius.Razmig feels that news in its current form is still very one-directional, with journalists doling out the stories they believe people want to read or watch (a model that Matter Four portfolio company Hearken is also seeking to overturn). His mission for Ripple aligns with his early urge to create a citizen journalism app, bringing to light hidden narratives and sparking conversations around them. Now a much more seasoned entrepreneur, his approach been refined and informed by his experiences building Embrace and Viki. He\u2019s focusing first on the intersection of content and community, which he says is 80% of the product, and the part that excites him the most.\u201cI love the untold stories. We want to focus on the stories that matter. Ripple\u2019s a little bit like Viki in that it\u2019s also the torso of news and local stories. It\u2019s not the head, it\u2019s not what you\u2019re going to see on CNN or BBC, but it\u2019s not the clickbait stories either. It\u2019s that important middle, which is broken at the discovery level, is largely underreported, and it won\u2019t even index if you don\u2019t \u2018follow\u2019 the right people. We\u2019re here to unlock millions of stories around us that are waiting to be seen.\u201d ~ Razmig Hovaghimian", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Startup", "News", "Hyperlocal"]}, {"title": "Powerful interest groups", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@reveal/trumps-puddle-and-ditch-order-will-have-destructive-ripple-effect-fa88d8fbb5e0?source=search_post", "author_name": "Reveal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@reveal", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-30", "readtime": "9.13", "claps": 45, "voters": 26, "content": "The (Un)Scientific MethodTrump\u2019s \u2018puddle and ditch\u2019 order will have destructive ripple effectRevealFollowJun 26, 2017 \u00b7 10 min readPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order in February to roll back the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d rule. He called it a \u201cvery destructive and horrible rule.\u201d Credit: Aude Guerrucci/picture-alliance/dpa/AP ImagesBy Jane KayAs President Donald Trump signed one of his first executive orders, he was surrounded by smiling, clapping homebuilders, farmers and other supporters eager to see the new president rein in a 45-year-old law protecting the nation\u2019s waterways.The Environmental Protection Agency has \u201ctruly run amok\u201d by saving \u201cnearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmer\u2019s land,\u201d Trump told the gathering. Calling it a \u201cmassive power grab,\u201d he added, \u201cif you want to build a new home \u2026 you have to worry about getting hit with a huge fine if you fill in as much as a puddle \u2014 just a puddle \u2014 on your lot.\u201dBut these so-called puddles and ditches, according to scientists across the country, are fundamental to the nation\u2019s drinking water supplies and to wildlife, including many rare animals and plants.In February, Trump ordered his EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, to throw out a 2015 rule that protects seasonal streams and small isolated ponds, which would shrink the reach of the 1972 Clean Water Act by narrowing the definition of \u201cwaters of the United States.\u201dIn its place, Trump asked for a new rule that, in effect, would eliminate protection for tens of thousands of wetlands from coast to coast. What\u2019s at stake? Seasonal pools hidden in California grasslands and Maine forests, mountain streams in Arizona, freshwater marshes along the Gulf Coast, cypress swamps in Florida, glacial prairie potholes pockmarking the Midwest and more.Based on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s National Wetlands Inventory, at least 20 million acres of vernal pools, potholes, salt flats, creeks and other isolated wetlands would be put at risk if the EPA follows Trump\u2019s directions.And as many as 60 percent of U.S. streams would lose protection, according to the agency\u2019s own calculations. These headwaters and ephemeral streams and creeks contribute to the drinking water supplies of more than 117 million Americans.The changes are on a fast track: Pruitt already initiated the process to overturn the existing rule and is drafting a new one, which he has promised to unveil by year\u2019s end.Powerful interest groupsFor decades, developers, landowners, growers, energy companies, mines and other industries have tried to limit their obligations to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act.Opposition to the Obama administration rule comes from business groups that are heavyweights in lobbying federal lawmakers and agencies on an array of issues, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which spent $104 million on all lobbyists last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The American Petroleum Institute spent $6 million in 2016, the National Association of Home Builders spent $4.4 million and the American Farm Bureau Federation, $3.8 million.Granger MacDonald, whose companies have developed multi-family apartment projects in 25 Texas cities, and Georgia third-generation farmer Zippy Duvall attended Trump\u2019s signing ceremony. MacDonald, chairman of the homebuilders association, commended Trump for taking the first step toward overturning a rule that \u201cgoes so far as to regulate manmade ditches and isolated ponds on private property.\u201dDuvall, a poultry, cattle and hay producer and president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, called the rule \u201creckless and unlawful.\u201dThe golf industry also lobbied against the water rule, which suggests that Trump, who owns 12 golf courses in the United States, could benefit financially from killing it. Golf course owners worry that their ponds and drainage areas might be subject to provisions about pesticide runoff and filling of wetlands.Trump didn\u2019t mention effects on golf courses or his other property in his remarks, but he did say it\u2019s a \u201cvery destructive and horrible rule\u201d and he\u2019s \u201cbeen hearing about it for years.\u201dNo projects have ever been affected by the 2015 rule. That\u2019s because business groups \u2014 including the farm and homebuilder associations \u2014 joined 31 states and 91 members of Congress arguing in court that the EPA had overstepped its authority. They won a stay, so the rule has not been enforced as the legal wrangling continues.Pruitt, as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, led this multi-state lawsuit against the agency he now oversees. Under pressure, Pruitt has recused himself from the lawsuit. But he did not recuse himself from the rule revisions ordered by Trump. Pruitt\u2019s former general counsel in Oklahoma, Sarah Greenwalt, is now a top EPA official involved in rewriting the rule. Her name also is on the lawsuit against the EPA, but she has not recused herself.Paul Jones, a former EPA official who reviewed permits for filling wetlands in California, Nevada and Arizona for 27 years until he retired last year, said he was worried about the administration\u2019s quick move to weaken the Clean Water Act.\u201cThe minute we turn our backs,\u201d Jones said, \u201cthe forces of industry, agriculture and real estate destroy the waters of the United States right under our noses.\u201dA rancher\u2019s vernal poolsHigh above California\u2019s Central Valley, winter rains and melting snow gush down the craggy face of the Sierra Nevada, turning the valley green. Rivulets trickle through creeks and pools, filling the often-dry San Joaquin River, which flows to the delta as a source of drinking and crop water before heading on to San Francisco Bay.Vernal pools mark the Sierra foothills and valley floor, where land developers dream of subdivisions and growers of orchards.Driving south on little roads east of Highway 99, orchards turn to natural grassland. From atop China Hat Ridge, the Chance Ranch encompasses 8,000 acres. Rainstorms ending the record drought inundated clusters of vernal pools here.The pools slow runoff, store water and filter sediment before spilling into narrow swales that run to unnamed creeks, connecting to the Merced River and eventually the San Joaquin. Salamanders, frogs and other creatures rush to complete their lifecycles before the water dries up. Growing in the green pools are colorful wildflowers.Rancher Jeff Chance has a fondness and appreciation for these pools that bloom in spring, saying: \u201cThe cattle can find water. They don\u2019t have to walk too far.\u201d His family keeps the pools natural in exchange for added rangeland from The Nature Conservancy, an environmental group.\u201cRanchers are the best caretakers. We don\u2019t like to mess up anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe like the horse and the gooseneck trailer. We don\u2019t like the tractor and the plow.\u201dSeasonal pools such as these are living examples of Trump\u2019s \u201cpuddles and ditches.\u201dThe revised waters definition that Trump advised Pruitt to adopt likely would eliminate protection for pools and ponds, as well as streams that don\u2019t run most of the year or are not continuously connected by surface water to navigable waters, such as bays, rivers and the Great Lakes.Scientists say this definition is not scientifically sound and would leave important natural resources unprotected from bulldozers and plows. It also would change which waters would be protected from pollution from sewage plants, industries and farms.\u201cThis new definition clearly would not be based on science,\u201d said Ralph W. Tiner, a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist and author of two textbooks and 200 scientific papers on wetlands. \u201cA change like this would put in jeopardy the quality of the nation\u2019s water and the fate of the nation\u2019s wildlife.\u201dThe EPA\u2019s website says wetlands are \u201cbiological supermarkets,\u201d among the world\u2019s most productive ecosystems, comparable to coral reefs and rainforests. More than half of the country\u2019s wetlands have been lost since 1780, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, and losses continue, with recent mapping showing about 110 million acres in the contiguous United States.Linking land and water, wetlands are essential for cleansing and recharging groundwater in underground basins, controlling flooding and providing life support for waterfowl and other wildlife.\u201cLike diamonds, they can be small, but extremely valuable,\u201d the Society of Wetland Scientists wrote in a letter to Trump in March.The Scalia definitionTrump specifically asked Pruitt for a new definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d that mimics language used by the late Justice Antonin Scalia in a Supreme Court split decision a decade ago. The EPA says that definition covers only \u201crelatively permanent waters, and wetlands with a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters.\u201dExamples of what\u2019s at risk are found throughout the country: Thousands of inland basins from New Jersey to Florida fill with rain and then evaporate. Prairie pothole wetlands in the upper Midwest mostly are connected by water underground. In the Southwest, 80 percent of streams flow only after rainfall, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\u201cIn California alone, we have lost thousands of acres in the last two decades,\u201d said Jones, the former EPA biologist, who worked on national science teams determining which wetlands should come under the Clean Water Act. \u201cTo adopt the Scalia definition would only further weaken the ability of agencies to regulate wetlands and streams.\u201dDeciding what qualifies should be a task for scientists, Tiner said, because understanding how various wetlands contribute to ecological and hydrological functions takes considerable expertise. For instance, headwaters linked to downstream waters only by seasonal flows and underground water would not meet the conditions of the Scalia definition.\u201cIt makes little sense to try to maintain biological, chemical and hydrological integrity of our nation\u2019s water and exclude the source of the streams,\u201d Tiner said.Also, potholes from North Dakota to Montana and Texas could be excluded because they are connected mainly by groundwater, not surface waters.\u201cPrairie potholes are the duck factories of the North American continent,\u201d Tiner said.During droughts, prairie potholes might be the only watery green places for wildlife, he added, including some species that are rare or endangered.\u201cThink of all the aquatic animals living in streams and adapted to the natural pulses of water,\u201d Tiner said. \u201cLet\u2019s say you filled the intermittent streams or the headwater wetlands. If you didn\u2019t have the high water flows, what would happen to the many species of fish that spawned on overflowed floodplains? They would vanish.\u201dJeanne Christie, executive director of the Association of State Wetland Managers, said many state scientists are struggling with the proposed rule changes.\u201cThe words used in the court decision are not terminology previously used by scientists,\u201d Christie said. \u201cSo in order to have a scientific basis for identifying these streams, the EPA and the (Army) Corps (of Engineers) will have to do a crosswalk between science and these new words. For instance, what did Scalia mean by \u2018relatively permanent waters?\u2019 \u201d\u2018Confusing and cumbersome\u2019 rulesUnder the Obama rule, property owners must seek federal permits if they want to dam, grade or fill vernal pools, potholes or other wetlands for construction or crops, and they must replace the lost wetlands elsewhere.California Farm Bureau Federation attorney Kari Fisher calls the rule \u201cconfusing and cumbersome for farmers and ranchers.\u201d For example, ditches are exempted under certain circumstances, \u201cbut the burden falls on the landowner, and it\u2019s difficult to prove.\u201dZippy Duvall of the American Farm Bureau Federation said last year that a Senate committee investigation found instances of farmers being told to stop plowing fields or planting trees and to preserve their own tire ruts as wetlands.The Senate and congressional Western Caucuses, predominantly made up of Republicans, have said the regulation stymies economic growth.\u201cDuring the campaign, Donald Trump showed his familiarity with the complaints from the Republican wing that accuses over-reaching environmental protection of gobbling up private property,\u201d said Reed Hopper, a senior attorney for the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation. \u201cThe rule is an abuse of regulatory power. It\u2019s a prime focus of our regulatory rollback.\u201dEnvironmental groups are concerned about the rapid pace of the rollback: Trump\u2019s executive order was issued Feb. 28. A week later, the EPA published its intent to rescind and replace the Obama rule. On April 19, Pruitt heard comments from local and state representatives. The rule to rescind was sent to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget on May 3, and the new one is expected to be proposed this fall.\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s executive order had such high priority because it has the potential to broadly undermine Clean Water Act protections in one fell swoop,\u201d said Jon Devine, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. \u201cAs a result, it is being pushed by numerous and varying sectors that discharge pollution and are regulated by the law.\u201dThe current rule was years in the making, with more than 1.1 million comments over seven months and 400 meetings with interested parties, plus a peer-reviewed EPA scientific report that prompted 130,000 comments. The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and 24 other environmental groups sent a letter to Pruitt seeking the same effort from the Trump administration. Pruitt, however, told Congress to expect a final rule early next year.\u201cWe have every expectation the matter will be fast tracked,\u201d Devine said, \u201cwith a brief comment period, to get the Obama rule off the books.\u201dThis story was edited by Marla Cone and copy edited by Nikki Frick.Jane Kay can be reached at JaneKayEnvironment@gmail.com.

Ripple had another epic one month run starting in December, 2017. At it\u2019s peak, in January, 2018, Ripple was the 10th most valuable company in the United States. It was worth 15% more then Walmart.But, while almost everyone in crypto has heard of Ripple, few have even a basic understanding of what the company does, let alone appreciate its long term ambitions. What is XRP? What is it used for? Should it be classified as a security? Is it worthy of a $35 billion valuation? How much control does Ripple Labs, the team behind XRP, actually have over the world\u2019s second largest crypto asset (as of date of publication)? To answer these questions and more, we have three crypto industry experts, each with a unique perspective on crypto, to discuss the complex narratives that drive Ripple today.

The platform will allow for carbon credits to be traded as tokens on the public blockchain.Whilst carbon credits are themselves nothing new, a decentralised market could provide much-needed transparency to the process of offsetting carbon emissions.This announcement may be the first in series of new projects by IBM using the Stellar blockchain. In October last year, the tech giant announced it was working with a group of banks to create cross-border payment solutions using the Stellar network. Then, in April, Jesse Lund, IBM\u2019s VP of Blockchain Technologies, hinted at more announcements to come.Public, yet PermissionedThe Veridium partnership will be the first time IBM is creating a token on a public network. While the network will be public, it won\u2019t be entirely open, as there will still need to be a permissioned component. An IBM spokesperson said the model needed to be \u201cpublic / permissioned\u201d as some aspects of access to the platform would need to be restricted for regulatory reasons.The growing importance of Stellar to IBM is significant. Stellar has struggled to compete with Ethereum as a blockchain of choice for decentralised organizations. The vote of confidence from IBM may convince future projects that it is indeed a serious protocol.The IBM/Stellar combination is increasingly being seen as a potent combination that may challenge Ripple / XRP in the global payment space. In that regard, IBM appears to carry the advantage given its vast number of partnerships with major corporations operating on the international scene.According to some analysts, IBM\u2019s involvement in a public blockchain project \u2014 as opposed to relying on its own private offshoot chain \u2014 may also serve up a healthy dose of credibility for the wider crypto-tech experiment.Source", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Blockchain", "IBM", "Ripple", "Crypto"]}, {"title": "Get Ripple (XRP) in your Web Browser with Bitcoin", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@miko_57080/how-to-buy-ripple-xrp-from-coinbase-c769b89d9cb0?source=search_post", "author_name": "Miko Matsumura", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@miko_57080", "publish_date": "2017-12-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-15", "readtime": "3.21", "claps": 128, "voters": 21, "content": "Get Ripple (XRP) in your Web Browser with BitcoinMiko MatsumuraFollowDec 15, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readHow to move from Coinbase to the broader crypto worldMoving past the first step in cryptoThe vast majority of cryptocurrency users get their start on Coinbase.

The post can be found here. The tldr vision is that Ripple will free up a large portion of the $27 trillion tied up globally in transactional accounts by creating a widely accepted international currency that can be moved around quickly and cost effectively. Below is a more detailed summary:The big problem Ripple is solving is that right now global companies must keep significant amounts of cash tied up in bank accounts around the world in order to timely transact locally because moving money around internationally is very slow (it took me six days to move a tiny amount of money from Bank of America to Coinbase!). A McKinsey report actually found that at the end of 2015 there was more than $27 trillion(!) sitting in transactional accounts \u2014 the largest amount ever! Ripple\u2019s vision is to free up a significant portion of that $27 trillion by creating a widely accepted international currency that can be moved around quickly and cost effectively. If even 10% of the $27 trillion is freed up that is $2.7 trillion moved to Ripple. And if only 10% of that $2.7 trillion is needed to be tied up in Ripple because of efficiency gains, that would be $270 billion in Ripple or almost 24X the current market cap!Go Big.

I\u2019ve been eyeing that guitar case where that mammal sized cockroach just went under it. But I have not seen it resurface. No shame here. We have cockroaches too in our apartment.

She\u2019s corrected some of my numerous errors.Jay Kang: I feel like she\u2019s gotten to like 1% of our factual errors on this, but it was a very long email detailing several of our factual errors.Aaron Lammer: Side note. So when we were prepping to talk about this, we were looking at her show. Her podcast is called Unconfirmed-Jay Kang: Unchained.Aaron Lammer: Unchain \u2026 Well she has two. She has Unchained and Unconfirmed. I think you\u2019re right, Unchained is the episode we\u2019re talking about. It has a disclosure in the description that says, \u2018I own Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u2019 And I was like man, like if we had to do that, I wouldn\u2019t even know what we would say. It\u2019s like, \u201cAaron has like tons of shit in bag. A bunch of them he got bad entries on.\u201dJay Kang: Hahahaha.Aaron Lammer: \u201cSeveral of them have been de-listed and he can\u2019t move them. Jay may or may not have some Bitcoin.

If Jay was not too lazy to buy alt coins right now, these are the coins that he would have.Aaron Lammer: But anyway, so Laura does this show. It\u2019s a great show. She has on lots of CEOs. I mean her guest list is mostly the people behind these coins.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. She does not go our route, which is to invite on degenerate gamblers.Aaron Lammer: I feel like we like are both on the degenerate journalist and degenerate gamblers list, but we haven\u2019t had that many people who are actually like building-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: The stuff that we\u2019re talking about. So that is kinda what she normally does in the show and I\u2019m always curious \u2019cause I do listen to the show and I always sort of think about this decision to have people talk about their own work. These are people who have literally billions of dollars at stake in how the public perceives their projects.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: So it\u2019s not necessarily people that I associate with deep honesty, but it\u2019s interesting, I listen and if I have heard someone on the show it does affect whether I\u2019d want to buy that coin.Jay Kang: Yeah. Look it\u2019s the dance that all journalists have to do-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: For a certain \u2026 especially tech journalists I think more than anybody else.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And maybe like celebrity profilers, which is is it worth having this person on in an unfiltered forum like the podcast, where I can press them on certain things or her.Aaron Lammer: Right. And Laura to her credit, she\u2019s not a no coiner who\u2019s gonna try to like poke holes in what you\u2019re doing necessarily. She-Jay Kang: And she is interested in the world.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: So she\u2019s not a troll.Aaron Lammer: Not at all.Jay Kang: I think if you and I had on her guest list, one of us-Aaron Lammer: Jay.Jay Kang: Me, would spend most of the time-Aaron Lammer: There\u2019s only one troll who\u2019s on this show.Jay Kang: Yeah, would spend most of the time trolling and asking absurd questions and trying to corner them into like stupid debate trick stuff.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: She doesn\u2019t do that-Aaron Lammer: No.Jay Kang: Because she is a curious person in real journalism. She\u2019s trying to get these things out. So-Aaron Lammer: And she\u2019s like \u2026 generally takes the attitude of like let people like represent themselves how they wanna rep themselves.Jay Kang: Yeah. I do not take that.Aaron Lammer: So she was gonna do a show on Ripple. I guess she hadn\u2019t done the show on Ripple. I mean Ripple is this weird anomaly where it is one of the biggest coins, but it also almost exists outside of the rest of a lot of these coins, like in a different sort of business realm. And so she was trying to get on Brad Garlinghouse who runs Ripple Inc.-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: He\u2019s the CEO of Ripple Inc. and they were kinda giving here runaround on this. I had a lot of empathy for this \u2019cause I\u2019ve had the run around before by some PR apparatuses and they were like, \u201cWe \u2026 We\u2019re not actually getting you] Brad Garlinghouse, but like we got you the next best thing, this other guy.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: And she basically negotiated with them and they kinda didn\u2019t want to budge. And so she was like, \u201cWell fine. I\u2019m gonna do it with these two other guys.\u201d, who she had booked. One of whom was Ryan Selkis who I admire. Anyway, the Ripple dudes kind of freaked out on Twitter and were kinda accusing of her of acting in bad faith-Jay Kang: Unbelievable.Aaron Lammer: And trying to argue their way on.Jay Kang: Unbelievable. Yeah, yeah. And then their like army of Ripple fans also swarmed Laura\u2019s Twitter account and were making all sorts of crazy accusations towards her, which is really the sort of sad state of discourse in America right now. Where I \u2026 This is something I say to my wife quite a bit, which is that every time one of these things happen, which is that it seems like if you read Twitter that everybody is very obsessed with journalism. You know?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And that everyone thinks about journalism and journalist ethics all the time. And yet, you would think if that is true, that journalism business would be doing a little bit better. You know?Aaron Lammer: No.Jay Kang: Oh.Aaron Lammer: I think most people don\u2019t care, like especially in the crypto world, journalism\u2019s a pretty dirty word. Right?Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. Well that\u2019s what it is. Like essentially if you were part of the media and you say something that somebody doesn\u2019t like and this has happened to me maybe 30 times, where you get swarmed with people now who do not say, \u201cHey, you said something that I didn\u2019t like. I think you\u2019re full of shit and I hate you.\u201d They bring up these very granular and often times almost always wrong assumptions about what journalism is supposed to be and try and get you fired. Like that\u2019s the new normal.Aaron Lammer: If I sort of evaluate it, the whole exchange, I think I\u2019d call it a technical foul on both parties. I\u2019d be like-Jay Kang: Really?Aaron Lammer: Well I don\u2019t think she had to like \u2026 totally like air the dirty laundry quite as open. Let\u2019s play a little bit of it.Jay Kang: Okay.Laura Shin: If Ripple\u2019s going to participate, I want the CEO. I always get the CEO. I got the CEO of ShapeShift, Polychain, Xapo, BitGo, MyCrypto Chain, [Bitpay Za 00:09:18], Zero X, BTCC and others. So I decided I would leverage this tweet from David to get what I have been asking for since January. \u2018Brad, I told the PR woman I was taking the option of anyone but Brad off the table.\u2019 So their two choices were either Brad or no one from Ripple. I thought there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to prefer a podcast of two non-Ripple people discussing XRP over a podcast featuring Brad talking about XRP, but the next day they refused. I asked the Ripple coms person, \u201cYou would rather have two non-Ripple people talk about XRP on my podcast than your own CEO?\u201d He wrote back, \u201cI\u2019d prefer to have two XRP experts and C-level executives from Ripple who are moving mountains to make themselves available to you, come on your podcast to answer questions.\u201d I wrote, \u201cI told you the two options were Brad or two non-Ripple people and you are choosing two non-Ripple people?\u201d He did not respond.For the record, I\u2019ve put Ripple on the Forbes Fintech 50 list for three years straight. They were the only company I cover to send me a holiday card last year, just weeks before Brad refused to come on my show. They also invited me to interview Brad at their company offsite last fall, which I couldn\u2019t make and now here we are. From invitations and holiday cards to the cold shoulder.Aaron Lammer: Okay. So you get the idea. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in the wrong, but she did dedicate like the first 10 minutes of the show to airing these like Ripple dudes out pretty hard, which I respect.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: I understand why they like are annoyed with her and she\u2019s annoyed with them. But as an impartial third party, an investor. Hey, I\u2019m just speaking as an investor here.Jay Kang: That\u2019s not an impartial third party by the way.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, totally not-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Impartial third party. The constant thin skin-ness of the people behind Ripple speaks volumes about what they\u2019re doing.Jay Kang: Yeah. It really does. I mean I \u2026 How many Ripple fights have there been now? I mean I feel like you and I get some of it just for making fun of Ripple on our podcast-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Which I don\u2019t think anyone who listens to should take seriously as anything. Especially not like a long term referendum on whether or not this thing is an investible product or not.Aaron Lammer: Look the way we talk about Ripple and our investment track record, everyone should be happy. We\u2019ve been making fun of ripple and we\u2019ve been failing in all of our investments. So you\u2019re probably gonna do well and if you\u2019ve been honing Ripple, you are doing well. So why are you fucking complaining so much?Jay Kang: I do wonder sometimes what a portfolio would look like if they just went the opposite direction of everything that we did. So like \u2026 You know like there are these like people who place their bets online, NFL writers.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And for times I\u2019ve just faded them because either I have a personal problem with them or I just think that they\u2019re always wrong or that I think it\u2019s funny. Sometimes it really works and I feel like if somebody just faded us consistently, that they would do pretty well.Aaron Lammer: If you\u2019ve been fading us, you\u2019d do well and if you\u2019ve been buying Ripple, you\u2019d do well and none of the arguments that I would make against Ripple or I think Laura Shin would make against Ripple necessarily mean Ripple is a bad investment.Jay Kang: No, and-Aaron Lammer: Most of these arguments are that Ripple is a bad concept that\u2019s kinda shitty for crypto and is not actually decentralized and it\u2019s controlled by company, Ripple Inc., and that\u2019s a huge problem.Jay Kang: And it is-Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s not a reason not to invest.Jay Kang: It is barely a crypto currency and that the use case is specious at best. And it\u2019s not just Laura Shin that\u2019s gotten in \u2026 Nathaniel Poppers \u2026 Like every journalist who has written about Ripple essentially has gotten Ripple shamed-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: In a sort of way. So I have one question for you Aaron-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Which is that you and I do track some of this stuff on Twitter. Who are these fucking Ripple fans? Our friend Joe Weisenthal got it from the Ripple fans too. Like I just \u2026 Like I don\u2019t get who Ripple fans are.Aaron Lammer: Well I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re people who bought in when Ripple was like $3.00, most of \u2026 Like I think they\u2019re people who really need Ripple to go back up.Jay Kang: Oh, so you think they\u2019re not people who bought in at like point seven cents-Aaron Lammer: I think they\u2019re both. I think they\u2019re both. Someone was describing to me that people who are buying Tesla, you know Tesla\u2019s getting massively-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Shorter right now. If you\u2019re betting on Teslas, you\u2019re betting on hitting the \u2026 literally hitting the moon-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: With a rocket. It\u2019s a cult of people who like just believe in Elon Musk no matter what and they\u2019re like the Ripple fans of the stock market.Jay Kang: And you are one of these?Aaron Lammer: And I was offended because I am Tesla hodler and I do believe in Elon Musk.Jay Kang: I do not.Aaron Lammer: But I don\u2019t really know who these Ripple people are and I also don\u2019t understand why out of all of these projects \u2026 There\u2019s crazy people in all of these projects. There\u2019s crazy Ethereum teens out there-Jay Kang: Yeah, but that makes sense.Aaron Lammer: No, but there\u2019s something dark about the Ripple fans, like there\u2019s something gamergate about them. There\u2019s something about \u2026 and I think it comes from the top down, that it attracts people like the people who are running it, who are very weirdly thin skinned, and weirdly believe that negative press coverage is a huge threat to what they\u2019re doing.Jay Kang: Okay. I figured out who they remind me of and this is a group that I\u2019ve run across once.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Who still sometimes will tweet at me.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: They\u2019re like MLS fans to me.Aaron Lammer: That was so \u2026 I was wondering who you were gonna offend there. Like it could\u2019ve gone so many different directions.Jay Kang: They at me a lot. They at me a lot.Aaron Lammer: MLS fans.Jay Kang: DFS, daily fantasy fans-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Gordon Peterson fans.Aaron Lammer: Wow.Jay Kang: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar fans. Yeah, there\u2019s been a lot. But-Aaron Lammer: That is the hottest take you\u2019ve ever brought to this program, that Ripple fans are the MLS fans of crypto.Jay Kang: Well let me explain which \u2026 And it really is that they \u2026 they sort of have this built in inferiority complex. Right? Because the thing that they support gets shit on by almost everybody who\u2019s a layperson in that field. So like if you are into sports, and maybe this has changed over the last five years or so, but it used to be \u2026 Like if you looked five years ago, everyone just shits on MLS being like, \u201cWhy would you watch that? It\u2019s a bunch of out shape guys who went to Yukon running around. You know? And a bunch of like castoffs from Europe and Mexico.\u201d And so that builds this inferiority complex I think and that the press is generally negative towards them and so they hate the media. They have built a strange culture that to any outsider looks a little bit weird and you\u2019re like, \u201cWell why are these people into this thing?\u201dAaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Like it doesn\u2019t make any sense and that that contributes to that.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And so I think for Ripple fans \u2026 Like the case for Ripple \u2026 Being a fan of Ripple doesn\u2019t make any \u2026 It\u2019s not cool. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. So the future of Ripple is that bank transfers between two countries that do not do much business with one another \u2026 So for example, trying to send money from Argentina to Sudan will be \u2026 use the Ripple system and will use these tokens to make the transfer faster and more like seamless than it would be before.\u201d That is not a very sexy story, you know? And so that\u2019s why I think when people sort of point that out, the people who are fans, which I honestly still have no idea why they are. They get extremely defensive about it and then they congregate \u2026 Oh! The cockroach is-Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s back. It\u2019s back.Jay Kang: Is back.Aaron Lammer: Damn, I think that cockroach is officially the mascot of Coin Talk now.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: We may have to add him to the show art.Jay Kang: I just picked up my shoe.Aaron Lammer: If you could possibly like kill him without destroying him, so I could take a photo.Jay Kang: I am wearing Yeezys right now.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, well that\u2019s a \u2026 So you-Jay Kang: I will not be stomping on the cockroach with my Yeezys.Aaron Lammer: If I asked you, you would not kill that cockroach with those shoes?Jay Kang: No, I\u2019m not stomping on him with these fucking Yeezys.Aaron Lammer: So I think of these Ripple fans, they\u2019re people who brought like a weird beer to the party. Like they just kinda like-Jay Kang: That\u2019s the same thing.Aaron Lammer: There\u2019s this weird like level where it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, what kind of party is this?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, we\u2019re about decentralization, taking money out of the hands of the government, creating an independent transparent system that people can hold value.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cHey you guys, what if we like worked with the banks?\u201d Almost everything about what this is bringing to the table is antithetical to what most of these people came here for.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: And yet it\u2019s strangely seductive, which makes me think that there\u2019s a new generation of crypto enthusiast who is Ripple types, people who are like, \u201cI\u2019m into like bank stuff.\u201dJay Kang: Well yeah \u2026. Here\u2019s the disconnect that I have with the Ripple fan, which is that when the super FoMO phase of around thanksgiving of last year was happening, people at my work and people in my social life were saying, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t I just buy Ripple? It\u2019s the most reasonable of all of these. Like it\u2019s the one that can exist within the world that we inhabit right now.\u201d That was their big pitch.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Right? And a lot of them bought Ripple and a lot of them did very well because they bought it at like $0.20 and they sold it at like $2.00. They did awesome. You know?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Those people are not ideologically into Ripple enough to start trolling people online. In fact, I think that they thought that Ripple was uncool, which is why they got it. You know?Aaron Lammer: Yeah, that\u2019s kinda why I bought Ripple.Jay Kang: Yeah and-Aaron Lammer: It was like go against my instinct here.Jay Kang: Yeah, but that\u2019s \u2026 You would think that a dedicated fandom that would go around trolling people and sort of making these ugly spectacles online, that they would have some sort of ideological reasoning behind it. And that\u2019s the part I don\u2019t get with Ripple, which is why I actually think that a lot of the Ripple stuff might be bots.Aaron Lammer: Wow. I mean I will say there\u2019s some very high profile B-cash trolls out there.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: People are making B-cash rap songs. Dudes are like wigging out trying to convince you that B-cash is better. They remind me of like campus republicans at UC Berkeley on the like grange, fucking yelling at people-Jay Kang: Yeah, but those guys are idealogs.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, that\u2019s a person I recognize.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s a real person.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: I can tell there\u2019s some people who are really into B-cash.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: For real. No joke. I think that the Ripple people are bots is a provocative way to look at it.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: If not bots they\u2019re like-Jay Kang: Paid.Aaron Lammer: Or weirdly like there\u2019s some central place in all of the Ripple communications where people are getting together and it\u2019s like, \u201cAll right guys. Everyday let\u2019s go out one hour and reply to every threat about Ripple we can.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: \u201cAnd put our fucking nose in here and say \u2026\u201d \u2019Cause it\u2019s always about you\u2019re wrong about Ripple. Like another thing that I wanted to talk about was \u2026 and actually was trying to get him on the show, maybe he\u2019ll come on and talk about this. Jackson Palmer who created Dogecoin-Jay Kang: Dogecoin.Aaron Lammer: Dogecoin-Jay Kang: Hard G.Aaron Lammer: Adrian said it was the other way-Jay Kang: No, he said it was Dogecoin.Aaron Lammer: Oh, okay.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Jackson Palmer who created Dogecoin-Jay Kang: Thank you.Aaron Lammer: He has this website called \u2018Are we decentralized yet?\u201d, which basically shows the concentration of the coins.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Like how centralized the different currencies are. I think Bitcoin is like 35% and it\u2019s the lowest and Ethereum\u2019s next on down. Ripple is 98% centralized.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: This is not him like trying to take down the company Ripple. This is just like he has like built and wants to like show. Like you can make of it what you want.Jay Kang: It\u2019s information.Aaron Lammer: Information.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: You can say, \u201cThat information\u2019s bogus or that\u2019s a shitty way to do it.\u201d, or whatever. He\u2019s gotten ripped by so many Ripple people for this that he like \u2026 is like taking it down or giving the project to someone else. He\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s literally just not worth it for me. Twitter\u2019s unusable because it\u2019s a 100% of these like Ripple people just like at-ting me all the time.\u201dJay Kang: I \u2026 That\u2019s \u2026 I just don\u2019t get it, like where did all these people come from. Like who are they?Aaron Lammer: Well let\u2019s talk about another thing-Jay Kang: Have you ever \u2026 You and I now know a lot of people in the crypto space. Have you ever met anyone who was really, really into Ripple?Aaron Lammer: Yeah, like my brother-in-law\u2019s pretty into Ripple, I don\u2019t to mean to like air him out. I think like for certain people who like \u2026 I kinda do my research into like a few coins, this one seems like a good bet to me, bought it and did well. They\u2019ve got more memories. You know?Jay Kang: Yeah, but they \u2026 That doesn\u2019t mean they go brigade people online.Aaron Lammer: Well like \u2026 It\u2019s kinda like sports. Like why am I so into Monero? I don\u2019t know. I just got into Monero, I love Monero.Jay Kang: You don\u2019t brigade people, at least that I know-Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I know-Jay Kang: You don\u2019t like go troll people who slander Monero online.Aaron Lammer: It does get on my hackles a little bit when people are like, \u201cMonero\u2019s like a money laundering coin.\u201d Like a little part inside of me is like, \u201cFuck you dude.\u201dJay Kang: Yes, it is but \u2026Aaron Lammer: Yes, and?Jay Kang: Well here\u2019s the thing.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Every subculture that \u2026 And this is what we\u2019ve found through however many years of internet subculture, it\u2019s very hard to predict which ones will go and do these for some toxic brigading campaigns and make people\u2019s \u2026Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Social media unusable. So for example \u2026 And look I\u2019m not saying that this is their fault, but like Barstool Sports who\u2019s another subculture that completely-Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Another group of people who hate Jay.Jay Kang: Who hate me, yes. They have a-Aaron Lammer: Shout outs to that one guy at Barstool Sports who\u2019s a big Francis and the Lights fan though.Jay Kang: Well they also are big Bitcoin fans.Aaron Lammer: Oh, yeah.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t have a problem with Barstool honestly. But like they\u2019re-Aaron Lammer: Who\u2019s \u2026 Do they have like a crypto person over there? We should have someone on.Jay Kang: They do. They do.Aaron Lammer: Okay. Let\u2019s have them on.Jay Kang: Yeah, their business guy. But like-Aaron Lammer: Let\u2019s have that guy on. Hey, you\u2019re invited on the show guy.Jay Kang: He\u2019s been into Bitcoin for a long time. But Barstool does have this reputation for having fans that-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: That swarm and they do. The fans do swarm. If you talk to the guys at Barstool, they don\u2019t \u2026 they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a problem. We don\u2019t really get why it happens. But we don\u2019t encourage it.\u201d But like similar sports sites don\u2019t have that. Like so for example, we at Grantland had like a pretty big audience, but like we didn\u2019t have that type of activity happen.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And that you could argue that the people who read Grantland were different than the people who read Barstool. I don\u2019t actually think that that\u2019s necessarily true. It\u2019s just that some communities build up these types of things.Aaron Lammer: Well I think you could say that the people who are working for Ripple Inc., the guy who was tweeting at Laura like, \u201cHey, I really think I should come on the show. I like know this and that about it.\u201d I think he\u2019s like the chief scientist or whatever from there.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah.Aaron Lammer: Those people in some ways emboldening other Ripple fans to like come after people.Jay Kang: Yeah, but that \u2026 That sort of stuff happens all the fall through doesn\u2019t always happen.Aaron Lammer: I know. It\u2019s true. Like you\u2019re always trolling Wait Wait\u2026 Don\u2019t Tell Me!, but it\u2019s not like everyone from Grantland started trolling them.Jay Kang: Yeah or like nobody else does. I\u2019ve started slowly like building my army, but like \u2026Aaron Lammer: Jay, I think that the lesson of this is that you should stop trolling Wait Wait\u2026 Don\u2019t Tell Me!, not mimic the tactics of Ripple fans to try to take them down.Jay Kang: I would say that there is a \u2026 with certain things you can draw a corelation between the actual culture and that behavior. For example, you could say that there is a reason why MRA, Men\u2019s Rights Activists, would swarm the accounts of women who don\u2019t like men\u2019s rights activists. Right?Aaron Lammer: Absolutely.Jay Kang: That makes sense.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: It makes no sense when you take Ripple into account. In fact, you would think that the group of people who would swarm people would be the ones who like stable like corporate coin.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, like a bunch of like bankers.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s not like you see like Wall Street guys swarming the mentions of like stocks that they\u2019re shorting or something.Jay Kang: No, no, no.Aaron Lammer: I mean but is there that kinda activist stuff in stocks, where people are like \u2026 trying to like spread FUD?Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. For sure.Aaron Lammer: I mean they\u2019re kind of spreading the opposite of FUD. They\u2019re spreading like pro-Ripple propaganda.Jay Kang: Well I mean look if they did that, it would obviously be illegal if it was traced back to a certain source that was invested in it. The thing with Ripple is it just makes so little sense to me that I will say purely speculatively and allegedly that it does seem like \u2026 I would not be surprised to find out if there was some sort of like social media campaigning that was going on in this sort of way.Aaron Lammer: You really gotta watch out when the Russian Ethereum stands show up. That\u2019s gonna \u2026 It\u2019s gonna all be over then-Jay Kang: It\u2019s all over.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s gonna be curtains for our Twitter accounts then.Jay Kang: All right. So let\u2019s move on to another part of media, which is television and-Aaron Lammer: Yeah. We\u2019re doing kind of an overview of like pop culture crypto right now. I guess Ripple\u2019s not really pop culture as it\u2019s \u2026 It\u2019s tech culture though.Jay Kang: Tech culture.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s troll culture.Jay Kang: Yeah. So did you watch Silicon Valley this week?Aaron Lammer: I did \u2026 I did watch. I enjoy the program Silicon Valley and they had been teasing like Bitcoin plot a little bit earlier in the season, then it didn\u2019t seem like it was gonna happen and then it came roaring back.Jay Kang: I feel like the link between Bitcoin and Silicon Valley has been going on for a long time, because what Pied Piper is trying to build is a decentralized internet. Right?Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: And so Richard Hendricks who is the \u2026 I don\u2019t know what the actor\u2019s name is. But the character on the show, when he does these sort of like standup speeches about what he\u2019s trying to build, it\u2019s always about decentralization.Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: And so Pied Piper this week was having trouble with its series B funding and there was some things written in it that the CEO did not like. And so instead he was \u2026 allowed one of the engineers who\u2019s played by Martin Starr from Freaks and Geeks and Party Down, to convince him to ICO instead.Aaron Lammer: Yes, let\u2019s play it. Let\u2019s hear a little bit of that.Speaker 5: Gilfoyle, we\u2019re not gonna suddenly pivot and become a digital currency company.Speaker 6: I\u2019m not proposing a pivot. I\u2019m proposing that we sell digital currency as a way to finance our new internet company. You wanted an alternative to Laurie Bream. Well it\u2019s right here in front of you. Pied Piper Coin.Speaker 5: Okay, look, I\u2019m not gonna bet the entire future of my new internet and everything I\u2019ve worked for on becoming the next Bitcoin. You really expect me to do that?Speaker 6: There are very few things that I will defend with true passion: medical marijuana, the biblical Satan as a metaphor for rebellion against tyranny, and mother fucking Goddamn cryptocurrency.Aaron Lammer: So in some ways it\u2019s kind of inevitable to me that Silicon Valley would\u2019ve ended up here.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: When this show came out, I was like, \u201cWhere are they gonna go with this?\u201d You know? Is it gonna be like the same joke forever? Is it gonna like burn itself out over a few seasons? I think a lot of people feel like it did, but there seems like there\u2019s a new life in it, and in some ways crypto is a new cultural life in Silicon Valley. It\u2019s like a whole new world to make fun of.Jay Kang: I\u2019m surprised that it took them this long to start making fun of crypto.Aaron Lammer: I feel like people wouldn\u2019t have gotten the joke until year.Jay Kang: Maybe. Maybe that is true and they would\u2019ve had to explain too much. Now like-Aaron Lammer: And I was surprised how deep it went. Like did you hear that part where they were talking about like securities regulation?Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah.Aaron Lammer: Let\u2019s hear that.Speaker 5: Who do I hire? Someone who understands securities, right?Speaker 7: Not necessarily. I mean your coin doesn\u2019t have to be a security. You could do a utility token instead, since you provide an actual unit of compute. Although, you\u2019d have SEC. Damn it. Surge pricing.Speaker 5: Monica.Speaker 7: You might not even need to bother with a moving average pricing strategy when you launch. But you will need to keep a close eye on statements from the federal government, South Korea, and China. So, whoever you do hire should definitely know how to do all that.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s a fairly like in depth way to talk about this.Jay Kang: And very topical for right now.Aaron Lammer: Yes, very up to the news cycle.Jay Kang: Yes. The only question that I had about all of this \u2026 I enjoyed the episode as well. The only question I had was like, has crypto reached the saturation point in culture where you can do a episode on a very popular show on HBO about an ICO and you can actually kind of represent it well without sort of having people sit down and do explainers of every single thing that\u2019s going on?Aaron Lammer: I think that there\u2019s certain pop culture that sits as sort of the bleeding edge of introducing ideas, like South Park comes to my mind.Jay Kang: Sure.Aaron Lammer: And a lot of times these are shows that are written really closely to the news cycle and we can just know that this is written closely to the news cycle because the stuff about securities has only really been in the news for about I\u2019d say what the last month-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Maybe six weeks. So South Park would do this too, where they\u2019d do the episodes in one week and often times like the stuff that\u2019s coming up in those episodes becomes like deeper in pop culture in the next wave, as like writing catches up. So I would read this as this is gonna be a year of a lot of crypto jokes.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: And I think it\u2019s probably good. It\u2019s probably a bullish signal.Jay Kang: Well look, their ICO didn\u2019t turn out so well \u2026Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: At the episode that we\u2019re at right now, but the case for it I thought was actually quite elegant and it actually made me think that I \u2026 more of ICOs, which was that look, if you keep relying on VCs, they\u2019re gonna keep chipping away. Right?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And that they are ruthless. Like you could get the rug pulled out from you at any time. You are going to have to do things you don\u2019t want and then this when it was that, they didn\u2019t wanna sell ads on the Pied Piper platform. Right? And she was gonna make them sell ads. And so the case they made was that the only way that we can do this the way that we want to do it is to do an ICO, which is what they did.Aaron Lammer: The thing that struck me when I was watching it is what if this was my first encounter with crypto. I mean young Aaron Lammer. I\u2019m 17 years old. I like stole my friend\u2019s parents login to HBO. I\u2019ve heard of Bitcoin. I don\u2019t really know what it is. Then you watch this and it\u2019s like the really clear message of the joke in it, is that VCs are gonna get supplanted by these initial coin offerings, and that they\u2019re like at an existential war-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: With each other. And I do think pop culture can kind of inform how the future goes with this stuff. And the fact that Silicon Valley, which I know is a show that\u2019s like written very much within that culture and sourced with people are there, makes me think that that is a joke that Silicon Valley people would recognize and in some ways describes how people are feeling about this.Jay Kang: Yeah and the rest of the episode did have like a referendum on other Bitcoin type friend things. Right?Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: So there was like the VC guy who had 300 million dollars on a thumb drive and he was looking through a dumpster for it. Right?Aaron Lammer: Tried 35 ICOs and only one of them worked.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah.Speaker 8: Listen, all the coin I had from the ICO that worked was on a USB thumb drive. And my dumb fucking housekeeper threw out my jeans, \u2019cause they were ripped, even though I paid more for the ripped ones and the thumb drive was in the pocket. So $300 million in crypto is buried out here, somewhere. But my boys will find it. If they wanna get paid, right?Aaron Lammer: This reminded also that in the overall reality bleed that\u2019s happening between fact and fiction and like real Silicon Valley and this. Alexis Ohanian, who is one of the co-founders of Reddit, was on I believe Colbert this week basically describing cryptocurrencies as the pathway towards a new internet. But I have to say I don\u2019t totally understand it. In fact, when I think of it, I just come back to Pied Piper, which is fictional and not a real technology \u2026 or not really like something that I could see happening. So what do you think that new internet is?Jay Kang: So is Richard Hendricks just making Ethereum?Aaron Lammer: I won\u2019t try to weigh in on what he\u2019s building. But I think when people are talking in the real world about the new internet, they\u2019re imagining some kind of the frictionless Ethereum system that has something to do with micropayments and infinite storage and totally free, unfettered access to everything, everything tracked. I don\u2019t really know. I mean I feel like I\u2019ve just wrapped my head around how Bitcoin works and when people have described these Toshi Ethereum land universes, I haven\u2019t totally like wrapped my head around what this new internet is all about. I know that DApps are gonna be a big part of it, but \u2026 Well I hope we get some people on the show who can like sell us on this vision a little more fully.Jay Kang: Yeah. Brian Armstrong please.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. I\u2019d like to talk to Brian Armstrong.Jay Kang: We\u2019ve never insulted you. All right. So let\u2019s go to my favorite story of the week, which is the \u2026 this was in Bloomberg, their crypto vertical.Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: \u2018The Wealthy Are Hoarding 10 billion dollars of Bitcoin in Bunkers\u2019, and it is the story of Xapo, which is-Aaron Lammer: Yeah. We\u2019ve talked about Xapo on the show before. Yeah.Jay Kang: yeah, yeah. And it is the new venture of Wences Casares, who if you\u2019ve read Nathaniel Popper\u2019s book \u2018Digital Gold\u2019, he is one of the real evangelists of Bitcoin at the beginning. Like what Roger Ver was doing to people in Japan, Wences was doing sort of to Silicon Valley people, VCs, CEOs, people who were interested in other types of technology, the sort of Silicon Valley elite. Wences was the guy who was converting them all over to Bitcoin. And he comes across very sympathetically in Nathaniel\u2019s book.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, he seems like a smart, interesting person. Of all the people \u2026 Like this venture is not like a get rich quick cash in.Jay Kang: No. It is a way to store your Bitcoin in a way that feels secure.Aaron Lammer: I mean literally-Jay Kang: Which is something you and I know nothing about.Aaron Lammer: Literally in a bunker.Jay Kang: In a bunker.Aaron Lammer: And on a spectrum from the most insecure way to store Bitcoin would be just on an exchange, then there\u2019s like jump drive like systems-Jay Kang: Ledger and-Aaron Lammer: Ledger Nano is what I have.Jay Kang: Trezor.Aaron Lammer: Trezor and then all the way at the other end of the spectrum is the Xapo. It\u2019s X-A-P-O, which is literally a concrete bunker. It\u2019s not connected to the internet with computers storing private keys for high net worth individuals I think mostly and family investment arms.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. So like Novogratz has his there. From the article, two Xapo clients said it houses roughly 10 billion dollars of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin\u2019s price after all is hardly steady. Now I did a little bit of number crunching at my desk at work today.Aaron Lammer: Calculator Kang in the house.Jay Kang: Calculator Kang is in the house. That\u2019s 7% of the Bitcoin supply right now.Aaron Lammer: I think it\u2019s probably actually more than that \u2019cause \u2026 because so many coins probably are actually lost, that it would be even more than that. The actual-Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. So in a pure system, it is 7%.Aaron Lammer: \u2019Cause we actually know all the coins that are in Xapo are there, unlike all the other coins on earth.Jay Kang: Yeah. So let\u2019s take Saifedean Ammous\u2019 Bitcoin maximalist-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Vision to the end. Right?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And that Bitcoin is all the money in the world.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: 7% of the global money supply is 6.28 trillion dollars.Aaron Lammer: Could we pay off the federal deficit with that?Jay Kang: No. Definitely not. So that is 50 Jeff Bezozes in one vault.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I mean it\u2019s kind of incredible. In some ways in the present day, the bunker seems excessive. In the Bitcoin maximalist world view, they\u2019re gonna need a lot of guns around that bunker.Jay Kang: Yeah. Well I mean \u2026 So here\u2019s my question to you, which is that look the idea-Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m always talking about guns on this show.Jay Kang: The idea of a small number of people holding 6.28 trillion dollars in a bunker, right now it would destroy any sort of world economy because so much wealth would be centralized in one spat, amongst a small number of people. Right?Aaron Lammer: Sure.Jay Kang: Does this actually make the case for Bitcoin itself taking over the entire world economy a little bit harder, because it\u2019s so \u2026 Like none of these people are gonna sell their Bitcoin or distribute it. And so if Bitcoin does take over the world, it means that even just with this, you have a massive concentration of wealth.Aaron Lammer: Well-Jay Kang: Does that bother you?Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t \u2026 I\u2019m not sure I agree with that none of these people are ever gonna sell or move their Bitcoin.Jay Kang: If Bitcoin keeps going up and they believe in Bitcoin in the way that they do, I don\u2019t \u2026 I think that that concentration will stay pretty constant.Aaron Lammer: I do think that that much of the Bitcoin in one place is a problem on several levels and I assume that as the price accelerated, there would be more Xapos scattered around the earth, and that we would try to spread out the Bitcoin amongst them. I just see it would make sense. You know? Bitcoin goes 10 X and there\u2019s 10 times much money there, you might wanna at least say, \u201cHey, we don\u2019t wanna keep more than like a 100 billion per bunker.\u201d Or something like that.Jay Kang: I guess my problem is more that like if we try and think of \u2026 visualize Bitcoin as being the standard for all wealth in the world. Right? And that some of the ethos of Bitcoin is like we\u2019re gonna help bank the bankless-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: And that\u2019s gonna lead to \u2026 Like I think that what it basically has led to is that the people \u2026 the wealth concentration that we see right now is gonna become hyper concentrated. Right? And it\u2019s going to just be the people who bought into large amounts of Bitcoin early, and that seems like it\u2019s a real problem. You have very little flexibility in that world because small amounts of people are essentially gonna be nation states upon themselves, which already is sort of happening. But it will be accelerated for no reason, for no value except for the fact that they own all this Bitcoin early. Like do you see that as a problem?Aaron Lammer: You know I don\u2019t know enough about the like current concentration of wealth in the world. Somehow it compares-Jay Kang: Well just think about 50 Jeff Bezozes in like one vault.Aaron Lammer: But I mean that\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering. Like if you took the top 100 Fiat holders in the world and concentrated their wealth in Swiss bank. Does the Swiss banking system as a whole have that much money in it?Jay Kang: Well it\u2019s not even \u2026 It\u2019s just like there aren\u2019t 50 Jeff Bezozes. Like there\u2019s one Jeff Bezoz.Aaron Lammer: Right.Jay Kang: Right?Aaron Lammer: Right.Jay Kang: And if you-Aaron Lammer: But there\u2019s the 50 richest people on earth-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Which let\u2019s say are like somewhere overall around 50 Jeff Bezozes.Jay Kang: Yeah. No, that would get nowhere close to 7% of the total net worth in the world.Aaron Lammer: Wow. Yeah, I mean look I think it\u2019s a major liability. I think these people are liabilities and Satoshi\u2019s stash is probably a liability in its own right. My guess is that the like gamblers amongst us would read that situation and say, \u201cProbably none of those coins are ever gonna move. Let\u2019s just look at it as a smaller supply.\u201d That said, if someone decides to like become like a despotic tyrant-Jay Kang: That\u2019s the problem!Aaron Lammer: With their money. I mean and like clearly the betting odds are on Peter Thiel here. Right?Jay Kang: Sure.Aaron Lammer: I mean we know that Peter Thiel \u2026 and not just looking at Peter Thiel the individual, but his sort of network of like companies of investments. Yeah, it could be like a major holder amongst those.Jay Kang: Yeah. Do you want Peter Thiel to be richer than he already is by several, several hundreds percent?Aaron Lammer: I\u2019d be against it myself.Jay Kang: Yeah. And so that-Aaron Lammer: But I am getting rich during that scenario. Now if I go 100 X and I also know that Peter Thiel is going a hundred X, will I accept scenario? I think I probably would.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know. I would think very, very hard about it.Aaron Lammer: I think you also have to look at this a little bit like the force. There\u2019s a dark side and there\u2019s a light side and I would hope that some of the people who became powerful and insanely rich through Bitcoin, would use it to do good. And that it\u2019s not an inherent system that those people would become like despotic, tyrant nation states. That money could be used a lot of different ways.Jay Kang: I guess so, but you are still setting up a world in which there are oligarchs. You\u2019re setting up like a mass concentration of wealth-Aaron Lammer: Yeah. But we live in a world where there are oligarchs already.Jay Kang: Yeah and it\u2019s not great. It\u2019s not great.Aaron Lammer: I mean I don\u2019t see how you disrupt currency and also end oligarchy simultaneously.Jay Kang: Well look, that\u2019s the problem with things like Ripple right, where they start out so concentrated. I guess that-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: The thing that I would think \u2026 And this is what I think actually will happen and this is like my hottest take-Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Which I think that there will be a minable coin in the future that will probably be less centralized in wealth. And that because people will be more used to the idea of crypto, that it won\u2019t be as concentrated and that that feature, that it is not so concentrated that there aren\u2019t these massive dents clusters of wealth, that that will cause people to actually buy into a little bit more, because they can buy into a more democratic vision. Like-Aaron Lammer: Kang coin. It\u2019s for the people.Jay Kang: Kang coin for the people, like let\u2019s do it. But like the problem-Aaron Lammer: So part of the way Kang coin works is sort of like magnetism. If you get too much Kang coin, like it repels other Kang coin.Jay Kang: Yeah. You can only \u2026 Your Kang coins are capped, right? Like I actually don\u2019t think I would do that. But that is \u2026 If something spread and was mine to add paste, where it was sort of by propulsion was more evenly distributed, I actually think that that would probably be a better vision of it. And maybe that\u2019s what the people who are behind Ethereum are hoping for.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t really see how Ethereum is in improvement in this respect, other than it\u2019s a different group of people who\u2019ve become the oligarchs.Jay Kang: I personally just don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for 12 random people to have 7% of the world\u2019s wealth. That\u2019s just me. All right. So go-Aaron Lammer: I mean there\u2019s also like a timeline where like Xapo is involved in some sort of like insane like atomic accident or something that-Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Like I mean the incentives-Jay Kang: EMP baby.Aaron Lammer: Destroy Xapo, if Bitcoin really was a million dollars would be intense. You know?Jay Kang: Now that would be a good movie.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Breaking into Xapo to do an EMP to like wipe out all of this wealth.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Kang coin can reconquer the world.Jay Kang: Exactly. Oh, maybe the Kang coin should just fund the Kang coin movie.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: It should be a production house where we should make all the dumb Bitcoin movies that we think of.Aaron Lammer: The Jaytoshi Saga.Jay Kang: All right. So the second part of the Xapo story is how it actually works and this is something that I think was very interesting to me at least, which is \u2026 This is from Bloomberg\u2019s story, \u2018At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client\u2019s identity and authenticates a request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\u2019Aaron Lammer: Well for starters, that\u2019s the first scene in the movie, is it\u2019s you during those two days. You\u2019re getting verified.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: But you\u2019re really a mole who\u2019s breaking into Xapo to like destroy it from the inside-Jay Kang: Yeah. I\u2019m taking like a mental map.Aaron Lammer: But you\u2019re posing as like a wealthy Korean business man, who\u2019s like eye scan you\u2019ve stolen. You\u2019re like \u2026 You\u2019re wearing his eye balls.Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly.Aaron Lammer: I mean that sounds like pretty good security. This is interesting to me because one of the thing we hypothesized I think during the basement tapes, was that ultimately rich people were gonna \u2026 wanting to buy into Bitcoin through some sort of an ETF or some sort of a \u2026 basically an abstracted way that was secure, where they basically just owned stock. And this presents a different, I think superior vision, which is if you really have that much money, just buy \u2026 hire someone to buy a bunch of Bitcoin and go put it in this place that has a two day wait and the most insane security procedures in the world. As long as you\u2019re putting it \u2026 making a big investment, that\u2019s probably more cost effective than using one of these GBTC like kind of investment products.Jay Kang: Yeah and I think that if you\u2019re like a Bitcoin purest, it is certainly the most pure vision of it.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: I mean it actually makes Bitcoin seem very cool.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s cool to have an internet that\u2019s not on the internet. Like they just have like \u2026 There\u2019s just like a \u2026 Like you know? It\u2019s like just dead inside Xapo. The computers can\u2019t talk to anyone.Jay Kang: Yeah. I\u2019m picturing like a very, very old man hunched over, walking like from vault to vault.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, with like a-Jay Kang: Writing down-Aaron Lammer: Big, big key thing with like thousands of little keys on it.Jay Kang: Yeah. Yeah. And he\u2019s like writing down the private keys on a little piece of paper and walking it over.Aaron Lammer: Mr. Kang, you can come in now.Jay Kang: Oh, thank you. Oh, hello Mr. Kang. Yeah, exactly. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhat will your withdrawal \u2026\u201d It sounds awesome actually.Aaron Lammer: How was your stay at the Swiss town in the Alps Mr. Kang?Jay Kang: Maybe we should put our very small amount of Bitcoin into Xapo just so that we could get the service.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re allowed. I think it\u2019s like you have to like meet some sort of minimum, right?Jay Kang: Really?Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know.Jay Kang: I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m sure.Aaron Lammer: We should try and get Casares on the show. I know it\u2019s a long shot, but come on the show, man.Jay Kang: Yeah, answer all of our questions.Aaron Lammer: He\u2019s a friend of a friend to me. I\u2019m gonna try and talk him into it.Jay Kang: We\u2019ll cut you into the movie rights.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what I said. I think we should just ICO this movie about us breaking into Xapo and then we\u2019ll use that money and put it in Xapo.Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly.Aaron Lammer: And not actually make the movie.Jay Kang: We\u2019ll give him a producer credit.Aaron Lammer: All we need to do is story board this story out.Jay Kang: Yeah. Start a kick starter that only takes \u2026 that only deals in cryptocurrency.Aaron Lammer: Well there must be competing Xapos out there or people must trying to create competition for this.Jay Kang: Yeah. Yeah. I mean look it\u2019s too good of an idea and it is one that basically takes out \u2026 or seems to take out the biggest fear that one would have if you had a shit load of Bitcoin, which is what if someone kidnaps me, what if I get hacked, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.Aaron Lammer: Yeah and it also creates like a framework where you can imaging like hodling across hundreds of years.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: You know like post apocalyptic movie where people are like walking across the like shattered remains of Europe to try to get to Xapo to like get access to these billions of dollars.Jay Kang: Have you seen the land before time?Aaron Lammer: I have.Jay Kang: I feel like we could make a movie that was like \u2026 where Xapo was like the oasis, you know?Aaron Lammer: Oh, yeah.Jay Kang: And that the world has become a post apocalyptic hellscape and a small group of people are trying to make it to Xapo.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Which is the only place with money in the world and it\u2019s been walled off and like \u2026 It\u2019s like Elon Musks\u2019 computer deals.Aaron Lammer: Oh, see I \u2026 In my vision, the world was a scorched wasteland and the people were walking to Xapo so they could get the Bitcoin out to like restart the world economy-Jay Kang: Why would you need a world economy if there\u2019s no world economy left?Aaron Lammer: I mean-Jay Kang: Like what is Bitcoin worth in like a scorched earth scenario?Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s like the key to rebuilding civilization, is to get the Bitcoin network back up.Jay Kang: Explain how.Aaron Lammer: I think we have to cut this off before like we just turn this into a Bitcoin movies podcast.Jay Kang: Yeah, like the stoned Bitcoin movies podcast.Speaker 2: This episode of Coin Talk was taped Wednesday, May 9th at six PM eastern standard time. The Bitcoin price index was $9,294.00.Aaron Lammer: Thanks to everyone for listening. We are brought to you in partnership with Medium.

You don\u2019t even know all the big guests we got coming on.Jay Kang: We have huge guests coming up.Aaron Lammer: You probably haven\u2019t heard that many huge guests on the show and that\u2019s because guest booking\u2019s on a bit of a lag, but I\u2019m telling you, we got a tsunami coming the way of this show.Jay Kang: Yeah, it is gonna revolutionize Coin Talk.Aaron Lammer: We are rock you like an atomic bomb rocked Xapo in the doomsday scenario that we are currently kick starter ICO-ing a movie about.Jay Kang: Is the end of the Xapo movie when Geraldo Rivera went to Al Capone\u2019s vault, they open it and there\u2019s nothing in there?Aaron Lammer: I think the end of the Xapo movie probably has something like the end of like Planet of the Apes, where it\u2019s like \u2026 you think it\u2019s all happening on like a distant moon, and then it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, it was earth. We destroyed it all with Bitcoin.\u201d We\u2019ll see you next week.194 Silicon ValleyBitcoinPodcastRippleICO194 clapsWritten byCoin TalkFollowThe official podcast of Bitcoin crashes.

Monica is the driving force behind Ripple\u2019s messaging and marketing, and helps translate the technical details of how their products work into easy to understand concepts.How did you get dragged into the crazy world of Ripple all the way back in 2013? It was still a pretty obscure project at that time.I worked with Chris Larsen (co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple) when he was the CEO of Prosper. In August 2013, I\u2019d noticed he started something new (Ripple) and I dropped him a line to catch up.From that first conversation, I knew this technology had revolutionary potential, but I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t totally understand it! It took a few conversations and a lot of deep thinking to understand how it works and how we could apply it to solve real world problems. (The truth is I keep learning every day.)From that meeting, I knew I wanted to join the team at Ripple for two reasons. Firstly \u2014 Chris is a true visionary. He was a pioneer in online mortgage lending with E-Loan and again in peer-to-peer lending with Prosper and was a driving force in both categories taking flight. He\u2019s a good person to follow, given his knack for finding disruptive ideas early on.Secondly \u2014 the common thread to Chris\u2019 ventures has been the democratization of finance in some respect. Ripple is no different. Having a background studying third-world development, I am deeply passionate about Ripple\u2019s ability to increase access to global commerce worldwide, and the life-changing impact that will have.What did you do before you got into this?I was at Intuit on the corporate communications team and before that at a tech PR agency.What problem is Ripple solving, and why do you feel passionate about this?At Ripple, our mission is to remove friction from global payments. International payments have earned the reputation of being slow, unreliable and expensive. In fact, they\u2019re prohibitively expensive for entire segments of the population. If global payments are instant, reliable, easy and low-cost, they become so much more accessible to everyone \u2014 especially in underserved markets.To draw a comparison, the Internet made information exchange instant, reliable, easy and low-cost. By breaking down borders and barriers, it\u2019s connected the entire world and enabled previously impossible or unthinkable businesses and opportunities.We have the opportunity to enable a new era in commerce that holds revolutionary possibility. It\u2019s a tough problem to solve but incredibly inspiring and rewarding to work on.What\u2019s been the most inspiring experience you\u2019ve had at Ripple thus far? You\u2019ve been around to see most of the company\u2019s history.I\u2019m most inspired by big customer milestones. It was a watershed moment for us when our first institutional customers went live in production and sent their customers\u2019 payments across the network. Another big moment was when the first institutional customer went live with payments through XRP. In both cases, we had happy customers who have increased volume and usage over time.As an example, SBI Remit and Siam Commercial Bank went live in production with Ripple-powered payments last summer. SBI Remit\u2019s customers are Thai ex-patriates living and working in Japan. In many cases, they\u2019re supporting families back home in Thailand so it\u2019s important their funds arrive quickly and reliably.That real market validation of our products and value propositions is incredibly rewarding and motivates us to keep building.What are some ideas you\u2019re excited about in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, and why?I think interoperability is a critical design principle to an Internet of Value (an Internet that allows money to move around the world like information already does), and needs greater attention from the industry.Our engineering team works a lot on the interoperability of systems \u2014 be they blockchains or traditional. We\u2019re seeing scalability limitations stunt the growth and possibilities of Bitcoin and Ethereum. We developed the Interledger Protocol, which is totally open-source and free, to enable instant transactions across any number of ledgers without risk of failure.As you think about the rapid pace at which this industry moves, what do you think happens over the next few years? And what about longer term?In the next couple of years, we\u2019ll see a culling of the herd in crypto. It\u2019s fantastic to see the whole market grow so rapidly with lots of developers getting involved. But not every new coin and new system has a well-defined and validated use case. Of the 1,500 or so cryptocurrencies in existence, I think many will go away and the strong will survive.Over a 10\u201320 year time horizon, I think blockchain and crypto will be the technology drivers of a new industrial revolution. The most obvious implication is likely greater global commerce and financial inclusion. But there\u2019ll be far-reaching progress and change we can\u2019t even imagine today. Think of how different the world is because of the cotton gin, the shipping container, the Internet. Blockchain and crypto are innovations of that significance.Thanks to Monica for participating!

SpencerFollowMay 28, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readRipple is really good at B2B partnerships and of all the cryptocurrencies it\u2019s been integrated with banks and financial institutions the most successfully. This gives the speculation about a partnership between Ripple (XRP) and Amazon.com (AMZN) an aura of plausibility.However, let\u2019s be clear this is a hypothetical partnership that is yet to happen, and Amazon is not likely to partner with a cryptocurrency directly, it\u2019s already offering blockchain on the cloud via AWS.Last December, the chief cryptographer for Ripple, David Schwartz, let it slip that there were two huge Ripple partnerships coming up that he wasn\u2019t able to name. Ripple is full of big partnerships though, so it\u2019s a bit of a leap to think Amazon is among them. However in recent months, Facebook has created a blockchain division meaning Google and Amazon are under pressure to adopt native cryptocurrency or blockchain solutions to keep at the forefront of innovation.If indeed Ripple is partnering with Amazon, it\u2019s been kept secret pretty well. Ripple payment settlement services and XRP (the coin) would be able to streamline operations and cross-border payments.Ripple has around 4800 times the supply of Bitcoin, this is not a scarce decentralized asset.While Ripple is a distributed, open-source payments system that\u2019s still in beta; it\u2019s highly compatible with the existing financial system and therefore it\u2019s easy to see the commercial digital web adopting it. Amazon has of late partnered with J.P. Morgan Chase and shows both ties to the Pentagon, the police and is nearly a fetish company of Wall Street investors.Ripple on the other hand is led by a private company. According to is OpenCoin, the company behind ripple, the currency addresses the need to keep money flowing freely. Amazon as an E-commerce, Cloud, Entertainment, Grocery-logistics, and AI company \u2014 certainly knows something about keeping money flowing with well over 100 million Amazon Prime customers. It\u2019s also the leading smart speaker in terms of penetration into our homes.The argument goes: Amazon deals with a lot of suppliers from around the globe. These suppliers need to be paid in a fast and efficient way. Amazon is a complex B2B and B2C entity and one of the leading marketplaces of the future. As a global entity Amazon may adopt blockchain for more efficient low-cost and fast payments; Ripple would definately be someone they could look into adopting or even acquiring.Ripple\u2019s mission statement is about unifying a fragmented payment situation:Payment systems today are where email was in the early \u201980s. Every provider built their own system for their customers and if people used different systems they couldn\u2019t easily interact with each other. Ripple is designed to connect different payment systems together.In theory this is a vision that\u2019s compatible with what Amazon is doing with E-commerce around the world, with now a significant presence in India. Even as Walmart has practically acquired Flipkart, Amazon will likely be the dominant marketplace for hundreds of millions of people in India and basically become the primary shopping utility for the english speaking internet.The company building the Ripple protocol, OpenCoin, was co-founded by CEO Chris Larsen and CTO Jed McCaleb. Ripple has had success integrating with groups of Japanese banks in particular. If successful, that amounts to practically a national roll-out in Japan, where Bitcoin adoption with retail and services is commonplace.Ripple bills itself as:Better Than Any BlockchainOne Frictionless Experience To Send Money GloballyRipple connects banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges and corporates via RippleNet to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally. Would Amazon want access to such a system? How would it integrate?The rumor gathered speed in November 2017, when Ripple hosted a conference presentation and displayed a slide that appeared to show Amazon, Uber, and Seagate as prime examples of companies that could use Ripple\u2019s xVia platform. Certainly in Ripple\u2019s end-game, it\u2019s integrated with the likes of Uber and Amazon; however now with Facebook likely going after a FacebookCoin of some kind, Ripple will have to move fast to make the necessary enterprise integration; and not just be relegated for banks and the purely financial world.Ripple QR Code Mobile Payments?In theory, trading between Amazon and suppliers would be as easy as scanning a Q.R code and transferring Ripple (XRP) coins.We know with the likes of AmazonGo stores, consumers sign-in with QR codes. It\u2019s likely FacebookCoin and Amazon\u2019s brick-and-mortar tech will increasingly go the route of QR codes, which have become the dominant mobile payment gateway on the New China internet.Amazon could pilot XRP in any number of ways. XRP blockchain solutions have also been suggested as being ideal for Amazon\u2019s fleet management system on top of the revolutionary payment solutions.If we think seriously about Amazon on the blockchain, if Amazon wanted to have a crypto as the payment currency for their giant online presence, what options would they gravitate towards? They would probably build their own. However if they wanted to try an existing one, XRP would make sense.Ripple thinks its faster and more reliable than anyone else. XRP settles over 500x faster than bitcoin and any other digital asset, which allows for near instant inter-exchange transfers.Ripple positions itself as a complement to, rather than a competitor with, Bitcoin. The Ripple network is designed to allow the seamless transfer of any form of currency, which Amazon might be looking into. For transactions, Amazon could definately use Ripple.

Balvin, Fabio Acosta, Vivi Nevo, Founders Fund, Karlie Kloss, Penni Thow, DJ Skee, Shrug.vc, and Dream Machine.Today I\u2019m very excited to announce that we have integrated XRP into our product so Omni members now have the option to cash out their rental earnings to an XRP wallet. This is especially exciting because this is the first time that consumers can get XRP outside of an exchange.We\u2019re building towards a world with frictionless access to the things we need as we need them, irrespective of ownership. In order to realize this vision, we set out to implement a payments system that was both instantaneous and global, which is why we partnered with Ripple back in January and why we\u2019re excited to announce the XRP cash out option now. By enabling XRP cash outs we\u2019re aiming to lower the barrier to entry for crypto-curious consumers and also reduce the risk because you still own the asset.Ready to give it a try? Rent your things on Omni! When someone rents from you, you\u2019ll earn money that you can then cash out to XRP or USD. While our San Francisco Bay Area and Portland communities have a diverse assortment of rentable items, the most popular ones are currently bikes, folding chairs, folding tables, vacuums/carpet cleaners, tents, and drones. And a little behind the scenes intel \u2014 we see the most unfulfilled searches for musical instruments (drums and keyboards) and cameras.Thank you to the XRP community for your patience as we worked to get this right!

I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a real cryptocurrency, and its business structure/model goes against the moral fabric of cryptocurrency itself.However, it\u2019s possible that XRP will surpass BTC in market cap in 2018.I don\u2019t think this would happen anytime soon, and I hope it doesn\u2019t happen at all, but I think it\u2019s possible.There has been a huge influx of retail investors, and the new folk love them some cheap coins.Just in case you\u2019re not up to speed, Ripple increased from $0.25 to hit all time highs just above $3.50 in the past 30 days.UPDATE:January 9th, 2018Since the time of posting this blog, Ripple has dropped from $2.70 to $1.90I didn\u2019t sell.This is what you get for buying Ripple!February 7th, 2018I sold.Ripple is currently sitting at around $0.70, owning a coin I didn\u2019t believe in brought me my largest loss of the past 12 months.I think XRP surpassing Bitcoin would send shockwaves through the market and change the game as we know it.Before I get into that, let me tell you why Ripple is the worst.Disclaimer: I\u2019m not one of those people who spreads FUD about a coin when they miss the boat on it. I currently hold $XRP, and have made a pretty % on it as well.I just hate myself for it.Ripple is what\u2019s known as a token. Whereas coins like bitcoin trade on their own value, tokens tend to be tied to something else.[1]Ripple is not an actual digital currency, as the quote from Mashableabove would suggest, it\u2019s simply a token.Bitcoin is the actual currency being traded and used, whereas XRP tokens are essentially backed by traditional currencies, as if they\u2019re dollars or yen in another form.[2]Most investors don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re really buying when they buy XRP.When you hear about Ripple making partnerships with Banks and large financial institutions, that doesn\u2019t really have much to do with XRP, the Ripple currency.That\u2019s a win for RippleNet, the framework created by Ripple to speed up large international financial transactions. These large financial transactions aren\u2019t going to take place in XRP, they\u2019re going to take place using whatever currency the countries choose- so more banks using RippleNet does not mean more demand of XRP from financial institutions.When most cryptocurrencies rise in price, its due to an increase in understanding or application of their utility. When Ripple rises in price, its because the company did some solid business development, not because their token is fundamentally increasing in value by virtue of its utility.The price of a cryptocurrency is a reflection of the amount of people who understand its utility.2. Ripple is as centralized as can be.Blockchain technology is a tool that will allow us to decentralize processes mediated by middle men, thereby removing those middle men and allowing peer to peer anything.Blockchain was created to be a tool to put power back in the hands of the individual.You do that by creating a trust-less system where a middleman (like a bank) isn\u2019t needed \u2014 this is the beauty of the technology and at the end of the day, the reason that cryptocurrencies are seeing such a huge increase in market cap.Unlike fiat currency where the supply is controlled by a third-party (like the Federal Reserve), blockchain and the cryptocurrencies that have come from it are a completely transparent way to handle the management and creation of financial infrastructure.So with that in mind, does this raise any red flags?Since Ripple controls 61% of the world\u2019s supply of XRP coins \u2014 61 billion out of 100 billion in total \u2014 the gains placed Larsen\u2019s personal position in the cryptocurrency as well as his share of the XRP owned by his company at a dizzying total of $59.8 billion. [3]Ripple controls a staggering amount of its own supply.There is no mining with Ripple.With Bitcoin (and every other cryptocurrency) you increase the supply by mining. Either through Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).With PoW, miners download a copy of the blockchain ledger and essentially perform accounting duties to ensure that transactions aren\u2019t fraudulent. They are paid for their work in whatever currency they\u2019re mining, therefore increasing the supply.With PoS, miners just have to \u201cstake\u201d their holdings in a wallet, and it earns interest. That interest they earn is new currency, that increases the supply.With Ripple, they decided how much their total supply would be and issued it, there is no mining, there is no trust-less system, there is no utility.Ripple is basically what would happen if a blockchain company said to itself, \u201cWhat if we just made a fiat currency that functions exactly the same as USD. Except we turn ourselves into the Federal Reserve for that currency so we control everything?\u201d.Hell, Ripple didn\u2019t start to climb until the company announced they\u2019d be locking 55 BN XRP in escrow so they could ensure the token holders that they wouldn\u2019t dump all their tokens as soon as the price got up.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ripple", "Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Crypto"]}, {"title": "Transcript", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@cointalk.show/cointalk-%EF%B8%8F-79-jay-bought-ripple-and-other-signs-of-the-apocalypse-95430f482e2f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Coin Talk", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@cointalk.show", "publish_date": "2019-06-19", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-19", "readtime": "31.3", "claps": 24, "voters": 17, "content": "CoinTalkEpisode #79: \ud83c\udfe7 Jay Bought Ripple and Other Signs of the ApocalypseOver the last two weeks Bitcoin has flash crashed, flash rallied, then rallied again.

But more importantly, welcome back to coining.Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. I\u2019m deep in it now, much deeper than earlier. Yeah.Aaron Lammer: More on that soon. I don\u2019t want to blow this for the listeners, but Jay is deep back into coining, and it\u2019s not with Bitcoin. More on that later in the program.Aaron Lammer: First, let\u2019s talk a little bit about what\u2019s happened to the market since we last spoke. It\u2019s been a wild ride, a roller coaster. Crypto is back for another season. Pretty much, we talked two weeks ago. Immediately after, it spiked from 8000 down to briefly 6500, rubber banded up to 7200, retook 8000. I\u2019m looking right now. We\u2019re back and looking at the price of Bitcoin at the top of the show mode. I think we\u2019re in the 8800-ish range.Jay Kang: Yeah. It\u2019s been there for a couple days now.Aaron Lammer: 8750.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: What happened? We talked about this two weeks ago, and I feel like we weirdly have to revisit it again now.Jay Kang: Yeah. We went through five theories that Reddit users had come up with, which had all been compiled in this site called Markets Insider.Aaron Lammer: I think that\u2019s a Business Insider spin off.Jay Kang: That would make sense.Aaron Lammer: Shouts to the OG, Joe Weisenthal for his early guru-ship to the whole Business Insider team.Jay Kang: Do you want to go through those theories first just quickly, and see how we feel about them, if two weeks later they\u2019re more convincing or less convincing than before?Aaron Lammer: Yeah. One thing I want to say is that it\u2019s a wonderful thing, crypto. Unlike sports, someone has to win in sports. All of the things can come true at once in crypto. We had a crash and a rebound, and then another rebound all in this two week span. So if you thought the market was going down, you were right. And if you thought the market was going up, you were also right.Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly.Aaron Lammer: The first theory was the safe haven theory, which was basically I think we boiled down to the Trump fear index. How much fear is the world feeling? Are you feeling more or less fear right now than you were two weeks ago?Jay Kang: I would say it\u2019s pretty constant. And my fears are actually inversely correlated I think with the market. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think Trump is eventually going to crater this thing. But like I said earlier, I think on a show earlier, the real thing that people in the stock market are afraid of is Bernie or Warren winning. That\u2019s worse for them in their opinion. I could see, I think, given that Biden is losing a little bit of steam.Jay Kang: But also that there is a pathway now for either Bernie or Warren to win that maybe some stock people are just like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to hedge into Bitcoin now that it\u2019s easy to buy. I can buy it on all these other platforms,\u201d so I\u2019m going to give that like a 2 out of 10 plausibility from like a 1 out of 10 plausibility, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of Trump. I really just think it\u2019s because people are a little bit worried about the state of the US economy under a far \u2026 not a far leftist, but on a very progressive or someone running on equality. That\u2019s concerning to them. Maybe some of them are starting to hedge right now. What do you think?Aaron Lammer: Okay, so let\u2019s talk about that Warren, Sanders ticket. Let\u2019s just merge them into a single ticket. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s the president. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s the vice president, but let\u2019s just say their policies are a possible winner. I think to the market, they\u2019re probably about equally abhorrent, to the stock investor, bad news either way, doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s the president.Jay Kang: Yeah, I actually think maybe they\u2019re more afraid of Warren because they think she\u2019ll actually be able to hammer through polices whereas they might see Bernie as more of a demagogue who won\u2019t actually get anything done. But the one thing I have seen consistently when reading stories about this and for some reason, I read a lot of stories, mostly because I am very personally interested in the Warren campaign, is that the Wall Street people really seem afraid of Warren. Even though she\u2019s still in third place right now and pretty far behind Biden, there\u2019s no question that just like happened last election cycle, that as things ramp up and these people stay in and they have constituencies, that it\u2019s going to force people like Biden or \u2026 I guess there\u2019s just Biden, because we shouldn\u2019t say like Beto or people that have no shot.Aaron Lammer: Let\u2019s just say that there\u2019s the Yang and then there\u2019s the Warren, Sanders ticket.Jay Kang: Yeah and then there\u2019s Biden.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m not particularly saying that anyone\u2019s going to win. The market should be pricing in all these eventualities in real time.Jay Kang: Yes, exactly. I\u2019m just saying that right now it seems almost impossible to believe that someone could run for president on the Democratic ticket without pushing certain income equality things and certain regulations of Wall Street and Silicon Valley ideas through. They\u2019re just too popularist right now and I think that maybe there is some sense of resignation amongst Wall Street to try and hedge out of those markets given that we\u2019re really only a year and a half away at this point.Aaron Lammer: Can I ask are we accidentally rating everything with our Bitcoin maximalist hats on right now, because there\u2019s this weird way we can look at a Trump and say, \u201cHoly God, this guy who got his finger on the trigger, he\u2019s pushing trade wars, all kinds of things everywhere volatility everywhere, great for Bitcoin.\u201d Then we can also look at a Warren, Sanders ticket and say, \u201cWell, stock traders are going to be fleeing traditional markets, good for Bitcoin.\u201d What eventuality is bad for Bitcoin?Jay Kang: I agree. That\u2019s why I\u2019m giving it a two out of ten.Aaron Lammer: Okay, okay, okay.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really as much to do with it. I\u2019m simply putting out the point that if you believe the politics and the future of the markets are spooking investors, that there\u2019s two sources of spooking. One is, \u201cHoly shit, this guy might blow up the world,\u201d and the other one is, \u201cHoly shit, we might have socialism.\u201d Those things I think are both scary to investments. I would say that a small percentage of them might be thinking about rerouting into Bitcoin, although I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s a lot.Aaron Lammer: Jay, do you remember the music of the 1990s?Jay Kang: Oh yeah, of course. All of it, every song.Aaron Lammer: Something happened in the 1990s, which is that CD mastering came in and everyone just pumped up the volume. It became like a competitive game to just remove the dynamic range of music and fill out the whole spectrum with the throbbing sounds of ska, swing and so much more. One of the things that it resulted in, in my opinion, is a certain amount of ear fatigue, on the part of listeners, where we just got used to extremely pumped up music with very little dynamic range. Eventually, it doesn\u2019t sound loud to you anymore. The trick stops working and now we just are stuck with music that sounds kind of tinny and overly full, in my opinion. I feel like that\u2019s a bit what\u2019s happened with the fear index in the age of Trump. I don\u2019t really know what would make me fear more and I can\u2019t imagine any outcome in which I fear less.Jay Kang: I think if he started agitated a little bit more clearly towards a war \u2026 Although, I don\u2019t know what else he could do more than tweet out, \u201cIran, you better watch yourself,\u201d or whatever the fuck he tweeted out, but I think if I took him more serious that he wanted to start a war, because I will say this about Trump which is that I don\u2019t think that he wants to start a war. I don\u2019t think he wants to be a wartime president. I think that there is something in his head where he\u2019s just like, \u201cThis is all funny and this is all about my ego, but I\u2019m not going to get millions of people killed because of this,\u201d Do you know what I mean?Jay Kang: There\u2019s certain arms conflicts that the United States could have gotten in already during his presidency and I think people would argue that outside what\u2019s happened in Yemen, that somebody like Hillary Clinton who\u2019s a lot more hawkish would have gotten involved in these situations. I don\u2019t think that outside though of him being like, \u201cWell, I and do go to war to win the next election that I could be more \u2026\u201d I think you\u2019re right. There\u2019s no escalation of my panic.Aaron Lammer: I feel like Trump\u2019s a little like Tether FUD, terrifying the first time, very scary the second time. Once you get into the 9th tether panic, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s fake. Yeah, Trump is reckless and he could start a war. He\u2019s just done it so many times. I can\u2019t go down into my bomb shelter every time Trump starts saber rattling and I kind of think markets probably feel a bit the same way. I\u2019m going to be with you. I\u2019ll give it a 3 out of 10.Jay Kang: Okay, that\u2019s bullish.Aaron Lammer: All right, mainstream appeal and this basically means Fidelity and Ameritrade, Etrade, et cetera, all the people who are going to let you buy crypto with your easy to use mainstream account. Any change in this one for you? [crosstalk 00:10:45]-Jay Kang: I\u2019ve had a life change since we did our last podcast, which is-Aaron Lammer: You\u2019re [crosstalk 00:10:49] coiner.Jay Kang: Part of the reason why I got back into coinage is because I finally got an email from Robinhood after a year of waiting. It said that I was eligible to trade crypto currencies now that my spot in line had come up. I got to say. I really don\u2019t like Coinbase. I find their fees to be absurd. I also don\u2019t like the idea that you have to buy and then they lock it up and you can\u2019t move it for like seven days or something like that. That definitely makes me suspicious.Aaron Lammer: Does it also bother you that they don\u2019t seem to be catering directly to the gambling market?Jay Kang: Well, that\u2019s part of it, which is just that if I\u2019m speculating, I kind of want to speculate in the same place where I\u2019m buying monthly puts on fucking Tesla into the other dumb degenerate shit that I do. To have crypto on Robinhood is actually kind of amazing. You can\u2019t buy that many coins. The only really obscure altcoin you can buy is Dogecoin, but it\u2019s so easy to sell off an option or to sell off a stock and then buy crypto, that it actually has made me more willing to dabble in crypto, because I\u2019m just like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just exit out of here like I exit out of everything else.\u201dJay Kang: It doesn\u2019t quite feel that way in Coinbase, because it\u2019s a separate thing. I have wire money to them. I have to wait for a while to do anything with it, and then I have to withdraw from there right into my bank account. This is a little bit different. It\u2019s like I would say like 15% easier and that actually has \u2026 It has influenced my behavior.Aaron Lammer: If I\u2019m reading you correctly, you\u2019re kind of saying if I can\u2019t just cash my chips out right after I win a bunch of money playing baccarat at a casino, it\u2019s not as much fun.Jay Kang: Yeah, but also I don\u2019t want to go to another casino to play baccarat. I want to go to the casino that has craps and baccarat.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, yeah. No, I buy it. The side narrative that\u2019s connected with me is just I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m starting to hear more people ask about crypto than were asking about it six months ago. I think other people who are involved in crypto feel a similar way and when you think about if it\u2019s even 50% easier than it was during the last bull run. I think you could argue just with the existing accounts in products like Robinhood, Fidelity, Ameritrade or whatever, it is easier.Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s a lot easier.Aaron Lammer: This is a powder keg. When this next one goes off, it\u2019s going to have a bunch more fuel because a bunch of people already have Fidelity.Jay Kang: Can I ask a question though? When you say when this thing goes off, it\u2019s up like 300% from the kang line. Why is this not the parabolic moonshot? It\u2019s basically done that.Aaron Lammer: Can we talk about something there, because I think you\u2019re absolutely right. You\u2019ve hit the nail on the head. We talk about mania when it\u2019s above 10,000. The mania is going from 3,300 to 10,000.Jay Kang: Yeah, and we\u2019re not at 10,000 yet, but we hit 9,000 at some point or like 8,950, I think. Yeah, I anecdotally have had the same thing happen where people in my life some of whom are responsible adults who didn\u2019t get in on the last crypto craze and kind of are FOMOing now, being like, \u201cOh wait, maybe I can be one of the ones who got in early and make money.\u201d Then some start degenerates I know, they\u2019ve all asked me about it in the last week. I don\u2019t know if those people are going to be the fuel, if there\u2019s enough of them. It certainly is not as much as it was last time, even when Bitcoin was around 5,000 or 6,000, 7,500. It was like four people a day at work. Now, it\u2019s been like four people total.Aaron Lammer: Imagine we had 12,000, imagine we really start rolling into this thing.Jay Kang: Yeah, I mean I also think at that point, some people would be afraid that it\u2019s already capped out. But I will say that-Aaron Lammer: You mean smart people.Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly, exactly. We predicted a while ago that it would take a while for Bitcoin to get rid of the stink of all these scams and all the crashes and the only thing I\u2019ll say in a bullish sense right is that it does feel like some of that stink, not all of it, but let\u2019s say like 33% of stink is gone and that people are willing to trust it a little bit more, because the price is going up. That said, I think it\u2019s extremely fragile and that only big downward movement is going to wipe all those people out. Right now, it seems okay. It\u2019s like the type of thing where I kind of wish we had more market manipulation so we wouldn\u2019t get a normal, natural retracement.Aaron Lammer: Well, I think you can be pretty confident that we have a good amount of market manipulation and if you ask me, \u201cAaron, why are you so bullish?\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just feel like these market manipulators want to see the prices go up.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m not saying this is real growth. I\u2019m just saying you can kind of feel the vibe in the stadium even in a fixed match and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, I think this is fixed in the upward direction.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, the vibe has changed. Very, very precise technical analysis term of the vibe, I would say that as vibe experts, I think we both believe that the vibe around crypto is over. All right, do you want to go to the third reason?Aaron Lammer: All right, the third reason is people leaving alts for Bitcoin. I feel like at this point, I can\u2019t really say that people \u2026 Alts are very racked against Bitcoin, but the minute Bitcoin showed life also had a little run there. I\u2019m not comfortable really saying anything about alts at this point.Jay Kang: The only thing I\u2019m comfortable saying is that I am now once again an altcoiner.Aaron Lammer: Well, I say this about alts, rather than \u2026 the story is that people are flowing out of alts into Bitcoin, I think alts are just a riskier bet and people are like, \u201cOh, well, I really think Bitcoin is going up. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with alts.\u201d As soon as alts starts showing mania and alts can show mania in a week, easily. Give me a few double digit days in a row and then tell me people aren\u2019t making an exodus from alt coins.Jay Kang: Yeah, and I think that those same, degenerate and uninformed impulses still exist amongst a lot of people for alt coins. One of the friends who\u2019s been asking me a lot about crypto is rather wealthy and has a very \u2026 I\u2019ll just put it this way. He has a very high risk tolerance and he bought like-Aaron Lammer: Is this Doug Kim we\u2019re talking about?Jay Kang: No, it\u2019s not Doug Kim. This person is actually more degenerate than Doug Kim.Aaron Lammer: We got to have Doug back on the show.Jay Kang: He bought like an alarming amount of XRP Ripple and something called BTT, which is like a derivative coin of Tron. It was based entirely off some Twitter guy who was saying, \u201cOh, I called the last price movements.\u201dAaron Lammer: It\u2019s a derivative of Tron?Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s a derivative of Tron.Aaron Lammer: You\u2019ve gone to a level below even where I operate.Jay Kang: I didn\u2019t buy any of this stuff. He did, but it was the same thing. It was the same exact story. He was just like, \u201cWell, this stuff is like $0.25. Why wouldn\u2019t I buy that instead of buying Bitcoin?\u201d I was trying to explain to him. I was just like, \u201cWell, you should look at the supply. A lot of these small coins are scams. You have to look at the circulating supply and the fixed supply.\u201d He was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t care. This guy on Twitter is on fire.\u201d It reminded me of us like a year and a half ago or maybe us now.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, well, what has changed? What have we possibly learned?Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know. I think we\u2019ve learned to scold people who do that, but I will tell you that I bought a considerable amount of XRP after this guy bought it.Aaron Lammer: Let me make a very simple, easy to understand argument. Do think there\u2019s a good chance that crypto will regain its mania and the Bitcoins will reach new highs?Jay Kang: This year?Aaron Lammer: No, let\u2019s just say ever, in the next five years.Jay Kang: Oh, yeah, sure this a chance.Aaron Lammer: Okay, so if you think Bitcoin is going to print a new high and you also think XRP is going to print a new high, XRP is going to go 10X before printing an all time high or maybe like 8X or 6X or something like that. You have a lot more ceiling than you do with Bitcoin. This is exactly how we thought about it when we first started buying. We looked at Litecoin. The first thing I ever bought was Litecoin.Jay Kang: Litecoin\u2019s gone crazy, by the way.Aaron Lammer: I know. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.Jay Kang: Do you want to buy Litecoin?Aaron Lammer: Maybe people are that dumb. Maybe everything will happen again. Maybe we are in a loop of dumb market thinking. If you believe that, which is not super crazy, XRP is very attractive right now. If we\u2019re on the brink of going totally dumb, I would be buying XRP right now.Jay Kang: I did buy XRP and it\u2019s done great over the three days that I\u2019ve had it or four days that I\u2019ve had.Aaron Lammer: Can you explain why you bought it?Jay Kang: Well, yeah. This is embarrassing, but the guy who bought all the XRP is also the luckiest person I\u2019ve ever met. I have been around gambling long enough to know or to at least have hammered in my head that some people are just lucky and you can mathematically say anything that you want, but some people are going to run on the hot side of the odds for their entire life. It\u2019s just math distribution. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to do it again, but this guy just keeps doing it, and so me and my friends all bought XRP once he did it, just because we\u2019re just like, \u201cOh, he\u2019s so lucky. Of course it\u2019s going to go up.\u201d That\u2019s it. That was my brilliant investment strategy.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know anything about his other betting history, so I can\u2019t interrogate the fact that he\u2019s been lucky in the past, but is it possible also that his bets, even if mockable, are good? I would say right now, there\u2019s a little bit of the market turns its nose up at things that are stinky, right? So yes, XRP is stinky, Tron, very stinky. There\u2019s a lot of stink on the market, but is being totally objective in this market, maybe being immune to stink? Because if I had no stink nose, I\u2019d look at Ripple right now. Look, I\u2019m holding a big Ethereum bag. Yes, do I believe in Ethereum more than Ripple? I do, but I actually believe in an overall recovery for crypto and if crypto does overall recover, them stinky bags are going to be worth a lot.Jay Kang: Look, I think you\u2019re right. In this particular instance, it\u2019s not that \u2026 I told him what I still believe, which is I don\u2019t think that buying XRP is a bad bet. I just think you should have better thinking on it, because he was like-Aaron Lammer: I would just weight that bet with Bitcoin. That\u2019s always my feeling is that you got to anchor at least partially to Bitcoin.Jay Kang: He has a lot of Bitcoin too.Aaron Lammer: But this guy clearly knows way more about betting than I do. That\u2019s how he got all these Bitcoin that he\u2019s betting.Jay Kang: His XRP bet is essentially based on some random guy with 4,000 Twitter follows in Australia who records these weird videos of himself being like, \u201cI have called the last five price spikes.\u201d He\u2019s like on the minute chart on TA, like the most granular chart, being like, \u201cOkay, there\u2019s accumulation here in the next 15 minutes. We\u2019re going to see the moon,\u201d and then it doesn\u2019t happen. Then he\u2019s like, \u201cI need 10 more minutes.\u201d All I\u2019ve said to my friend is like, \u201cListen, I don\u2019t know what you do with your money, but this is literally the most pathetic thing that you could be buying into.\u201dAaron Lammer: Aren\u2019t we just the respectable version of that, like with ledger status?Jay Kang: Aaron, look, I\u2019ve bought \u2026 Fucking, I\u2019ve bought XRP because I thought this guy was lucky. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m giving myself a pass here. There isn\u2019t a single thing that I\u2019ve done that\u2019s less degenerate than what he\u2019s done, except the amount that we\u2019ve invested in. I don\u2019t think that buying something like the derivative of Tron. Maybe it\u2019s a good idea. Tron went crazy for a long fucking time, while we were all poo-pooing it, it went nuts. That\u2019s nothing to really sneeze at. If all you really want is to take like let\u2019s say $50,000 and turn it into like $500,000, you might as well buy fucking XRP and some shitcoins that other people might FOMO into, as long as you have an exit plan. No, I generally agree with you that our pretensions and our prejudices and our snobiness is probably to our detriment.Aaron Lammer: Can I put forward a crypto investment thesis for going forward? If you believe that crypto is basically all a giant scam, which I would say both of us at last somewhat believe, you perhaps more than me.Jay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s fair.Aaron Lammer: And you also believe crypto is going to succeed and that the people who play the game best will be successful. Wouldn\u2019t you basically use the founder\u2019s hypothesis, which is invest in the person, not the idea and just seek out the biggest scammers and the most successful crypto scammers and invest in them? That\u2019s the bold case for Ripple. That\u2019s the bold case for Tron is that they\u2019re basically pure marketing and that they\u2019re run by scamming marketing masters who are good at planting stories and making phony partnerships and acquiring other companies to grow them, like BitTorrent.Jay Kang: Yeah, and also maybe market manipulation. The one that he bought was the BitTorrent coin, BTT.Aaron Lammer: Market manipulation\u2019s a big part of that. Here\u2019s another one: Binance Coin. It\u2019s basically just a bet on [CZ\u2019s 00:25:46] crazy cult of personality and marketing scale.Jay Kang: Yeah and maybe his ability to be the singular exchange out there, which I don\u2019t think is a crazy thing.Aaron Lammer: Remember I had my money laundering index where you\u2019re getting exposure to Monero and Zcash, but less Zcash, really the ones that people are actually using? It would be like if we made a pure internet marketing index and it was coins that are basically have no function other than for a hype man to hype them.Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly.Aaron Lammer: And to use the money they got from one hype to buy other companies. I know that sounds crazy, but I was just reading a profile of Marc Benioff\u2019s Salesforce. That\u2019s basically Salesforce\u2019s game plan. They just keep getting more and more money and buying other business software and incorporating it. The company itself on some level is getting bigger and bigger.Jay Kang: Yeah, all I know about Salesforce is that it\u2019s big. I don\u2019t know a single thing that they do.Aaron Lammer: Okay, should we get to our final hypotheses here?Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019ve been getting nicely down the rabbit hole there I feel like. Good job, us. The Bitfinex scandal drove Bitcoin purchases. Let me say this. That Bitfinex scandal didn\u2019t have legs.Jay Kang: Yeah. It seems like it\u2019s already over until the trial stuff begins, right? I\u2019m going to give that a big zero.Aaron Lammer: I do feel like there\u2019s a growing sentiment that New York City is going to prosecute crypto, which is a New York City resident. I don\u2019t really appreciate that much.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Although, on the plus side, it could help our ability to get interviews with the defendants and prosecutors, so I\u2019ll give that one 3 out of 10.Jay Kang: Angry crypto guys who are yelling about the state. I think we\u2019ve had enough of those one. Let\u2019s just continue our conversation that we were having, because I thought it was interesting about the altcoin market and if we have started another cycle of dumb money coming into crypto. I don\u2019t believe this hypothesis necessarily, but I don\u2019t disbelieve, but I just want to lay it out and I want you to respond to it, okay?Aaron Lammer: Okay.Jay Kang: Which is that by the time that a lot of people started hearing about crypto every single day in 2016, that the price of Bitcoin was already over $10,000, that it already had these parabolic moves and that some people, because the price was so high and because they were getting so many warnings, did not buy in and those people did know about Bitcoin, they did know what had happened. They might not have condemned it in the same way and that now that the price of Bitcoin is under $10,000, which I think is a huge mental block. Those round numbers do matter in terms of people\u2019s psychology, that-Aaron Lammer: Hugely, hugely.Jay Kang: That they feel like, \u201cLook, if I want to double my money, maybe this whole scam thing is going to happen again and I want to get in early,\u201d and not just that, they don\u2019t the same thing that everybody else does, which is they start with Bitcoin and then they get bored and then they start moving over to other things that they see are going crazy when they\u2019re reading through Twitter and stuff. They get hooked in and they\u2019re like, \u201cHoly shit. This BTT thing, which is the BitTorrent coin. I know what BitTorrent is. This thing is fractions of a cent. Why don\u2019t I buy like two million of these coins and just hope it goes to $5 and then I\u2019ll be a rich person and I\u2019ll have cashed in on the second crypto boom.\u201dJay Kang: In addition to that, maybe there is some narrative out there thinking like, \u201cWell, now that these big companies are involved, this is web 2.0. This is not the first .com boom and bust, but this is a building of shit like Google and I should get in on the ground floor there.\u201d That may be all that psychology put together has a lot to do with the retail investor that is interested in crypto right now. What do you think?Aaron Lammer: Well, we\u2019ve always tried to go dumb on this show and give people none of the benefit of the doubt and assume that they\u2019re being stupid. For the most part, I think we have concluded that most crypto buyers are either giant, whale level, macro market manipulators and those are the people, let\u2019s be honest, who made most of the money, and I include the exchanges with those because the exchange themselves are macro market manipulators, and then these dumb kind of kid trader gamblers, which I think are a much smaller portion of the puzzle but are probably the people who drive alt coin trading for the most part, I think. I don\u2019t think that many people are actually that interested in alt coin trading. I think there is a certain kind of big money that doesn\u2019t ever really get passed say an Ethereum or a Litecoin.Jay Kang: Well, are you sure about that? Because the reason why thing weren\u2019t limited to that in the beginning was because Coinbase had such a monopoly on new users and that was all they offered but it\u2019s not even that they offer all these coins, but they at least let you see the listings of all these other shit coins.Aaron Lammer: Well, so now I want to talk about what\u2019s different this time. I don\u2019t assume that a new crypto buyer has actually analyzed the whole last crypto mania and crash. They probably just know a little bit about it, right? They know that crypto was really high and then it crashed and maybe they know that there was some funny business and there was some feeling that the market was manipulated and they heard about some scandals. Who knows what they know?Jay Kang: Sure.Aaron Lammer: Now, assuming that they\u2019re basically like us, they come to Coinbase, they come to Gemini, they maybe use the Cash App, and they probably first buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin probably, if this is really the market wave we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s going to stall out a bit here, maybe kind of hover around close to 10,000 and assuming that this happens again, we\u2019re going to start seeing some of these alts go off. I would assume that the new set of alts is going to be what\u2019s available at Robinhood, Coinbase, et cetera. The biggest gains from here are probably the coins that were not included in the original set when we were on Coinbase, but are now.Jay Kang: Sure, so what would that be? Like BAT, [inaudible 00:32:29]?Aaron Lammer: Yes, Stellar.Jay Kang: XRP.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Stellar.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s kind of the usual suspects, but I think if we assume that history\u2019s just going to repeat, what I would expect is that within that elite prestige alts coin pool, some different things are going to shoot out than last time. So like right now \u2026Jay Kang: Yeah, sure-Aaron Lammer: \u2026 Monero is actually trading above Zcash, but Monero not any of these exchanges.Jay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s true.Aaron Lammer: I have no idea why.Jay Kang: Well, they all banned Monero, if you remember.Aaron Lammer: For the most part, yeah. I don\u2019t know where people are getting all this Monero. Come buy mine.Jay Kang: Maybe it\u2019s actually being used. I would say that I find that compelling in a narrative sense, but let\u2019s remember that there was a day where the founder of Ripple was the richest man in the world on paper. It\u2019s not like Ripple didn\u2019t go crazy. It definitely went crazy.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s true.Jay Kang: Now I\u2019m actually curious about this, because I do think that one of the things that was a product of the last bull run, which will have some sort of effect is A, I think there\u2019s probably less market manipulation now than there was back then, mostly because all these exchanges had to really \u2026 They all basically got fucking subpoena\u2019d or they got put under investigation and it\u2019s going to be harder for them to do the same things that they did last time. That\u2019s a huge chunk of it, but I think there\u2019s also a smaller chunk of it where I do think that the amount of money that people are going to put it, as opposed to what they did before where even you and I probably put in an irresponsible amount of money into crypto. I think that people are going to be a little bit more risk sensitive than they were before, because the gospel is no longer like John McAfee saying, \u201cThis is going to go to a million dollars.\u201d It\u2019s no longer like we\u2019re going to have a whole new system of money. It\u2019s going to be the new internet.Jay Kang: It\u2019s really now like, \u201cHey, this is an investment tool and also maybe it\u2019s a small portion of a brand new type of economy and a brand new type of technology.\u201d I think that\u2019s less of a draw than what we saw before, which was just people basically turning their entire lives over to crypto. I don\u2019t know. Does that sound compelling to you? Because I\u2019m actually not even sure if I believe that.Aaron Lammer: Jay, you remind me of like a veteran of a war, comes back. You did a little time in Europe in the 40s fighting on the allied side and you come home and you\u2019re like, \u201cMan, war was just horrific, but I feel better in that future generations. We\u2019ve kind of learned our lesson about this and they have movie cameras now, so people are going to see that that is truly just horrific and they\u2019ll never want to go to war again.\u201dJay Kang: Well, there hasn\u2019t been-Aaron Lammer: [crosstalk 00:35:28] atomic bomb.Jay Kang: There hasn\u2019t been a World War III yet.Aaron Lammer: No, but we haven\u2019t really learned our lesson about war as a whole. I think that each generation thinks that they are smarter or more modern and then gets dragged into the same cycles. I just thing crypto hasn\u2019t gotten any smarter. You\u2019re smarter because you were around for the last run, but if this is a mania, it\u2019s going to be fueled I think mostly by people who weren\u2019t around. We\u2019re old.Jay Kang: That is true. That is true. My friend who wasn\u2019t around for the last crypto one is acting so stupid that I want to throttle him.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019re scarred.Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly.Aaron Lammer: We\u2019re at the VFW hall with like pints in our hands being like, \u201cThese young bucks, they don\u2019t know nothing.\u201dJay Kang: It definitely is limiting our earning potential I think or else I think I would just be FOMOing into shitcoins right now as opposed to just buying XRP.Aaron Lammer: Does that mean your entire crypto portfolio is 100% XRP?Jay Kang: Right now, yeah, mostly just because I did it for fun to-Aaron Lammer: How would you feel if Bitcoin goes buck wild right now and Ripple crashes?Jay Kang: I\u2019d feel bad. [inaudible 00:36:48] feel great. What do you want the answer to be?Aaron Lammer: No, no, I\u2019m just surprised. For most of the time we\u2019ve been in crypto, we\u2019ve been kind of collectively hedged against the crypto market as the whole, basically \u2026 Not against the crypto market, with the crypto market as a whole.Jay Kang: I\u2019m much less afraid of Bitcoin taking off and my BTC value getting wrecked than everything crashing again, so let\u2019s say that first. That\u2019s like the least of my concerns.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019ll say I\u2019m just obsessed with my Bitcoin value right now where I\u2019m like even when Bitcoin was going on, my Bitcoin value was going down and I was kind of bummed.Jay Kang: Okay, so you bought a bunch of Ethereum?Aaron Lammer: I bought Ethereum the whole way down and I\u2019ve experienced a little bit of Ethereum relief since then, but for my entire buy to bare out the trade, I need a lot more Ethereum recovery. It would need to be at like 500 now.Jay Kang: For you to be even-Aaron Lammer: For me [crosstalk 00:37:53] selling it. To be like a successful trading [inaudible 00:37:58]. Somewhere around [crosstalk 00:38:00].Jay Kang: So it [inaudible 00:38:00] 2X.Aaron Lammer: 400, yeah. If any of this stuff comes back, I\u2019m just overall extremely Bitcoin wrecked. My portfolio has come back a lot from the bottom and I\u2019m happy about that, but that\u2019s the danger of being \u2026 I\u2019m about 60/40 Bitcoin verse everything else as everything else has gotten wrecked to Bitcoin. Just about everything has gotten wrecked to Bitcoin.Jay Kang: Yeah, I\u2019m looking at the prices right now and it does dawn on me that if we had \u2026 This is the exercise we always do that if we had bought Bitcoin when we first got into it, when the price was around $2,500 to $3,500 and we had just kept it the whole time, that we would be doing really well.Aaron Lammer: We would be hovering around 3X. We would have never been as wrecked as we were.Jay Kang: And then the lessons that you and I have talked about now on multiple, multiple, multiple episodes, dozens of episodes for the past year and a half didn\u2019t apply at all. It just went straight into the XRP.Aaron Lammer: We act like crypto is torture, but it\u2019s actually trading that\u2019s torture.Jay Kang: This is so stupid. What am I doing?Aaron Lammer: Bitcoin is pretty easy. If you bought it at any time except at the very top and just held it, even if you bought at Bitcoin 8,000 on the way up and just held on, you\u2019re doing fine right now. It\u2019s only us who are idiots.Jay Kang: All right, you know what? Fuck it. I\u2019m selling my XRP right now on the air.Aaron Lammer: To buy Bitcoin you mean?Jay Kang: No, I\u2019m going to roll it into some Tesla short or something like that.Aaron Lammer: Speaking of crypto [inaudible 00:39:45].Jay Kang: Yeah, Tesla shorts are like by far the most fun thing to \u2026 Actually, I can\u2019t do it because I can\u2019t sign into Coinbase. All right, well, is there anything you want to talk about? We\u2019re at the 40 minute mark.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I think that like covered most of the stuff I was interested in. Going forward, how will you manage that XRP [inaudible 00:40:06]? You\u2019re just going to sell it right now or do you have like a specific price target?Jay Kang: Okay, can you tell you the real problem is that all the people who are in my degenerate gambling group chat, they\u2019re all in XRP too just because the NBA finals is in a lull and because there\u2019s nothing to really bet on, experience come the summers, there\u2019s going to be even less to bet on. We\u2019ve just been talking about crypto and the most degenerate ways possible. I kind of don\u2019t want to miss out on that if it goes crazy. If it goes to like $0.90, I\u2019m going to be so mad.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m going to say that the bullishness from within your group makes me bullish, because those are the kind of people I know if Ripple doubles right now are not going to immediately dump. They\u2019re going to hold on and try to get a crazier return and I do think a Ripple mania could result in the extremely cheap Ripple that\u2019s available right now even in major apps. We\u2019ll just have to see.Jay Kang: Are you going to buy Ripple?Aaron Lammer: I might buy a little Ripple. I got a little out of my Cardano position. I think I might go from Cardano to Ripple.Jay Kang: If you\u2019re in Cardano \u2026 If we-Aaron Lammer: If that\u2019s an Atomic [inaudible 00:41:18] on Atomic Wallet, then I might be picking up a little bit of Ripple with my Cardano.Jay Kang: Do it so that we can have this thread going through the podcast where we\u2019re now Ripple maximalist. I think that would be a good heel turn for us.Aaron Lammer: Well, just like you FOMOed out into Ripple this week \u2026 I\u2019m sorry, XRP. I don\u2019t want to mix those up. I FOMOed a little bit into being like, \u201cShould I put a little of this crypto on the NBA playoffs because I actually think that there\u2019s some kind of juicy bets in this Warriors, Raptors matchup.\u201dJay Kang: What did you bet?Aaron Lammer: Well, I have not actually bet. I wanted to run them by you.Jay Kang: Okay.Aaron Lammer: So I think the Warriors are going to win, but I don\u2019t really like Warriors to win at like minus [crosstalk 00:42:06].Jay Kang: Like minus 280, yeah.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, and it\u2019s just like I\u2019m not too super interested in that. I also think Durant will never play as a Warrior.Jay Kang: Is that a bet?Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s unfortunately not a bet, so I\u2019m like, \u201cHow can I form a bet out of that hypothesis?\u201d One of the ways would be to bet Curry and Clay for finals MVP.Jay Kang: What are the odds for each one?Aaron Lammer: Well, I like Clay a lot at 14 to 1, especially if it somehow is a short series, you get a couple Clay games in.Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s just hard to \u2026 It\u2019s a little bit hard for me to see what would happen \u2026 You would have to average like 30 points a game for the series and somehow like guard Kawhi or something like that.Aaron Lammer: Or Curry would have to have a somewhat mundane series by his own standards, but they still beat the Raptors, which I actually could believe happening. Now, Curry is minus 140 for finals MVP. He\u2019s never won before. You\u2019d think that they\u2019re probably give it to him in any kind of a victory since he\u2019s never won before.Jay Kang: Yeah, I don\u2019t know about that, because I think that at that point, you might as well just grab the minus, the series win bet, because you\u2019re taking on a lot of \u2026 or just bet the Warriors to win every game on the money line or something like that, because \u2026 I don\u2019t think you should do that. I actually don\u2019t agree with your assessment of the series. I think I\u2019m going to bet on the Raptors to win, because \u2026Aaron Lammer: How dare you?Jay Kang: I\u2019m betting good odds on it and I also just think that not having Durant is kind of a problem against the team that can actually completely destroy your half court offense in the same way that Toronto did with Milwaukee for four games in a row. I also just think that Kawhi really could present a lot of problems for everyone on the Warriors depending on who he\u2019s guarding. The thing that I really feel the most strong about is I don\u2019t really buy this [inaudible 00:44:22] Draymond thing that\u2019s happening right. I feel like at some point, he\u2019s going to implode. If it was like a 50/50 bet, I would certainly bet the Warriors, but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like any of those bets for you honestly.Aaron Lammer: So you don\u2019t like Draymond for finals MVP then?Jay Kang: What\u2019s the odds on that?Aaron Lammer: I think [crosstalk 00:44:44].Jay Kang: It\u2019s like eight to one or something?Aaron Lammer: No, no, no, no, it\u2019s like 20 or 30 to 1.Jay Kang: Oh really?Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s lower than Clay.Jay Kang: I would pick that. That\u2019s a bet I would [inaudible 00:44:53].Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I kind of like that too because there\u2019s kind of a good narrative there and they gave it to Iguodala that time, which was also kind of a narrative finals MVP.Jay Kang: Yeah, so I would bet Clay and Draymond at that point.Aaron Lammer: And Draymond. Yeah, I would bet Clay, Draymond and maybe the road games, because I believe they\u2019re just going to come out firing in those [crosstalk 00:45:15].Jay Kang: They\u2019re an underdog in game one, which is weird.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. To me, I\u2019m a little bit surprised at the relative respect levels here.Jay Kang: Yeah, well, it\u2019s like-Aaron Lammer: They\u2019re dogs on the road to the Raptors.Jay Kang: I was trying to think of that, yeah. Well, there\u2019s dogs on the road in game one of the finals, but they\u2019re like a minus 290 favorite. It\u2019s just weird.Aaron Lammer: They also haven\u2019t lost a game with this lineup yet.Jay Kang: Yeah. Well, that is true. But Toronto\u2019s-Aaron Lammer: This is a pretty good lineup.Jay Kang: Toronto-Aaron Lammer: This lineup\u2019s had a lot of success.Jay Kang: Toronto also just won four games in a row against a much better team than the Portland Trail Blazers, so there\u2019s that too.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s true. But didn\u2019t Kawhi kind of like fucked up to you towards the end of that series?Jay Kang: He had like 18 rebounds in game seven, so it\u2019s-Aaron Lammer: I know, but like his body was going through things that a human body should avoid.Jay Kang: Yeah, I don\u2019t know if using the human body metric is a good way to think about Kawhi. Yeah, those are the bets I would do. I think I would bet those two MVPs and maybe not even bet the series and just bet those two and hope they hit, because they\u2019re both pretty good payouts.Aaron Lammer: Well, this series will still be running when we [inaudible 00:46:26] next week, so I\u2019m going to pick up some Ripple and maybe we can make one of our classic Ripple on Ripple.Jay Kang: Yeah, one Ripple.Aaron Lammer: All right.

The overall valuation of the crypto markets has surpassed $450 billion and, according to CoinMarketCap, is currently making $457 billion.There has been a lot of buying interest growing for Bitcoin recently as the largest cryptocurrency by market-cap surged by over six percent in the last 24-hours and touched $9800. Analysts say that one of the major reasons for Bitcoin to shoot on Thursday was the announcement coming from Goldman Sachs, who is launching its first Bitcoin trading platform involving Bitcoin and its derivative products.Participation of this institutional giant from the Wall Street is certainly a big development in itself, and a sign that the digital currency markets are now seen positively in the global financial space.Michael Moro, chief executive of Genesis Global Trading said:\u201cThere\u2019s been some level of sentiment amongst institutional investors that the asset class isn\u2019t legitimate until the big banks get involved. And while they\u2019re still not trading the underlying, Goldman getting involved in the forwards is an important first step.\u201dAt the press time, Bitcoin is trading at $9703.13 with a surge of over 5.5% in the last 24-hours. In the past one month, the cryptocurrency has gained 50%. The overall market cap of Bitcoin as on date is $165 billion.On the other hand, Ethereum is seen making some phenomenal northward moves in the last four days starting May 1st, Tuesday. On May 1st, Ethereum was trading at a price of $642 and since then it has increased by nearly 25%. Today, at the press time Ethereum has surged by 10.5% and is currently trading just short of $800 ($796), according to the data on CoinMarketCap. In the past one month, Ethereum has delivered over 100% gains from its low of $368 on April 6, 2018. The overall market cap of Ethereum as on date is $78 billion.This rise of Ethereum is quite surprising considering the fact that it has been on the radar of regulatory bodies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who recently said that Ether tokens might be qualified as securities.However, Google co-founder Sergey Brin recently credited Ethereum for the boom in computing taking place currently. Sergey said:\u201cWe are truly in a technology renaissance, an exciting time where we can see applications across nearly every segment of modern society. There are several factors at play in this boom of computing. First, of course, is the steady hum of Moore\u2019s Law. The second factor is greater demand, stemming from advanced graphics in gaming and, surprisingly, from the GPU-friendly proof-of-work algorithms found in some of today\u2019s leading cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum.\u201dThe third-largest cryptocurrency \u2014 Ripple \u2014 has also posted significant gains in the last one month. Ripple has gained nearly 100% from its low of $0.47 on April 6. At the press time, Ripple is trading at the price of $0.91 with its market valuations crossing $35 billion.Source", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Ripple", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Ripple Hit With Class-Action Suit Over \u2018Never Ending ICO\u2019", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@w12.io/ripple-hit-with-class-action-suit-over-never-ending-ico-ff443c43acfb?source=search_post", "author_name": "W12", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@w12.io", "publish_date": "2018-05-05", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-09", "readtime": "1.94", "claps": 77, "voters": 16, "content": "Ripple Hit With Class-Action Suit Over \u2018Never Ending ICO\u2019W12FollowMay 5, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readRipple Labs Inc., the fintech startup that controls the world\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency, was hit by a lawsuit alleging that it led a scheme to raise hundreds of millions of dollars through unregistered sales of its XRP tokens.The San Francisco-based company created billions of coins \u201cout of thin air\u201d and then profited by selling them to the public in \u201cwhat is essentially a never-ending initial coin offering,\u201d the class-action complaint filed Thursday in the Superior Court of California said. Ripple violated state and federal laws by offering unregistered securities to retail investors, the filing said.The plaintiff, investor Ryan Coffey, is seeking unspecified damages and a declaration that Ripple Labs and Chief Executive Officer Bradley Garlinghouse sold unregistered securities. Coffey is seeking to proceed on behalf of all purchasers of Ripple tokens.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the lawyer\u2019s tweet about a recently filed lawsuit but have not been served. Like any civil proceeding, we\u2019ll assess the merit or lack of merit to the allegations at the appropriate time,\u201d Ripple spokesman Tom Channick said in an emailed statement. \u201cWhether or not XRP is a security is for the SEC to decide. We continue to believe XRP should not be classified as a security.\u201dThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in July that companies which raise money through the sale of digital assets must adhere to federal securities laws. The SEC has also subpoenaed firms and individuals behind coin offerings it believes might be breaking the law, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier this year. An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the agency\u2019s view of XRP at the time.\u201cXRP is a security,\u201d the plaintiff said. \u201cDefendants themselves have recognized that XRP investors have a reasonable expectation of profit, and publicly touted XRP\u2019s price performance on numerous occasions.\u201dCoffey purchased 650 XRP tokens for about $2.60 each, or $1,690, at the start of January and sold them a few weeks later at a loss of approximately $551, or about 32 percent of his initial investment, according to the filing.Whether Ripple and bigger rival Ether are securities has been at the center of debate within the sector since the SEC comments. Gary Gensler, the former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, saidlast month that both XRP and Ether \u2014 the second most valuable digital coin \u2014 could be classified as securities.The lawsuit also highlighted Ripple\u2019s attempt to persuade some of the top U.S. crypto exchanges to list XRP. Bloomberg reported in April that the startup suggested paying financial incentives to the venues, Gemini and Coinbase, citing four people with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.Source", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Ledger announces XRP support on Nano S and Blue", "post_link": "https://medium.com/ledger-on-security-and-blockchain/ledger-announces-xrp-support-on-nano-s-and-blue-4101eaef0a9f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ledger", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Ledger", "publish_date": "2017-05-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-03", "readtime": "2.54", "claps": 22, "voters": 18, "content": "Ledger announces XRP support on Nano S and BlueLedgerFollowMay 19, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readCelebrating the latest major price rally on XRP, and due to high demand, we are excited to announce immediate availability of XRP support of all Nano S and Blue units.If you do not have yet a Nano S or a Blue, you can order one on our online Ledger shop or through our resellers network (please note that the Blue is out of stock until end of July 2017).XRP app installation on your Nano S or BlueTo add XRP support on your Ledger hardware wallet, you need to launch the Ledger Manager and install the XRP app on your device (as the maximum number of apps is limited by memory constrainsts, you may have to uninstall first another app). You must make sure that your Nano S has been updated to the latest 1.3.1 firmware.Ledger Wallet XRPTo manage your XRP wallet, you need to install the Ledger Wallet XRP app (compatible PC/Mac/Linux). It is a new and independant app, only dedicated to this crypto-currency.Step-by-step guideMake sure you have a Ledger Nano S or a Blue already configuredMake sure that your Nano S has the latest 1.3.1 firmware. To check, go to \u201cSettings > Firmware\u201d. Follow these steps if you need to upgrade. The Blue doesn\u2019t require any specific firmware.Launch the Ledger Wallet Manager, select the Applications tabs, find the XRP app and install it by clicking on the small bottom arrow. If you are having an error, it\u2019s most probably because your Nano S is full, you must then remove first an app.Close the Ledger Wallet Manager (it is important to habe only one Ledger app running on your computer at the same time).Go the the Ledger Wallet XRP app page and install the native app on your computer (compatible with Mac, PC or Linux).Launch the Ledger Wallet XRP app.Select the XRP app on your Nano S, press both buttons, and voil\u00e0!If it doesn\u2019t sync, make sure that \u201cBrowser support\u201d is disabled (in the settings of the XRP app on your device)Additional informationIn case of loss of your Nano S or Blue, your 24 words backup will also recover your XRP wallet in a new Nano S or Blue. You do not need to backup anything else.We will soon provide the tools to export your XRP private key (from the 24 words) if you need an emergency recovery without a Ledger device.The Ledger Wallet XRP provides with only one address / account (exactly like the current Ledger Wallet Ethereum Chrome app).The structure of the XRP protocol makes that it is not possible to send less than 20 XRP on a new account, and you must also always have a minimum of 20 XRP on your account (if you have 1,000 XRP you\u2019ll only be able to spend 980 XRP, a minimum 20 XRP will be locked to your account forever).With the addition of XRP, Ledger\u2019s hardware wallets are now supporting 10 crypto-currencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Dash, Stratis and Komodo. All ERC20 tokens (REP, GNO\u2026) are also supported as well through the myetherwallet.com integration.You can monitor the future implementations in our roadmap.

Often, though, the SWIFT infrastructure is slow and can involve transfers between several intermediate banks (each taking a transaction fee). The recent hacks of the SWIFT network [$81 million hack], too, has also shown that it is struggling to cope with securing the scope of its infrastructure.So could the SWIFT network now have a serious competitor in Ripple? With SWIFT taking hours (or even days) to clear a transaction, Ripple clears within five seconds and can handle an equivalent throughput of the Visa network.Causing a rippleRipple, created in 2012 by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb, has increased its value to around $12 billion.But is it different from Bitcoin \u2014 which is a cryptocurrency \u2014 as Ripple (XRP) can also be traded as tokens. These tokens are pre-mined, so there is no need for a mining network. With an XRP token, the value is directly mapped to traditional currencies. Overall it can act as both a cryptocurrency and also as a payment network for transactions.Currently, it has the third highest market capitalisation of the cryptocurrencies:Currently, banks solve the problem of transferring money between countries with the SWIFT network, and which is often slow in its operation. Ripple, though, uses a publicly sourced consensus ledger with a distributed infrastructure of trusted gateways. This infrastructure is managed by Ripple Labs. Ripple then aims to complete a currency transaction in seconds, using tokens for transaction fees. These tokens can then be converted back into currency through a cryptocurrency exchange.So while Ethereum and Bitcoin struggle to scale, and are hitting bottlenecks with the number of transactions that they can support per second. Bitcoin, especially is slow and can take over 10 minutes to create a consensus, and also require a great deal of energy to create it. Ripple\u2019s fast consensus \u2014 in less than a minute \u2014 can thus be used to quickly transfer funds and compete against Paypal and Visa:How it worksLet\u2019s look at a simple example. Say Bob wants to send $100 to Alice and who is in a different city. He gives the money to his local agent (Trent) with a password that Alice is required to provide [A]. Trent then contacts Alice\u2019s agent (Peggy) and gives Peggy the money with the password [B]. If Alice then gives Peggy the right password [C], Peggy will then provide Alice with $100 from her account [D]. Now Trent will create an IOU for Peggy for $100, which can be paid at a given time, or used within other transactions.The trust network created is between Bob and Trent, Trent and Peggy, and Peggy and Alice. These trust elements are created as a Gateway for the chain. Anyone can then register to act as a gateway and thus act as the middleman for the exchanges.Each currency uses its own gateway such as CADBluzelle (Canadian dollars \u2014 CAD), BTCbitstamp (BTC), and USDsnapswap (US $), and multiple gateways can be involved in order to translate the required currencies. This interconnection of gateways creates a \u201cripple\u201d effect for the transaction.Balances are thus held at the gateway, and where there could be the risk of a gateway not honouring payments. Users will thus only communicate with gateways which they trust, and which are credit-worthy. In this way, the user will not be exposed to the risk of a transaction hack, as the trustworthy gateway will, hopefully, honour the transaction.The Ripple network thus does not need a proof-of-work system such as Bitcoin, and the transactions can be cleared within a few seconds. The consensus is then created by validating account balances and transactions by the gateways within the system. This improves on the double-spending method that Bitcoin uses.So if Eve creates a transaction of $100 and sends them to multiple gateways, all the gateways will then vote on the transaction, and all, but the first, transaction will be deleted (and where the voting system takes five seconds to achieve a majority vote). As there is no central control, the verification of the transaction is distributed.Each transaction is recorded as an IOU on the public blockchain for the currency used for a user or gateway. These transactions are not linked to an ID, and are pseudo-anonymised (but with complex analysis could be traced to individuals). Unlike the Bitcoin network, the Ripple network scales well and can handle millions of transactions at a time, and where each transaction carries a fee of 0.00001 XRP (which is significantly smaller than the SWIFT network).AdoptionMany banks including UBS, RBS, Merrill Lynch, Santander, BBVA, UniCredit, and Standard Chartered have adopted the Ripple Network and are actively using it to transfer transaction fees. With its growth in popularity, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US \u2014 Coinbase \u2014 is likely to add it to its currency portfolio of bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), and litecoin (\u0141TC) trading. This will make it easier for users to purchase them. The exchanges where XRP is currently traded are:CEX.IO \u2014 This is a UK-based exchange.GMOCoin \u2014 This is a Japan-based exchange.Huobi.pro \u2014 This is a Singapore-based exchange.The limit applied for ripple is $100 billion. With every payment a small amount of ripple is intentionally lost, and which reduces the total supply over time. This act as an inflationary control and reduces its supply over time. In order to address worries about the supply of XRP, Ripple Labs have placed 55 billion XRP in escrow. This includes 55 contracts of one billion XRP tokens and which will release one billion XRP tokens into the market each month. This provides for a well-defined release of the tokens.The Ripple network can handle up to 1,000 transactions per second, which is the throughput that Visa handles. Presently, Ethereum can only cope with 15 transactions per second, and where Bitcoin only supports up to six transactions per second.Risks?As with many cryptocurrencies, there are associated risks. In 2015, Peter Todd analysed Ripple and found a number of potential attacks, and rated them in terms of cost, scope, duration, and probability:Consensus Split. This uses different versions of the protocol to confuse the network, and where it is unable to create a consensus.Transaction Flood. This is where a large number of transactions are generated, and the network is unable to process the valid ones within a given time constraint.Coercion of Validators. This is an attack on specific nodes, in order for them to fail to process their transactions.Software Backdoor. This is where a trusted user adds a backdoor in the software distribution.Theft of Validator Secret Keys. This is where the secret keys for the infrastructure are leaked.Simulated Ledger. This is where nodes can simulate the required signature and create a fake ledger.The major finding was that the end result of applying Ripple would not be that much different from the current centralised approach, and that if more than 20% of Ripple\u2019s network nodes did not agree, there would be a fork in the ledger. At the present time XRP doesn\u2019t actually have to be used, and can be seen as a \u201csettlement currency\u201d, but most of the coins are currently controlled by Ripple.ConclusionXRP focuses on translating currencies and overcomes the complexity of the SWIFT network. The creation of the trust network, and in the connection to trusted gateways, increases the overall trust in the network, as the trusted gateway are likely to honour transactions which are incorrectly handled.And for Ripple, with a clearing time of five seconds, we can see that traditional methods of translating currencies will have some serious competition on their hands. Its method of consensus also does not consume the electricity demand of a medium-sized country, and has a track record of five years of successful operation.The whole network, too, is not dependent on any one company enacting or securing the transaction, and thus bottlenecks are kept to a minimum. Overall the future of XRP is whether it will be accepted as a settlement current.So not all cryptocurrencies are the same! Bitcoin seems to get all the attention, but it has so many problems, especially that it will be difficult to sustain its current operation.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ripple Weekly Price Analysis", "post_link": "https://blog.zebpay.com/bitcoin-ethereum-bitcoin-cash-litecoin-ripple-weekly-price-analysis-44d24f129fa1?source=search_post", "author_name": "Zebpay", "author_link": "https://blog.zebpay.com/@zebpay", "publish_date": "2018-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-24", "readtime": "1.94", "claps": 38, "voters": 14, "content": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ripple Weekly Price AnalysisBy \u2014 Nirmal RangaZebpayFollowMar 29, 2018 \u00b7 2 min read\u201cThe market does not know if you are long or short and could not care less.

At this major support, Bitcoin can have a pull-back upto $8,700- $9,100 if it holds above $7,600 but Bears are holding more strength right now.Any breach of the above support which is likely will make BTC test the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement support level of $7,175 of the rally from $5,920-$11,780.

We did this for a few reasons:With some projects over the summer we saw people complain that they were not able to give larger amounts of ETC, XRP or LTC because ShapeShift has limits due to liquidity and slippage. While we do have a technological partnership with ShapeShift, we wanted to enable larger donors to participate easily.The WINGS Foundation wanted to have some financial stability, and given that some of these crypto-currencies go up when bitcoin goes down, we thought they would provide a higher level of stability to treasury management rather than hoping that one coin just continues to appreciate steadily over time.It goes without saying that BTC is the king of crypto, and with our planned support for RSK, a smart contracts system for Bitcoin, it is a natural preference.We intend to support Ethereum and Ethereum Classic as they have smart contracts systems and many projects wanting to use those networks.Ripple we chose because of their work on the InterLedger Protocol and long term price stability. WINGS intends to have cross-blockchain support for project DAOs to get funded in all sorts of crypto-currencies. We recognized the good work Ripple has done on this front and wanted to ensure that WINGS Foundation has stake in this system should we receive the funding to enable cross-blockchain supportWhy did we pick Litecoin? Good question. Primarily, because it has maintained a relatively stable value over the years, and because being WINGS we like chickens (read about why Litecoin is called chicken).Litecoin gets the smallest allocation but has the most flavor.Reaching allocation parityCurrently the backing campaign is in a status where many people have asked why their WINGS estimate is much higher for a lower BTC value of ETC, ETH, LTC and XRP. The answer is simple: the amounts for these four alt-coins collected are underweight to their respective allocation.The 75 Million WINGS allocated to donations that the WINGS Foundation is contractually obliged to put forward to the community have sub-allocations for each alt coin:BTC is 70%ETH is 15%ETC is 6%XRP is 5%LTC is 4%Chart showing the disparityThe bold red numbers show the amount of a particular alt-coin required to reach parity with the total amount of BTC donated. Thus, currently one can see a significant under-funding in ETC, XRP and LTC donations, thereby resulting in higher than anticipated estimated WINGS for the alt-coins.Making this easy to digestThe team is investigating ways to complement the WINGS backing campaign dashboard GUI in order to make it easier to determine how much each coin is out of parity.We also are open to offering an EGGS bounty for a community member who can build an easy visual tool that would show this.

Today we are going to continue talking about the advantages of our network in comparison with other current blockchain systems. Some of you mentioned Ripple in discussions, so we decided to analyze our similarities and differences with XRP!First of all, it\u2019s hard to compare #MetaHash with Ripple due to a number of reasons. Most importantly, their objectives are different \u2014 while #MetaHash aims to create a network for the people and implement full decentralization, XRP is built for enterprise use and offers banks/payment providers an on-demand option to source liquidity for cross-border payments.#MetaHash overperforms Ripple in several significant aspects. XRP is one of the top projects with a very high TPS rate \u2014 1500. This result is considered as very good and much better than Ethereum or Bitcoin, at the same time, #MetaHash transactions per second rate is more than 60,000. Ripple is phenomenally fast in handling payment \u2014 it can do it in 4 seconds, however, #MetaHash needs less than 3 seconds for transaction approval.We have already mentioned decentralization, nonetheless, the fundamental difference between 2 projects is hidden here. Ripple is a central digital currency controlled by one company, it is fully centralized, while #MetaHash offers the highest level of decentralization on the crypto market. Ripple is not even attacked or criticized by banks and the global financial system because they do not see a competitor in XRP. Ripple Investors are betting on the tendency of banks/financial institutions to buy huge amounts of XRP in order to improve their services, not to sell them and provide them to their customers.Ripple also can\u2019t be mined and it is probably the only similarity of XRP with #MetaHashCoin but the reasons are different. Ripple can only be bought on trading platforms, there is no other way to get these coins. At the same time, #MetaHash can be bought and also forged, which is much better than mining for plenty of reasons that we have already addressed in a number of articles.It is hard to compare #MetaHash with Ripple due to the vast difference in goals and objectives. XRP is not even a proper cryptocurrency, unlike #MetaHashCoin, Ethereum or Bitcoin. Ripple is set to benefit banks and financial corporations, while #MetaHash is aiming to benefit ordinary people and solve current issues in the blockchain tech.Our website#MetaGateTelegram Twitter", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "ICO", "Cryptocurrency", "Token Sale"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@TeriJo/every-thought-idea-action-or-inaction-makes-a-ripple-in-the-pond-amber-lisa-john-8dcfdfafe253?source=search_post", "author_name": "Terijo", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@TeriJo", "publish_date": "2017-07-27", "last_modified_date": "2017-08-18", "readtime": "2.29", "claps": 64, "voters": 14, "content": "TerijoFollowJul 27, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readPexabayEvery thought, idea, action or inaction makes a ripple in the pond.

Success reveres action. Success worships execution. Success BEGETS success. The world recognizes, respects and rewards successful people by triggering a ripple effect of opportunities. The bigger the success\u2026the bigger and faster come the opportunities. If there\u2019s one thing you can do to dramatically impact the trajectory of your life, it\u2019s to make something big happen\u2026 achieve an impossible goal\u2026to take on a beast of a challenge and crush it.Allow me to unpack this idea by helping you to understand the power of a transformative goal.Side effects. Delayed effects. After effects.A side effect is usually regarded as an undesirable, uncomfortable secondary effect which occurs when taking a drug or stimulus. A delayed effect is an unexpected, unwelcome reaction occurring hours to days after exposure to a drug or stimulus. An after effect is an unforeseen, unamusing physical, psychological, or emotional effect that continues after the removal of a drug or stimulus. But what about the other kinds of side effects, delayed effects and after effects? What about the positive side effects of success? The desirable, comfortable secondary effects which occur when crushing a goal, winning a contest or achieving a desired outcome. What about the delayed effects of gratification, self-discipline and other acts of self-control? The expected, highly welcomed outcomes which arrive hours, days, weeks, months or even years after their enforcement. What about the after effects of securing a big win, of overcoming a seemingly impossible obstacle through the deployment of persistence, character and an unbreakable will? The foreseen, highly enjoyable physical, psychological, or emotional effects that continue long after the win was secured and which inspire you to take on even bigger challenges. While you may be tempted to chalk up any newfound opportunities as lucky breaks or as the unintended consequences of being successful\u2026the truth is they should be viewed as the intended consequences of success\u2026the domino effect of winning big, the chain reaction or ongoing ripple effect of one big success leading to a self-perpetuating cycle of good luck. Things leads to things and big successful wins leads to a number of intrinsic and extrinsic benefits. For our purposes, we\u2019ll focus on the intrinsic benefits as there is no purer form of success, no more exact and demanding test of what you are capable of, than to take on and achieve a seemingly impossible goal or challenge and find joy in the capacity to meet it. Why? Because, the ultimate reason for stepping up your game and achieving a moon shot is to entice and empower you to become the person it takes to achieve such a transformative goal. As you are about to find out\u2026who you become, as well as the character traits, skill sets and newfound opportunities you create in rising to meet a big challenging goal are the real benefits. They are the things which inspire and allow you to play at the top of your game, and they are profoundly more important than the nature of the goal itself.In effect, the side effects, delayed effects and after effects of achieving a big challenging goal rightfully become the main effects.The main effects of the ripple effectWhat follows are the ripple effects, the top nine rewards and primary intrinsic benefits for achieving a big challenging goal. Each of these benefits sends a powerful psychological message which work to transform your mind and future in a meaningful way. 1. You Develop an Indomitable Spirit In your efforts to achieve your goals, you will always struggle with unexpected, unwanted, and uncontrollable aspects of your environment, but your ability to overcome these seemingly indomitable obstacles reward you with an indomitable spirit as well as recognition, respect, resolve and results. 2. You Overcome Fear Fear is only an excuse for those unwilling to face their doubts, insecurities, and mental boogie man. Your capacity to confront and overcome any fear or resistance force rewards you with confidence, conviction and a powerful sense of destiny. 3. You Become Courageous According to Aristotle\u2026 \u201dThe ultimate aim of human life and activity is the development of character.\u201dThe most important goal you could hope to accomplish in the course of your life is to become an excellent person in every respect\u2026one who has the courage to pursue their dreams. Becoming courageous is one of those priceless rewards\u2026a gift you give to yourself, and a gift that keeps on giving. 4. You Find Out What You Are Made Of When you take on a big challenging goal and shoot for the moon, you will never be the same again. You either cope or crumble. You become better or bitter. You emerge stronger or weaker. It must be this way, as a big challenging goal exists to tests your limits, to push you beyond the breaking point, to separate you from the crowded field of mediocrity. Your reward is finding out how far you can go and learning what you are really made of. 5. You Intensify Your Focus A great challenge demands great focus, and by staying the course you give your life the moment it deserves. Focus is best seen as a preemptive strike against mediocrity. The moment you focus on a challenging goal, your goal becomes a magnet that pulls you and your resources toward it. The more focused your energies, the more power you generate, the faster will be your rewards. 6. You Build Extraordinary Self-Confidence No mountains can be climbed, no hearts won, no opportunities seized, no books written, and no victories enjoyed without self-confidence. The inspired ability to rise to meet the physical rigors and mental demands of a big challenging goal is directly attributable to your self-confidence. As your challenges build, as you find the strength to face your fears and overcome obstacles\u2026you are rewarded with ever increasing levels of self-confidence. 7. You Become Fully Formed Few things demonstrate that you are ready to become the great man or woman that you are meant to be\u2026than the ability to set and achieve a big challenging goal. By doing so you are demonstrating all the behaviors of a mature, responsible adult\u2026focus, discipline, commitment, perseverance, integrity and follow through. These are powerful intrinsic benefits that will pay off handsomely throughout the remainder of your life.  8. You Become Your Own Hero Your greatest asset and primary sense of security and freedom extends from your ability to produce results and that\u2019s what self-reliance is all about. By taking control and responsibility for your own life and delivering on what you set out to do\u2026you are rewarded with a powerful set of execution skills and a mindset that says you can, will and must provide for yourself. 9. You Expand Your Freedoms Freedom isn\u2019t free. It requires blood, sweat, and tears. But freedom is the ultimate prize\u2026the highest reward for rising to meet the rigorous demands of a big challenging goal. In virtually every case, the decision to rise to meet a big challenging goal boils down to the desire for greater freedom in one\u2019s life. This includes freedom\u2026from the monkey on your back\u2026from self-imposed limitations\u2026from the comfort zone\u2026and freedom from fear. It also includes freedom\u2026to focus on projects you find important\u2026to succeed or fail on your own terms\u2026to follow your passions\u2026as well as the freedom to say no without feeling guilty. To trigger a massive ripple effect\u2026and to enjoy these freedoms, rewards and benefits requires that you rise to the challenges life presents and pay the required price in full, in advance, and without complaint.Achieving a big, challenging goal and triggering a massive ripple effect succeeds in dividing your life neatly into two parts\u2026before the big goal and after.I promise you that after is better \u2014 much better as nothing succeeds quite like success.What to do now?Focus on your moonshot\u2026that big game changing goal and consider all the intended consequences, the positive repercussions\u2026the side effects, delayed effects and the after effects which will take effect in your life as they will most definitely provide you with the extra fuel you need to take on this beast of a goal and crush it.Gary Ryan Blair is creator of the 100 Day Challenge\u2026a radical approach to goal achievement that shows people how to accelerate their results, achieve 10X size goals and transform every area of their life and career \u2014 FAST.Thanks for reading The Marketing & Growth Hacking PublicationJoin our Facebook Group.

The Bitcoin price index was $8,214.00.Jay Kang: Alright, ready?Aaron Lammer: Mm-hmm (affirmative).Jay Kang: Coin Talk. Aaron, we\u2019re back in the Crypto Cave.Aaron Lammer: Hey, I like your throw, there.Jay Kang: Thank you. Thank you. I\u2019ve been working on it. I didn\u2019t know whether to go for like, the gravely serious NPR, you know, like, welcome to Coin Talk, or to just yell, but, I think yelling is better.Aaron Lammer: I like you in more of like a Mike Francesa mode, just kinda like gravely, like, one and a half speed, just rocking.Jay Kang: Oh, okay, so, like, you know, with the [inaudible 00:02:24] not doing too good this day.Aaron Lammer: Ripple\u2019s in the goddamn toilet.Jay Kang: That\u2019s Joe Pesci. That is not Mike Francesa. I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve \u2026 Mike Fracesa is much more slower and full with a bunch of like, uhhhh. He does a lot of that. Every time he\u2019s searching for something, he goes, uhhhh. Yeah, let me check to see Bitcoin, uh, looks 8600, not bad, uhhh Ripple at $1.14. Anyway.Aaron Lammer: I feel like we never talk about the price of Bitcoin on the show anymore.Jay Kang: I know. It\u2019s actually kinda nice. Aaron?Aaron Lammer: Yes?Jay Kang: We have been talking a lot recently about Bitcoin projects that are utopian in scope.Aaron Lammer: Are there any other kind?Jay Kang: Yeah, so, we have \u2026 Oh, yeah. There are ones that are like, here\u2019s a utility token to pay your dental bills, right?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: But, I think that since we\u2019re not talking so much about the price, we\u2019ve been talking a lot more about the more fun parts about crypto.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I agree with that.Jay Kang: Last episode, we talked about \u2026 what was it called? Jaxx Land, or something like that?Aaron Lammer: Decentral unity.Jay Kang: Decentral unity, which is a Jaxx-based utopia that is trying to solve the-Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s not really like utopia. It\u2019s more of like \u2026 what are those lines of products that people sell at parties at people\u2019s houses?Jay Kang: Avon?Aaron Lammer: Avon. It\u2019s like, Jaxx this, Jaxx that, Jaxx prepaid card, Jaxx academy-Jay Kang: Jaxx everyhing.Aaron Lammer: Jaxx Magic, The Gathering.Jay Kang: But, somehow, Jaxx will solve the issue.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Somehow, through this line of products that it\u2019s gonna solve the warring tribal factionalism.Jay Kang: So, a couple of days ago, our friend, Neraj, sent a message to us in the group chat that we\u2019re in and it was of a Yurt in what looked like, almost like the Mars landscape or something like that. It was a very desert landscape and we couldn\u2019t tell what it was about, but it was a Twitter account called Bitcointopia and they said the first Bitcointopia domicile is up. Did you see this?Aaron Lammer: I glanced at it. I admit, I did not go much deeper into it.Jay Kang: Okay, so, I looked a little bit into what Bitcointopia is, and I have no idea if this is real or not, but it seems somewhat real \u2026Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: \u2026 in that, like, it might be 3% real.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, that\u2019s a lot.Jay Kang: Yeah, it is really a lot. So, what it is is that, it is hundreds of thousands of acres, 500,000 acres, to be exact, in the middle of nowhere in Nevada, where like, I think probably the government actually owns the land.Aaron Lammer: Literally before you even said that, I was like, he\u2019s gonna either say Florida or Nevada.Jay Kang: It\u2019s a swamp in Florida.Aaron Lammer: I got a great deal on 500,000 acres of prime Everglades swamp land.Jay Kang: So, this thing, as far as I can tell, is a \u2026 He is trying to build a society based on Bitcoin that is a utopia.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Hence the term, Bitcointopia.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Now, I don\u2019t know how familiar you are with like, biosphere type products or OTECs \u2026 Do you know what an OTEC is?Aaron Lammer: I mean, I\u2019m familiar with the Pauly Shore vehicle.Jay Kang: Okay, so, like, an OTEC is like, an old idea from the 80s, which is that \u2026 I think it\u2019s earlier than that, is that mankind will one day destroy the Earth and they\u2019ll have to live on these floating pods-Aaron Lammer: Oh, okay.Jay Kang: That somehow can like, propagate one another, like two OTECs can make another OTEC and everybody eats spirulina. So, it seems kind of like that. It also had a sort of wild wall country vibe, where people are trying to build an actual society.Aaron Lammer: This is kind of in the same cinematic universe as our specs greps of people traveling through post apocalyptic Europe to get to Zappo-Jay Kang: Yeah, to build the cointopia.Aaron Lammer: To get to \u2026 to turn the Bitcoin faucet back on and bloom the desert with sweet Bitcoin.Jay Kang: Yeah, I have actually been thinking about that movie for a while, and I was like \u2026 because we have one big problem, which is, there is no reason in a post apocalyptic world why you would need Bitcoin, unless Bitcoin created like, the actual logic that you can build any type of utopia in society.Aaron Lammer: People become savages, warring factional tribes, without the decentral currency to unite them all.Jay Kang: Oh.Aaron Lammer: So, a savior has to come and get the Bitcoin going again so people can organize themselves rationally and not fall into, I mean, you know the kind of thing we\u2019re falling into right now.Jay Kang: So, it would be like Mad Max, basically-Aaron Lammer: Yes, yes.Jay Kang: In that one tribe has decided that the only way to unite the tribes is to get the beautiful logic of Bitcoin, which is all buried in the Zappo.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, it\u2019s kinda like the \u2026 Isn\u2019t Warriors kinda like that? Like, they\u2019re gonna unite all the gangs at the beginning?Jay Kang: I\u2019ve never seen that movie.Aaron Lammer: Really?Jay Kang: Yeah, never.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s a great movie.Jay Kang: Every time someone makes like a warriors [crosstalk 00:06:55]Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m shocked that you haven\u2019t seen it because Viceland, no shade on Viceland [inaudible 00:06:59] both you and my wife, but you may notice they don\u2019t have that many shows, so they play the movie, The Warriors, I would say 17 times a week.Jay Kang: It\u2019s like Wings when we were children, remember?Aaron Lammer: Wings.Jay Kang: Wings would always be on.Aaron Lammer: For me, that was because I didn\u2019t have cable when I was a kid.Jay Kang: Yeah, me neither.Aaron Lammer: I only had UHF. They\u2019d play The Streets of San Francisco all the time. It\u2019s [crosstalk 00:07:25] It\u2019s like Michael Douglas.Jay Kang: Alright, so-Aaron Lammer: Basically, all my ideas about crime are like, something that like a pimp did in a Streets of San Francisco episode in 1872.Jay Kang: So, can I read to you what they say Bitcointopia is?Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: Bitcointopia is an experiment in technology. They misspelled experiment, E-X-P-I-R-A-M-E-N-T. So, we\u2019re on good footing here.Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: Government and city development. To build an entire new kind of city in the natural and rural environment into an advanced technology hub built on AI automation, Bitcoin, and machines is a large task to accomplish.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Yeah. That\u2019s not easy. Bitcointopia is leading the way by example on how humanity can build itself into the future by remembering yesterday and building tomorrow. Little vague.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: The first thing you have to do is buy land with Bitcoin, pay for your home, or build it yourself, and bring your business to the city full of Bitcoin users and blockchain citizens.Aaron Lammer: Kind of reminds me of Wild, Wild Country.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s what I mean. I mean, the footage is like a Yurt, you know, like in the middle of like a barren landscape before all the people in Wild, Wild Country built like an intricate, like an irrigation system.Aaron Lammer: I know. I feel like this utopia is probably built on the former site of a fireworks stand or something.Jay Kang: Alright, Aaron, you are a Bitcoin maximalist now, yes?Aaron Lammer: Yes.Jay Kang: As you have said many times on this show. Does this appeal to you at all? Because this is the end for you.Aaron Lammer: I mean, this unites several things that I like, waste time on the internet with, Bitcoin, pre-fab desert housing and like, earth ships and that kinda thing I\u2019m into. You remember that place, Arcosanti?Jay Kang: No. What is that?Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s like, in Arizona. It\u2019s like an experimental architecture commune religious kind of place. My friend Jessie went there for a while. I\u2019ll say this, yes, Bitcointopia appeals to me. I find the desert setting more appealing than the sea steading.Jay Kang: Yeah, I agree.Aaron Lammer: There\u2019s something about the sea steading where I\u2019m like, man, I gotta like, live with all these dudes who only wanna talk about Bitcoin, and there\u2019s like, no way to leave?Jay Kang: Exactly.Aaron Lammer: This sounds like a horror comedy.Jay Kang: Yeah, no, no, that\u2019s terrible. At least in the desert, you can go walk off in one direction and die.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s like, would you like to live on a cruise ship with a bunch of people who are into overthrowing the government?Jay Kang: Alright, so, you\u2019re a mild yes on this then?Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m a tentative yes. I\u2019d like to visit. I\u2019d like to have a vacation home there.Jay Kang: Alright, so here\u2019s some \u2026 They get a little bit deeper, right?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: So, they tell you about what this is gonna look like. Concrete grid sidewalks and roads. The city will get its shape from the concrete grids, the sidewalks, and the roads.Aaron Lammer: Obviously.Jay Kang: These lines in the sand will define the shape, skeleton, and the foundation of what Bitcointopia looks like. The first concrete foundations for homes and sidewalks-Aaron Lammer: This sounds a little too detailed.Jay Kang: Will bring Bitcointopia up from the sand. He\u2019s like, we\u2019re gonna lay some concrete.Aaron Lammer: The houses will have foundations and roofs. If you need to start with instructions for laying out the grid, I think governance is gonna be a problem. I think there\u2019s gonna be a lot of chefs in the kitchen. I\u2019d like to see more of a like, Last Man On Earth, the sitcom scenario, where these people move into an existing community.Aaron Lammer: I also don\u2019t feel like, in my opinion, this could be contentious, but I don\u2019t feel like the Bitcoin maximalist community and aesthetics, architecture, and like, enjoyable living really mix, you know? I\u2019m not sure we should be trying to lay out a place you have to live based on Bitcoin principles.Jay Kang: So, you\u2019re out now?Aaron Lammer: No, I\u2019m in. I\u2019m trying to-Jay Kang: You\u2019re out because they have concrete sidewalks?Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m trying to like, push their vision in a slightly more practical manner. Also, [crosstalk 00:11:38] do we really have to make this in Nevada desert? It\u2019s a place of death. Nothing lives there.Jay Kang: They have 500,000 acres. Where else are they gonna get 500,000 acres?Aaron Lammer: Shouldn\u2019t this be in like, Aspen or something like that?Jay Kang: Alright, so then, they have a houses section and basically, like, what you\u2019re talking about, where you go on and you can click on a different type of house that you wanna build on there and there\u2019s every type of style you want. So, you can get like a Cape Cod style, you can get a modern house, mid century modern, whatever you want, and you can put it on your plot of land.Aaron Lammer: Got it.Jay Kang: Alright, so, we have the grid and we have the houses, right?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: City center and government. Now, this is the most important part and I swear to God, this is the only thing that they have listed there. The city center will define and embody the spirit of Bitcointopia. It\u2019s design will embrace classical masonry, modern glass aesthetics, and a touch of the wild west history.Aaron Lammer: It seems like they\u2019re going to too many things at once.Jay Kang: What does this look like?Aaron Lammer: Why not just go, all wild west with a-Jay Kang: What does this look like? Classical masonry, modern glass aesthetics and a touch of the wild west? The government will be designed to function on AI automation and Bitcoin blockchain.Aaron Lammer: AI government?Jay Kang: AI automated and Bitcoin.Aaron Lammer: How could it possibly go wrong?Jay Kang: That\u2019s it. So, Bitcointopia government is all AI.Aaron Lammer: I will say that I can understand why the government of Bitcointopia might have to run on AI, because being on the city council of a Bitcoin maximalist town sounds like a form of like, exquisite torture.Jay Kang: yeah, so, basically, this is actually embracing one of the ideals, I think, of the Austrian School of Economics and Bitcoin maximalism, which is that \u2026 this is actually something that Raj Rivera also ranted about, remember? When he was talking about how there shouldn\u2019t be votes and democracy is bad. It\u2019s the idea that there is no form of government that is correct, so why not just make it AI?Aaron Lammer: I feel like moving to Bitcointopia is like a weird, intermediary step towards living on the moon.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Like, and, if there\u2019s one thing that I think would like, unite cryptocurrency fans, it would be like a plan to all go live on the moon together.Jay Kang: It\u2019s gonna be a lot of dudes.Aaron Lammer: Well, it kinda reminds me of how, like, you know how people who are really into preserving themselves after death, like cryptogenics people?Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Is that how you say it?Jay Kang: Cryogenics.Aaron Lammer: Cryogenics. Jay, I think we just invented it. It\u2019s not a eugenics thing. You know how people are into that. It\u2019s like, even before the technology exists, they\u2019re like, well, freeze my body. Maybe it\u2019ll just like, be backwards compatible when it happens. I think some of these things like Bitcointopia or like booking tickets to the moon with Bitcoin, which is definitely coming, are these weird reverse lease mortgages on the future, and I think it\u2019s an interesting divide in cryptocurrency between people who are like, I wanna be able to buy like a cup of coffee now with my Bitcoin.Jay Kang: No one says that.Aaron Lammer: No one says that, but that\u2019s always like, a fake reason why Bitcoin won\u2019t work.Jay Kang: Yah.Aaron Lammer: And then, the other side of that coin is like, here, we\u2019re taking Bitcoin deposits now for houses on the moon. We don\u2019t know how to build them. We don\u2019t know that we ever will be able to build them. You\u2019re probably gonna see no value in this other than it will allow you to engage in the most immersive fantasy of a Bitcoin maximalist future.Jay Kang: Okay, so, let\u2019s say that Bitcointopia has a a thousand of the most intense Bitcoin maximalists, right?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: What is the murder rate in Bitcointopia?Aaron Lammer: Well, I would assume there\u2019s gonna be a lot of guns in Bitcointopia.Jay Kang: Oh, yeah.Aaron Lammer: So, I would expect there\u2019s gonna be a lot of murder.Jay Kang: I feel like it\u2019s almost like a Battle Royale situation.Aaron Lammer: I also think that if it happened, what brought it down wouldn\u2019t be the Bitcoin, but the Bitcoiners.Jay Kang: Oh, yeah.Aaron Lammer: I think the Bitcoin element might work and maybe the economy might hum. I could kinda see like \u2026 you know how sometimes isolated communes get really good at producing one thing and become viable businesses?Jay Kang: Yeah, like the Rajneeshees.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, the Rajneeshees. There\u2019s like one that makes hammocks, I think.Jay Kang: Sure. Yeah.Aaron Lammer: So, I could see that all working out, but what I expect will ultimately bring down Bitcointopia will be the polygamy or the rocket launchers or some other form of anarchism.Jay Kang: The polygamy or the rocket launchers?Aaron Lammer: It will be people pushing against the idea of rulesJay Kang: Oh, yeah, there will be no rules.Aaron Lammer: That do something. I do think people should have the humble audacity to question money, but once you have questioned and conquered money, if you don\u2019t stop, the government will still stop you from doing something at Cointopia.Jay Kang: Not here, because the fucking government is AI.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, but, it\u2019s still in America. I\u2019m kinda surprised they wanna put Bitcointopia in America in the first place.Jay Kang: I am also surprised about that. You would think that they would do it in some country that has no governance or will not actually try to govern them.Aaron Lammer: The whole time I was reading Nick Bilton\u2019s book about the Silk Road, and I\u2019ve literally asked Nick Bilton about this one \u2026 he was on a Longform Podcast. I was like, if Ross Ulbricht had run the Silk Road from some Caribbean nation with a very, very bad extradition record, he might not be in jail at this point. The dumb, dumb part of this was doing this from a library in San Francisco.Jay Kang: Yeah, like at Glen Park.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Because all the things that had to conspire to catch him, he had to be caught with his laptop open by American agent. It would been a big ask if he had been living in St. Kitts. yeah. I mean, maybe it still happens, but putting Bitcointopia in America, you are eventually gonna run into conflict with the laws of America. If it\u2019s not the Bitcoin, it\u2019s the rocket launcher.Jay Kang: I feel like you have extrapolated this far out. I feel like they have like a Heaven\u2019s Gate, Jim Jones situation way before the government gets involved in this. I would say the murder rate-Aaron Lammer: Jim Jones was a government situation.Jay Kang: I would say that the-Aaron Lammer: They killed a congressman.Jay Kang: That is true. I\u2019m more saying that I think that the murder rate in Bitcointopia is somewhere close to 100%.Aaron Lammer: I got one more for you before we go to these Ripple interviews. I feel that we\u2019ve been doing a lot of kind of lighthearted, apocalyptic stuff on the show. I think this is what happens when we have sideways corn. There\u2019s no gambling action to get on, so it just gets weird. But, have you followed Jose Canseco\u2019s-Jay Kang: How could I not? Yes, yes.Aaron Lammer: Forays into cryptocurrencies?Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: So, Jose Canseco \u2026 I will give Jose Canseco the credit of saying, when he tweeted this, I didn\u2019t know if it was real. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s real-Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s real.Aaron Lammer: But, it\u2019s as real as many things that are regarded as real. So, he tweeted, Cansecoin is launched. If you are a good ICO lawyer, please get a hold of me. If that\u2019s a joke, that\u2019s a pretty funny roast on ICOs.Jay Kang: I actually think it was a joke.Aaron Lammer: Because, that is basically how most ICOs conduct themselves.Jay Kang: Yeah. I will say this, that I think it was a troll, and it was kind of a genius troll because everyone shared this thing, you know?Aaron Lammer: Okay, so he says, only Jose Canseco can issue cryptohugs, Cansecoins, and deliver e-hugs. One Cansecoin always equals one cryptohug. So, it\u2019s basically like a stable coin for hugs.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: There are a limited number of cryptohugs available and may run out at any time. Does a man showing a fake cryptocurrency about electronic hugs strike you as a lonely person?Jay Kang: No, I think you and I could\u2019ve easily made this exact same joke. So, if it is, it means that you and I are \u2026 We actually would\u2019ve made a worse version of this joke. So, Jose Canseco, I don\u2019t know. I mean, maybe, if that means you and I are lonely, then yes.Aaron Lammer: Okay, so, I wanted to go back, because I remembered that he had been tweeting about Bitcoin before. I kinda wanted to trace the evolution of Jose Canseco\u2019s views on crypto through his Twitter over time, which meant that I had to read back through his entire Twitter history.Jay Kang: There are much worse Twitter accounts.Aaron Lammer: So, starting with the Bitcoin, he says, look at the simplest slot machine in Vegas. That is what Bitcoin is structured on. Bitcoin is mathematically structured so a lot of people lose money and a small group will make a killing. Also, kind of right.Jay Kang: Yeah, I\u2019m in. Everything he said about Bitcoin I\u2019m in on.Aaron Lammer: And then, okay, he went on a tear in November 2017. I think both of these prophecies have come true. In 2018, blockchain will become mainstream knowledge understood by moron level and above. Kinda happening.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: It is the end of the beginning for cryptocurrency. Bitcoin at 10,000 by New Year\u2019s Eve.Jay Kang: True.Aaron Lammer: True. Came true.Jay Kang: Almost to the day.Aaron Lammer: Almost to the day. This is what I\u2019m saying, so, I would say at this point, I\u2019m hearing all of the Canseco calls.Jay Kang: Do you remember all those people when we did the basement hit tapes who were like, analysts at Goldman Sachs and stuff, who would be like, I think Bitcoin will be at 8,000 by November of 2018 and you were like, what are you basing this on?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: They just needed to ask Jose Canseco, apparently.Aaron Lammer: Okay, so, these are the other Tweets that I found in the Jose Canseco history. Number one, TS Elliot always puts a big lump in my throat. Unexpected.Jay Kang: Why would TS Elliot do that?Aaron Lammer: Number two, play a round of golf with baseball legend Jose Canseco and football legend Jim McMahon, available Thursday, Sunday. Call Morgan at phone number for more information. So, you can just call a guy if you\u2019re in Vegas and get a round of golf with Jose Canseco and Jim McMahon.Jay Kang: I would maybe pay for that.Aaron Lammer: How much, like, what is the maximum you would pay for that?Jay Kang: Five hundred dollars.Aaron Lammer: I kinda feel like it\u2019s probably about five hundred bucks.Jay Kang: Yeah, I\u2019d do five hundred bucks.Aaron Lammer: If you\u2019re just putting a phone number straight onto Twitter, it\u2019s not more than a thousand bucks.Jay Kang: I would do five hundred bucks.Aaron Lammer: Here are a couple more from the Jose Canseco archive. I wanted to thank Dave Kaval and the athletics family for welcoming me last season, but unfortunately, my contract will not be renewed due to Tweets I posted, which I take full responsibility for.Jay Kang: That\u2019s a Tweet that I am going to have to post at some point in the future.Aaron Lammer: A, Kang asked, B, I was like, which Tweets?Jay Kang: That really is \u2026 that Tweet really strikes close to home for me. Jose Canseco\u2019s Twitter feed, I think, is good.Aaron Lammer: I really enjoyed reading through it. It seems like his crypto calls have been like, pretty dead on. He does say in his bio, media appearances, bookings 818\u2013903\u20135698. So, I say we give him a call and see if he wants to come on Coin Talk.Jay Kang: I think that\u2019s his real number, too.Aaron Lammer: I think that\u2019s at least a number of someone who can get him on the show.Jay Kang: Let\u2019s get him on Coin Talk.Aaron Lammer: And, if you can play a round of golf with him for like, five hundred, I\u2019m willing to do a paid placement. I\u2019m willing to put a little of our cold hard earned cash and a paid conversation with Jose Canseco for twelve takes.Jay Kang: I\u2019ll pay for it. Maybe we can pay him in Ripple.Aaron Lammer: Speaking of non-paid conversations, should we move on to my interview with a real live Ripple fan?Jay Kang: Yeah, I wanna hear about this because you and I talked about this, which was that, we didn\u2019t wanna just bag on Ripple fans.Aaron Lammer: No. Along with the more body angry Ripplebots, when we posted that episode about Ripple, we heard from real people who were like, I\u2019m not a bot, I really like Ripple. Fuck you guys. Or, they weren\u2019t like, fuck you guys. They were nice about it.Jay Kang: No, no, no, they were very nice about it, yeah.Aaron Lammer: They were like, we have a great community. We love this community and we\u2019d like to tell you what the Ripple community is really like and I think that\u2019s fair. We\u2019re not here to bag on anyone.Jay Kang: Also, we could be wrong.Aaron Lammer: Well, part of this, I think, is our curiosity about the Ripple community and how as one project became to be viewed so differently than other projects.Jay Kang: Or even just stripped down. Like, what does it mean to be a fan of a coin, you know?Aaron Lammer: So, here\u2019s the interview.Speaker 2: This episode of Coin Talk was taped Tuesday, May 22nd at 1 p.m. Eastern standard time.

By now, more than three dollars per coin went down to below 0.30 USD by December.However, the cryptocurrency recovered in December 2018 and many new partnerships and projects were completed. Where is the journey going in 2019? The Ripple forecast looks promising. But are actually $500 per coin possible?Ripple Status QuoBank cryptocurrency \u2014 so-called because it works with many international banks and payment service providers to build a global payment network \u2014 is often decrypted in the crypto scene. Many followers of other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Monero, Dash or Ethereum do not like the cryptocurrency around CEO Brad Garlinghouse, because it relies on the banks.Many other cryptos want to make exactly these banks superfluous and create a decentralization. CEO Brad Garlinghouse\u2019s company, on the other hand, uses its technology to provide payment services that can be used to transfer money to other countries within seconds. And that at 40 to 70 percent less cost.Trending Cryptocurrency Hub Articles:1. The Bitcoin Bubble Post Mortem2. Ethereum and Blockchain Technology3. The CryptoKitties Economy4. The Crypto gameIt has often been written that XRP developed significantly worse than all other top currencies in 2018. But that\u2019s not true. If you look at the charts, you can see that the XRP behaved exactly like the market capitalization of the entire market.That\u2019s not very good, but not bad either. So you can not say that the bank cryptocurrency performed worse than the competition. But what are the forecasts for the coming year?Currently, Ripple's price is in a range of 0.30 USD and 0.40 USD. Only when it breaks out there, it can move back towards the $1 mark. Anyway, if you go to the chart technique. In doing so, you look at the chart \u2014 the development of the price of the last months and years \u2014 and get an important brand through an analysis. Especially for Ripple trading, such a chart analysis is important.But long-term investors who are interested in the Ripple price can also benefit from it. However, the bank cryptocurrency should no longer fall below the $0.36 to $0.38 mark. That would trigger new sell signals. Important is the recapture of the hurdle at $0.43 to $0.44 and then the limit at $0.52.That was pure charting, but what do experts and ripple news say about a ripple forecast?Marko Vidrih is creating content about blockchain/crypto/tech/finance/economy/business... | PatreonMarko Vidrih was born in Slovenia and has always been fascinated by the worldwide economy and evolving technologies\u2026www.patreon.comThe forecast for the coming yearsThere are numerous pages that have predicted potential future price targets. The truth is, no one really knows. You can only approach one goal with good arguments and numbers. For example, the Price Forecasting.com page predicts a price of $0.10 for the XRP for December 2019.This means that throughout the next year the price will only slide down. Is this realistic? Eventually, such an event would go hand in hand with a near-bankruptcy of the entire cryptosystem. That seems unlikely.Investinghaven.com experts, however, expect the coin to rise to $20 within a year. That sounds better. But: what arguments can you put forward?Thus, the authors say that the XRP is gaining value because it can handle worldwide payments in the future. Each year, about $30 billion would only be spent on international money transfers and currency exchanges. The system of Ripple could save about $16.5 billion every year.In addition, the company is planning another application called Xpring. This should make more people work on the blockchain and use the coin. So also goods on the blockchain are to be developed and acted. The authors attach great importance to this and think that the Ripple, like the big platform companies Facebook, Amazon, and Google, is number one in their field.And this platform or network effect is likely to push forecasts for cryptocurrency further up. These platforms work on one principle: The winner takes it all.So the experts come to a forecast of 20USD. In support of this, they take the long-term chart. Writing this into the future, an XRP coin could actually cost $20 next year.Other reasons for a positive prognosisThe company has managed to break into the Chinese market with its partner American Express. American Express is allowed to settle in the Chinese currency Yuan and thus the XRP is expected to be used in the currency exchange. This step was very important because China is a gigantic market and is already being paid electronically today.CEO Brad Garlinghouse and his product manager Craig DeWitt were delighted with this step and their entry into the Chinese market. In China, about 10 billion credit cards are expected to be in circulation in 2020. This ensures an enormous payment and thus a positive forecast.Another reason is that there is no Ripple mining. All about 100 billion XRPs that will ever exist are already created. This narrows the supply and sooner or later causes rising prices.In addition, payments have to be paid with 0.00001 XRP fees, so the amount of circulating coins is slowly but surely falling. That does not make a huge impact for the next few years, but in the long term, these circumstances should not be ignored.Also important are the partnerships with the banks Santander and UBS, as well as the credit card provider American Express. As a result of these existing cooperations, further companies are likely to become aware of the bank cryptocurrency, which will lead to a further positive Ripple prognosis.For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation already uses the company\u2019s blockchain technology. So it should be possible for millions of people in the third world to have a bank account on the smartphone and digitally come to a loan. The companies Visa, Amazon and especially Google might also be interested in working together.Because these companies spend billions of dollars worldwide, but sometimes take up to five days to make it to the right account. With blockchain technology and XRP, this should be much faster and cheaper.Ripple 2020 can rise that highLet\u2019s take another one year and dare to make a prognosis for the future. After Ripple did not run very well in 2018 and ended the year with a minus of about 60 percent, the question arises what will happen in the coming years. There should not be another Ripple crash. But what seems realistic now?We have already seen some forecasts and also reasons for a positive outlook. In 2020, the value of XRP is likely to continue to rise significantly, as many experts see 2019 as a fateful year for most cryptocurrencies. Only those who have an application case in the real world are likely to survive in the long term.After all, many coins only exist because someone wanted to take money through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) \u2014 something like an ICO of a cryptocurrency \u2014 or because the coin should be a store of value like the Bitcoin. But it does not take 2000 stores of value. So now should be sorted out, which means that there will be only a few hundred cryptocurrencies.These should then increase in price because they have shown that you need them and their blockchain. These include the XRP, which is why the Ripple forecast looks good for 2020 as well. Although there are no concrete price targets here. But if it does well in the coming year, the XRP coin should be forecasted over $20 the following year.Should you buy now?The simple answer is yes. The best thing you can do right now is to buy Ripple. The course is already very low. That it falls much further is not very likely. But even if: Get in first with a small installment. Do not take more than 20 or 30 percent of the amount you want to invest in Ripple.Buy some coins on an exchange and put them in your Ripple wallet. When the price goes down, you buy 20\u201330% again. Sell them if the price rises sharply. Then buy again. So you benefit from any price movement and improve your position. In the long term, of course, it should go up, but for several reasons that should succeed.There is an important question: In which currency do you want to look at and buy the XRP? The Ripple in euro currently costs 0.33 euros and the Ripple in USD cost 0.37. This has simply to do with the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar. Mostly, the cryptocurrencies are displayed in dollars and bought because it is easier and more understandable worldwide.But if you buy your coins in different currencies, you always have currency risk. If the currency loses value, you will get less money, even though the price of the coin does not move at all. Mostly you can not do much here, but you should be aware of the risk.What does the final forecast look like?Basically, nobody can tell exactly where the coin is going. But it seems that there are many more positive opinions than negative ones. The coin has many applications and is used by many international companies.These partnerships are likely to become even more numerous in the future, making the XRP even more circulating. Due to the platform and network effects, the price should be forecasted higher than today. Forecasts are always difficult, but technically possible.For the coming years, there are forecasts to over $20 and even $500 are now and then proclaimed. That seems to be a bit too high, but the XRP should grow up to $100. Then it would have a similarly high market capitalization as gold. Why should not that be possible?Author: Marko Vidrih @cryptomarksMarko Vidrih is creating content about blockchain/crypto/tech/finance/economy/business... | PatreonMarko Vidrih was born in Slovenia and has always been fascinated by the worldwide economy and evolving technologies\u2026www.patreon.com@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

Its success caused a country-wide frenzy \u2014 herd behavior as all types of people, from peasants to lords, developed a feverish interest in investing: in South Seas primarily, but in stocks generally. Among the many companies to go public in 1720 is \u2014 famously \u2014 one that advertised itself as \u201ca company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\u201dWhich doesn\u2019t sound all the different from what we see with Crypto Currencies, where all sorts of people are getting involved with speculation, not always having much idea of how the underlying technology works.This is what I want to do in this article. Explain how the technology of different crypto currencies affect its value.Intrinsic ValueIt is often leveled against crypto currencies like Bitcoin that it has not intrinsic value, as opposed to say gold. Gold has industrial and medical uses. People also appreciate gold jewelry. So clearly it has some value, but whether the present value of gold is a reflection of its intrinsic value is debatable. As Warren Buffett said:Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.Still, gold is a not a fair comparison to crypto currency. Fiat currency like dollars, rubles or pounds don\u2019t have any intrinsic value either. They are not worth the paper they are printed on.So why would anybody want fiat currency, or why is there a market or demand for fiat currency?By law people have to accept payment in the national currency.The government demands that you pay your taxes in the currency they issue from their central bank.Of course if anybody could print or copy the money it would be worthless, which is why fiat currencies have artificial scarcity and can\u2019t be easily copied. This is very similar to crypto currencies.A bank note is printed in a complicated manner which makes it difficult to replicate, while a Bitcoin is secured against copy by the use of cryptography.Then central bank limits the supply of fiat currency, while the Bitcoin mining process limits the supply of Bitcoins.Intrinsic Value of BitcoinOf course Bitcoin is not a mandated currency for payment or taxes anywhere, so that is no way of securing a market for Bitcoins.On the other hand, lots of things have value without being mandated by government. A soccer card with the signature of a famous player, is just a cheap piece of paper with some ink on it. Yet many people will place a high value on it.A lot of art is the same. The value of the paint is limited and so is the utility of the painting. It does of course have a certain value with respect to pleasure people take in looking at it and having it on their wall to decorate a room.However most of the value of an art piece derives from its exclusivity. A perfect copy of a master piece, would only be worth a fraction of the value of the original despite giving the viewer the paining the exact same experience.Hence there is no objective way of assigning value. Things are worth whatever people think they are worth. So the question is why might people assign value to e.g. Bitcoin?Bitcoin UtilityOne reason is the utility of Bitcoin. There will always be a desire for anonymous or pseudo anonymous payments. Cash of course offers this, but not in a convenient manner online. People might want to purchase something only anonymously, which is not possible with a credit card. This could either be buying something they find embarrassing or it could be something illegal. E.g. the online service Silk Road was famous for selling drugs online taking payments in Bitcoins. Another dark side of Bitcoin is its usage for Ransomeware payments.As long as people want to buy drugs online or extort each other there will be a demand for Bitcoins, which means it will have some value. What value is almost impossible to define. There is however a lower limit, define by the electricity cost for computer mining new bitcoins.But of course most of the value of Bitcoin today, is derived from speculation. People buying it in the hope that its value will increase.Speculation is of course not entirely useless as it creates liquidity for those who desire to use Bitcoin for payments.But why does Bitcoin have value over any other crypto currency. Anybody could in principle duplicate the Bitcoin source code and make their own crypto currency, which is in fact what people do.The advantage of Bitcoin is in first mover status and the network effect. Bitcoin is already established, the competition is not. There are already a huge number of companies and services involved with Bitcoins. You can get a whole host of applications for Bitcoins, there are many currency exchanges which allows you to buy Bitcoins, and many companies have built money transfer services around Bitcoin such as Azimo and Currencyfair. These offer much faster and cheaper international money transfer, especially for remittance than traditional banking or established players such as Western Union.To the user of these services the usage of bitcoins is transparent. Customers just transfer money from to the service provider, which uses that money to buy bitcoins. These bitcoins are in turn sold in the target country for local currency which is transferred to the recipients bank account. Hence a slow and expensive cross border bank transaction using say SWIFT never happens. It is all local cheap bank transactions. The cross border movement of funds is facilitated with bitcoins.Centralized money transfer services like Paypal could in principle do this as well, but this is quite expensive.International Personal Payments:If you send or receive an international personal payment using your PayPal balance or bank account, you\u2019re charged a cross border fee, which can range from 0.5% to 2% of the payment amount.For purchase payments it is even more expensive. The problem with centralized payment schemes as Paypal is that they are built on top of old and expensive bank infrastructure and they hold a monopoly positioned when buying and selling currency. If you hold dollars in your Paypal account and want Euros, then Paypal has a monopoly on making that transaction. Hence they give a poor exchange rate.If you hold Bitcoins on the other hand, nobody has a monopoly on exchanging those for a different currency.So as long as there are many companies using Bitcoins as a bridge currency for money transfer, as well as people needing it for anonymous transactions it will have some value.RippleRipple or Ethereum are the names really of whole systems and not a crypto currency. Ripple does however come with a crypto currency called XRP and Ethereum uses a crypto currency called Ether.A problem both Ripple and Ethereum solves is that there is originally not particular reasons to buy a crypto currency. New crypto currencies tend to be bought exclusively because people are making a speculative bet that they would be worth something in the future.Ripple and Ethereum on the other hand has made their crypto currency a necessity for the services they offer. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t really offer any services beyond a system of transferring ownership of Bitcoins.Ripple in contrast is a money transfer or payment system similar to SWIFT presently used by bank to transfer money internationally. In fact Ripple is working closely with banks to integrate Ripple as a way for the bank to transfer money cheaply and quickly to other banks. For instance SWIFT can require days to perform a money transfer while a Ripple payment is done in a mere second.A Guaranteed Need For XRPRipple was made to transfer fiat currency, and even ownership of assets like gold. But here is the kicker. Every transaction in Ripple requires XRP. So even if you want to just transfer dollars to another person, you still need to acquire XRP to perform that transaction. This serves several purposes:It avoids the public ledger of transactions being spammed with lots of pointless transactions. Hackers can\u2019t overload the system with millions of frivolous transactions because they would have to buy a lot of XRP to do so.It gives a way for the Ripple company, to charge for the service they offer. Ripple is open source and anybody can run a ripple node, so it is not through hosting an online service in the traditional sense that they get paid.Ripple held all the initial created XRP coins, and have been gradually selling and giving them away. This serves as an alternative to funding through selling stocks. Ripple sell XRPs to fund their operation. As more financial institutions start using Ripple to perform transactions between each other, the higher the demand for XRPs will become and hence the price and their ability to capitalize on it.So far Ripple has signed up something like 60 banks and financial institutions to their network. In this sense it is a more centralized system than Bitcoin. The Ripple company function in many ways as a regular central bank. If the currency sees too sharp value swings, they dump XRPs on the market to stabilize the price. Ripple wants a stable value on XRP as that facilitates trade more easily. Bitcoin in contrast is based on decentralized mining. Bitcoins can spring into existence on any computer. Hence there is no central control of the money supply. This also means higher volatility of the Bitcoin price.However Ripple is not a centralized system when compared to e.g. PayPal. The Ripple company is not a central authority on money transactions. There is no single Ripple database of account balances that they update. Rather there are distributed servers each keeping a copy of the Ripple public ledger. Transactions are verified by cryptography just like with Bitcoin. It means government couldn\u2019t just suddenly shut down Ripple as there would always be Ripple nodes in other countries maintaining the public ledger which does not depend on the existence of the Ripple company. As they software is open source, anybody could continue its development.XRP as a Bridge CurrencyBecause there is a guaranteed need for XRP since it is required to perform transactions, It can serve a second purpose which is acting as a bridge currency. As mentioned with Bitcoin money transactions, a crypto currency can be used as an intermediate to perform a transaction between two banks. If the banks don\u2019t have an established relationship, they could still perform transactions with each other and avoid counterparty risk by using XRP as a middleman.These factors contribute to creating a demand for XRP. As long as people value the transaction services offered by Ripple, XRP will have a value.Ethereum, a Further AbstractionBitcoin could be used to perform transactions of just one currency. Ripple could perform transactions of any currency. Ethereum takes a big step forward and allows performing almost any financial transaction or contract. You could use it to handle ownership transfer of a house, selling movie tickets, escrow services, Kickstarter style funding of projects where people pledge money to a project, but it only gets transferred if the project raise the target amount.To accomplish this Ethereum is essentially generic platform for running software, referred to as smart contracts.Understanding how this works and understanding the full implications is not something I found easy initially, so I\u2019ll try to explain it in terms of my misunderstandings, hopefully to avoid giving you the same misunderstandings.Ethereum has its own sort of virtual machine, which runs a particular kind of byte code. Although you can program in higher level languages which compile down to this bytecode.My first critical thought when looking at this, was that they language looked too loosely typed and dangerous. It will be too easy to write a faulty program, which has a bug was my thought. You really want to avoid that when dealing with money or financial assets. So I thought it was weird they did not use a sort of strict language like Haskell.The thing to realize is that there are many ways of creating safety other than through language design. First of all, it is a completely sandboxed environment they run in.Also remember how Ripple prevents people from going crazy with transactions by requiring some XRP for each of them?Well, Ethereum is similar. Running a program is going to cost Ether, which is the Ethereum crypto currency. But how do you calculate how much? With e.g. Bitcoin the cost of a transaction is sort of market driven. People assign higher fees to get their transactions through if it goes slowly.Likewise if your Ethereum programs aren\u2019t running you will pay more Ether to get them to run. So there is a price controller by supply and demand which prevents the Ethereum nodes from getting overloaded. However since with Ethereum each program run will require different amounts of resources unlike a Bitcoin or Ripple transaction, they can\u2019t be priced the same. Instead Ethereum solves this by assigning a cost of each operation in a quantity called gas. Hence running a program will consume a certain amount of gas. Ether is used to pay for this gas, but you can\u2019t hold a balance of gas. Instead you pay for gas with Ether as you go.Which brings up the next question, who exactly pays Ether to run a program (or smart contract) on the Ethereum platform? Is it the creator/owner of the smart contract or the users of it?Smart contracts are not like something like Google App Engine apps running continuously. They are more like hooks which run for just a short amount of time in response to events. One of those events would be sending a transaction to a smart contract. In your transaction you specify an operation you want to perform with the smart contract. A smart contract is essentially an API with a set of supported operations. Alternatively you can look at it in an object oriented fashion. They are objects with state and a set of methods which can alter that state.If you as an external entity want to alter a smart contract state, then you have to invoke one if its methods by specifying which one, and give arguments in a transaction. In this transaction you also provide Ether to pay for the gas, which will be consumed when invoking this Smart Contract method. You specify how much you are willing to pay for each unit of gas, and how much gas you are willing to pay for. This sets and upper limit for how much Ether will be consumed.If you specify too low price for gas, then the Ethereum node, might not want to include your transaction and run it, similar to how Bitcoin transactions with a too low fee will not get included, or might have to wait a long time to be included.Once the contract method is run, you will get back any unspent Ether. However if you provided too little Ether to run the contract method, then you will not get anything back. It will be lost. So there is an incentive to provide enough. This also means that buggy contracts with things like never ending loops won\u2019t run indefinitely as they will run out of gas. It also means the operations in the contract will not get performed.Smart contracts can be used together with regular software to create dapps (distributed apps). A bitcoin client is an example of a dapp. You got a client running on say a smart phone interacting with bitcoin software running on a Bitcoin node, performing transactions you put together in the Bitcoin client. Likewise developers can create any number of mobile phone apps or web clients which create particular Ethereum transactions to interact with particular kinds of Ethereum smart contracts. This could be a client for buying movie tickets, sell and buy a house or pledge money to a project.Of course these sorts of applications or services already exists, so what is the new thing now? At the moment all of these applications require building your own infrastructure or paying to host such a service on e.g. Google App Engine. It also requires trusting a multitude of companies. E.g. trusting that if you pledge money to a project, the company running the pledge service isn\u2019t going to run away with your money. With Ethereum you know that no single company owns the Ethereum network.The Huge Need for EtherThis is what is going to drive a large demand for Ether. As companies build a multitude of dapps for trading stocks, buy and sell houses, place bets on horse races, pledge funding to projects, buy subway fares etc, the need for Ether will rise as all of these apps will require Ether to run. The more people who use these apps the more Ether will be required.This makes the future for Ethereum possibly brighter than Bitcoin, because there is nothing you have to have Bitcoins for, but you will have to have Ether to run the services on the Ethereum platform.But to raise one important point of contention. Ethereum is still dog slow, just like Bitcoin. It is fine now, but if volumes should grow, the present solution won\u2019t scale. This is an advantage for Ripple, which although less flexible than Ethereum has lightening fast transaction processing, because it is based on a consensus protocol rather than proof of work (mining) as used by Bitcoin and Ethereum.Part of the advantage here is gained from Ripple working with the established players like banks to build their network. This also makes idealists suspicious of Ripple.Ethereum creators have claimed however that they plan on transitioning to a proof of stake protocol which will give much faster transaction and smart contract processing. It remains to be seen how this will work out.ConclusionI think Ethereum has the biggest potential, however it is more risky because we don\u2019t know how well they will implement proof of work and with the flexibility of smart contracts, it is hard to foresee potential problems.Ripple seems like a solution with great potential but with much less risk. It has already successfully signed up many banks and is essentially a proven solution.While Bitcoin has less technical advantage it has a huge advantage at the moment in terms of first mover status, momentum and much larger mindshare. Almost everybody has heard about Bitcoin and it is easy to get started trading it. Many companies build services on top of Bitcoin which kind of offsets its limitations.This is why I think all of three of these cryptocurrency systems have the most potential for long term investment.From a technical standpoint there are of course many other interesting solutions such as ZCash and Monroe exists. In particular these aim to provide absolute anonymity which neither of the solutions I\u2019ve described in this article do. However my speculation is that pseudo anonymity provided by Bitcoin will be more acceptable to most users seeking some level of anonymity.What will drive adoption by users will most likely be what you can do with the solution and how easily accessible it is.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ripple", "Ethereum", "Technology"]}, {"title": "Ripple & these coins are going to make you rich in 2018", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@reviewcryptos/ripple-these-coins-are-going-to-make-you-rich-in-2018-37c6c179212a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Crypto Reviewer", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@reviewcryptos", "publish_date": "2018-01-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-16", "readtime": "1.93", "claps": 112, "voters": 13, "content": "Ripple & these coins are going to make you rich in 2018Crypto ReviewerFollowJan 19, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readAs I had predicted earlier, and many of you thanked me for that, Ripple (XRP) was on fire & will stay so. I see a target of 8\u201310 USD in the next 2\u20133 months. I am still holding it strong & did not sell when it went down to 75 cents because I believe in the technology.The reason for recent dump was caused by top Korean gamblers, who conspired with some government officials to spread FUD about cryptocurrency. Eventually they were caught manipulating the market & buying Bitcoin & other crypto currencies for cheap. This is the reason why we need some regulations. Crypto newbies don\u2019t understand all this & they put their life savings in to it & end up losing half of it.Ripple is the only company working with the government & the banks. So, your money will be safe with it, if tomorrow Trump or Putin decides to ban all cryptocurrencies. As we start 2018 there will be a few bumps caused on the way but expect the market to stabilise in February after Chinese New Year. Ripple should reach at least 20\u201330$ by end of the year.My other recommendations for 2018 to invest:1. Ethereum: Price Target: 2000 $ by March.Ethereum is working with some big banks like UBS & it would be interesting to see new DApps being launched on the Network. Would definitely put the price up. Besides Bitcoin, Ethereum & Ripple dominate the market and any new investor would invest in to these currencies than any other. Whether ETH can reach 10K? No one knows but it is quite possible.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/2. EOS: Price Target: 20 $ by AprilEOS testnet is already launched & expect some new Dapps to be deployed soon. The team is solid & the product launch should get new customers & investors. They have been also very good with their marketing efforts & the token is listed on many exchanges already.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/3. Global Jobcoin (GJC): Price Target: 8\u201310 $ by AprilYesterday it was trading at 23 Cents & already up 84% on some decentralized exchanges. They have not been able to list on bigger exchanges as yet but that might change soon. This token has great value & the team is launching their global Job platform in January, already ahead of time. They also destroyed the unsold tokens so total supply is only 15 Million.

Thankfully none of them were killed, but several were seriously injured. Many will inevitably endure the lasting effects of trauma. My heart goes out to them all and I hope they can find the strength to move forward without persistent fear impacting their daily lives. My heart is with you guys.I was hesitant to write this post because I did not want to make this about me. After all, I was not attacked or injured. I did not fear for my life this week. I am still alive and healthy.I realized that this is the third mass shooting I am closely connected to, despite not being physically present or shot at myself.The first was in 1993 at a \u201cChuck E. Cheese\u201d restaurant, just a few blocks from my childhood home in Aurora, CO. I was 14 years old. Four people were murdered that night and a fifth was seriously injured. I was skateboarding across the way when police stormed the building. A family friend was supposed to work a shift that night but unknowingly swapped it with someone else who ended up getting murdered. This incident rattled my school and our neighborhood. An unfamiliar feeling of deep sadness set in.The second time was in 2012, again in Aurora, at our local movie theater where 12 people were senselessly murdered and 70 were seriously injured during a screening of Batman. Remember that one? Once again, lives were forever changed and the city grieved. Some people felt scared to sit in a movie theater afterwards. By this time mass shootings had become more commonplace in America, but their impact still cut deep emotionally.And now the shooting at YouTube where I used to work, think and build five days a week. A familiar feeling by this point. The unfathomable is now totally fathomable.I\u2019m sure there are many stories like mine. The emotional impact of these tragedies is far reaching. It ripples outwards from the crime scene, creating a lasting sense of sadness and fear. Some people grow numb over time. Others, like myself, start to feel an empathetic connection to each new incident. Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Pulse, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Parkland, and far too many others. It is painful every time.My dad is a gifted pianist who excels in classical, jazz and improvisation, but he doesn\u2019t compose a lot of his own music. The night of the San Bernardino shooting, he recorded an original song titled \u201cSan Bernardino\u201d and emailed it to me. Thinking of the innocent victims, I cried when I played it back, just sitting there in the sadness as the notes reverberated. I could feel his pain as a father in the music.I was chatting about Parkland recently with my dear uncle who has different views on guns than me. He pointed out that Parkland is a complex basket of issues\u200a\u2014\u200afrom police and FBI failures to mental health, our violent culture and everything in between\u200a\u2014\u200athat must be sorted through one at a time. Don\u2019t be so quick to blame guns, he implied. Perhaps he is right, but guns are one of the issues. It is statistically undeniable. And we need to sort this one out.Common sense gun safety legislation will not change everything, but every indication shows that it will make a significant difference. We have to take action.I believe in the power of speaking out and I am encouraged by the young Parkland activists. Unfortunately I was unable to attend the March For Our Lives in Washington DC on March 24th, which I see as a vital youth movement. In our absence, my wife and I sent 5 students and a teacher from my old high school in Aurora, a city that has seen its share of gun violence. We feel fortunate that we could help these young people participate and be heard. They will drive the change we so desperately need to see.I am not a gun owner today but I will probably purchase one some day. If and when this day comes, I hope I am subject to a rigorous background check, mandatory training, a licensing process and an insurance requirement. That\u2019s not because I hate guns. It\u2019s because I respect them.I feel neither cursed nor unique for my own personal connection to these tragic incidents. Again, I am alive and healthy. I grieve for the true victims and their families. I am sad that these shootings have the power to destroy lives; creating a ripple effect that makes us feel numb\u2026 or scared. But I refuse to go numb. I feel angry that the system continues to fail us.

President Trump\u2019s action to suspend all refugee resettlement to the United States and to impose additional restrictions on refugees from largely Muslim countries is a sad day for refugees and for cherished American values.But these actions also threaten a carefully-constructed international system for responding to people fleeing persecution and conflict. This system was intended not only to protect the rights of those forced to flee violence but also to prevent refugees from threatening international peace and security. Today\u2019s actions by President Trump, in the name of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, threaten that system.Beautiful despite blemishesThe system, grounded in the 1951 Refugee Convention and guided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has proven remarkably adaptable over the past six decades. Originally intended to assist those displaced by World War II, it has saved the lives of millions of women, children, and men fleeing communist countries, persecution by repressive governments, civil wars, ethnic cleansing, genocide, and criminal gangs.But somehow, frayed at the edges as it is, the system has continued to meet the needs of both refugees and the international community.It has never functioned perfectly. Some countries never signed the Refugee Convention; some governments refused to allow refugees to enter their countries or forcibly returned refugees to countries where their lives were in danger; some have adopted increasingly restrictive definitions of refugees. Financial support to countries hosting refugees was never sufficient to cover their costs.But somehow, frayed at the edges as it is, the system has continued to meet the needs of both refugees and the international community. The system was based on the concept of responsibility-sharing, reaffirmed in the New York Declaration less than six months ago. Responsibility-sharing means that the international community \u2014 and not just the countries where refugees happen to go \u2014 will step up. Countries experiencing a sudden influx of refugees have been reassured by this international commitment that they will not have to bear the burdens alone. It is in our national and our collective interest to make sure that refugees are cared for and that massive arrivals of refugees do not threaten peace and security.Dominoes falling?America has always played a king-sized role in the international refugee system. It has resettled millions of refugees from regions in turmoil, not only providing a benefit to individual refugees but also expressing a concrete commitment to responsibility-sharing. American leadership has led other governments to make commitments to refugees, most recently in the September 2016 Leaders\u2019 Summit. In recent years, the United States has been in the forefront of efforts to address issues such as sexual and gender-based violence and the rights of LGBTI refugees. And over the years, the United States has expressed its commitment to humanitarian principles by assisting refugees on the basis of need and not because of their religious affiliation. Lives have been saved and the international system has been supported because of U.S. leadership.If the United States slams the door, why should other countries keep theirs open, and what would that mean around the world?The actions by the Trump administration will close doors to refugees \u2014 whom federal law already requires undergo thorough vetting. This is a major problem, both for its direct effects and for possible ripples internationally. The move denies refugees the chance to start new lives in the United States and to enrich our communities. More broadly, it is another blow to an already fragile international system. If U.S. refugee policy excludes those fleeing violence in Muslim majority countries, why shouldn\u2019t other countries impose similar exclusions? If future U.S. refugee policy is based on a narrow implementation of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d why should Lebanon or Tanzania or a hundred other countries continue to receive refugees? After all, over 85 percent of the world\u2019s refugees are hosted by developing countries with far fewer resources than the United States. If the United States slams the door, why should other countries keep theirs open, and what would that mean around the world? If countries neighboring Syria, for instance, were to close their borders or to return Syrian refugees to a bloodbath, the results would be unconscionable from a humanitarian perspective, disastrous from a regional stability one, and deeply detrimental to U.S. and international interests.This post originally appeared on www.brookings.edu.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Refugees", "Syria", "Donald Trump", "2016 Election", "United Nations"]}, {"title": "200+ Banks & Financial Organizations will use RippleNet in 2019", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/200-banks-financial-organizations-will-use-ripplenet-in-2019-95d20cc6bb94?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mina Down", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@minadown", "publish_date": "2019-01-21", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-22", "readtime": "2.21", "claps": 65, "voters": 11, "content": "200+ Banks & Financial Organizations will use RippleNet in 2019Including the use of Ripple Software and XRP Cryptocurrency at a Regulated UK BankMina DownFollowJan 21 \u00b7 3 min readEuro Exim Bank is a registered and regulated UK-based bank that has announced it will use Ripple\u2019s xRapid software and the cryptocurrency XRP for cross-border payments. This is one of several new banking partnerships that Ripple revealed in 2019. At this point, it is working with over 200 banks and financial organizations.xRapid Blockchain Offers Fast and Transparent TransactionsRipple\u2019s blockchain software is like other blockchain platforms in that it can provide transparent and real-time visibility of transactions to all stakeholders. For those with access to the blockchain ledger, there is no need to email queries or check confirmations. Stakeholders can simply check a link to the transaction which is immutably recorded on a blockchain network.Euro Exim Bank plans to use both xRapid and Ripple for transactions in the first quarter of 2019, according to American Banker. Doing so would make the bank the first to use both Ripple software and the XRP cryptocurrency.Marcus Treacher, global head of strategic accounts at Ripple explains why financial institutions are drawn to Ripple\u2019s services:\u201cWhen you use XRP, instead of having to pre-park all your money in foreign accounts around the world, you hold your funds locally, under your control, your stability, your creditworthiness. It\u2019s a much better position structurally.\u201dAccording to Treacher, XRP reduces the time it takes to move funds from one account to another in a different currency. The current system, SWIFT, can take up to three days whereas Ripple can execute the same transaction in two minutes.Ripple has capitalized on the weaknesses of the existing SWIFT system. Graham Bright, head of compliance and operations for Euro Exim Bank explained that XRP eliminates the need to establish pre-existing bilateral relationships with foreign banks to hold reserves of foreign currency and process local fiat payments: \u201cwe saw the technology would let us easily and quickly originate payments without having bilateral relationships.\u201d Bright happens to have worked at SWIFT for 20 years.Ripple Has 200 CustomersRipple confirmed it now has signed 200 banking and financial customer partnerships. In addition to Euro Exim Bank, it announced partnerships with SendFriend, JNFX, FTCS, Ahli Bank of Kuwait, Transpaygo, BFC Bahrain, ConnectPay, GMT, WorldCom Finance, Olympia Trust Company, Pontual/USEND, and Rendimento. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple said:\u201cWe\u2019re now signing two \u2014 sometimes three \u2014 new customers per week. We also saw a 350 percent increase last year in customers sending live payments, and we\u2019re beginning to see more customers flip the switch and leverage XRP for on-demand liquidity.\u201dOf the new partnerships, Ripple has said that JNFX, SendFriend, Transpaygo, FTCS and Euro Exim Bank, will use XRP for settlement as well as Ripple\u2019s blockchain products.

Every day new financial institutions are joining the network to test what the blockchain can do for the industry of transaction processing.Ripple Transaction Protocol is built upon a distributed open source Internet protocol, consensus ledger and native currency called XRP. It does not only support cryptocurrencies, but can be used for fiat currency or any other asset, commodity to be sent through the protocol. The basis of the protocol is a public ledger with a consensus process that allows for transactions in a distributed process.The advantages that the protocol brings, are mostly focused on speed and cost per settlement, while also enabling security of a traditional financial payment protocols.Average daily payment volume of XRP ledger is already around 500 mio USD, and the market is growing rapidly. Imagine that Ripple could some day become the new foreign exchange market, which today amounts to $ 5.3 trillion of daily volume.The number of gateways in RTXP is increasing rapidly. Gateways enable users to put money into and take money out of Ripple\u2019s liquidity pool, and with growing number of gateways, there is a growing need for connectivity of those numerous entry and exit points.There is a real need for a market maker between those points and that is where we as a market maker come in play.Bellow you will see the example of only two gateways (Bitstamp \u2014 Gatehub), where, at its peaks, the users had to take 15% and even 25% haircut for USD dollar to USD dollar transaction.By positioning ourselves on different gateways we can create liquidity for the users and earn a fraction on every settled transaction. Of course, the total market consists of many more gateways and 15+ crypto and fiat currencies. The potential is unprecedented\u2026", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ripple", "Ethereum", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Ripple (XRP) Wallet \u2014 Best Wallet For Ripple", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinsutrablog/xrp-wallets-3f369a775dda?source=search_post", "author_name": "Harsh Agrawal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@denharsh", "publish_date": "2017-06-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-19", "readtime": "3.79", "claps": 72, "voters": 12, "content": "Ripple (XRP) Wallet \u2014 Best Wallet For RippleHarsh AgrawalFollowJun 3, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readRipple (XRP) is currently the second highest cryptocurrency in the market by market cap.In the past month, the price has gone up by +977% & people who have invested in XRP are making a great profit.If you are planning to buy Ripple (XRP), you may have a couple questions:Where should you store XRP?What wallet supports XRP?How to buy XRP?In this guide, I will help you understand everything you need to start holding XRP.I have also shared some of the best XRP wallets in the market that are safe, secure, and trusted by other cryptocurrency enthusiasts like you.Let\u2019s start with where can you get XRP\u2026Where can you buy XRP?There are many places from where you can get XRP.The best way is to buy Bitcoin & exchange them for Ripple.Changelly & ShapeShift are two popular websites to exchange BTC (or other cryptocurrencies) for XRP. Personally, I\u2019m a big fan of Changelly.Another method is to use an exchange like Poloneix & buy XRP using Bitcoin or USD.You can also buy XRP from Bitstamp.Other exchanges which support buying Ripple are Kraken, Coinone (Korean), Bitso, and Coincheck.Once you have finalized the way you want to get XRP, the next thing to figure out is where to store them.Also see: Monero Wallet: How to Create & Use Monero Wallet Address OnlineXRP Wallets: Best Wallet For Ripple CryptocurrencyBefore I share about top wallets for XRP, you need to know one important thing:Unlike Bitcoin wallets which are free, Ripple wallets require you to have 20XRP to book your wallet address.So if you add 1000 XRP to your Ripple wallet, 20XRP will be used to book the wallet address. This is one reason you don\u2019t want to use multiple wallets for XRP (unless required).Pick the right wallet from day one so that you don\u2019t end up losing 20XRP on various wallet addresses.Do remember, there are various kinds of cryptocurrency wallets & you can read more about them here.Ledger Nano S:Ledger Nano S is a hardware wallet that has recently added support for XRP.Being a hardware wallet, it is one of the best ways to store your cryptocurrency as it offers great security, ease of use, and you can carry it with you anywhere.I recommend Ledger Nano S as it supports many popular cryptocurrencies including:Dash, BTC, ETH/ETC, Stratis, Zcash, and now it supports XRP.You should order it from the official site here & it will take 4\u20137 days to have it delivered to your doorstep.Once you have it, you can check out our Ledger Nano S video library to learn how to start using the Ledger Nano S.Coinpayments:CoinPayments is recommended by CoinSutra reader \u201cDipen\u201d and this one is a solid multi crypto currency wallet. With one account you will be able to store XRP along with many popular Cryptocurrencies & upcoming altcoins.Unlike other XRP wallet mentioned in this resource, for receiving XRP on coinpayments wallet you need to add the destination tag.CoinPayments is more than just XRP Wallet as it offers payment gateways for merchants to accept payments in cryptocurrencies. Right now I\u2019m trying their EDD integration & would let you know how it goes. For short term parking, this one is a solid solution for storing XRP coins.Join CoinPaymentsPoloniex:If you want to get XRP right now, you can use Poloniex to get an XRP wallet.However, you should store your XRP for more than 1\u20132 days on an exchange (any exchange) as exchanges can shut down or go into issues at any time and put you at risk of losing your stored coins.When I needed to get ahold of XRP urgently, I used Changelly to convert my bitcoins into XRP & stored them on my Poloniex wallet.You can, later on, transfer these XRP to the Ledger Nano S (or any other hardware wallet that supports XRP).Here is the statement from Poloniex about 20XRP for holding your Ripple deposit address.IMPORTANT: The first time you deposit to a Ripple deposit address, 20 XRP will be held there to reserve the address. This is because the Ripple network requires a minimum of 20 XRP to be in any active address. The money does not go to anyone, and the difference will be credited to your account if the minimum requirement is ever lowered. Once you have funded your deposit address with 20 XRP, you will be able to deposit any amount and receive your full deposit. Please note that if you generate a new deposit address, you will have to fund that one with 20 XRP as well.With time, I expect more popular wallets to integrate XRP & make it easier for us to store Ripple.However, for now, these are the top Ripple wallets that you can start using right away.If you are someone who is investing in cryptocurrencies, I would recommend you to just order Ledger Nano S hardware wallet which ensures that you remain in total control of all of your coins.Have a question about storing XRP?

We started two weeks ago with a new strategy on EOS, and we are happy to publish our long overdue strategies on XRP and LTC cryptocurrencies. Even though it may be too early to start thinking about launching DAFs outside BTC and ETH, we believe it is interesting to provide trading signals on other large cryptos so that you would have more tools to invest in a more diversified way.New XRP.USD strategyThe strategy is the aggregation of two primary strategies, similar to the old BTC.USD pair. As a reminder, this was made up of one strategy that takes positions on a weekly basis with a long-only trend following approach and one \u201cbuy the dip\u201d daily strategy. This has been designed to allow trading on all platform as no short positions are included at this stage. This may come in an updated version later this year.Source: Napoleon GroupAs you can see, we are essentially capturing the moment where the uptrend is the most ferocious and being neutral when the trend is absent.New LTC.USD strategyThis is basically a copy and paste of the a.m. strategy. We usually like to test a strategy on different assets and find out that it is still working. That reinforces the statistical value of our methodology, and in the case of cryptos, it is quite useful as there is not much historical data.Source: Napoleon groupIn this strategy, that we have not overfitted, it is at the beginning that we lag somewhat the underlying. After that, the strategy is working nicely to capture uptrends, with at the end a much-reduced volatility.Upcoming eToro strategyWe are in the final stage of onboarding a Napoleon product on the eToro platform. The rationale behind this launch is to get some visibility amongst eToro community, which is a large retail community of traders that could be interested in our project and in the bots that will be launch in the next few weeks. We will communicate separately on this topic quite soon. So stay tuned.ConclusionAs always, we are coming with new ideas and new features for you. It is important that you are rewarded as you supported us in the first place. You will also be our best ambassadors in the future when people become aware of our project and will join our Telegram and our platform. It is just the beginning of our long journey to setting up this new kind of asset management business. We are now starting our marketing campaign, and as usual, we try to be creative to avoid spending money when in fact we can make some.Trade wisely,Stephane IFRAH, CEO Napoleon Crypto.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Trading", "Litecoin", "Ripple", "Newsletter"]}, {"title": "Values and Ripples", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@millsustwo/values-and-ripples-425a8877f133?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mills", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@millsustwo", "publish_date": "2018-07-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-28", "readtime": "2.75", "claps": 120, "voters": 12, "content": "Values and RipplesPersonal Values Iteration 1.0 (1.2)MillsFollowJul 12, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readstolen from hereI make decisions using my values.One TeamI want to feel part of a team, always.

I enjoy the feeling of using what influence I have to help others who make impact. I am building my podcast so that I have a bigger platform to highlight the incredible efforts of people I get to know, bond with and have an afffinity or respect for.Highlighting awesome things like this by Dem, this by Preet, or this by Kate this by Harry, this by Kian and this by Alex.Think happy, See HappyI spent so much of my life using my infectious energy to highlight everything that is wrong with my business as opposed to everything that was right.

How I do buy Ripple?This was my answer:But, as a personal finance geek who loves numbers and facts so much, I felt that there was an opportunity to bring more light to my answers about Ripple (the company) and $XRP (the digital asset).What is Ripple?The first time I heard about Ripple was in 2016 when I found a very interesting whitepaper written for the specialists of the company called \u201cA Protocol For Interledger Payments\u201d, which explains in great detail how this protocol works, the technical background behind it and why it\u2019s relevant today a solution like that.So, what is Ripple (the company)?I will use its own words here:Ripple provides global financial settlement solutions to ultimately enable the world to exchange value like it already exchanges information \u2014 giving rise to an Internet of Value (IoV). Ripple solutions lower the total cost of settlement by enabling banks to transact directly, without correspondent banks, and with real-time certainty of settlement. Banks around the world are partnering with Ripple to improve their cross-border payment offerings, and to join the growing, global network of financial institutions and market makers laying the foundation for the Internet of Value.Ripple is a venture-backed startup with offices in San Francisco, New York and Sydney. As an industry advocate for the Internet of Value, Ripple sits on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee and co-chairs the W3C\u2019s Web Payments Working Group.As a fan of simplicity, I knew that there had to be a simpler answer to the question about what is Ripple and what it does? And I found it in a live interview made by Martin Arnold (The Financial Times) to Daniel Aranda, Managing Director For Europe at Ripple:In the interview, Daniel said:Ripple is a cross-border payments network, and the members of the network are financial institutions. We work with banks as well as non-bank financial institutions, and they use Ripple as a way to move funds around the world to other financial institutions. And where the blockchain portion comes in is in really helping to coordinate things like settlement, so when a debit occurs to the account of the sender, is coordinated and synchronized with the credit accuracy account of the receiver.And we are also deploying digital assets cryptocurrencies, tokens of equity management as well. So, we are really trying to build a next generation network in terms of people how can move funds around to service new kinds of demands we are seeing on the market.I encourage you to watch the entire discussion. Believe me, it worth of your time.Then, I began to search more information about the protocol and the company behind it: Ripple. In the middle of my search, I found another interesting whitepaper called \u201cThe Cost-Cutting Case for Banks: The ROI of Using Ripple and XRP for Global Interbank Settlements\u201d, and I realized that this could be huge in the next 5 to 10 years.Inside the whitepaper, I found two particular parts which made me to jump of my chair:This model includes a conservative assumption of hedging costs with initially high volatility of XRP. However, institutional holdings and active trading of XRP can greatly reduce the volatility of XRP, significantly lowering the hedging costs. In a low volatility state, assuming the volatility of XRP is the same as that of a basket of liquid global currencies, costs can decrease an additional 3.8 bps ($10 billion system-wide) or 60 percent compared to the current system, translating to total system-wide cost savings of over $33 billion annually with lower volatility of XRP.Specifically, Ripple can eliminate 6.8 bps or $18 billion annually in liquidity and payment operations costs. Implementing Ripple with XRP, which further improves liquidity and treasury operations costs, can lead to a total savings of 8.8 bps or $23 billion annually. As the volatility of XRP approaches that of a global currency basket, cost savings can amount to 12.6 bps or $33 billion annually.Furthermore, as banks globally adopt Ripple and as liquidity costs are eliminated, there is a real possibility that the marginal cost of international transactions approaches zero. To accelerate market thickness and reduce volatility for XRP, Ripple will soon introduce an XRP incentive program to algorithmically rebate market makers who provide liquidity through XRP.Let me repeat the number: a cost reduction to almost 60% compared with the current system (SWIFT I suppose), for a total annual saving of $33 Billion globally.When I read those numbers, I immediately gathered the opportunity behind Ripple and its Internet of Value vision.That\u2019s why in my answers at Quora, I made a clear point: XRP is not in a bubble like Bitcoin; it has a real multi-billion industry behind and Ripple is working with more than 100 financial and non-financial organizations at global scale to get on board on their RippleNet.Here are some of the most prominent banks and financial organizations working with Ripple:American Express (NYSE: AXP)Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (NYSE: CM)Banco Santander (NYSE: SAN)Swiss-based UBS (NYSE: UBS)Japan Bank Consortium (JBC), a collection of 61 Japan-based membersRAKBANK (United Arab Emirates)Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore)Axis Bank (India)Barclays (United Kingdom)When Ripple announced they were working with Axis Bank, Standard Chartered and RAKBANK, I quickly began to search more about the opportunity.First case: Axis BankUsing their own words in the last financial reports, you can see the impact that could create Axis Bank inside RippleNet:Incorporated in 1994, Axis Bank has emerged as one of India\u2019s most trusted banks and the third largest in the private sector. It is among the country\u2019s first new generation private sector banks, and offers the entire spectrum of financial services to customer segments, spanning large and mid-corporates, SME and retail businesses.Over the years, the Bank has developed long-term relationships with its customers by being their preferred financial solutions partner, leveraging deep insights and superior services.Axis Bank has also taken significant steps to simplify banking for its customers by the smart use of technology. The Bank has always focused on meeting the financial needs of its customers by providing high-quality products and services through regular customer engagements.Axis Bank\u2019s numbersSecond case: Standard CharteredUmmm, well done SC:I can\u2019t access to SC\u2019s website from here in CubaThird case: RAKBANKAnalyzing the last financial report of Q3 of 2017, you can see the big numbers behind RANKBANKQ3 2017 HighlightsIt\u2019s great to see this kind of organizations working with Ripple, and based on the information shared in the article about the announcement; this could be a terrific opportunity:For Standard Chartered and Axis Bank, the Ripple-powered corporate payment service will allow each bank to offer their business customers an enhanced payments experience, ultimately enabling their end-customers to manage their cash flow, costs, and float better.By our estimates, there are between 200\u2013300 large, international corporates with regional treasury hubs in Singapore. These corporates span industries including fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and retail.Often these corporates manufacture their products in India before shipping them to Singapore for worldwide distribution. In fact, the Singapore-India trade corridor is worth $15 billion.Ripple-enabled cross-border payments will help unlock this corridor on both sides for Standard Chartered and Axis Bank.It\u2019s also never been more important for retail remittances to be instant, efficient, and secure between the UAE and India. Retail remittances between the two countries are significant and growing, thanks to the large Indian workforce in the UAE.These workers send a significant proportion of their salaries home every year \u2014 nearly $12.6 billion annually \u2014 which RAKBANK wants to support with faster, easier, and more transparent payments.Individual retail remittance payments are usually lower in value, but higher in volume. Processing these over RippleNet will allow RAKBANK to offer their retail customers an easier, more affordable experience, helping them to increase their market share in this crowded and competitive space.So, this is part of the network effect Ripple is causing in the banking world. Precisely focused on the network effect and many other things, Brad Garlinghouse (CEO at Ripple) gave a very interesting Q&A session on Wednesday December 20th, 2017:And on Thursday December 21, 2017, was the Q&A with David Schwartz (aka JoelKatz), the Chief Cryptographer at Ripple:If you want to invest on XRP, you must watch these talks.XRP as a long-term investmentNow, let\u2019s analyze the long-term investing opportunity behind the digital asset of Ripple: $XRP. According to CoinMarketcap, XRP has a market capitalization right now of $40 Billion, and its price at this moment is $1.03 USD (December 22th, 2017):XRP chats at CoinMarketcapWhy XRP is superior to other cryptocurrencies?Ripple\u2019s team answered these questions in Tweets:Now, analyzing the market opportunity behind Ripple, I found this quote which is perfect for this:What is the Internet of Value?Our vision is for value to be exchanged as quickly as information. Although information moves around the world instantly, a single payment from one country to another is slow, expensive and unreliable. In the US, a typical international payment takes 3\u20135 days to settle, has an error rate of at least 5% and an average cost of $42. Worldwide, there are $180 trillion worth of cross-border payments made every year, with a combined cost of more than $1.7 trillion a year.That\u00b4s why Ripple (the company) is working in several solutions not just only for banks, but for corporations too; to help them to alleviate these massive costs in annual transactions. These solutions are:xCurrent: It is Ripple\u2019s enterprise software solution that enables banks to instantly settle cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking. Using xCurrent, banks message each other in real-time to confirm payment details prior to initiating the transaction and to confirm delivery once it settles. It includes a Rulebook developed in partnership with the RippleNet Advisory Board that ensures operational consistency and legal clarity for every transaction.xRapid: It is for payment providers and other financial institutions who want to minimize liquidity costs while improving their customer experience. Because payments into emerging markets often require pre-funded local currency accounts around the world, liquidity costs are high. xRapid dramatically lowers the capital requirements for liquidityxVia: It is for corporates, payment providers and banks who want to send payments across various networks using a standard interface. xVia\u2019s simple API requires no software installation and enables users to seamlessly send payments globally with transparency into the payment status and with rich information, like invoices, attachedFor myself, the most interesting of these products is xVia. Why? Because it could be even a larger market.Just consider these numbers of 3 major corporations, which could decide to work with Ripple:Alibaba Group (BABA): the company works with 75% of consumer brands in Forbes Top 100 Most Valuable brands on TmallShopify (SHOP): announced that collectively retail shops sold over $1 Billion in GMV on November 28th, 2017, and the company is powering 500,000 businesses globallyApple (AAPL): works with many suppliers overseasCould you imagine if these companies worked with Ripple in the future?

After analyzing the Github repositories for developmental output in 16 of the top blockchains, it has become clear that some haven\u2019t been working too hard over the last few years.There is very little time for anyone to do in depth analysis on many of the current blockchain protocols. Most of us just skim our information from the easiest sources, such as Twitter \u2014 where it takes all of 5 seconds to blast off a tweet for all to indulge.This post involved a little bit of data aggregation and data analysis, but that goes a long way in our fast paced world. The following three pieces of information are gathered from public repositories:Commits (weighted as the most important value)Pull Requests (weighted as the 2nd most important value)Issues (weighted as the 3rd most important value)This data was collected by querying the Github GraphQL API, which exposes all the commit, pull request, and issue data.What you\u2019ll learn from this postThe following will be explained:Which blockchains have a robust, upward trend in development \u2014 a very good signal!The long term commit history of 16 of the top blockchains.Data showing multiple projects that have significantly dropped off in development, and are beginning to look like dead projects (Ripple and Litecoin among them)Unique contributors to each projects code, another indicator of good health for an open source project.Unique Contributions \u2014 All TimeThe chart below considers unique contributions since the inception of each blockchain. A unique contribution is a single Github user interacting with the code repository in an Issue, Pull Request, or Commit. These scores are combined in all three categories, and their points are weighted and tallied.Note these values are weighted. The actual number of people who have contributed are less than what is shown.For unique contributions, obviously Bitcoin is at the top, since it has been around the longest. But it is important to see where some of these projects land. We see some weak looking projects at the right side. These blockchains have had very few individuals interact with the code, and some of been around for many years\u2026. Not a good sign.Another interesting point is how strong Bitcoin and Ethereum (go-ethereum and parity-ethereum) are compared to the rest of the pack. They each have the most unique contributors, with the longest history. The momentum they have will be very hard to knock off.Let\u2019s now focus on recent data.Unique Contributions \u2014 Jan 2018- Late Feb 2019This is the same data as above, but we are focusing on the last 14 months.Note these values are weighted. The actual number of people who have contributed are less than what is shown.A surprising fact was how many unique Github accounts have contributed to EOS. I have to admit I\u2019ve been out of the loop on EOS. I thought their $4 billion dollar ICO was ridiculous, so I didn\u2019t pay too much attention. I don\u2019t know too much about the development community, but I expected it to be much more centralized in development. Similar to where Tron is on the chart. Both projects have similar amounts of commits, and were started at roughly the same time, but Tron has had way fewer unique developers contribute to its source code. Maybe EOS hired a ton of people with the $4 billion dollars they raised, or maybe there is real open source contributions happening here. More in depth analysis would need to be done.Cosmos and Polkadot get more representation in this chart, which makes sense since they are both launching this year, and will be pushing many commits before going live \u2014 a common pattern among launching blockchains, which we will see below.We see again that Iota, Litecoin, Ripple, Stellar, Dash, and Neo are not really doing that much development work.Total Contributions \u2014 Jan 2018 Late Feb 2019This is a combination of Issues, Pull Requests, and Commits, over the last 14 months.Note these values are weighted. The actual number of people who have contributed are less than what is shown.Of the mature projects, Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum all show that that they are still consistently pushing code.We see EOS, Cosmos, and Tron having large pushes over the last 14 months. Cardano is up there too. It might seem surprising to many in the Ethereum community that Tron and EOS have this much development work, but it is true. Their repositories had heavy development before launch.This isn\u2019t the whole story though, as we will see in the next section.Commit History \u2014 All TimeBelow is a chart of commit history in each repository. Each months commits are summed together, giving 12 data points per year. The chart is very hard to read within Medium, it is highly recommended to click through and go to the interactive chart, and click on \u201cFull Window\u201d mode.While interacting with the chart on Plotly, I recommend keeping Bitcoin and go-ethereum highlighted, while turning on and off every other blockchain project to see how the commits compare. This will allow you to compare the development of all the other projects to the top two blockchains.Click this link to see an interactive chart (highly recommended!)We get some really good information from this chart:Bitcoin\u2019s trend of commits is consistently upward and to the right. This shows how reliable the continuous development of the protocol is, and it is one of the main reasons it is the most relied upon blockchain in the world.Go-ethereum had a massive spike before launch and has since dropped off. There is also a huge spike for parity-ethereum right after the go-ethereum spike, which is a nice sign, since both clients are important to the protocol. But this goes to show, big spikes, with big drop offs, are expected after a network launches, and can still lead to a successful blockchain.EOS, Cardano, and Tron have all fallen off massively since their initial pushes for their launch. However, since Ethereum had this exact same situation, this isn\u2019t enough to criticize them. A much better way to compare these projects would be by how many smart contracts are being built on each of them.Monero is also up and to the right, more so that any project except Bitcoin. This is a good indicator for Monero. Comparing privacy coins, Zcash has less overall development work and less unique contributors. I would take Monero over Zcash.Polkadot is coming up this year for a launch. It would be expected that they have a big code push in 2019. Cosmos had a big push the last few months of 2018, and it has fallen off in early 2019 as they are currently in audit mode. Both of these projects have a lot of promise, but it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise when we see them drop off as well.Iota, Dash, Stellar, and Ripple have poor development over the last few years. They also have very low unique contributors. This points out that they aren\u2019t doing much development themselves, and they aren\u2019t doing a good job at building a decentralized community of developers. It is not so clear why these are valued so highly.Ripple isn\u2019t a real blockchain, but still, the Github commit trend line is the worst of them all, a complete and total disaster!I never looked into Litecoin much before this. For development, it seems almost non-existent. It followed Bitcoin almost exactly, up until mid 2017. Since they broke from following Bitcoin, the commits have fallen off extensively. It isn\u2019t clear why this coin is worth anything. I even doubled checked all their branches, and all of the people in the organization \u2014 no one has written any code since October 2018\u2026. Is it possible to short Litecoin? (Seriously, let me know in comments).Neo is the saddest project of them all. The commits are so few. And there are very few people who have ever contributed to this repo. I have to admit, I fell for \u201cChina\u2019s Ethereum\u201d a few years ago and I thought this was a serious project. What a great framing that was! However it is clear as daylight that not a lot of work has been done here, and that this project was never serious from the start. You can now call Tron \u201cChina\u2019s Ethereum\u201d.How many contributors make up 90% of the commitsLastly, a simple table that looks at how many unique contributors make up 90% of the commits. You want to see a high number here, as it means more people have put in real work into developing the blockchain core software.Note Dash, Zcash, and Litecoin were left out because so many of the commits mixed and matched with Bitcoin core contributors, since they were all forks of Bitcoin.However, many of these blockchains have employees as contributors, rather than open source developers, which could represent the bulk of commits, which is not as robust as open source development. Once again Bitcoin takes the cake here, with the most contributors, and the least employees.ConcludingThe big points to take away from this post:Bitcoin is robust as hell, and I would not bet against it. The \u201cBitcoin is old technology\u201d narrative will rear its ugly face again in the next bull run of Alt Coins. Remember how consistent Bitcoin has been over the last 10 years, as this will remind you how hard it will be to dethrone Bitcoin.There are some really crap blockchains that have big market caps (Litecoin, Neo, Iota, Dash, Stellar, and Ripple).EOS, Tron, and Cardano have had a lot of development over the last two years. It is now time for their platforms to prove themselves.Monero has good, consistent development.Remember, this is just high level analysis of data points on Github. No in depth analysis of the code has been done. Having lots of commits does not mean the code quality is good!What\u2019s Next?The next blog post I am going to do will focus on smart contracts being developed on blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, Tron, etc.It is expected that Ethereum will have the most here, but I am very interested to see how some of these other projects are doing. Most of my information end up coming from the Ethereum community, so this data should be very eye opening to myself, and many in the Ethereum community.Follow me on medium for more posts on blockchain data \u2014 @davekajFollow me on Twitter if you like reading tweets that take 5 seconds to write or if you want to talk about blockchain data analysis \u2014 @davekajpustAppendix \u2014 Brief notes on the dataAny project that was a fork of Bitcoin (Zcash, Dash, Litecoin) has had their commit history altered to start from the point at which their commits started to diverge from Bitcoins significantly.Cosmos and Tendermint have been combined as one project, even though they are two seperate repositories. So has Substrate and Polkadot. Both repositories are core to each blockchain, which is why they were combined.Parity-ethereum and go-ethereum clients have both been included in the data. Ethereum is the only blockchain with two clients that both have wide usage, which is why they were both included.EOS, Tron, Dash, and Cardano have a lot of commits on their \u201cdevelop\u201d branches, so these were used, rather than \u201cmaster.\u201d (Recently on Twitter it was being passed around that EOS\u2019s development has completely fallen off.

The currency with the abbreviation XRP is a token of the company Ripple Labs. Anyone who bought ripple for 100 euros on 1 January last year was able to withdraw 36,000 euros on January 1, 2018. The sum of all ripple tokens has a market capitalization of $ 89 billion. The founder was at the top of the list of the richest people at the beginning of this year. Are these tokens worth 89 billion? Certainly not. But what real value do they have? I think: 0. Here is my reasoning.What Ripple is designed to doWhen banks transfer money across borders, they use Swift\u2019s service (and technology). It is a protocol from the early 1970s. It enables digital transfer of money between banks without having to send real banknotes back and forth. Swift is one of the cornerstones that has made our current, globalized monetary economy possible. Swift is expensive, slow and awkward. On the other hand, it has been functioning for four decades with a permanent increase in money transfers.Ripple Labs has now invented a blockchain-based protocol to replace Swift. If it is introduced nationwide, it will replace Swift and all its disadvantages. The need and interest of the banks is there and it\u2019s significant. If money transfer costs almost nothing, the institutes will save billions. If Ripple Labs prevails on the market, the company will also be worth billions of dollars.XRP is not Ripple LabsIf you own Apple shares, you own a part of the business. You are (sometimes) entitled to a share of the profits in the form of dividends. Or even a vote on the fundamental direction of the company. Similar to all forms of investment, he value of the stock is based on the belief in the future profitability of the company. However, this is supported by the ownership and related rights.The Ripple XRP token, like virtually every other crypto token, is not tied to company capital. Anyone who owns XRP, owns\u2026 nothing except the token. No property, no dividend, hardly any rights. The price of XRP hardly correlates with the company Ripple Labs, but only with the expectation of buyers for a higher sales price in the future. That may bring the price up, but not the value.Utility by itself is not valuableCrypto tokens can be divided into three groups: currencies (such as Bitcoin, Dash, Monero), investments (such as stocks or notes), and utility tokens. The latter are used to pay for a service. In the casino euros will buy you a few chips that you can then use to play. In the crypto world, you buy Ether to pay for the operation of the Ethereum supercomputer. Or just XRP to pay for the money transfer. Utility tokens are a currency used to pay fees.XRP has no valueIn the crypto scene, Ripple is accused of not being a real blockchain. The reasons are that it is centrally controlled, intransparent, isn\u2019t mined and is controlled by a company. However, for Ripple\u2019s purpose, those are not bad things. After all, for 45 years banks have been doing very well with a centralized Swift. But the problem lies elsewhere: XRP is only used by banks. But the token is tradable on public exchanges. This is pointless, because I personally have no need for ripple, except for speculative purposes. Speculation means price fluctuations and that\u2019s a horror for banks. Just imagine, a transfer from Vienna to Timbuktu costs 3 cents today and 25 euros tomorrow. In order for XRP to be used as a utility token, it must disappear from the public market. And so the price drops to its actual value.No utility token is an investmentAt least since the industrialization of 200 years ago, our economic system is based on this principle: the more of a product is produced, the cheaper the unit price. The more a service is used, the cheaper the individual use.But how do crypto tokens work? The more they are used, the greater the demand. The greater the demand, the more expensive the price. The token principle is at odds with our economy.The bottom lineIn order for the token to not get caught up in this contradiction, it may not be used for the service. There are already many blockchain projects that have two tokens. One to collect money (speculative) and a second, stable one to use the respective platform.With such a solution, the token XRP would be detached from its original use. It would only be the company value. But wait: it does not exist. And in terms of value, things get even more uncomfortable. If a listed company wants to issue new shares, then the current stockholders must vote on it. Because with new shares, the value of each individual share is diluted. Not only is XRP the sole decision of the company, but they haven\u2019t put more than half of all XRPs on the market. The value of XRP is therefore not in the hands of the market, but can be (and is) manipulated by Ripple Labs.All of this happens while Ripple Labs owns the company. They can now go to a conventional exchange at any time and issue real shares with ownership. So they can raise capital a second time and only hand out shares once. Then XRP owners clearly look will be left behind.This does not just apply to ripple labs, but to any crypto token that does not serve as a currency.That\u2019s why I think that XRP has no value. And neither do most other tokens. However, I am open for discussion.Update from August 2018: Please bear in mind that the article was published in Februar 2018. While many disputed some of the facts back then, they didn\u2019t get any fresher in the past six months. Although the price proves my polemic right.

It was released in 2012. With Ripple we have a way of sending, receiving and holding any currency. Not just a specific kind of crypto-currency.It\u2019s the third most valuable crypto-currency and one of the fastest and most scalable digital assets in the world.And what makes Ripple XRP especially unique?XRP is literally decentralized.Anyone can download and run the software, which is a pretty big deal when with other crypto-currencies, it\u2019s not at all clear who\u2019s providing the mining power. This encourages people to work together to make XRP as a currency better than other traditional forms of payment.XRP is predicted to be adopted by banks as a form of currency that will plain and simple make transactions more convenient. In fact, Bank of America and Wells Fargo have both expressed interest in using XRP ripple, and this could prove to be an absolutely huge chance for anyone who would like to invest in XRP now and hold the investment for the long term. As of today, Ripple is trading at around just 40 cents.With a crypto-currency that shows so much potential, just think of how much opportunity there is to make massive profits from a single investment.Ripple is quickly becoming the standard for digital value transfer globally. If they can accomplish this, they\u2019ll solve trillion dollar value transfer issues. International transactions can take days or weeks. Every year all around the world, there\u2019s 180 Trillion dollars worth of cross border payments made every year, with a combined cost of 1.7 Trillion dollars (that doesn\u2019t even consider the money lost with unfavorable currency conversions).Ripple aims to change that, and make international payments simple and cost effective. In other words, they hope to become the \u201cinternet of value\u201d.This means Ripple isn\u2019t hoping to eliminate banks, but rather work with them.That should excite you, as it\u2019s commonly accepted banks aren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon.XRP Ripple Price PredictionLet me tell you something crazy. If you would\u2019ve invest just $900 into XRP, back in 2014, you would be a millionaire right now.Excited?I really hope so, because I know I am. Like previously mentioned, the potential XRP as a a long term investment has to change your life is huge, and if you haven\u2019t already invested, what\u2019s the worst that could happen? You lose a couple thousand bucks?In March of 2017 Ripple was at 0.005, and then spiked to 0.4 (an increase of 7,900%), where it\u2019s still currently sitting today.If XRP is adopted fully, and is utilized in the way Ripple is hoping for, the standard consensus estimate is that XRP would reach around a 7 Trillion dollar market cap, and a price of around $90.The chances of this happening are of course relatively low. However, of all crypto-currencies, Ripple XRP has as good of a shot as any to reach that level.To put this into perspective for you though, if you spent about $1500 today to invest in XRP, and you held the coins until the market cap hit that 7 Trillion dollar spot, you\u2019d have more than $300k.There aren\u2019t many investments that possess this potential. The worst that can happen is you lose a few thousand dollars.The best?That you end up with hundreds of thousands.For myself personally, the risk to reward ratio is completely ideal.

You can can listen to the whole episode here.Aaron Lammer: Welcome, Kieran.Kieran Kelly: Thank you for having me on.Aaron Lammer: So, I just wanna situate this slightly for listeners. We did a show a week or two or go, in which my co-host Jay Kang humorously, but with some meaning behind it, questioned whether Ripple fans on Twitter are real people or bots. I\u2019ll say, we\u2019ve never gotten as much response as we got to that show. Usually, it\u2019s like a trickle of Twitter and emails, like, instantly bombarded with interest from that show.Aaron Lammer: So, some people felt like we were piling on the anti-Ripple sentiment of the internet. Other people were like, yeah, fuck those guys. And, there was a third camp of people like you, who were like, actually, there\u2019s an interesting community here and you should look more into it. So, I can tell right from when you Tweeted at me that you\u2019re interested in Ripple because it\u2019s in your Twitter bio. So, tell me what makes you wanna have Ripple in your Twitter bio and sort of make it part of your persona in that way?Kieran Kelly: Well, I suppose it started quite a few years ago. A friend of mine introduced me to Bitcoin. I did my research and it sort of, I think with everybody, it sort of sounded a bit like magic money.Aaron Lammer: Where are we in the history of Bitcoin right now? Like, approximately what price are we talking about when you\u2019re hearing about it?Kieran Kelly: Actually, to be honest with you, when I was first told about it, it was about six or seven years ago.Aaron Lammer: No wonder you\u2019re calling from the Bahamas.Kieran Kelly: Yeah, quite right. But, for me, it really sort of came down to a couple of things, actually. I mean, I come from a more traditional investment background, so, I was quite pragmatic about my approach.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Kieran Kelly: I had a couple of problems with Bitcoin, or maybe what it stood for, which was, at that time, I think it was really sort of anti-government, anti-bank.Aaron Lammer: Anarchist.Kieran Kelly: So, that was really one of my first problems with it and then second to that, and I mean no disrespect when I say this, I also couldn\u2019t quite get my head around the legendary Satoshi story, which was, a he, she, or a group, but nobody knew who they were, and maybe that\u2019s my ignorance or maybe that\u2019s just something that was completely different to me, but I just couldn\u2019t buy into that either, so I really, really struggled on those two aspects, which led me into Ripple.Kieran Kelly: I had this company in front of me with a fantastic theme. I looked into the investors, Google Ventures being one of them, was a big factor, and then, I did further research finding David Schwartz on YouTube, and I thought, well, this guy has a far bigger brain than me and then, obviously, onto the technicals.Aaron Lammer: And David Schwartz, for people listening, is on Twitter @JoelKatz, and that was the person actually, the story that kicked off us talking about this was Laura Shin\u2019s podcast in which the CEO, Brad Garlinghouse didn\u2019t wanna go on and David Schwartz, AKA @JoelKatz offered to go instead and Joel Katz is kind of the technical godfather of Ripple.Kieran Kelly: He is. He is chief cryptographer and I\u2019m in awe of people like David. I did, actually, also want to apologize that you didn\u2019t get the CEO, because I know that was a massive thing and I also wanted to say that obviously, I am not a bot, but, you know-Aaron Lammer: You can confirm that you are not a bot?Kieran Kelly: I can confirm I am not a bot.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Kieran Kelly: But, you know, it sort of led me into, okay, what is Ripple? It\u2019s a company. Who are they? Who are they backed by? I really liked the team. I mean, it seemed to me that it was sort of best in class team. The backers seemed fantastic with Google Ventures, SBI, et cetera, and then I sort of looked at it and went, okay, so what do they do? What is Ripple? What is XRP?Kieran Kelly: I\u2019m not that technical, but as someone who wanted to get into cryptocurrency, it made sense to me. I looked at it as a use case and I thought, okay, that sounds good and anyone that has sent a cross border wire transfer, like I have, either weekly or daily sometimes, it\u2019s really frustrating. So, it made sense to me.Kieran Kelly: Use case enterprise, use case sentiments in three seconds, low transaction cost and scalability, et cetera. So, all those things really resonated with me. Also, not beating around the bush, there was the excitement of the money.Aaron Lammer: Sure.Kieran Kelly: Bitcoin had grown so hugely and at that time, I saw that there could be considerable return on investment. So, they were really my main reasons.Aaron Lammer: Interesting. So, most of the people I know who are skeptical of some of these core ideas behind Bitcoin, generally become no-coiners or skeptics. They\u2019ll be people who are sort of like, eh, it\u2019s not for me. In fact, I\u2019m actually kind of against it. And, kind of what I\u2019m hearing you say is, these are the problems I had with it, so I looked for a different cryptocurrency project that had differences along those lines.Kieran Kelly: I was looking for something that resonated as credible. I was really pragmatic about it and I took a long time to make a decision and it was the only one that really stood out. I am more confident today that I was then. I was quite hesitant even in the beginning because it was such an unnatural investment for me because it certainly wasn\u2019t traditional and I know that, obviously, we as a community, get a lot of heat for being involved, being holders of XRP.Aaron Lammer: One of the things you said when I was asking you to come do this interview was that you didn\u2019t wanna defend Ripple. I think that\u2019s a fair position, but I wanna ask you from a sort of more zoomed out philosophical level \u2026 I think a lot of people\u2019s problem with Ripple is that it breaks some of the dominant metaphors in cryptocurrency on several levels like, the deep involvement of a company that in some ways, the currency is built on top of this company. That rubs people the wrong way.Aaron Lammer: The fact that it takes the idea of decentralization as put forth by Satoshi and, in my opinion, kind of scales it back a little bit. It takes the basic ideas, but it\u2019s really like, more controlled. It\u2019s more like traditional banking. At a certain level, do you feel like it makes sense to even compare Bitcoin and Ripple, or should these almost be filed under different cabinets in the office?Kieran Kelly: Well, I think, I mean, you have Ripple, you have \u2026 well, you have Ripple the company and you have, obviously, XRP, the cryptocurrency, the digital asset. Ripple is centralized. It\u2019s a private company. XRP, in my opinion, is not.Aaron Lammer: Right.Kieran Kelly: So, it is different. I sort of looked at it from a different perspective. What is cryptocurrency? How is it evolving? I mean, I just feel that actually what\u2019s happened is that from Satoshi\u2019s original white paper cryptocurrency or blockchain is evolving. This is just a different angle. It is a different way to do it. In many respects, again, that\u2019s why it resonated with me because it was something that really aimed at use case and something that I saw very valid, maybe because I do live overseas and I do a lot of wire transfers and our companies do.Kieran Kelly: It hit home with me that it just takes so long to get money across border and as Brad points out, in many of his interviews, as quicker a jump on a plane and hand deliver the money, which makes absolutely no sense. So, I see it from a whole different view.Aaron Lammer: Sure.Kieran Kelly: I mean, there\u2019s cryptocurrency and there\u2019s something that potentially can change the way the world and money works. Now, there is obviously the Bitcoin view, in many respects, that\u2019s P2P. We don\u2019t need banks. I don\u2019t believe that \u2026 I believe that banks will evolve and change over the next decade, but I don\u2019t believe they will disappear.Aaron Lammer: I mean, in some ways, the way that you position Ripple is a more traditional investment in so far as, Ripple has a spokesperson and a CEO and there\u2019s people behind it, whereas you said, the Satoshi method is kind of about the lack of leadership and the void left behind.Aaron Lammer: I had a similar feeling about Ripple when I first got into crypto, in terms of it\u2019s potential. I was like, oh, I get that, it\u2019s like a thing banks can use. Okay, I get all that. And the part where I started to kinda lose the thread a little bit, and I\u2019m wondering where you come in on this stuff, was when I realized that they were \u2026 and this is not unique to Ripple. You could level this against half of the cryptocurrencies out there.Aaron Lammer: They would sort of say, oh, we have a deal with Am-Ex. Well, it\u2019s actually a pilot program. Well, it\u2019s actually, Am-Ex doesn\u2019t know about it, but this kind of like, idea that they were selling the vision of it and acting like it was already happening when it wasn\u2019t totally happening, and many of these things are not totally happening, but I feel like something about that moment fractured the crypto community into people who were defending Ripple and people who were against Ripple.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think any community has been quite so divisive. When did you start feeling like that was seeping in? How far into your Ripple journey did you start feeling the friction?Kieran Kelly: I think actually just before SWELL, the conference. So, when was that? September, October last year.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Kinda right before the big bull run.Kieran Kelly: Yeah. It was. And so, SWELL was announced and the price went up for XRP. A lot of people were waiting for a huge announcement, but that was when I believe the, maybe almost, Ripple felt that they had to keep announcing partnerships to feed the fire, fuel the fire of cryptocurrency.Aaron Lammer: Right.Kieran Kelly: You know, I mean, I totally understood SWELL. I thought it was a fantastic conference. It was about gaining relationships, and obviously, after SWELL, the price went down and it sort of settled a bit. So, I did like to hear about the partnerships because it does sort of set the tone that Ripple is working with X bank. In my opinion, the next step to that on these pilots is the implementation of xRapid. So, it\u2019s connectivity, I suppose, for me.Aaron Lammer: So, the big bull run happened. Ripple went from 50 cents to a dollar-ish all the way up close to three dollars, I think, at one point?Kieran Kelly: I think we nearly hit, on some exchanges, nearly hit four dollars.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m assuming that that was a profitable run for you, but beyond-Kieran Kelly: That was a good Christmas.Aaron Lammer: I remember on the show, actually, Jay and I talked about \u2026 We were like, okay, well, people have exhausted all the coins on Coinbase. What\u2019s another thing that\u2019s easy to find on the internet? Like, you had almost it that point, Google, like what crypto should I buy? And Ripple would be popup.Aaron Lammer: So, there was this whole new wave of people coming in who were buying Ripple, many of them in positions above a dollar, and getting ejected. So, what was it like as a long term Ripple holder to have this new wave of Ripple people coming in?Kieran Kelly: Well, to be honest with you, I sort of had that mad scientist feeling because I truly believed in it before the bull run.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Kieran Kelly: I was a bit concerned, to be honest with you, because as it started happening, the press got hold of it, the media got hold of it, and it really just escalated it so quickly. For me, it was too quick.Aaron Lammer: Brian Kelly was not your friend during this period [inaudible 00:36:48]?Kieran Kelly: Yeah. You know, it really, it pushed on so quickly, the concern was obviously that it was going to exhaust itself and it did. I mean, there were two things that really ended up happening, which was Coinbase sent out their notice that they\u2019re not looking at any other cryptocurrencies, and-Aaron Lammer: And they also sent out kind of a blanket message that was like, here are the kinds of coins we could consider and you\u2019re like, huh, seems like they\u2019re saying, not Ripple.Kieran Kelly: That was exactly how we read into it. The other thing was, I think it was about two weeks later, CoinMarketCap took off the, I think it was the South Korean pairs, or prices, and that dropped the market completely. So, we have these two elements that really took the bottom out of the price. So, in many respects, it did stabilize and went, in my opinion, went back to normal.Kieran Kelly: But, what it created was this huge thud, if that\u2019s what you are to call it. I suppose, left us exposed in many respects and then you had the talk of the flippening, which was obviously the potential, I think, that one stage we went above Ethereum and then, I didn\u2019t think we were gonna overtake Bitcoin at that time, but it really obviously got the backup of some big Bitcoin maximalists, if that\u2019s what you wanna call it.Kieran Kelly: And, obviously, Twitter being such a big forum, there was this huge attack that came out of nowhere, so you had these big guys with massive following on Twitter and they went for it, and whereas the XR community had spent a long time really informing people, so we were really just guys and girls out there informing new members or anybody else that wanted to look at XRP, about what it does, correcting misinformation, and then suddenly, we were being attacked from every angle, and it really went from there, so I think, actually, the SWELL conference and the bull run were the two main elements when it came to where we sort of sit today and why, maybe, we are perceived as sort of a swarm of, a gang, or whatever you wanna call it.Aaron Lammer: I come back to sports metaphors a lot. It felt like that moment when Ripple passed Ethereum, you became the Yankees or the Chelsea of the league and it became fashionable to dislike Ripple, and I think we take the piss out of enough currencies that we can\u2019t be considered Ripple skeptics particularly. I don\u2019t think we discriminate.Aaron Lammer: But, one of the things that came up in a lot of the discussions \u2026 I actually think we taped a show the night that Ripple passed Ethereum and became number two, was, I believe at that juncture, Brad Garlinghouse became, on paper, somewhere around three dollars, he became, on paper, one of the richest people in the world, like, maybe number two or number three in the richest people in the world with his Ripple stash.Kieran Kelly: Was it Brad or was it Chris Larsen?Aaron Lammer: Now, I think you\u2019re right. It think it was Chris Larsen. But, everyone was in the top 100. Jed McCaleb, a bunch of people became in the 100 richest people in the world at that moment.Kieran Kelly: They were. They definitely-Aaron Lammer: And-Kieran Kelly: Yeah, I didn\u2019t think that helped [crosstalk 00:40:20]Aaron Lammer: Well, I mean, look, I\u2019m not mad \u2026 It\u2019s not that I think the other people in the 100 richest people in the world are somehow admirable and Ripple people aren\u2019t, but it became a little bit of a question for me \u2026 If they\u2019ve got a few pilot programs going for Ripple, and they are already in the 10 richest people in the world, what is the incentive, then, to follow through on this vision?Aaron Lammer: If this has been enough to make you one of the biggest companies in the world on paper. When Apple came to that point, they had computers and the iPhone on the market. They had done all of this stuff, and it felt a little bit like Ripple got there many years too early.Kieran Kelly: I think the proof was in the pudding. You know, they\u2019ve really upped their game and continued to expand. One thing I\u2019ve always loved about Ripple is the fact that they have, in my opinion, have always followed through, trust, integrity, have been a huge part of why I invested in two XRP. It was a lot of hype, and to be honest with you, I think in the community, we didn\u2019t particularly buy into any of the hype, we just knew that potentially, the price could go down and it would be business as usual.Aaron Lammer: Why do you think that Ripple has a bad reputation on Twitter as a community for ganging up on people who criticize Ripple, or generally kind of like, taking the attitude of us versus them?Kieran Kelly: Well, to be honest with you, I think we\u2019ve been provoked in many respects. As I said, when we, I think, mid 2017, a lot of what we did on Twitter was educating people, new people, and we used to have general discussions between ourselves on Twitter openly about what XRP is and it was all very, very positive. The bull run came, and we were being attacked in every single threat. I mean, you couldn\u2019t have a conversation with anybody without being called names and blah, blah, blah.Kieran Kelly: So, really, it evolved into us sort of trying to educate misinformation, so you would have people sort of jumping in and saying something and you would have to correct them and then it would turn into this fight and sort of, name calling and that\u2019s not really our style. Then, you have these big Twitter guys out there really putting out some bad press, should we say, on Ripple and XRP and I felt that was a vested interest, sort of biased position they took.Kieran Kelly: So, obviously, if XRP goes up, it really, it could cause them a problem for their Bitcoin holding. There was a lot of that going on. And so it evolved, and there was this new phase of XRP people, community, that got involved, and I think the sort of main guys and girls in the XRP community have been in for a long time, have tried their hardest to say, look, you don\u2019t react. We\u2019re not into name calling and any of that sort of stuff.Kieran Kelly: But, we have sort of been forced or grouped together. I mean, I remember I was at Consensus: Invest in New York in November 2017. It was my first conference and you wander around and people ask you who you are and what you do and any time I mentioned that I was invested in XRP, I was laughed at and you think, oh, okay, this is a whole different world for me.Kieran Kelly: I think in many respects, there\u2019s this sort of holding on Bitcoin and the people behind it and they really don\u2019t wanna see XRP succeed. We\u2019ve had this situation also, we mentioned Laura. We\u2019ve had another matter, I believe with Ryan Selkis. There\u2019s been a bit of back and forth with Ryan and Brad last week.Aaron Lammer: I had my bag of popcorn already popped.Kieran Kelly: You know what, it \u2026 look, whatever. The reality of this situation is they had a back and forth, then, I believe, that Ryan\u2019s Twitter account was taken down and it was presumed, or it was, I think Ryan presumed, that it was done by an XRP fan with the skills to do that or a group of XRP fans reporting him or reporting his account, and so that it was taken down.Kieran Kelly: However, when he came back on to Twitter with his personal account, you know, you have the likes of Tiffany Hayden, Nick, and David really rallied around and within an hour, his account was back up. I don\u2019t know if you saw the interview consensus with Ryan.Aaron Lammer: I did not, actually.Kieran Kelly: Which, was quite interesting. So, okay, so, you know, you think all is good. We obviously rallied around after his account was taken down on Twitter and [inaudible 00:45:29] if it was an XRP fan, these sorts of things, or enthusiasts, these sorts of attacks are just not welcome. The Consensus: Invest interview was quite interesting. I think the topic came on to scams, but I can\u2019t remember word-for-word what Ryan said, but his instant reply was something along the lines of Ripple and a cheeky little wink.Kieran Kelly: You think, well, okay. We\u2019re obviously being provoked. We take a lot of attacks on a daily basis. But, reality, I think it\u2019s just a phase, because it does get rather boring having to repeat yourself. I mean-Aaron Lammer: The way it comes across is, I\u2019m not like, I\u2019m no Ryan Selkis. I\u2019m not well-known in crypto or anything, but I notice that I can just mention Ripple on Twitter and people will appear. And, it\u2019s the same thing with this show. We\u2019ve made fun of lots of coins on the show, but there\u2019s something about Ripple that people just sort of show up.Aaron Lammer: What you describe as informing people, there\u2019s a weird, like in America, it would be the Jehovah\u2019s witnesses, I don\u2019t know in England who it would be, but it\u2019s like, aggressive like, knock on our door kind of inform you.Kieran Kelly: We have those, too.Aaron Lammer: You know? And I wonder if \u2026 part of what makes me think that Ripple is a scam is that people are so eager to tell you it\u2019s not. I\u2019m a fan of Jackson Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin, and he has a thing that\u2019s called, Are We Decentralized Yet? Which basically lists what percentage of the total coin volume is in the top X accounts. I don\u2019t wanna quote numbers because I\u2019m gonna be wrong. But, it shows Ripple as much more centralized than, say, Bitcoin, viewed through this lens.Aaron Lammer: I understand, I would guess that you would probably say, well, that\u2019s kind of a manipulative lens to see it through and that\u2019s not really what Ripple\u2019s all about, blah, blah, blah. Fine, I agree with that. The fact that Jackson Palmer, who\u2019s like a crypto veteran, wants to take that site down because the amount of like, weird attention it brings him. There does seem to be some organized, behind the scenes effort on the part of Ripple and you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s not bought, but I\u2019ve never seen people who are able to organize to appear people to comment in this kind of a way.Aaron Lammer: We have comment threads on that episode of Coin Talk that are 10 or 15 people involved. We only have \u2026 we\u2019re not even that big a show. A lot of the people who are commenting didn\u2019t seem to have listened to the show, either. That was what was made me suspicious, and someone made a graph that showed all the Twitter accounts that had responded to Ryan Selkis after the Laura Shin thing and it was like, it\u2019s \u2026 Some of the people just pop up all over the place.Aaron Lammer: One of the people I was hoping to get on the show, who said that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it, was XRP Trump. I think his was like, in the word cloud, he was the biggest, and XRP Trump has interacted with me, he\u2019s interacted with Ryan Selkis. Are these people who just have a lot of free time, who are sitting around all day like, I have got to tell people what\u2019s wrong about their impression of Ripple.Kieran Kelly: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that. I think it\u2019s, I mean, enthusiast, I mean, obviously invested, but also enthusiastic about it. It\u2019s a tough one. In reality, I suppose, maybe we\u2019re being looked at in a bad light at the moment. There\u2019s a timeline to this. There\u2019s a history behind it. It\u2019s not organized. I think there\u2019s, yes, there\u2019s obviously a lot of XRP fans, enthusiasts. We\u2019ve, in many respects, I believe, to a degree, we\u2019ve been cornered or we\u2019ve been put in our corner.Kieran Kelly: We\u2019re the banker\u2019s coin, I suppose the would love to throw at us on a daily basis, and we went into XRP, I think, many people went in for some of the similar reasons as I did, and it was because we believed in it and then, we sort of went on Twitter and then we just got attacked on a daily basis. I mean, I could go onto Twitter now and I could start a conversation and with five seconds, I would have someone jumping in, saying, well, I wouldn\u2019t even wanna repeat. But, you can imagine.Aaron Lammer: I think part of what I get is Bitcoin is more ideological than me, so I get that people have more religious dedication to it. Part of what I think is hard to read about the Ripple community is that, the Ripple community is like, passionate about overseas transfers, which, anarchism is a different ideological drive than low fee bank transfers. I\u2019m surprised that you take it so personally that people are bagging on Ripple. Is it more than an investment for you?Kieran Kelly: For me, it\u2019s definitely more than an investment. I think it\u2019s not just even so much that it\u2019s low fee transactions. As I said, I look to Bitcoin and what the approach is is to obviously do away with the banks. My view on it was that it actually changes \u2026 Ripple, XRP, changes the fabric of finance. It isn\u2019t as simple as it\u2019s just a cross border transaction with a lower fee.Kieran Kelly: That changes everything from business. Everybody banks, so at the end of the day, that is inclusive of everything personally and from a corporate level. It changes absolutely everything and I suppose Bitcoiners, which say exactly the same thing, it\u2019s just, one includes banks and financial institutions and the other doesn\u2019t, I suppose. But in many respects, it\u2019s the same.Aaron Lammer: I actually find your case compelling as an investment case. I\u2019m like, I see what he\u2019s saying. I\u2019m a Monero fan. I like \u2026 sort of in the same way that you built your hypothesis, I sort of, I understand the hypothesis of privacy coins, but I don\u2019t have as much of an urge, like when someone\u2019s like, Monero, what is that? The money laundering coin? I\u2019m not like, hey, man, come on! This is actually used for like \u2026 I don\u2019t have quite the same urge to defend it, and maybe that\u2019s just like, differences in personality, et cetera.Aaron Lammer: The thing is, to me, the defensiveness almost makes it seem more sinister. The fact that people are arguing about me is part of the reason why I\u2019m suspicious of Ripple. If it was just a banking coin, it was like, I don\u2019t find \u2026 I live in New York. Even when people hated the banks here, in the worst part of the financial crash, I didn\u2019t feel like bankers were coming up to me and defending their positions and being like, no, banking\u2019s important!Kieran Kelly: Well, you made a really good point. I think it was either yourself or Jay, you entered into the conversation that we were sort of liken to MLS fans.Aaron Lammer: That was Jay.Kieran Kelly: Yeah, Jay, right.Aaron Lammer: Jay has pissed off lots of different constituencies over time, so he\u2019s always got a good-Kieran Kelly: It\u2019s a broad-Aaron Lammer: A good metaphor for people who are angry at him.Kieran Kelly: Well, it was an interesting \u2026 I mean, I did the bit of research. I, you know, I like my football.Aaron Lammer: I was gonna say, are the British even aware that the MLS exists?Kieran Kelly: We are. We are, because you keep taking all of our stars.Aaron Lammer: I was gonna say, where would stars in their late 30s go if there wasn\u2019t the MLS? They\u2019d have to retire.Kieran Kelly: Well, I\u2019m a big Manchester United fan and you\u2019ve just taken Zlatan Ibrahimovic, so, [crosstalk 00:53:25]Aaron Lammer: You\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome.Kieran Kelly: But, I mean, look, it \u2026 I did a bit of research on the MLS and it\u2019s something that sort of grew out of nothing in 1996, they had, whatever, 10 teams. And then, you have these big stars coming in, these guys, brought to the MLS was huge. And I think, when I sort of thought about what you guys were discussing, I think you\u2019ve got MLS fans that believe in this, what was a project, is growing into something huge, and will and has the potential to have something globally massive.Kieran Kelly: I thought to myself, okay, well, look. If I put Ripple where, let\u2019s call them the MLS-Aaron Lammer: Yes.Kieran Kelly: And then, we are the fans.Aaron Lammer: And that makes LOLGA, Bitcoin, and the premier [inaudible 00:54:18] Ethereum.Kieran Kelly: Exactly. So, I think you can sort of say that that\u2019s where we stand as a community, as well. We didn\u2019t really find our place in, let\u2019s say, the Bitcoin community, because we didn\u2019t believe in Bitcoin. So, we were trying to find what made sense to us, and I think the use case for XRP was what fit and we, like the MLS fans, believe that it will be the biggest thing in the next three to five years, ten years, let\u2019s say.Aaron Lammer: Let me ask you, as someone who believes in this. I wanna understand how I could become a Ripple maximalist. So, I\u2019m gonna tell you the things that are keeping me from becoming a Ripple maximalist. The hardest thing for me to wrap my head around is the idea of no mining. One of the things that makes me believe in the Bitcoin system is that a bunch of people started mining it even when it was worth almost nothing and there was all these different constituencies that had to come together to imbue it with value.Aaron Lammer: When I compare that model to a model in which all the coins just show up, and it\u2019s like, hey, who wants to buy these and trade them, and, additionally, where a bunch of the Bitcoins are sitting in the digital earth, but a bunch of the \u2026 Ripple, as I understand it, are sitting in an account to be used to like, attract partners and to do various other business. Does that give you any pause? Or, like, how do you think about that?Kieran Kelly: No. I mean, to be honest with you, the mining side of it, to be honest, I couldn\u2019t quite \u2026 I mean, I understood it, but, I saw some value in it, but I really didn\u2019t see huge value in it.Aaron Lammer: Interesting.Kieran Kelly: You know, maybe I was a bit later to the game, but it really didn\u2019t hold much value. It made more sense to me on a consensus basis without proof of work or mining, and obviously, there\u2019s a big thing about, obviously, the wasted electricity that goes into all of that. I mean, yes, that absolutely makes sense. But, no, realistically, it resonated with me, maybe because it was closer to the current financial system in many respects. I think that XRP is there to better the current financial system, not take it over.Aaron Lammer: Okay, so, this store of Ripple that\u2019s sitting there, that\u2019s owned, I guess, by the Ripple company?Kieran Kelly: Yes.Aaron Lammer: And what I\u2019m wondering, is what is the objective for all of that Ripple that\u2019s still out there, in your opinion?Kieran Kelly: I mean, they were \u2026 when the founders got together and I suppose created it, Ripple were, in many respects, gifted, a lot of XRP. They owned the majority of XRP. Then, you\u2019ve got others joining in. I mean, the Arrington fund owns \u2026 what is that, it was a hundred million dollar fund.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Kieran Kelly: Number one, I did like the fact that Ripple owned quite a lot of XRP because it incentivized them to make a success of it. They, in my mind, had skin in the game, but, I suppose I looked at it and though, well, it\u2019s good to \u2026 it\u2019s an incentive program. You know, that, for me, makes sense. They\u2019re utilizing it to expand Ripple and their partnerships and evolving business, but I also believe that once they have X-Current and the pilots in place, the connectivity between X-Current and xRapid is the next step. So, enter the XRP use case.Aaron Lammer: As someone who believes in XRP and Ripple, what do you think is the biggest stumbling block is, potentially, in the road coming up for Ripple and what do you think the systems that currency like Ripple would deal with something like that?Kieran Kelly: Well, I think it\u2019s the same for most currencies, cryptocurrencies, but I think, obviously, regulation is a hot topic.Aaron Lammer: Sure.Kieran Kelly: You know, that as one of my big reasons also that Ripple work closed with regulators. I mean, Ryan [inaudible 00:58:35] and Ben Lawsky are with Ripple. I mean, I think it\u2019s a huge stumbling block to a degree, but it\u2019s one that everybody has to counter. They, hopefully, are leading the way. We\u2019ll have to see what happens with the SCC, although the news that we\u2019ve heard so far has been quite positive.

Here we briefly go over some vital differences between Ripple and the other, more prevalent digital currencies BTC (bitcoin) and ETH (ether).So why do the banks love XRP so much?1) Ripple is CENTRALIZEDRipple Consensus Ledger (RCL) is a centralized \u201crecord book\u201d that keep tabs on Trustlines and IOUs (and more). Here\u2019s some important tidbits about Ripple Labs\u2019 currency XRP:XRP is Ripple Consensus Ledger\u2019s (RCL) native tokenHas a finite quantity of 100 billion; no more XRPs will ever be created again. The number of XRPs will decrease over time as it is consumed for every single transaction that is made80% of the XRP supply has been kept away from public, locked up i EscrowRipple is a system made for the banks based on a trustline consensus. A trustline is simply the amount in which you are willing to trust another party for. E.g. The amount in your bank account can be seen as IOU tokens, and what you have is basically a \u201ctrustline\u201d of at least that amount extended to the bank. If you only dare trust your bank for a maximum of 10,000 USD. Then your trustline can be said to be 10,000 USD extended to your bank. And you would never hold more than that in your account.Ripple has been likened to an alternative to SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication2) Using XRP for International Bank Transfers in lieu of wiring will save Banks BILLIONS of dollars per yearAs the Ripple team reports, \u201cInstead of holding local currency in nostro accounts around the world, banks (or third-party market makers on their behalf) can consolidate their liquidity for global payments into one XRP account, held on their own balance sheets. This singular XRP pool then allows respondent banks to allocate less total liquidity to service the same volume of international payments in three ways:They only have to hold domestic currency and maintain one account with XRP versus many, expensive nostro accounts around the world.They only need enough XRP on hand to service their largest expected payment obligations, freeing previously trapped liquidity idling in nostro accounts around the world. XRP allows banks to access liquidity on demand.By making markets directly between their domestic currencies and XRP, banks minimize the number of intermediaries involved and their markup on spreads.As a result, respondent banks that use Ripple with XRP as a bridge currency can save up to 42 percent on costs today and up to 60 percent as XRP gains usage and volatility decreases. To accelerate market thickness and reduce volatility for XRP, Ripple will soon introduce an XRP incentive program to algorithmically rebate market makers who provide liquidity through XRP.\u201d3) Ripple\u2019s Market Cap is FALSEBecause Ripple is withholding a large percentage of its XRP token, limited supply is inauthentic \u2014 it is completely fabricated. This naturally \u201cincreases\u201d demand, which increases the cost \u2014 inflating the market cap.What are your thoughts on Ripple?

The price is $0.25 from last Tuesday and rise to $0.69 on last Friday, an increase of more than 176%. At the time of writing, the price is currently stable at $0.47.According to latest reports and speculations, XRP will turn over three times this year or continue to rise by $3-$5, becoming one of the most investable cryptocurrencies this year. Is this speculation reliable? What is the reason for the recent surge in XRP? Crypto4All will talk about Ripple (XRP) today.Background of Ripple:Founded in 2012, headquartered in San Francisco, USA. Ripple uses blockchain technology to make international financial transactions, providing global financial settlement solutions.In April 2014, Ripple released a white paper, and issued XRP token.Circulation of XRP is 100 billion, liquidity is 39.3%, original issue price = 0.0000001USD, and XRP is only used to pay transaction fees in Ripple network.The Ripple protocol is a blockchain protocol for interbank settlement, that\u2019s why someone called Ripple as SWIFT 2.0.Ripple VS BitcoinIn Common:Through P2P network, XRP can be transferred between wallets like BTC. No third-party is required.The transaction is irreversible, both provide cryptocurrency unique anti-counterfeiting certificate.Multi-signature support.Difference:The Ripple network supports multiple currencies. In addition to its own Ripple currency, it also supports fiat currencies (such as the US dollar, euro, yen, etc.)Ripple is not designed to be mined instead of Bitcoin. Indeed, XRP are premined whereas Bitcoin are mined from time to time to reward miners. .Ripple network is based on an iterative ledger whereas Bitcoin is a Blockchain based network using Proof Of Work consensus model.Bitcoin is decentralized whereas Ripple is centralized. 60% of XRP are owned by Ripple private company, Bitcoin are public.Ripple\u2019s transaction confirmation process can be completed in a matter of seconds. Ripple introduces a \u201cConsensus\u201d mechanism that allows transactions to be verified and validated in a very short time by voting special nodes.The total amount of Ripple coins cannot be increased, and can only be decremented. Each transaction is very, very low, about 1/1000 cents.Two news recognized as affecting this wave of rising pricesNews1: PNCBank, one of the top ten US banks, announced its participation in the RippleNet Global Payments Architecture organization.News2: On September 17, Ripple told the media that xRapid, a commercial application product, may be launched next month, and well-known cross-border transfer companies such as Western Union and MoneyGram have begun trials.What is the specific link between this two news and the rise of XRP?First of all, Ripple has two products: xCurrent and Xrapid.Currently, xCurrent has been used by more than 100 financial institutions around the world for international financial settlement, including banks and financial trading companies. However, using XCurrent does not require XRP tokens. Therefore, banks and institutions do not have to purchase XRP tokens.xRapid is the international financial transaction settlement network that Ripple is preparing to launch recently. xRapid needs to use XRP tokens.RippleNet is a global payment architecture founded by Ripple. Member companies in this organization (eg. MUFG in Japan, Bank of America in the United States and Mizuho Financial Group) can use Ripple\u2019s blockchain technology to complete their cross-border transfer and payment business.Therefore, the reason that really affects the rise of this XRP should be the xRapid product that consumes XRP tokens is about to go online. Although the banks are not on the list of the first products to use xRapid, but based on more than a year, major banks have begun to use xCurrent.It is believed that XRP is worthy of continuous observation and is likely to be a good long-term cryptocurrency. The reasons are as follows:It\u2019s an Down-to-earth application, from xCurrent to xRapid, and xViaProduct performance has certain advantages over existing foreign exchange systemsTo date, more than 100 financial institutions have used Ripple blockchain technology, and the customer base is expandingThe total amount of XRP tokens will not increase, but will decrease due to consumptionThe Ripple team has decades of experience in the areas of technology, financial services and regulatory complianceCheck also our previous blogs:Is the decentralized dividend model a future and promising trend ?Can Bitcoin cash surpass Bitcoin\uff1fAre stablecoins a new revolution for the crypto industry?For Crypto Rookies \u2014 What is cryptocurrency exchange?The 3 Challenges Bitcoin Mining Are Facing With In 2018Before you go\u2026If you liked this story, feel free to \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f a few times, so other people can enjoy it as well.

I have meetings set up to help others with social media, and other \u2018small\u2019 tasks that may or may not be financially fulfilling.But in the thick of things, there\u2019s this voice that hits me hard:Why are you doing this? What\u2019s the point?For the last few months, it\u2019s been a very distinct why:Why do you write?Some time ago, I wrote about this.

A mention on a list of people to be grateful for.A connection.A human connection.All it took was one person \u2014 miles away \u2014 telling something true, honest, real. Something about me I couldn\u2019t think about.A simple comment, jarring me from the darkness of self-doubt and self-defeat.It might be possible that they might have nothing to do with my return. I acknowledge that. A human mind is a \u2026interesting place.Reasons are myriad for nearly every single action we undertake.However, I remember feeling like a part of more. I remember feeling that someone cared enough to take a few seconds and hold the thought of me in their mind.For one ephemeral moment, they sent feelings of gratitude and belonging my way. I believe that\u2019s what happened.Can I prove it? Probably not. Do I care?You know the answer to that.I will make sure to pass this on to the people offline and online. The people whose issues I have no clue about. People who smile with hardship and try their best to stay up when the whys get too loud.We will all die one day. I think the journey can be somewhat easier with kindness.If you don\u2019t know where to start, look around you. Say something honest, uplifting and true to the person next to you.And if there\u2019s no one, just leave a \u2018comment\u2019 whenever you can.You have no idea how far you can anchor someone with this.

Ripple (XRP) is distinguished from other things which share the same name by a qualifier such as \u201cRipple platform\u201d or \u201cRipple company\u201d. Ledger refers to the overall state of the system which is typically computed from but does not include the transaction history, analogous to Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO set.IntroductionHere I analyze how fit the Ripple (XRP) is to serve as a supranational electronic currency on the Ripple platform. This is assuming that the SEC does not declare Ripple (XRP) a security, banks actually use Ripple (XRP) on the Ripple platform, people actually also use Ripple (XRP) as an electronic currency, and Ripple (XRP) captures most of the economic value on the Ripple platform. The conclusion is that the Ripple platform is peacetime, low-stakes financial software not fit to serve as critical infrastructure of any kind. The issue at hand is that the Ripple platform works poorly in adversarial environments, and preventing a major attack vector compromises the benefits of decentralization entirely.Why the focus on Ripple (XRP) as a supranational currency?It\u2019s pretty widely acknowledged that Ripple\u2019s official strategy is adoption in the banking sector as a bridge asset. For banks to actually use Ripple, it needs a huge amount of liquidity, and that liquidity can\u2019t come from the banks.Need for constant liquidity: This is because slippage makes the price of traded assets (such as the bridge asset) extremely volatile at the moment of exchange especially if fulfilling multiple orders. Liquidity decreases slippage, and it also decreases price volatility when holding.This liquidity cannot come from banks: If it did, banks would be better off with a token they created, which would allow them to own 100% of the supply as well.So who supports Ripple\u2019s price, thereby creating that liquidity? The only way forward that I can see is if Ripple works as a general purpose cryptocurrency. This is not a particularly bad direction given that Ripple\u2019s market cap is currently about $19B, which is to say there is probably some real liquidity. For reasons that may or may not have to do with classification as a security, this happens to be how Ripple (XRP) is marketed now. And since we\u2019re talking about liquidity that can support the bulk of the world\u2019s banking, it needs to be a really, really successful cryptocurrency. With that in mind, the focus is on Ripple as a supranational currency.Some requirements for a global electronic currencyThis list is not exhaustive but we will find that these aspects are relevant to the discussion.FungibleThis means that units of money are indistinguishable. Fungability allows anyone to receive a payment and not concern themselves with whether others will discriminate against those tokens. If the true value of cash is not its nominal value, it increases mental transaction costs, adds considerable friction to end-users, and is ultimately less useful as a currency.Trust-minimizationTwo people who distrust each other must be able to engage in commerce.Censorship-resistantThis means that it is difficult to any entity to exclude transactions from being confirmed. This is analogous to freezing funds or preventing those funds from being used in certain ways.Resistant to theft or burningUser balances should be treated like property rights since tokens are a bearer asset. The owner(s) alone should have control over their funds.Difficult to counterfeitCounterfeit money dilutes the relative purchasing power of everyone else who has stake in this system. For cryptocurrencies, creating tokens outside of the protocol is considered counterfeiting.One set of account balancesThere must be one set of account balances that is shared by everyone. People who are mutually distrustful must be able to engage in commerce on the same ledger.ScalableAs the number of users grow and the value of the tokens appreciate, the system must be able to retain its core properties and function.Graceful failure modesIf the security assumptions for consensus are no longer true, what happens? When an attack becomes possible, how expensive is it to make arbitrary changes?Ripple platform\u2019s failure modesHow the Ripple ledger or consensus can be disrupted largely comes down to the behavior of trusted peers. As the Ripple company mentions, the system depends on these validators not colluding.During consensus, each node evaluates proposals from a specific set of peers, called chosen validators 6. Chosen validators represent a subset of the network which, when taken collectively, is \u201ctrusted\u201d not to collude in an attempt to defraud the node evaluating the proposals. [source]Denial of service (DOS)With >20% of trusted validators disagree, service can be halted. Consensus requires that at least 80% of trusted validators agree. From the Ripple company whitepaper:Thus for a UNL of n nodes in the network, the consensus protocol will maintain correctness so long as: f \u2264 (n\u22121)/5 (1) where f is the number Byzantine failures. In fact, even in the face of (n\u22121)/5+1 Byzantine failures, correctness is still technically maintained. The consensus process will fail\u2026 [source]Consensus failing means that no transactions can be confirmed, making the system unusable. This does actually require that validators collude, as an attacker can knock validators offline with the same effect (unresponsiveness is considered a Byzantine failure).Rewriting state permanently \u2014 excluding or reordering historical transactionsNodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a supermajority of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash 8. Going forward, transactions are applied to this updated and now validated ledger with sequence number N+1.In cases where a node is in the minority, having computed a ledger that differs from its peers, the node disregards the ledger it computed 9. It recomputes the correct ledger, or retrieves the correct ledger as needed.If >80% of trusted validators collude, transaction history can be permanently reordered without violating consensus rules. With the Ripple platform, transaction history is relative. It\u2019s whatever your peers say it is. Much like Ethereum technically didn\u2019t violate consensus rules from the DAO incident, nobody is violating the Ripple platform\u2019s protocol by re-constructing a new ledger from existing transactions. And fully validating the ledger against all transaction history will not protect you.Rewriting state arbitrarily\u2014 violating consensus rulesIf >80% of trusted validators collude, they can break consensus rules, and these changes will be accepted by anyone who does not validate their history against this new ledger. This means they can mint funds, burn funds, and steal funds without any transactions needing to take place. This attack is only made possible against those who don\u2019t fully validate transaction history, which makes it extremely important that you only trust validators on the Ripple network who do full validation.Scaling implications \u2014 critical infrastructureHere we assume that the Ripple platform is too big to fail, meaning preventing Ripple platform\u2019s failure modes is a top national priority. The primary threat model are foreign, coordinating countries disrupting consensus.Trust concentration \u2014 DOS protectionRealistically the only ledger state that matters is among the people you do business with. There is no benefit to trusting people who are not within your economic confines because in the event of a dispute, only the ledger of your economy matters (not somebody halfway across the world). That is to say, trusting too many other validators could cause you to be forked out of your own economy. The larger the Ripple platform\u2019s contribution to the economy, the riskier a denial of service (DOS) attack becomes.At the right scale the security of the Ripple platform within national infrastructure come into question as an issue of national security. Trusting a node is not just a statement about their ledger but also about their ability to resist distributed denial of service attacks which could take them offline. Government efforts would be directed towards mitigating these failure modes. We can expect that government will run their own secure validators in their country, which would be considered authoritative for the uses of domestic banking. Governments would almost certainly mandate that no more than 20% of trust for domestic banks be directed towards validators not under government control to prevent this attack vector.Since validators can sometimes be offline for reasons unrelated to an attack, in practice banks might weight 85+% of their trust domestically.Trust concentration to comply with lawRunning a validating node may expose the operator to legal risk. During consensus, nodes vote on which transactions they wish to confirm, and we can expect there to be restrictions on this vote can be exercised if this ledger controls the flow of serious money. It is entirely possible that validators which participate in consensus must register as financial service providers and comply with applicable regulation, regardless of who trusts them or not.At the right scale, the Ripple platform has geopolitical implications. We can reasonably expect the US government to require that validators contributing to consensus within their jurisdictions comply with international sanctions or law enforcement requests. The same holds true for every other jurisdiction. I see a few paths here:Delegate the entirety of your trust to domestic banks or government validators, which will only propagate legal transactions. This is fairly low maintenance.Use software which acts as a filter for transactions which may not be legal. This is higher maintenance as the determination of legal and suspicious transactions may be complex and constantly changing. I see this as out-of-reach for individuals who do not have a business reason for this.Do not participate in consensus, which means your validator is a tracking node.It would be trivial for law enforcement to enforce any policies that relate to consensus as they can connect to validators and view this data in real time. While the way I described how this could play out isn\u2019t guaranteed, it is clearly within the reach of government to do things this way as the actual number of validators is fairly small, within 200 as of recently. For comparison, Bitcoin has about 10,000 listening nodes as of now which support the network.Governments can alter domestic ledgersEarlier I discussed how <20% of trust will be weighted to validators outside of government control to prevent DOS attacks on domestic infrastructure. As it were, this means that government can control >80% of the weighted trust which is the necessary minimum to rewrite state and even violate consensus rules.Government and law enforcement will have an interest in censoring transactions, freezing accounts, and possibly even inflating the supply as a source of revenue. This would be true even if they didn\u2019t control a supermajority of trust domestically, but in this case they happen to. Governments will change the ledger as much as they can get away with, and that state will propagate to all ledgers who transitively trust them.Ledger fragmentationWhile many people may not directly trust government validators, they have no choice but to trust those they do business with. For most people they will trust businesses, retail banks, and friends. Businesses will trust major business partners, and their banks. Banks will trust their government. Government trusts themselves.Due to the pattern of trust concentration, changes to the ledger within a jurisdiction\u2019s nodes will propagate locally but won\u2019t propagate to other hubs of trust (e.g. other jurisdictions). So each country will have their own separate ledger, and the differences between ledgers will increase over time.This presents a large problem for anyone who must do international business in this low-trust environment. Ironically, Ripple (XRP) was meant for international settlements, but as we can see this does not work well across separate hubs of trust and what separates those hubs are national borders.No such thing as a global ledgerProvided that national infrastructure protects against DOS attacks, any kind of transaction censorship within a hub will fragment the ledger permanently.It\u2019s possible that we can get around this by partitioning the address space into separate countries, each of which make the determination of which transactions are permissible, but this incompatible with the protocol as it exists. It\u2019s possible we can get around this by having each country issue their own tokens, but countries will still want to censor Ripple (XRP) as it pertains to sanctions or criminal investigations, so we are back to our original problem.Practically speaking, there is no way we can get around this as it\u2019s not what the Ripple platform was designed to handle. Ripple platform was meant to work only within hubs of trust, not across separate, mutually distrustful hubs.Once a ledger fragments, there is no general way to reconcile it without dropping the transaction history altogether. We can expect that the Ripple ledger and assets would be an asset denoted by its national confines. Such as XRP-US, XRP-China, XRP-Russia. The same private key would have different economic values in different jurisdictions due to inflation of the supply, government stability, etc. Cross-border exchange would be difficult.No use for a counterparty-less assetThe token Ripple (XRP) draws its main benefit from being an asset without a counterparty. With a fragmented ledger, each fork controlled by some government, there is no additional benefit of XRP over fiat.Scaling implications \u2014 non-critical infrastructureWhile not the focus of this article, I think it\u2019s helpful to go over how the Ripple platform would function as non-critical infrastructure, because it still has some pretty significant limitations. Here we assume the Ripple platform is not related to national security, so the threat model becomes any single jurisdiction disrupting consensus, including friendly ones. Domestic banking would not take place on the Ripple ledger.Trust dissipation \u2014 DOS protectionMaintaining a single global ledger requires that we not delegate trust at more than 20% to any single group which might be likely to collude. Since collusion is most likely within national borders we must be sure not to not trust any single nation at more than 20%. This means that >80% of our trust must be to jurisdictions outside of our own.Coordinating governments can censor transactions, freeze accounts, or stop the networkGovernments are known to coordinate with each other for political purposes. Crossing the 20% line for global trust will come down to at most 39 countries (which would be an equal allocation of trust to each jurisdiction). Taking a look at intergovernmental organizations is pretty clear evidence that this level of cooperation is possible. While you may not assign trust to a government, everyone is beholden to their governments and must follow their laws. This is to say that governments ultimately have control over how their validators will behave.Intergovernmental cooperation is common. For example, NATO has 29 member states. The United Nations has 193 member states. The European Union has 28 member states. The International Monetary Fund has 189 members. The European Central Bank has 19 EU member states. Interpol has 192 member countries. The World Trade Organization has 164 member states. Only one or two large intergovernmental organizations need to cooperate to halt consensus.To be realistic, sovereignty isn\u2019t distributed equally among the 193 countries in existence. Some countries have extensive ability to exert influence or project power on global scale, and they are referred to as potential superpowers. The most commonly mentioned ones are United States, European Union, China, India, Russia, and Brazil. This is to say there is not a whole lot of benefit to delegating trust outside of these potential superpowers, as they ultimately will have power over the smaller, less powerful countries. One or two of these major powers coordinating could halt consensus.Coordinating governments could counterfeit Ripple at the right priceIf the Ripple markets were large and robust enough, it would be within the interests of all governments to come together and mint Ripple. In this way they would treat the Ripple network as their own central bank at the right price. While governments can easily print more fiat, inflating the supply of Ripple could give them an easy way of generating money without it affecting the exchange rate of their fiat.Since each country must balance minting money and destabilizing their local currency, minting Ripple would be a much more attractive proposition because they are unlikely to face the negative externalities in the same way. I am guessing the motive would be there when the average nation would stand to gain $100 million, which be about $20 billion inflation worldwide.A low-trust environment can cause ledger fragmentationIf there is an international incident, such as a cold or hot war, we can expect that the highly connected web of trust globally will partition. The cold war was a 45 year period of geopolitical tension between at least two world superpowers. Trust must be distributed widely for there to be a single ledger, and low-trust environment can encourage people to delegate trust in such a way that prioritizes the security of their local network. This creates hubs of trust which won\u2019t allow fragmented ledgers to reconcile across the hubs.Less overall demand for Ripple assetsThere is little reason to hold assets on a platform outside of what is necessary to fulfill a task. Keeping more money than necessary on the platform is, if anything, a decision of convenience regarding the expected near-term future use of the platform\u2019s services. Since we\u2019re assuming the Ripple platform does not facilitate much of the world\u2019s commerce, we can expect less demand for Ripple assets.Returning to those requirements for global electronic currencyThere are two scenarios to consider: Ripple platform as critical and non-critical infrastructure.Fungible1/5 \u2014 Critical infrastructure: The ledger will fragment as governments have the interest and ability to make arbitrary changes to the ledger which will propagate within national borders according to the protocol. Ripple assets are not guaranteed to have the same nominal value or even relative purchasing power across borders. That government can easily freeze or confiscate funds makes dirty coins or coins without a provably clean history even more risky to accept.3/5 \u2014 Non-critical infrastructure: Provided there are no periods of international tension, there will likely be a single ledger that won\u2019t be tampered. This is to say that the tokens will have the same nominal value and relative purchasing power across jurisdictions.Trust-minimizationTwo people who don\u2019t trust each other can engage in commerce only when they share the same hub of trust. Specifically, 80% of each person\u2019s trusted validator set must overlap if they wish to engage in commerce without service interruptions and >50% overlap is required to ensure they are guaranteed to use the same ledger. There is no way to verify that your trusted validator set overlaps with someone you are engaging in commerce with as UNLs are private.1/5 \u2014 Critical infrastructure: Same level of trust as fiat (everyone trusts their govt).2/5 \u2014 Non-critical infrastructure: Less trust required than fiat but two mutually distrustful people trust the same collection of entities, akin to a consortium. There is no good way to verify that there is sufficient trust overlap.Censorship-resistant1/5 \u2014 Critical infrastructure: Since >20% of trust is given to government either directly or transitively so transactions can be prevented and funds effectively frozen. Governments can also require all other domestic validators to adhere to blacklists or whitelists.1/5 \u2014 Non-critical infrastructure: Cooperating governments can easily halt consensus and prevent the movement of funds.Resistant to theft or burning1/5 \u2014 Critical infrastructure: Governments will have >80% of weighted trust which allows them to make arbitrary ledger changes including inflating the overall supply.3/5 \u2014 Non-critical infrastructure: Funds are unlikely to be stolen since it requires large-scale intergovernmental cooperation. However, the indefinite freezing of funds is logically equivalent to funds being burned, and this requires a level of cooperation within reach (>20% of weighted trust).Difficult to counterfeit1/5 \u2014 Critical infrastructure: Governments will have >80% of weighted trust which allows them to make arbitrary ledger changes including inflating the overall supply.2/5 \u2014 Non-critical infrastructure: If the Ripple markets were large and robust enough, governments could easily come together to counterfeit Ripple as they control validators within their jurisdictions. Such an act would be mutually beneficial to all governments and could occur if the markets could support $20 billion inflation.One set of account balances1/5 \u2014 Critical infrastructure: The ledger is very likely to fragment across mutually distrustful hubs of trust. The level of fragmentation is likely to be somewhere between the number of global superpowers to the number of separate countries. Mutually distrustful people who don\u2019t share the same hub of trust cannot engage in commerce on the same ledger.3/5 \u2014 Non-critical infrastructure: One ledger, provided no periods of international tension. If there is a cold or hot war, the ledger is likely to fragment.ScalableThe Ripple platform scales extremely poorly when it comes to censorship-resistance. Regarding counterfeiting, the platform scales well up until the point where it\u2019s worth the cooperation of governments to treat the platform as a central bank. Regarding fragmentation, the platform only works in peacetime environments, but scales well until the point where it becomes too big to fail.Graceful failure modesThe failure modes are extremely bad and once those security assumptions are no longer true, attacks are free beyond this point. With full validation, the transaction history can be re-ordered in any way, causing transactions to disappear or appear in an inconsistent order. Without validation, the ledger can be changed in arbitrary ways that violate the protocol such as inflating the supply, altering balances, and burning money.ConclusionRipple platform is peacetime, low-stakes financial software for groups who trust the same entities. There is no way to fully protect against denial of service attacks without giving some group the power to make arbitrary changes to the ledger at no cost. As a global currency, Ripple would not survive a cold war without severe fragmentation. During a hot war, Ripple would fail entirely.As a supranational currency, Ripple (XRP) provides no advantages over fiat. If Ripple platform becomes too big to fail then DOS attacks would be prevented by delegating >80% of trust to government, which gives them complete control of the ledger within their borders. This means Ripple assets fragment for each national government. Since governments have the desire and opportunity to freeze funds, censor transactions, and inflate the supply, we can expect them to do just that. Cross border, Ripple is not guaranteed to have the same nominal value or relative purchasing power.As a supranational currency it\u2019s important to have a single set of account balances, something strongly resistant to government control, and something which can survive adversarial environments.

Some altcoins are also giving huge returns as well. Bitcoin has peaked at a value of around $20,000 and currently trades for less than that.

It is hugely popular among bank as it makes huge money transactions between nations a lot easier, and accounts for billions of dollars being transferred every day. Ripple believes that XRP can be used as fiat currency between nations which means that a person says, in the USA converts US dollars to XRP and sends them to India where the receiver converts the XRP into rupeesShould you buy Ripple?Ripple has been gaining a lot of popularity in 2018. But if it fails in gaining further acceptance in the cryptoasset industry, it would severely impact ripple\u2019s reputation in the crypto market.Cryptoassets are already changing the world, helping the entrepreneurs create disruptive products, and raising funds from them via ICOs.As the crypto market becomes more popular, the value of Ripple will also balloon. Apart from being cheaper (and therefore gaining a psychological advantage), it also has chances to provide a higher return (nearly 5.5 times) compared to the bitcoins (1.5 times), according to analysts.As the cryptoasset market grows, investors may want to focus on XRP and other such options. The huge size of Ripple\u2019s market (and its institutional backing) is a clear sign of the potential of it has of becoming one of the most valuable cryptoassets in the future. Its partnerships with the industry leaders not only establishes the legitimacy but also help in its wide acceptance as well.Many cryptoasset watchers have become obsessed market capitalization which refers to the amount of virtual currency going around.

With our leading payment technology platform for processing cashless business transactions and our exclusive distribution channel, member businesses utilize our digital currency \u201dITEX dollars\u201d to exchange goods and services, rather than use cash. ITEX Corporation is based in Bellevue, Washington.\u201dFrom the filingThe emergence of \u201cvirtual currencies\u201d could result in competitive trading platforms which may reduce transaction volume and revenuesVirtual or digital currencies are receiving increasing interest from investors, businesses and governments. Examples include private virtual currency or payment systems such as BitCoin, Ripple, and Litecoin. As peer-to-peer currencies, they rely on a system of mutual trust and do not rely on a central bank, a third party or other intermediary to effect transactions or act as guarantor in the event the currency collapses. They do not have the status of legal tender. However, increased popularity or government acceptance of virtual currencies could encourage competitors to utilize virtual currencies or the exchange of online credits for goods and services. Our potential competitors could enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and access to capital, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives. If other virtual currencies gain widespread merchant acceptance, to the extent that we cannot compete effectively, it may adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.The emergence of increased regulation related to virtual currencies could increase our costs by requiring us to update our products and services; or subject us to operational requirements that result in substantial compliance costs which would adversely affect our businessThe increased attention to virtual currencies could result in changes in federal or state regulations or the adoption of new regulations that could affect us as well as many companies transacting in credits that might be called \u201cvirtual currency.\u201d For example, the Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d), as amended, established anti-money laundering related recordkeeping and reporting requirements for financial institutions and was designed to provide evidence useful in prosecuting money laundering and other financial crimes. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury, as the delegated administrator of the BSA issued interpretive guidance in March 2013 to clarify the applicability of regulations to persons creating, obtaining, distributing, exchanging, accepting, or transmitting virtual currencies. Although we do not believe we are currently subject to the BSA requirements, that could change with new regulation. Registering with FinCEN and complying with FinCEN\u2019s regulations would be burdensome, as would getting licensed as a money transmitter and complying with the money transmission regulatory regimes in each state (plus the District of Columbia). Changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations relating to the use of virtual currencies could require us to incur significant costs to update our products and services, significantly increase our compliance costs or may impose conditions that we are unable to meet. This could make our business cost-prohibitive in the affected state or states and could materially adversely affect our business.SOURCE: http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/131213/ITEX-CORP_10-Q/Here is the Business Description from Yahoo!

In fact, the attack as I see it is well underway.And it began with the attack on the credibility of Bitcoin Cash and it\u2019s continuing with the insane pump of Ripple and any coin which has direct ties to old money. What I want to posit today is how the next crash in the cryptocurrency markets can, and likely will, play out.To lay this out you have to believe a few things are true.The major money center banks have all been trading Bitcoin and other alt-coins for a long time. They have substantial books to push and pull the price.The futures market is used to control the price during daytime hours in the U.S. and Europe.Bitcoin\u2019s failure to implement \u2018Segwit 2x\u2019 and its current dysfunction was intentional in order for Blockstream to offer a \u2018solution\u2019 to a \u2018problem\u2019 that needn\u2019t have existed.Lightning Network is simply a backup control plan in case Ripple isn\u2019t adopted by the marketplace as the crypto-settlement and exchange layer. It creates a second layer of centralization off-chain.Legislation and regulation to date has been designed to allow money to flow into the crypto-markets but not back out again.Ripple, otherwise known as \u2018BanksterCoin\u2019 among we crypto-enthusiasts is the stalking horse of the cryptocurrency industry. It\u2019s meteoric rise in price coincides with Bitcoin\u2019s peak and subsequent meandering. It was done, timing-wise, to see articles like these (here, here and here) written as we ring in the new year.The Bitcoin TrapLook at the situation in Bitcoin. After the failure to implement the New York Agreement, something that didn\u2019t have to be an all-or-nothing proposition, Bitcoin spiked from $5000 to a high near $20,000 in less than a month. Transaction fees soared, exchanges became illiquid, getting alt-coins off some exchanges was difficult as many were revealed (at least in the short term) to not have supply of the underlying assets people were \u2018trading\u2019 in their pools.Services like Changelly and Shapeshift have much smaller lists of coins available for easy exchange than they did a month ago. Try buying tokens like WAVES, STEEM, Golem, NEO or Komodo on these services. You can\u2019t. They can\u2019t source actual tokens or the gateways to exchange them are down.The best way to kill a market is to get retail investors buying the peak and selling into it. Such is the stuff bear markets are made of. It\u2019s imperative to break retail investor sentiment down. That\u2019s how markets are brought to heel. Then rotating out of that market into the next market you want to promote. This is what the banking industry does with its sell-side \u2018analysis\u2019 all the time.I have a rule, when Goldman-Sachs says \u201cBuy\u201d I sell and vice versa. In my Universe, rightly or wrongly, Goldman and their ilk are still trading against its recommendations and its clients. And if it\u2019s not allowed to do so anymore *wink* *wink* because of Dodd-Frank then in the unregulated crypto-markets you should bet that they, J.P. Morgan and the rest of them are.So, it\u2019s easy to believe in an irrational pump of Bitcoin to $20,000 and the subsequent rotation out and into Ripple, boosting its price and profile, while leaving \u2018teh newbz\u2019 hanging at the top. Add in Bitcoin futures trading to help the tail wag the dog, insane transaction fees that have everyone wondering what\u2019s so great about this Bitcoin if it costs $30 to move $100 and you have a set-up for carnage.The spike to $20,000, in my opinion, was created by the very hinckey roll-out of rival Bitcoin Cash by Coinbase last month. The goal there was to sow confusion and undermine Bitcoin Cash as an alternative to Bitcoin. Again, if you want control over the entire market, you do so by killing off real competition.See, folks, all of this confusion and carnage comes from not having any kind of centralized control. But, hey, there\u2019s this new cool thing called Ripple which solves all of that and the price is going bonkers!Trap Set.To Ethereum and BeyondThat\u2019s the past. That\u2019s where we are as we enter 2018. Now what?In response to this, Ethereum begins another push towards $1000. Now, Ethereum has its own problems that are technology-based. Ultimately, its blockchain is only as secure as the code of the tokens issued on it.We\u2019ve seen this in reality a couple of times, including the hack because of bad code that forced a fork of the Etherum blockchain which created Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Ethereum (ETH).While I fully believe that one (or many) of these Ethereum-based projects is likely to create another event like that one, the pure cynic in me says, \u201cWhy wait?\u201dIf you were the bad guys wouldn\u2019t that be your plan in the first place? Create a crypto-project using ERC-20 tokens that resolve and clear on the Ethereum blockchain with the intention of breaking it. Invite investor money in, say fifty million dollars. A reasonable, but not insane amount of money.Then let the code run until such time that it will cause maximal damage to Ethereum and the whole crypto-community. The token goes up four or five times because that\u2019s simply what is happening across the space.At that point you\u2019ve created a $200+ million meltdown and negative headlines galore.At this point Bitcoin is neutralized and controlled, Ethereum is discredited and something like that would cause a major panic which is exploited by the same prop trading desks that blew the bubble up in the first place.If you time that with a spike in Ripple, the banker-acceptable coin, and crash it too, you\u2019ll take down most of the industry in almost no time. The psychological damage from a scenario like this will create bear market not unlike the one created post Dot-Com bubble.And like that bust, only those companies that are willing to play ball with Wall St. and Washington D.C. will be promoted and allowed to thrive.Trap Sprung.If you don\u2019t think Wall St. isn\u2019t thinking in these terms then you aren\u2019t a serious crypto-investor. This is the nightmare scenario, or one like it.The Slipstream SolutionThis is why I continue to bang on about the need for decentralized exchanges where the kind of manipulation described above is harder, if not impossible, to pull off. I fundamentally do not believe most of the \u2018liquidity\u2019 that exists on exchanges like HitBTC, Bittrex, GDAX, etc. exists.Between the false liquidity created by Tether and the potential for running fractional reserves it\u2019s not hard to posit. It doesn\u2019t take the weight of the entire Bitcoin market to raise the price. It just takes one guy willing to buy the ask. Once sellers lift their offers in response to a wave of buying things go up quick, especially with programmatic, algo-driven trading.These exchanges who are not holding all deposits as smart contracts off-exchange with 100%+ reserves like BitShares are vulnerable to major price rises creating liquidity problems, which only adds to the perception that the industry is amateur-hour.Another solution aside from Bitshares is Komodo\u2019s BarterDEX, which exclusively trades through cross-chain atomic swaps and has no need for a third party intermediary. Both of these, to me, represent where the industry needs to go to avoid us ending up with Ripple and Goldman still running the show.Remember, no one is operating BitShares\u2019 exchange. It\u2019s completely blockchain-based. It has a fully-tradeable profit-token, OBITS, which distributes monthly profits from the exchange back to the token holders (current yield is around 4%). There is no central pool of liquidity that requires ever-growing ties to credit-providers. The network only manages assets that have been deposited onto it.Projects like AriseBank (full disclosure I bought into its ICO), I think, deserve a look. AriseBank partnered with BitShares to provide the back-end technology to facilitate currency-swaps and brokerage services. This is billing itself as the world\u2019s first truly decentralized bank, designed to compete directly with the major banks and provide a new business model for banking altogether.So, as 2018 plays out we as traders and investors need to be aware of the dangers of centralized liquidity and move our liquidity off of them, supporting projects that will build the kind of infrastructure Bitcoin\u2019s initial design was supposed to support.So many people who have gotten into cryptocurrencies in 2017 will not have an exit strategy in 2018 when the fan gets hit. As we saw in the peak in December getting your money into or off of Coinbase was a nightmare.Viewing the market structure through this lens provides a way to siphon off some of the energy the banks are propelling cryptos with to not only fatten your wallets but bring validity and stability to the markets and businesses that will carry on the fight before it\u2019s yet another case of \u201cMeet the new boss, same as the old boss.\u201dFor more background look at these articles:https://tomluongo.me/2017/12/23/was-coinbases-bitcoin-cash-rollout-a-designed-hit/https://tomluongo.me/2017/12/04/bitcoin-futures-and-the-need-for-control/https://tomluongo.me/2017/11/16/the-foundation-of-the-next-cryptocurrency-bull-market/and my archive at Crypto News: https://www.crypto-news.net/author/tom-luongo/", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Finance", "Bitcoin", "Economics"]}, {"title": "Ripple\u2019s $XRP is a Steward for Real Change", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@georgedyjr/ripples-xrp-is-a-steward-for-real-change-3e6c7e8d16f?source=search_post", "author_name": "George Dy, Jr.", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@georgedyjr", "publish_date": "2018-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-08", "readtime": "3.32", "claps": 40, "voters": 7, "content": "Photo by Max Ostrozhinskiy on UnsplashRipple\u2019s $XRP is a Steward for Real ChangeThe Behavioral Studies Case for $XRP, Why Partially-Centralized Protocols Are HelpingGeorge Dy, Jr.FollowMar 22, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readI feel dirty just writing about Ripple. It\u2019s a symptom of how the crypto-community can make you feel \u2014 forced to take a binary stance on a topic that is so new to the world that it seems impossible to take a side. Just jump on Twitter these days and you can feel the uncomfortable hum of so-called cryptocurrency experts and decentralization evangelists arguing an opinion as fact, more often diminishing projects than supporting one.Deconstructing the centralized \u2018shitcoin\u2019Dubbed \u2018a centralized shitcoin\u2019 by many in the crypto-community, the popular opinion is rather one-sided in opposition to Ripple\u2019s XRP. However, regardless what any pundit may say, XRP still holds the 3rd largest market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies for a reason. People tend to fixate on its lack of decentralization. They point to its marked decision to pick a trust algorithm that puts major decisions into the hands of its creators, not solely the technology and the holders.XRP is built on a trust algorithm that hand selects nodes in a rather centralized process, allowing it to control the speed and cost of transactions on their blockchain to the benefit of their end customers \u2014 financial institutions. This technological decision is not only a strategic advantage, but a necessity when working with big banks and financial services. These organizations are notably averse to volatility, especially when it impacts their core responsibilities.It is this centralization and cooperation with big banks that earn XRP the \u2018shitcoin\u2019 misnomer. But I believe their decision to centralize the stack will allow XRP to succeed in converting a growing audience of cryptocurrency Early Adopters and Early Majority.XRP is a mental bridge for the masses, marketed by traditional financeRipple\u2019s technology addresses and solves an immediate problem in financial technology today. Their technology is a proven means to transfer funds quickly, efficiently, and securely. As a side effect, its position builds mental parallels between traditional financial institutions and \u201cfuturistic\u201d cryptocurrencies \u2014 improving sentiment and increasing visibility of a decentralized digital future.Ripple\u2019s continued expansion into partnerships with central banks and major financial institutions like Moneygram and Western Union works to placate the fears of people that are wary of digital currencies as a whole. Partnerships with central banks further make the case for widespread adoption among banks. Deeper integration presents potentially-marketable service offerings, perhaps even the ability to convert fiat for crypto at physical locations. These partnerships act as a litmus test for the masses, enabling mainstream consumers to approach cryptocurrencies with less hesitation.Simply put, Cryptocurrency (with a capital \u2018C\u2019) stands a better chance to create supporters by providing comfort in something familiar. So, the greater the brand of the financial partner, the stronger the impact on consumers. With steady growth and usage by trusted financial organizations, we may be best served in the long run by accepting Ripple\u2019s ties as a necessary sacrifice for rapid mainstream consumer adoption of digital currencies as a whole.Unified by a shared goal, a future secured by the blockchainI\u2019m not ignoring the fact that this sounds like an endorsement for banks to take advantage of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain to their financial advantage. But the truth is, if a bank decided it wanted to build its own blockchain, there\u2019s nothing stopping it from doing so. In fact, I would be surprised if forward-thinking banks like Capital One weren\u2019t already developing one.If we of the Early Adopter crypto demographic truly believe that blockchain is the evolution of money, then our future will greatly benefit from any thoughtful development in the space. We should have faith in the foundations of decentralization baked into the technology and encourage mass adoption and experimentation.Adoption is gradual. It doesn\u2019t happen in the revolutionary style most crypto-purists portray. Alas, Twitter will be Twitter and forums will be forums. Crypto communities will continue to exist, endorsing some coins, and diminishing others. But chatter, too, is productive.To be better stewards of the blockchain revolution, people need to unify behind strong, meaningful blockchain technologies. It brings us leaps and bounds closer to a future where cryptocurrencies and blockchains are embedded in our daily transactions and interactions.Closing NoteAlthough I hold a position in XRP (as I do with many other alternative coins), I\u2019m a proponent of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain as a whole. I believe that the growth and success of projects like Ripple create a meaningful and positive impact on the progression of decentralized technologies.As with any new technology, people are resistive. But, with time, familiarity breeds comfortability. And while it may be difficult to equally appease all parties in the ecosystem, every ounce of work \u2014 whether technical, regulatory, financial, or otherwise \u2014 helps to move the needle toward mainstream adoption and a more secure financial future backed by trust-less technologies.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Blockchain", "Finance", "Regulation", "Ripple"]}, {"title": "Poorly executed innovations have ripple effects throughout an industry", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@jayparkinson/poorly-executed-innovations-have-ripple-effects-throughout-an-industry-bf01e7092280?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jay Parkinson, MD, MPH", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jayparkinson", "publish_date": "2017-11-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-15", "readtime": "1.72", "claps": 65, "voters": 7, "content": "Poorly executed innovations have ripple effects throughout an industryJay Parkinson, MD, MPHFollowNov 15, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readIf someone has a terrible experience with something new, they\u2019ll be an outspoken hater. And this can flavor an entire category of innovation.For example, if someone uses Teladoc or Doctor on Demand for anything other than the ~30 simple issues they can treat, and they waste $79 on trying something new, they\u2019ll probably begin believing that an online doctor can\u2019t really do much for them. Then, next time, they\u2019ll probably just visit an old-fashioned urgent care center because, while expensive and annoying, it\u2019s tried and true and they know what they\u2019re going to get.Healthcare is plagued by wonky \u201cinnovations\u201d that don\u2019t delight users and work as promised:Price transparency toolsVideo visits with random, unknown doctorsAnything wellnessActivity trackersPill-shaming digital pillsMedication remindersAI for cancerTheranosPsychotherapy chatbotsHealthcare AlexaThe list goes on and on. Healthcare\u2019s hard. It can\u2019t really be automated and it\u2019s almost impossible to build a real revenue-generating healthcare innovation. An app to remind you to take your medication will soon start feeling like a frustrating nag. So you turn off the notifications. You can try and find the price of some procedure and feel empowered that you know the cost of a medical procedure only to get a bill a few weeks later for 3 times the cost of what you expected. And you have no recourse. You\u2019re feeling down so you fire up some new therapy chatbot which makes you realize that the reason why you chose a human therapist last time was because you felt that human actually cared about you.Raising the bar for innovation usefulness in healthcare will help all healthcare innovators. I\u2019m often critical of new innovations in healthcare mostly because I care so damn much. After 10 years of banging my head against the wall, I still have faith in us. I still have faith that someday, with plenty of blood, sweat, and tears, we\u2019ll create something far better than what exists today. I know how difficult creating something great is because I live this everyday with Sherpaa. And I\u2019m also aware of the minimum viable product concept and how you should be embarrassed by your initial releases just so you can get something out there and see how it works.Just keep in mind that innovation is an ecosystem and poor user experiences influence us all. Healthcare has to step up its game. I beg you. Don\u2019t create things just because you can. Don\u2019t create things without asking a single patient if that\u2019s what they want.

XRPJPY will be less bogged down this week by the somewhat overbought conditions slowing BTCUSD\u2019s torrid advance, and has stronger momentum heading into this week. With massive gains on Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD) these last few months, a rotation will continue into other top coins that have yet to see an explosion upwards, with XRPJPY a likely beneficiary from a rising tide lifting all boats. Significantly, XRPJPY has comfortably consolidated above descending triangle resistance (on the daily chart), and appears readying to resume its rally higher.Industry FundamentalsFacebook is accelerating its discussions with regulators, the largest US crypto exchanges, and some of the world\u2019s largest marketmakers \u2014 Jump and DRW \u2014 as it looks to raising USD 1B for its stablecoin \u201cGlobalcoin\u201d project. Fidelity\u2019s institutional crypto trading offering is expected to be live in the next few weeks, with retail brokerage giants Etrade and TD Ameritrade also preparing to launch trading in a few top coins. The market is increasingly shrugging off the fears around Bitfinex covering up losses with funds earmarked for backing Tether (USDT), especially as it has apparently already received commitments for USD 1B in its current raise to offset funds frozen by US, Polish and Portuguese authorities. With liquidity on USDT significantly higher than newer, competing USD-backed, audited stable coins due not in small part to USDT enjoying first mover advantage and the network effects from having the longest established history, the market appears to be largely sticking with using USDT which is listed on more crypto exchanges and offers superior liquidity. Longer term industry bulls are increasingly buying on dips as the sector overall gains interest from IBM\u2019s use of Stellar Lumens and a USD stablecoin as part of the World Wire blockchain network for regulated financial institutions (announced in March). Ongoing anticipation is building for the coins being developed by leading messenger apps (i.e. Facebook/Whatsapp/Instagram, Line, Kakao) and banks (i.e. JP Morgan, Mizuho, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ). The launch of BAKKT has been delayed multiple times with no announced target go live date. A race continues to launch STO exchanges and consultancies ahead of increasingly regulatory clarity on STOs.Ripple FundamentalsXRPUSD and XRPJPY bulls should balance any enthusiasm with the ongoing and legitimate criticisms against Ripple hyping its customer list (as many of the 200 plus financial institutions supposedly testing Ripple products are yet to be clients, and are generally not trialing xRapid \u2014 the product that makes use of XRP). The financial institutions already using xCurrent \u2014 the Ripple product that does not make use of XRP \u2014 have the option to upgrade the software so that XRP can be used. With the technology to use XRP available to those xCurrent users who upgrade their software, the only remaining hurdle for most will be the regulatory green light. Ripple holding 60 billion XRP will also continue weighing on the price as the company sells into rallies, as will any legal action against Ripple for being deemed to having issued a security (i.e. XRP) without meeting appropriate regulatory requirements and increasing adoption for stable coins (for payment/remittance functions) which have much lower volatility than XRP.Ripple (XRPJPY) Weekly/DailyClick here for the rest of today\u2019s big picture on the crypto industry, as well as technical and fundamental analysis on Ethereum and BitcoinPrevious Post:Trading analysis \u21164 by Darren Chu, CFABitcoin (BTC/USD) Consolidating After Massive 1st Half 2019 Rallymedium.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Trading", "Cryptocurrency", "Crypto", "Btc"]}, {"title": "\u2018MCAP TOKEN\u2019 yields 470% return on Investment in Ripple", "post_link": "https://medium.com/bitcoingrowthfund/mcap-token-yields-470-return-on-investment-in-ripple-74cb5e9a59ac?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bitcoin Growth Fund", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mcaptoken", "publish_date": "2017-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-25", "readtime": "2.47", "claps": 8, "voters": 6, "content": "\u2018MCAP TOKEN\u2019 yields 470% return on Investment in RippleBitcoin Growth FundFollowMay 17, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readWe predicted that investing in mining and ICOs is the new goldmine and the recent positive trend of rising prices has proved the same.

The prices of ether (ETH), Dash (DASH) and Monero (XMR), among others, have surged in the past month as investors are growing more confident of cryptocurrencies and looking for investment opportunities beyond bitcoin.Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, has been amongst the most notable rallies, rising by up to 231% between March 01, and March 17, to reach an all-time-high of 53 USD/ETH. According to data from Coinmarketcap.com, ether is currently trading at around 43 USD/ETH.Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Annalyst at eToro, said:\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing today is a further sign of growing investor confidence in cryptocurrencies. Certainly the SEC announcement earlier this month was a disappointment, but Ethereum has been rallying since then and Bitcoin bounced back almost immediately. With more announcements due in the coming months, we expect our traders will continue to remain confident on the future prospects of the asset class.\u201dThese trends and developments suggest that both the mining and ICO sector are set to boom in crypto currencies.

To be noted, that each Ripple transaction has a fee, which is eventually being destroyed. This implies that the fee is not paid to anyone. Bitcoin(BTC) transaction fees, on the other hand, are paid as a reward to the miner to include a transaction in a block formation.Ripple has solidified its position in the top 5 cryptocurrency list and is almost as well known as Bitcoin. Regardless if Ripple becomes the number one blockchain-for-banks or not, there are plenty of other applications for its technology. Unlike Bitcoin, it is business friendly as it complies with regulation. While Bitcoin relies on user adoption, Ripple is aiming for more widespread adoption in daily commerce. This makes it more attractive to investors that view cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as vulnerable to future regulatory battles and therefore not likely to be adopted for general commerce.#3As with all altcoins, Ripple still resides under the shadow of Bitcoin in terms of daily trading volume. That\u2019s because Bitcoin is the most exchanged and offered cryptocurrency in the world. Where Bitcoin is offered on local exchanges, in persons and in ATMs, Ripple exchanges are limited to the following reputable sources: Poloniex, Bittrex, Kraken, Jubi, Bter, Anxpro and some other lesser know exchanges.#4Acceptance Ratio is high for Bitcoin as compared to Ripple. Inspite of Ripple falling under the list of decentralized cryptocurrency, we find that cryptocurrency debit cards don\u2019t accept Ripple as readily as Bitcoin. All in all, Ripple is great for banking infrastructures to connect worldwide, whereas Bitcoin is suitable for all sorts of different use cases.#5Bitcoin has an unparalleled amount of different wallet options. However, you\u2019ll find that Ripple has a few different wallet types to use as well. Rippex, for example, is a well respected desktop wallet.Last, but not the least, Ripple value in USD is far less than bitcoin. As of now, Ripple token(XRP) price is $0.5244 & Bitcoin (BTC) price is $ 6655.44.Which is good for long term investment?Ripple has certainly gained a lot of momentum and the list of organizations which are using it indicates that the tokens themselves will become valued commodities in their own right. In fact, last year, the increase in value of one XRP token outperformed Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.At the start of 2017 one XRP was valued $0.006. They peaked, at the start of this year, at $3.87, before quickly crashing down to their current value of around $1 per XRPXRP are traded on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Poloniex. Usually, it isn\u2019t possible to buy them with existing government-issued (fiat) currencies \u2014 you will have to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first, then transfer them to an exchange to trade them for XRP.The Bitcoin price changes a lot every day and has seen many highs and lows over the last few years. The price of 1 Bitcoin has gone from around $76 (07.09.13) to as high as $20,000 in December 2017. But then after Bitcoin reached its highest point in December, the price of Bitcoin dropped to around $6000 in February 2018.It\u2019s revolving around the $6000 mark.It\u2019s crazy!Considering that Ripple is largely governed by a central body, it is hard to argue that it is more secure than the most mined cryptocurrency in the world- Bitcoin.In cryptographic terms, its centralized nature makes transaction reversals far more likely than in the case of Bitcoin.Bitcoin, with it\u2019s current +2000$ USD price, has a massive lead over Ripple, which still trades well under the 1$ mark. So the winner here really is a no-brainer.The Bitcoin Bridge is a link between the Ripple and Bitcoin networks. The bridge makes it possible to pay any Bitcoin user directly from a Ripple account without ever needing to hold any bitcoin.Any merchant accepting bitcoin has the potential to accept any currency in the world. If a Ripple user prefers to keep money in USD and not own bitcoins, a merchant however, may desire payment in bitcoin. The Bitcoin Bridge allows any Ripple user to send bitcoins without having to use a central exchange.Hence, Bitcoin after such fluctuations also is a warrior and no other currency can match with its upheaval.In the long run, Bitcoin is going to prove beneficial as per sources. BTC is going to come back to its original shape.For better and informed decision making, with self supervision in the cryptocurrency exchange space, go to Coinswitch page.About CoinSwitchCoinSwitch is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange aggregator.

Our firm has been studying and analyzing Ripple for the better part of its lifespan. In this piece, I will examine some of the challenges facing Ripple, its potential for future expansion and try to sieve out the wheat from the chaff when it comes to the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.Every day, companies and consumers send over US$76 billion in payments through a dizzying array of banks and financial intermediaries. From correspondent banks to issuing banks, the financial services which support payment flows are a vast web of nodes and networks, each demanding their own slice of the action as money flows through the veins of global commerce. Without this flow, dockworkers don\u2019t get paid and cargoes don\u2019t get loaded \u2014 the letters of credit (instrumental to global commerce \u2014 because nobody trusts anyone) which are key to trade flows have ensured that our modern way of life as we know it gets done. Yet for the better part of a decade, Ripple, a San Francisco-based company claimed to one-up this inefficient and sometimes archaic system by leveraging the blockchain technology underpinning Bitcoin to create what it called the \u201cinternet of value.\u201d Ripple, in the cryptosphere is a veritable institution in that sense. It has survived numerous cryptocurrency routs and is just slightly younger than Bitcoin itself and far older than Ethereum. From late Fall last year to early January this year, Ripple saw an eye-watering 1,300% jump in the value of its digital token, with many hopping aboard the Ripple train on the basis that unlike other cryptocurrencies, Ripple had a narrowly defined purpose and a clear utility \u2014 to help banks move cash from one point to another faster and more cheaply \u2014 particularly across borders.But as anyone who has worked with banks will attest, the pace of change within these institutional behemoths is glacial (in fact thanks to climate change glaciers are likely to change faster these days). According to one senior executive at a large multinational bank who declined to be named,\u201cRepresentatives from the company (Ripple) came by earlier in the year and while their technology and value proposition was good, we did not get the go ahead for adoption from legal. We did agree to a trial.\u201dBut that detail didn\u2019t stop Ripple from subsequently announcing a partnership with the said bank at the time, one which they had to step back from subsequently. Part of the reason for the reluctance for banks to accept Ripple is ironically trust. The blockchain was meant to create a \u201ctrustless\u201d ecosystem that would negate the requirement for trusted intermediaries to facilitate transactions. But current and former executives at several global banks, some of which agreed to partner with Ripple to trial the cryptocurrency say that there is little chance they would ever entrust their corporate clients\u2019 payments to a privately-held cryptocurrency. According to Ripple\u2019s website, in January this year, the company held 61 billion of 100 billion available Ripple tokens, with most held in escrow so as not to be sold in excessively large amounts which would tank the value of Ripple. If one of the main arguments against fiat currencies is central bank manipulation, the same argument can be used against Ripple as well. Quite apart from creating a \u201ctrustless\u201d ecosystem \u2014 the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the blockchain \u2014 Ripple merely substitutes several trusted intermediaries with a single one \u2014 itself.Ripple founder and man who\u2019s wondering if you put mayo in his sandwich, Brad Garlinghouse.Then there\u2019s RippleNet, which is targeted at the Brussels-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication \u2014 better known as SWIFT \u2014 a messaging system used for the control of money flows across the planet. SWIFT was famously hacked (several times) and today connects around 11,000 financial companies. RippleNet doesn\u2019t need Ripple\u2019s digital token XRP to work, but it was hoped that XRP would become a key ingredient in the mix. For instance as an intermediary currency akin to the dollar. Today if you want to convert Afghan afghanis to South Korean won, you\u2019d first need to swap out to dollars \u2014 the idea being that XRP could serve as that bridge. The value proposition was that instead of tying up money in various different currencies in accounts at other banks, with the attendant hassles and expense, XRP could do the job. But that sort of also misses the point. Now instead of a disparate bunch of currencies (which may or may not have value), banks would essentially be centralizing their currency risk by holding deposits of XRP. But at least the technology underpinning RippleNet seems to be sound (for now). More than a handful of banks have signed up to the network and Ripple has even managed to sell equity stakes in itself to Standard Chartered and Banco Santander. But of the over 100 banks which have signed up, only Swedish bank Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken is moving commercial payments over to RippleNet. Over a year ago, Standard Chartered started a program to allow payments between Singapore (a fintech hub) and India using RippleNet for its corporate clients and Banco Santander\u2019s U.K. division tested an international payment using Ripple\u2019s technology which allowed an international money transfer to be executed in mere seconds. Although neither bank has indicated they will use XRP anytime soon, they remain optimistic about Ripple\u2019s technology and understandably so as they have directly invested in it as well.But Ripple is far from alone in its innovation. Other companies such as TransferWise are also tackling the issue of global payment networks as is SWIFT itself, which despite the hackings, released its own major upgrade called Global Payments Innovation or GPI which allows corporate clients to make payments in hours as opposed to days and to track the money flows the same way DHL would track a parcel. Add to that SWIFT is already a trusted network used by banks and approved by compliance departments and Ripple has its work cut out for it. GPI already has 36 banks using it to make over US$1 billion in cross-border payments and while Ripple may argue that SWIFT is merely trying to speed up an already slow system, at the very minimum, hours versus minutes starts to matter very little when a ship travels less than 50 miles an hour anyway. Efficiency arguments work \u2014 to a point. The reality is that while it may be preferable to have instant cross-border money transfers, there are plenty of counter-examples when you may either not require that level of urgency or perhaps not desire that level of efficiency.\u201cWait you mean this isn\u2019t the line for Hamilton tickets?\u201dAnd even if plucky bankers were willing to roll the dice on Ripple, their compliance departments were there to stop the roll. Because Ripple has yet to be approved by regulators (who move at an even more glacial pace) bank compliance departments could never allow them to risk cross-border payments using the digital stuff. And approval is unlikely to be forthcoming for a variety of reasons, chief among which is that approval would be a tacit endorsement of Ripple\u2019s business model and could potentially be perceived as as government-sanctioned currency \u2014 something a central bank or regulator would be hard put to do \u2014 especially for a private company. Though that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not been done before. During the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the government stood behind private companies and stumped up for their debts to preserve the integrity of the entire financial system. But those were dire circumstances, Ripple\u2019s argument is far weaker in comparison. Efficiency is hardly a pressing need.Finally, there is the age-old (or at least as old as the cryptocurrency industry) problem with the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. In January this year, Ripple\u2019s XRP was worth about US$2.92, today it\u2019s worth US$0.35 \u2014 hardly the stuff of stability and a far cry from its intended use as a replacement for the dollar for facilitating transactions. And it adds an unnecessary layer of headaches for both compliance departments as well as bankers. That Ripple is the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency today by market cap is more a testament to its value as a speculative investment tool, rather than as a serious contender to existing global money network solutions.And it is in trying to be all things to all people that perhaps is where Ripple\u2019s greatest challenge lies. It is at once both payment network and cryptocurrency, regardless of the internal divorce, the two will be closely associated from an external optics perspective and depending on the state of cryptocurrencies and their legal status, will no doubt weigh on potential adopters considerations. In terms of technology, banks and other financial institutions are already exploring blockchain-driven solutions which do not require a native cryptocurrency. Countries from China to Uruguay are toying with the idea of central bank-issued digital currencies, which would effectively negate the value of a privately held cryptocurrency to facilitate transfers. And finally, Ripple misses the point of decentralization. With its outsize holding of its own digital token, XRP, banks would be derelict in their duty of care to their clients to concentrate risk within a single point of failure. Decentralization itself is a benefit, not a feature. And if the only value to be had from adopting Ripple is re-centralization and efficiency, then the efficiency benefits pale in comparison to the increased risks undertaken.https://altcoinmagazinemastermindevent.eventbrite.comBefore moving on, make sure to press follow, leave a clap or 46, share today\u2019s highlight and if you missed the last article, click here.Read about the Altcoin Magazine Mastermind Event here.Follow us on Twitter, InvestFeed, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and join our Discord and Telegram.The purpose of ALTCOIN MAGAZINE is to educate the world on crypto and to bring it to the hands and the minds of the masses.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ripple", "Cryptocurrency", "Banking", "Money Transfers", "Finance"]}, {"title": "Analytical Digest \u211615: \u201cXRP / USD The Search of The Support Level\u201d", "post_link": "https://medium.com/exmo-official/https-medium-com-exmo-official-analytical-digest-15-ace3f0deed8f?source=search_post", "author_name": "EXMO", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@exmo_official", "publish_date": "2019-05-24", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-24", "readtime": "0.87", "claps": 3053, "voters": 65, "content": "Analytical Digest \u211615: \u201cXRP / USD The Search of The Support Level\u201dEXMOFollowMay 24 \u00b7 1 min readThe downward trend was globally struck.\u201dWhite\u201d indicates the range of customer demand, which has gained a position of 280 days.The Fibonacci also attracts the price to the 23.6% level.The horizontal volume indicates the active\u2019s price move down up to 30 cents.The Short Point Entry \u2014 36 centsThe Exit Point \u2014 34\u201332 cents.Stop Loss Short Position \u2014 40 cents.Point of a Long positions set \u2014 34, 32, 30 cents.The Exit point from is 48 cents for conservative trading and 60 cents for aggressive one.Original Post: https://ru.tradingview.com/chart/XRPUSD/5Q7KvGW7-xrp-usd-poisk-urovnya-podderzhki/Previous Analytical Digest:Analytical Digest \u211614: \u201cBTC / USD \u2014 \u0441losure of short and growth of long positions!\u201dmedium.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Trading", "Cryptocurrency", "Crypto", "Bitcoin", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@justmoon/yes-xrp-is-cheaper-faster-and-more-liquid-than-other-currencies-so-in-the-kind-of-interoperable-3534dd3f3fb?source=search_post", "author_name": "Stefan Thomas", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@justmoon", "publish_date": "2018-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-14", "readtime": "0.24", "claps": 15, "voters": 7, "content": "I\u2019m pleased to catch your article this early.101Chulhee JunStefan ThomasFollowJun 7, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readYes, XRP is cheaper, faster, and more liquid than other currencies, so in the kind of interoperable world that we\u2019re trying to create with Interledger and Codius, I expect a lot more people would use it.Interoperability also paves the way for blockchain to go mainstream.

There has been a lot of buzz about the future of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and all the potential these new paradigms have to change the world. From changing how the world does business, to changing the way individuals handle their money and investments, cryptocurrency has already had a big effect on modern-day society and had even more impact on the developing nations.Not everyone shares the excitement and optimism about cryptocurrency, though. Some are concerned about dangers of fraud and what decentralized, digital currencies could mean. Others aren\u2019t as worried about the cryptocurrency itself, but are more concerned with the saturation of the market, the ability of certain cryptocurrencies to withstand crashes, and the effect that crashes will have on some economies. Others have even warned about crashes, but believe that it will actually be a good thing in the long-run and will have a positive impact on the economy in the end.In early January, a number of cryptocurrencies experienced a downturn, including Ripple. While it\u2019s still yet to be determined whether cryptocurrencies will continue to fall, what effect this crash will have on our economy, there is no shortage of concerns and opinions being shared across the Internet. With so much information out there and so many people discussing the subject, we decided to narrow it down to the top three most engaging, liked, and disliked articles, and the top three most liked and disliked comments on the subject. With articles and pieces from before the crash and through now, we were able to get a better idea of what it was that people were excited about, what it is that they agree with, and more.To get this information, we used SolidOpinion\u2019s Comment 1000 technology to mine reader commentary on sites across the web from January 5th through January 12th 2018. Here\u2019s what the comment technology gleaned:Top Three Most Engaging PiecesThe top three most engaging pieces were all threads on Reddit, under the Daily Ripple/XRP Discussion Thread. They were always posted by an AutoModerator, and covered the topics of Questions and Price Predictions.Daily Ripple/XRP Discussion Thread 01/03/18 [Questions and Price Predictions]. This Reddit Discussion Thread received 128 upvotes and 1,670 comments, with a count of 1,300.Daily Ripple/XRP Discussion Thread 01/04/18 [Questions and Price Predictions]. This Reddit Discussion Thread received 71 upvotes and 1,315 comments, with a count of 1,250.Daily Ripple/XRP Discussion Thread 01/09/18 [Questions and Price Predictions]. This Reddit Discussion Thread received 96 upvotes and 1,431 comments, with a count of 1,138.Top Three Most Liked PiecesThe top three most liked pieces were all threads on Reddit, all started before the Ripple crash. One shows the support for a Reddit user when they shared the news that they became a Ripple millionaire (which has since been removed) while another simply discusses Ripple\u2019s standing, and the last demands an explanation to chatter they\u2019ve been hearing (which has also been removed).I just became a Ripple millionaire. This thread was started on Reddit in the CryptoCurrency and received 10,613 likes.Ripple at second place by market cap: surpassed Ethereum! This thread was started on Reddit in the CryptoCurrency section and received 9,443 likes.Keep Hearing \u2018XRP will hit $1000\u2019. Guys, that\u2019s about 1/3 of the entire world GDP. Has everyone gone mad!?!? This thread started in the Ripple section and received 7,302 likes.Top Three Most Disliked PiecesThe top three most disliked pieces were also Reddit threads two of which started before the Ripple crash. Two of the posts shared the market stats for Ripple and where it placed in comparison to other cryptocurrencies while the other was a regular discussion thread.Ripple at second place by market cap: surpassed Ethereum! This thread received 663 dislikes total.ETH has passed $900 and has retaken the #2 market cap spot from XRP. This thread received a total of 555 dislikes.Daily Ripple/XRP Discussion Thread 01/09/18 [Questions and Price Predictions]. This thread received 540 dislikes.Top Engaging DomainsDespite widespread media coverage of Ripple and cryptocurrencies, Reddit, YouTube, and news.bitcoin.com all secured more engagement than other prominent sites like TechCrunch and Marketwatch. Reddit threads pertaining to Ripple secured over 50,000 engagements, followed by YouTube with 2,900 engagements. Reddits dominance in sparking conversation on Ripple and cryptocurrency is fitting. Reddit contributors respond to one another, rather than the singular voice of an outlet or editor, thus creating a massive conversation.Consumers are still trying to make sense of how cryptocurrency fits into their lives and it makes sense that consumer-driven threads are fueling global discussion.Additionally, the most engaging articles also belong to Reddit. For a form of currency built on a decentralized ledger system, the conversation that is following is also taking place on forums and sites that are not driven by singular owners. These websites empower individuals to step forward and offer their own contributions.As cryptocurrencies grow increasingly prolific, it will be interesting to track whether these conversations remain on websites that are designed to encourage individual content creators to share their voices, or if audiences will begin to engage more with mainstream media coverage of cryptocurrency.SentimentIn addition to tracking individual comments and engagements, SolidOpinion\u2019s technology can also determine sentiment across the web. From January 4th-January 11th, as coverage of Ripple rolled out, consumer response to these stories remained largely positive at 58.6%. While positive sentiment does not necessarily indicate consumer trust in Ripple or even the coin\u2019s future success, it may however reveal that despite the dramatic drop of this coin, consumer interest level in cryptocurrency is still piqued.What\u2019s so interesting about the Internet\u2019s reaction to Ripple\u2019s unsteady valuation is, that even though rates have plummeted, and although the long-term effects of Ripple\u2019s market crash and the future of cryptocurrency may not be entirely certain, it\u2019s clear that in spite of unsteady valuation and murky future, consumers across the web are still displaying interests regarding the potential of cryptocurrencies \u2014 whether they are Ripple, Bitcoin, or other emerging Coins \u2014 to transform how we create and distribute money.No one can predict how the next few months will turn out for Bitcoin and other decentralized tokens, but we do know that consumers increasingly invested in tracking the viabilities of established and emerging coins. As a democratized form of currency, the future success of digital coins hinges on consumer awareness, and ultimately trust, which can only be cultivated through ongoing conversation.What do you think will happen with cryptocurrency going forward? How do you think it will affect the economy?Disclosure:The author has had a working or personal relationship with one or more companies mentioned in this article in the past.

I took a few notes.\u201cRipple is not an Open Blockchain. Individuals can\u2019t get full access to the Ripple Network.\u201dNot being able to figure out how to use the network isn\u2019t the same as not having full access. Sorry.Ripple is an open source protocol. Anyone can access it and everyone has an equal right to use it. Ripple, the company, does not control the network, collect fees, or limit access.\u201cThrough some effort, users can go download a wallet and transfer Ripple to it, but you have to create trust lines with other organizations in order to get access. In this way, you can\u2019t just send money to whomever you want, they have to accept you as trustworthy before allowing transactions.\u201dXRP doesn\u2019t require trust. It exists natively on the Ripple network as a counter-free currency, similar to Bitcoin. You can send XRP to anyone with a ripple account.IOUs are another component of the Ripple network. IOUs imply trust. Users decide who to trust, if they decide to accept IOUs. Trust lines must be created in order to accept an IOU. You can only be owed money from someone who you have agreed to let hold money for you.In Ripple, not all IOUs are equal. There could be many issuers offering $USD. One issuer could be the Bank of America and another could be a guy named Bob. It\u2019s up to the user to decide who to trust. Will it be easier/safer to redeem an IOU through the Bank of America, or a guy named Bob? Nobody can be forced to trust anybody else or forced to accept an IOU. Sorry Bob.\u201cXRP is not a cryptocurrency in the Traditional Sense.When Bitcoin and Ethereum were originally created, their cryptocurrencies, BTC and ETH, were designed to be stores of value.\u201dBitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP form a core part of their blockchains and each are a part of an incentive scheme. Bitcoin incentivizes miners to validate transactions and create blocks. XRP creates a small cost per transaction which acts as an anti-spam mechanism. It prevents ledger spam and transaction spam, which help make the network less vulnerable to attacks.\u201cXRP was mined all at once\u201dThere are no mined coins in Ripple. There is no mining system of any kind.\u201cAll XRP was created to be destroyed and if the network lives long enough, will be destroyed.\u201dThe transaction fee is .00001 XRP and there are 100 billion XRP in existence. If the Ripple network takes over the world and it starts to look like minuscule transaction fees could cause XRP to completely vanish, another decimal could be added so that the fee is less.\u201cXRP has unique properties and a special use case that does not fit into the traditional cryptocurrency paradigm.\u201dXRP is a cryptographically secured digital asset with verifiable mathematical properties, similar to how we can reliably verify gold as a substance made of atoms with 79 protons.Ripple transactions typically settle in three to five seconds and the network is able to sustain nearly 1000 transactions per second. (An XRP Payment Channel allows transaction throughput to increase to tens of thousands of transactions per second, bringing scalability to the same level as Visa.)\u201cThe majority of the currency is controlled by the Ripple Foundation.\u201dThat\u2019s not a thing.\u201cThe Founders of Ripple Recommend Not Investing in Their Currency\u201dXRP is a digital asset that is independent of the company, Ripple, and existed before the company was created. The company is a holder of XRP and, like all rational XRP holders, the company has a strong interest in fostering a healthy ecosystem and a robust liquid market for XRP.Additional information regarding XRP and the Ripple protocol can be found here.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Blockchain", "Ripple", "Xrp", "Fintech"]}, {"title": "Exchange issues with Destination tags, Memos and Messages", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@Changelly/issues-xrp-xem-steem-dct-xlm-1d0a1c4d5114?source=search_post", "author_name": "Changelly Team", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Changelly", "publish_date": "2018-01-24", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-14", "readtime": "3.84", "claps": 11, "voters": 6, "content": "Exchange issues with Destination tags, Memos and MessagesChangelly TeamFollowJan 24, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readThe crypto industry as a whole is full of techy and complicated things that may confuse you. Some of 90+ currencies we support require different measures to take before exchanging them. Over 70% stuck transactions happen due to negligence of these measures. We will take a closer look at common mistakes happening during the exchange process and sort out the possible aftermath. Let\u2019s look into issues occurring with Ripple\u2019s destination tags, NEM\u2019s messages and memos in Steem, Stellar and Decent.Destination tags, Memos and MessagesIf you\u2019ve ever sent Ripple, Steem, Stellar, Decent or XEM to Changelly, you are likely to know about Destination tags, Memos and Messages. These are short combinations of digits and letters that help us determine your payment and send exchanged money to a \u2018recipient\u2019s address\u2019 you put in when creating a transaction. If they are specified incorrectly, your transaction may get stuck in Limbo or go to another Changelly user.Destination tagDestination tag is used in Ripple transactions. It is the most tricky thing you should be extremely careful with. If you send Ripple to Changelly, you should specify a destination tag when sending. The generated tag is tied to the recipient\u2019s address, so that Changelly automatically sends money to that address, once it gets confirmation from the blockchain. If you mix up digits in the tag or put in a random combination, you may encounter quite frustrating issues. Your money will be sent to Changelly, but your transaction won\u2019t go through due to the error, and you will have to contact our support team and ask them to process your transaction manually. Another, and the worst, scenario is that you may occasionally send your Ripples to an unknown person whose recipient\u2019s address is already tied to the tag you specified. In this case, we can\u2019t help you out.ExampleJohn is about to exchange Ripple to Bitcoin. Let\u2019s say his transaction is already created and he should send us Ripples to exchange them. He sees a screen below:John opens his wallet app, puts in our wallet address. And then, when putting in the destination tag, John is like: \u201dAh, whatever, I\u2019ll put 12345 instead! Anyway, it\u2019s still Changelly\u2019s address. The tag is unnecessary stuff.\u201dThis is the very moment John makes a terrible mistake, because 12345 is the tag tied to a wallet address of another Changelly user who is obviously not John! Once XRP is sent it will go to the wallet address provided by that user, and John will lose his money forever! The worst thing is that we can\u2019t help John in this case, since we don\u2019t control funds sent to our customers.Poor John. Don\u2019t be like him and always send Ripples with a correct destination tag. Only in this case your transaction will pass through in the right way.MessageThe NEM\u2019s message as such is quite confusing. While sending XEM to Changelly, some of users omit it or take too literally sending something like \u2018I love Changelly\u2019, \u2018Greetings from Germany\u2019 or \u2018This is my first salary\u2019. Instead, the NEM\u2019s message represents a combination of letters and digits shorter than a wallet and works the same way as Ripple\u2019s destination tag. If you omit it or specify incorrectly, your transaction will not pass through. You will have to send to our support team a request, so that we can process your stuck transaction manually.This is how the message looks like.Don\u2019t omit it, don\u2019t confuse it, and you\u2019ll always get your transaction done.MemoMemo is unique supplementary information used in transactions with a range of cryptos listed on Changelly, such as Steem, Stellar and Decent. Although Memo works similarly in all these platforms, it is important to mention that they utilize different algorithms. For all of them, entering Memo is a mandatory measure. When sending either, you must indicate your memo, so that our machine will know that the transaction comes from you. If the memo is omitted or incorrect\u2026 well, now you know the outcome. Changelly will have to process your transaction in a correct way. It requires you to report us about the issue.Steem\u2019s memos look like the combination below. So do memos of Stellar and Decent.Please bear in mind that the screenshots above are just an example. All Destination tags, Messages and Memos are unique for each our user. Never use the given examples for your own transactions.Recipient\u2019s addresses of Ripple, NEM and SteemSimilarly, when buying Ripple, NEM, Steem or Decent on Changelly, make sure if you need to input either a Destination tag, Memo or Message to receive your coins to a recepient\u2019s wallet. Always provide this information, if required. Otherwise your money will be sent as an unassigned transaction to your wallet provider, and you will have to contact their support team trying hard to prove that the transaction belongs to you.Have any questions?

If you violate the securities law, you are liable no matter what you do afterwards.\u201d\u2014 Jake ChervinskyPeter McCormack: Good Evening Jake. Well, it\u2019s evening here in England, what time is it there in New York?Jake Chervinsky: So a little after 5:00 PM. I\u2019m in Washington DC actually.Peter McCormack: Oh yes. Sorry. You\u2019re in Washington but you also spend a bit of time in New York, right?Jake Chervinsky: Yeah. So my firm\u2019s headquarters is in New York, so I\u2019m up there fairly often.Peter McCormack: I\u2019m very proud to have you on the show. I think I\u2019m one of your first. So, I really appreciate all the work you do. I think you are valued by the people who follow you, but you\u2019re a not well enough known resource on Twitter. I think this is going to be a very important interview and I\u2019ve got a lot of questions for you. As you know, my style is to try and ask the simple questions to try and help people understand everything that\u2019s going on and it feels to me that even though we have this borderless Crypto, that America seems to be the world police for what\u2019s going to happen, especially with the SEC, apart from say some rogue small countries like Malta. So I want to get into that, but before we do, I don\u2019t usually do an origin story because they usually exist, but it would be great to hear your origin story and how you got into crypto and why it\u2019s become so important for you.Jake Chervinsky: Thank you very much for having me on, I\u2019m a big fan so I\u2019m thrilled to be here. So I am a lawyer in a private practice. I work for a law firm called Kobre & Kim, as I said in Washington DC. I focus on government enforcement, Defence and Securities Litigation. So I represent individual and corporate clients who are being investigated or prosecuted by the U. S government for alleged regulatory violations or for alleged criminal conduct. I also represent clients in civil litigation related to similar issues, usually financial services or Securities issues as far as my professional background. So I graduated law school in 2013, I worked for a few years after that for a different law firm in DC doing mostly the anticorruption and anti-money laundering, compliance and investigations. I left the firm and moved to Los Angeles in 2016, to clerk for a federal district judge. This was a one year position. So when I finished I came back to DC and started working for my current firm, which is a litigation boutique specialising in mostly complex cross border disputes and investigations.Peter McCormack: Oh Wow. Okay. So did crypto come to you or did you come to crypto? Like was it a specific client that raised crypto to you?Jake Chervinsky: It actually wasn\u2019t a client, so I sort of fell into it by accident, I guess the way that most of us do. I came across crypto a bunch of times over the last five years or so. I think I first came across Bitcoin in 2013 when I was doing some anti money laundering work at my last firm and I was looking into FINCEN regulations that has just been passed about virtual currency and I wrote like a paragraph on what the regulations were, but it never occurred to me to look into what it actually was. It wasn\u2019t until last year, 2017 that it really clicked for me. I think the reason, well, a couple reasons that I find it so fascinating. I mean, first of all I\u2019m sort of a tech nerd, so as a kid I was going to computer camp and building PCs and programming websites and html and all that kind of stuff.Jake Chervinsky: I mean, I\u2019m certainly not a programmer, but even though I decided to become a lawyer instead of a computer scientist or a software engineer or something like that. I\u2019ve just always loved technology. So that aspect of the space really spoke to me. At the same time I\u2019ve really found the economic and monetary aspects of Bitcoin fascinating. So like I said, a lot of my work is in the financial services industry and most of what I do is adversarial to the government. So when I started learning more about Bitcoin last year and I was reading, you know, Bitcoiners or I was watching an Andreas Antonopoulos videos and they\u2019re talking about things like separating money from state and disintermediating rent seeking third parties in the finance industry. This stuff was right up my alley. I was primed for that. so, you know, I think last year I saw a random article about price action and decided, okay, fine, let me figure out what this thing is and I just couldn\u2019t stop for hours and days and weeks reading and learning everything I could about what Bitcoin is, how it works, what the technology is, hashing and digital signatures and proof of work and a scaling debate and all this stuff.Jake Chervinsky: And you know, also went down the same odd tangents that we all do with the altcoins. But, you know, Bitcoin is king. So I\u2019ve always come back to that. And you know, earlier this year, 2018, I just realised there was so much going on from a legal perspective that I wanted to make this the focus of my practice, and so I decided to fire up my twitter account and here I am.Peter McCormack: So, you fell down the rabbit hole as we all do initially as a personal interest, but then obviously useful you spotted the commercial opportunity for your firm. And does that mean you are heading up a specific crypto division within the firm?Jake Chervinsky: So, we actually have several lawyers who work on crypto. I was lucky to get a job at a firm when I came back to DC that already had a really amazing fintech practice.Jake Chervinsky: So, just a little bit about my firm, so we focus on international disputes and investigations, but most of our cases deal with allegations of fraud misconduct and most related to financial services. So for example, one of our main areas of practice is defending traders who are being prosecuted for market manipulation, which obviously is going to become an issue. We can talk about that a little later, but I think is going to become a big issue in the crypto space. So I was lucky to fall into a group of people who are already interested in this space and engaged in the crypto world. We also have a little bit of a different business model for most firms. We tend not to develop ongoing long standing relationships with large financial institutions. We also tend to take more risks, a little bit more aggressive than some other firms, so whereas a lot of law firms are afraid of getting involved in crypto, my firm is very supportive of my being active on twitter and learning and writing about the space.Peter McCormack: Is that to avoid any form of conflict of interest, those kind of retained accounts?Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, exactly. So we describe it as a conflict free business model and what it does is it frees us up to litigate cases against any number of financial institutions that most Wall Street law firms are already representing in one way or another, and therefore can\u2019t take cases against their own clients. We also don\u2019t have a transactional or corporate practice. We only do disputes and investigations, which allows us to be a little bit more aggressive with the government. So, you know, some firms are doing a government enforcement defence on Monday and they\u2019re at the SEC arguing vigorously about some issue, but then on Tuesday they are back in front of the SEC begging and pleading to get some other financial product approved. And so they have to maintain more of a friendly relationship with the government. We don\u2019t. So that frees us up to be a little bit more aggressive than some firms.Peter McCormack: So, you\u2019re part of the resistance then?Jake Chervinsky: If you want to put it that way, I won\u2019t argue.Peter McCormack: Okay. So look there\u2019s a lot of people out here who started to get involved in Crypto and bitcoin and there\u2019s different incentives. Most people have a financial incentive, but a lot of people do love and understand the benefits of the technology, the real world use cases and the likes of Venezuela. I think we read about Palestine this week, but it seems to a lot of people that the SEC are kind of kind of holding the purse strings for kind of future success. But at the same time, I\u2019m not based in the US, and a lot of other people aren\u2019t based in the US. So can you just for those who don\u2019t understand, who, tell us who the SEC is, what is their jurisdiction and the powers they have?Jake Chervinsky: So, the SEC is the Securities and Exchange Commission and is the federal agency responsible for interpreting and enforcing the federal securities laws.Peter McCormack: They don\u2019t write laws, right?Jake Chervinsky: They don\u2019t write the laws themselves, so they are enforcing laws that Congress has written and enacted that are codified in the US code. The SEC does have the ability to do some of its own rule making. So the statutes, like the securities Act of 1933 has the broad strokes of what the securities regulations should be, but the SEC gets to fill in some of the blanks about the day to day details of how those regulations will be implemented. But you\u2019re right, they don\u2019t write the laws themselves.Peter McCormack: So right now, I guess a lot of the work being done is to see if crypto can fit within current laws or if new laws are required.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, I think that\u2019s the question for Congress right now. In theory at some point in the future, Congress could draft a brand new crypto specific piece of legislation that clarifies some of these issues that right now are still pretty uncertain, but it is certainly possible that the SEC can handle all of this in their rule making authority within the existing security framework.Peter McCormack: And the extent of the powers they have, in terms of if there are people do commit some kind of securities fraud or a break of the security laws?Jake Chervinsky: Well, securities fraud is a specific type of Securities violation, I would say in general, a violation of the Securities laws.Peter McCormack: So what powers do they have?Jake Chervinsky: So, the Sec has enforcement power to enforce all of the federal Securities laws. There are a bunch of different rules that they have passed to implement the statutes that restrict, for example, manipulation, fraud, misrepresentation, a failure to comply with some of the affirmative obligations of the Securities laws. So for example, most issuers of Securities have to register their Security with the Sec if they fail to register their Security, but they promote it and sell it anyway, then they may have violated Section five and 12 of the Securities Act and the Sec could go after them for dealing and unregistered Security. There\u2019s an entire division of enforcement at the Sec that handles this. They have subpoena power. They can bring administrative cases which are handled in house at the Sec by administrative law judges and they can also bring civil or criminal actions.Peter McCormack: So, this is where we kind of have a grey area with ICOs in that almost, almost no ICO registered as a Security last year. Probably even didn\u2019t even realises what a Security actually is, probably a term that was new to most people last year. I think a lot of people thought these are just monetary tokens, a digital virtual, but now with the Sec lens on them, I guess in hindsight and many of these tokens should have been registered as a Security.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah. So I think last year the discussion was a little bit different. I think people at that time were trying to treat these tokens as utility tokens or maybe they were trying to do their issuance outside the jurisdiction of the Sec by keeping the ICO outside of us borders and conducting the transaction in some other country and screening out us investors. There were also some other mechanisms that folks are trying to use to stop these tokens from being subjected to the Securities laws like SAFT agreements, the simple agreement for future tokens. I think that the more we look at these products and the more we consider the existing Security framework, specifically the Howie test, which has gotten a lot of a lot of press and a lot of discussion in the crypto space. The more it looks like your average token probably is a Security that assuming it\u2019s subject to SDC jurisdiction should have been registered before it was issued.Peter McCormack: But at the same time, it seems like the Sec have only really gone after the outright scams, the obvious, scams within the market and have taken quite a light touch with everything else. Um, why do you think that is?Jake Chervinsky: Well, you know, that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done so far. I wouldn\u2019t bank on that being how it goes for the next few years. I think that\u2019s going to change and I think it\u2019ll change pretty soon. So you\u2019re right that for the last year or so, the SEC was mostly going after outright fraud and Ponzi schemes that were not just failing to comply with the securities regulations, but were being issued by truly malicious actors who are trying to take advantage of and swindle retail investors, that\u2019s already starting to change. Just last week the SEC announced its first action against a crypto company that had failed to register, but did not do any other act of fraud or misrepresentation or anything malicious like that. So I think we\u2019re going to see a lot more actions in the future for pure regulatory violations even where the crypto company was acting honestly and in good faith and was trying to comply with laws but simply failed to do so.Peter McCormack: But at the same time, I read that any, any action that is followed with some form of compliance or liaison with the SEC openly doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll actually be closed down or prosecuted. They can actually work with the SEC. Right?Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, that\u2019s right. So I think there\u2019s a common misconception in the crypto space that securities enforcement is all or nothing, right? That either you have not committed a securities violation and you\u2019re finedPeter McCormack: Or you go to jail.Jake Chervinsky: You have to dissolve your company, you have to liquidate all your tokens and you\u2019re going to go to jail. That\u2019s not how regulatory enforcement works at all. So let me give you a quick summary of how these things usually work. So you\u2019re, you\u2019re an ICO. One day you get a subpoena from the SEC, it says the SEC suspects that you have violated Section five and Section 12 day of the Securities Act, which is the rules that require you to register a Security before you issue it. The SEC subpoena then asks you to respond with a bunch of information and maybe to send out a bunch of documents.Jake Chervinsky: And this begins in negotiation between you and the SEC over how this enforcement issue will be resolved. Normally where this goes is you and the SEC sit down in a conference room across the table from each other and you negotiate. And in a typical business style negotiation where you say to the SEC, here are the weaknesses in your case. Here\u2019s why we don\u2019t think you can prove in court that we violated the Securities laws. They respond, here are the strengths in our case, here are the weaknesses in yours. You talk about the risk of what will happen if you can\u2019t make a deal, which is if you go to trial and you beat the SEC, they\u2019re embarrassed. If you lose the penalties can be very severe. And then you work out a deal and the deal usually does not involve you going to jail and dissolve your company or else you wouldn\u2019t make a deal in the first place. So these things all get worked out in a standard negotiation.Peter McCormack: Sounds like a plea deal of some kind.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, it\u2019s a negotiation. So, the SEC is afraid they\u2019re going to lose a trial or that you\u2019re going to reveal that whatever their theory of liability is, doesn\u2019t hold water and that\u2019s going to screw them up and not just with you, but with every other company that they\u2019re saying the exact same thing to in another conference room in another building. They don\u2019t want bad precedent created because it\u2019ll. It\u2019ll mess up their law enforcement strategy, so usually in these cases tend to get settled because it\u2019s better for everyone. It\u2019s less costly. There\u2019s less risk and usually the settlements, as long as the company is willing to comply with the securities regulations, probably pay a fine and remediate whatever issue there was that you didn\u2019t register your security. Maybe now you have to, but as long as you\u2019re willing to play ball in that way, you\u2019re probably going to be okay.Peter McCormack: I don\u2019t know the relationship between the various government agencies, but one thing that appears to be quite good from America\u2019s point of view, than compared to someone like China is the fostering of innovation and the supporting of capital formation. I guess if they do come down hard on every single ICO from day one, it might have not been such an entrepreneurial environment for US ICOs.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, that\u2019s right. I think the SEC understands the potential value of this space or at least they\u2019re trying to. The United States does not want to push entrepreneurs to other countries. The US wants to attract healthy and productive development of any space. As you mentioned, innovation is an important issue for the US. So what the SEC is trying to do isn\u2019t destroy crypto or take control over crypto, like I think some other countries might be trying to do what they want to do is allow the space to develop a healthy and safe fashion where the technology can move forward without simultaneously hurting retail investors, which is something that has happened I think pretty significantly over the course of the last year.Peter McCormack: Just so other people understand what actually constitutes a Security.Jake Chervinsky: So basically, all the security is a financial instrument that holds monetary value in some way. And usually but not always, isn\u2019t negotiable, meaning you can transfer the security between yourself and some other party. So there\u2019s sort of three or four main categories of securities. There are equity securities which are securities where you as the holder own a piece of an underlying asset, so like a share of a company, if you own Apple stock, you own a piece of Apple that\u2019s an equity security. Then there are debt securities where you don\u2019t own any underlying asset, but instead you have invested money in someone else with the promise that they will repay you money, and usually with interest. So that would be like a corporate bond or a treasury bill. Those are debt securities. Then you have derivative securities which are futures contracts, options, contracts, swaps, these are securities that derive their value from some other underlying assets. So we have Bitcoin futures, the futures contract, its a derivative security that derives its value from the price of Bitcoin. And then lastly, you have hybrid securities which sort of combine some elements of these other three categories.Peter McCormack: And are there any specific legal requirements for issuing a security in terms of who can and when you are an issue in a security, are there specific rules you have to follow outside of registering the security, as you\u2019ve already mentioned?Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, I mean there are a ton of requirements as you might imagine, right? There are any number Wall Street law firms that you can pay a lot of money to, to explain to you how to comply with all the regulations for issuing a security. It depends on what kind of security you want to issue. So in the usual example, if you\u2019re doing an IPO, an initial public offering, meaning you\u2019re telling your security to all comers in the general public, anyone who has enough money can buy your security. You\u2019re going to have to register it with the SEC. You\u2019re going to have to comply with the disclosure obligations of the securities laws. You have to provide information about who you are, what your business model is, what your assets and liabilities are, what risks face your business, you\u2019re going to have to do regular disclosures quarterly and annual disclosure, I mean, there are all of these different requirements in a usual circumstance.Jake Chervinsky: Now there are other types of securities where you don\u2019t have to comply with those requirements. For example, there\u2019s something called a private placement, which is a security issuance under the SECs regulation D, where pretty much, if you only sell your security to accredited investors, you enjoy a safe harbour from the securities regulations. You do not need to register. You do not need to do the typical disclosures. That\u2019s why we see a lot of securities only getting sold to accredited investors, because it means that the company issuing the security doesn\u2019t have to spend the, I think it\u2019s on average between one and $2, million dollars to do an IPO.Peter McCormack: Okay. Wow. Okay. I think the accredited investor rules that you have to have something like, what is it like $250,000 a year and have over a million in assets?Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, it\u2019s, it\u2019s pretty close to that. I mean, it is basically a wealth test. There are other ways to be an accredited investor. So for example, if you are a registered broker dealer, then you don\u2019t necessarily have to meet the love requirements. If you\u2019re a director or officer of the issuer of the security, you can buy that security. You\u2019re accredited for purposes of that issuance, basically the accredited investor rules are wealth test and there\u2019s a lot of controversy about whether and how that should change.Peter McCormack: Did I read correctly? I was researching for this interview but I\u2019m sure a long time ago, this came from something like the, was it the 1929 crash? It was because so many people lost money investing in the stock market. Does it go that far back?Jake Chervinsky: Yeah. So the modern securities framework that we still live with today dates back to the 19 thirties. It was born, as you said, from the Great Depression. So yeah. So stop me if this sounds familiar to you. So in the 19 years there was a speculative mania. This was the understanding in the 19 theories of how the Great Depression happened is speculative mania due in large part to easy access to capital over overuse of margin financing, um, too much hype about post-war economic opportunities and sort of like a general culture of rags to riches success. The idea was all you have to do is buy these securities and we promise you\u2019ll be rich. So all of these issuers, you know, came up with is security is and told everyone just by these don\u2019t ask any questions, don\u2019t worry about it. Everything will be fine, and of course in 1929, that bubble popped, the reaction to this in the thirties was to say, to prevent another speculative mania like this, we need to close the information gap between issuers and investors.Jake Chervinsky: That is to say there is information that investors should have in order to make an informed decision about the securities that they\u2019re buying and holding and only the issuer has that information, right? Who they are, what their business model is, what their risks are, all that stuff. So the basic idea behind the securities regulations was to make sure that investors have basic information about securities and then also to prohibit issuers from a perpetrating acts of fraud and misrepresentation on the market, which you would think would already have been illegal. But in fact one of the key things that the securities act of 1933 did was to how outlaw fraudulent conduct.Peter McCormack: But it seems a little bit outdated now. You talk about a wealth test, but if it is a wealth test without an intelligence test it is kind of myopic, especially seeing I know some pretty smart people who would not pass the accredited accreditation, but I know some pretty dumb people with a lot of money. You could easily lose it pretty quickly. And I guess, I guess this is the point now, people are starting to feel like these regulations are outdated and unfair.Peter McCormack: Yeah. Well I think I agree with you about the accredited investor rules. I think that is one example of a piece of the securities frameworks, that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense anymore. I think at one point it did, I mean, the idea is that if your investors have a certain level of sophistication, it\u2019s okay not to give them this basic information that you would want a regular retail investor to have. And in an earlier era where it really was impossible to conduct due diligence, right, in the years before the Internet, before all the information in the world was at our fingertips and there really was no way to figure out what an issuer was doing. It made sense to a degree at least to exclude people who were not sophisticated investors. I completely agree that the problem is equating sophistication with how much money you have.Jake Chervinsky: I don\u2019t think that makes a whole lot of sense. I think most people agree about that. Even the chairman of the SEC, Jay Clayton recently said that if he could find a way to maintain the same level of investor protections while changing the accredited investor rules, he would do that. So I think it\u2019s only a matter of time until we come up with some other way of doing this. I will say generally speaking, I don\u2019t think that the securities laws are so outdated that we need to start from scratch. I think that core concept that it\u2019s important for investors to have basic information about the Securities they buy and hold that it\u2019s important for market participants like issuers and exchanges and brokers, to you know, not commit acts that creates systemic risk, right? Using too much leverage and other practices that got us into the financial crisis, for example, securitising bad mortgages, you know, these concepts still make sense. It\u2019s just a matter of updating the laws for the digital age. There\u2019s a lot about the laws that made sense when they were written, but that when you put them into the context of, for example, digital tokens issued on a blockchain in 2018, it just doesn\u2019t match up that well.Peter McCormack: I think most people feel like the, the biggest problem with the accreditation is the affordability test because it\u2019s arbitrarily unfair on many people who want to invest, who do want to have the opportunity to, invest in certain things.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, I mean I think that\u2019s a big problem. I also think another issue is there weren\u2019t so many private placements until recent years. It was more expected for a company that wanted to raise capital through securities issuance to do so through an IPO. But the regulations have become so onerous and the costs of doing an IPO has become so much that many more companies are now staying private and allowing only private equity firms and individually accredited investors to buy their securities. So, I think there isn\u2019t much incentive anymore for companies to stay public. We\u2019re seeing a lot fewer IPOs and if not for that, the accredited investors might not be that much of an issue because, if there were more IPOs then regular folks like you and me could still get access to interesting securities that are likely to accrue value. But because of how the market is, we\u2019re not able to.Peter McCormack: One of the things I find interesting right now is there are a number of ICOs which issued last year who are now changing the value of the token, the utility of the token in fear of the securities regulations and at the same time the industry is trying to find some form of utility outside of Bitcoin one of the most interest in areas is also then the tokenisation of assets. It\u2019s kind of a strange conflicting story happening.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, I agree. I mean, I. first of all, I\u2019m sceptical about this concept of doing a securities issuance and then trying to escape liability by converting the token that you use to do that issuance into something else. That\u2019s not how liability works, right? So take the example of a drug dealer, you can\u2019t just say to the government, Hey, I\u2019m going to stop dealing drugs now, please don\u2019t prosecute me for all those times I did deal drugs, right? If you violate the securities laws, you\u2019re liable no matter what you do afterwards, you may have less damages because the harm that you have theoretically caused to investors is less because you have stopped promoting the security, that doesn\u2019t change the question whether you are liable or not.Peter McCormack: And then also we\u2019ve seen, I guess a cloudy grey area around the Ethereum is a security. There was some kind of official/unofficial response to that. It may have started as a security, but now it\u2019s decentralised. It isn\u2019t a security. And then following that, Ripple/XRP has gone on the march of decentralisation for Ripple claiming XRP is decentralised. There\u2019s almost like a changing narrative there too.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah. Well we can get into Ripple and XRP in a minute. Let me tackle and security issue for us. So yeah, in June on Bill Hinman, who is the director of the division of corporate finance at the SEC, gave an official statement where he said that he views Bitcoin as not a Security and probably never was. And the theory based on the status of the network today is not a security, but he said, putting aside the question of whether it was a security at the time it was issued, I\u2019m not going to express an opinion now about whether Ethereum was or wasn\u2019t a security, but clearly there is a difference between using a crypto asset for the purpose of raising capital to fund the development of a network versus where Ethereum is now, where so many people are building on it, it does serve a use case.Jake Chervinsky: I mean, if you\u2019re not a fan of Ethereum, you may disagree with this, but it does serve the use case of I\u2019m paying for transactions on the network. So I think it makes sense to consider a framework in which you can have a token that\u2019s starts life as a security, and then it evolves over time to become not a security at some point in the future. And that\u2019s what Hinman said. You mentioned that it was unofficial and that\u2019s a really good point. This is not the rule making that I was talking about that the SEC gets to do when the SEC makes rules that are binding, they have to go through a whole process that looks a lot like this ETF process we\u2019ve been following. They have to publish the proposed rule in the Federal Register. They have to solicit notice and comments. They have to issue a formal binding rule. This was just one of the directors saying what his opinion was. He could finish his time at the SEC and someone else could come in and take the opposite view and there would be nothing wrong with the SEC doing a complete 180. So while the Securities bar that the Securities lawyers who are following the SEC, more or less take what someone in Bill Hinman\u2019s position says as gospel. It\u2019s not something you want to hang your hat on.Peter McCormack: Right? Okay. I have a feeling you want to talk about Ripple or XRP.Jake Chervinsky: Maybe the same thing, maybe not. Okay. So yeah, we can. We can talk this. I get asked about Ripple and more than anything else by far on twitter,Peter McCormack: I think there\u2019s essentially split the community. There are a staunch advocates of Ripple who will argue against Bitcoin and then there\u2019s Ripple haters. I\u2019m probably in the latter camp, something I invested in early on and did okay with, but as I\u2019ve come to understand Bitcoin or crypto more I like it less, I kind of wish I had Ryan Selkis with me, he would probably have better questions, tell me the picture for Ripple and XRP as you see it. And isn\u2019t it so funny how so many people in this space started with Ripple and then moved on to something else but still made a boatload of money in the process? I think there\u2019s three they understand with Bitcoin Dogecoin or Ripple, right.Jake Chervinsky: Let me start with a whole bunch of disclaimers because I\u2019m a lawyer and so that\u2019s what I have to do. So nothing I say is legal or financial advice. Don\u2019t trade or make any financial decisions based on what I\u2019m saying. I have no opinion about whether XRP is or isn\u2019t a Security. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with Ripple. Okay?Jake Chervinsky: I think that does it. You know, one thing that\u2019s funny is I\u2019m on twitter and I have followers in both of those camps you mentioned. I have a lot of fans of Ripple who are following me, because I tweet a lot about what\u2019s going on with Ripple and then I have a lot of followers who are more in your camp. So hopefully I won\u2019t alienate one or the other when this podcast comes out. The interesting thing about Ripple, I don\u2019t mean to make any statements about the connection between XRP and Ripple, I\u2019ll use them interchangeably. But the interesting thing about Ripple is this, the securities issue related to XRP is already being litigated in state and federal court in California. It\u2019s actually furthest along as compared to any other token or ICO or crypto asset in getting to a resolution on this question, whether it is or isn\u2019t the Security.Jake Chervinsky: There are two cases in California state court, there\u2019s one in California federal court. All of them basically allege the same thing that Ripple created, promoted and sold an unregistered security, that is XRP, that because XRP is a security, Ripple was required to register it first and provide all the disclosures that they\u2019re required to provide under both California state and federal law. And by failing to do that, they violated state and federal securities laws. The cases are still very early stage, but at some point this question will be in front of a judge who in theory could say categorically XRP is or is not a security or could say, this is an issue for a jury to decide by trial and then we get 12 lay people chosen through the jury selection process in California who gets to make the decision whether XRP is or isn\u2019t Security.Jake Chervinsky: That\u2019s unlikely because class action cases, which is what these are rarely go to trial, but we have started this process of marching toward getting answer of what XRP is or isn\u2019t. While that happens. It seems to me that the SEC is taking a hands off approach and just watching the cases develop to see what happens. If Ripple wins, right? If one of these judges rights on a worker on a motion for summary Judgment or a motion to dismiss and says, as a matter of law, XRP is not a security. That\u2019s a disincentive for the SEC to take any action right now. Wouldn\u2019t be a controlling precedent, but it would bad precedent and they don\u2019t have time or resources to waste going after something that has been vindicated by a judge sitting on the bench. On the other hand, if Ripple loses or settles, then that would justify an SEC enforcement action after the fact. So I think until those cases move forward, we\u2019re not really going to know what the SEC thinks and we\u2019re not going to have any certainty about XRP status,Peter McCormack: But at the same time, even if it is considered a Security, as we\u2019ve spoken previously, it doesn\u2019t mean the end for Ripple and XRP haters would want, we would expect possibly a fine some kind of non-prosecution agreement. I think I saw you tweet there\u2019s a number of avenues for a Ripple to carry on, but just face the consequences of a previous violations of the regulations.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah. And so they can, they can settle with the SEC. If the SEC were to be investigating them or to be prosecuting them in exactly that way, and they could promise the SEC that they\u2019re going to register XRP and they\u2019re going to comply with all the disclosure requirements and maybe pay a massive fine. Or a small fine depending on how good the deal they can negotiate and then they can keep doing business. The same thing is true with these class action cases, so it\u2019s important to understand that difference. The cases in California are brought by private investors who are taking advantage of a private right of action under the securities laws that allows regular people to file lawsuits for violations of the same rules and statutes that the Sec might launch an enforcement action for the class action. Plaintiffs can reach their own settlement with Ripple, where Ripple maybe pays some amounts of money in damages to the class action plaintiffs, and if they\u2019re able to either reach a settlement or win that case, then in theory they would resolve this issue for every single investor who is within the class, which would probably be all us investors who bought XRP. And that that\u2019s a gives a lot of clarity to Ripple if they\u2019re able to do that.Peter McCormack: And referring over to the Howey test, I won\u2019t repeat all four points here, but just a question I have, must it meet all four points to be considered a security.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, it does. And so it\u2019s actually not that complicated. So the four factors of the Howey test are you have an investment of money, number one in a common enterprise, number two with the expectation of profit number three, based substantially on the efforts of a third party or promoter. And number four, you have to tick all those boxes to call something an investment contract, which is a type of Security.Peter McCormack: So, does decentralisation take you away from coming enterprise?Jake Chervinsky: It\u2019s probably not common enterprise. That prong is more about the act, the relationship either between all of the investors or between the investors and the issuer. So pretty much a common enterprise is like all of us own the same token. Therefore all of our fates are intertwined. If the token goes up, all of us do well and if the token goes down, all of us do poorly. That\u2019s a common enterprise. Decentralisation is more about that fourth prong. Whether you are expecting profit as a result of the efforts of a single third party or promoter, this goes back to the idea of why we have the securities laws in the first place. Investors need information from the issuer about the security. So if you\u2019re expecting a single issue or to make you a bunch of money, you need to know from that issue or what\u2019s going on with their business. If instead you are expecting profits because there are a thousand different companies that are working on this same network, you don\u2019t really need information from any individual one of them. It is easier for you to make an informed decision about buying this token or whatever it is without getting that information. So in theory, the more decentralised something is, the less you\u2019re expecting profit from the efforts of the single promoter, the less you need the securities laws to apply to protect investors.Peter McCormack: So, with Ethereum I understand that because there\u2019s an ecosystem, most of independent companies or coders or developers building on top of that and just creating a whole ecosystem of this unstoppable computer. Whereas if you look at XRP, it is Ripple,Jake Chervinsky: I will leave that to you to decide.Peter McCormack: That\u2019s my interpretation. Okay. So in terms therefore of the ICO landscape, I guess there is still an opportunity for companies to use an ICO as a way of raising funds, but really for those now considering it that kind of Wild West is over. What is it, a five year statute of limitations even affects those, previously raised ICOs. But actually there\u2019s a good opportunity for the future. Really. Anyone issuing a security now has to have good legal advice before, before they do it, but it\u2019s not actually a closed door, right? It\u2019s just follow the regulations.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, that\u2019s right. I mean, so one of the other core concepts of the securities laws, and this is something that was articulated by the Supreme Court in the Howie case in 1946 is it doesn\u2019t matter what form your security takes, it doesn\u2019t matter what you call it, you can issue any kind of security you want to. So if you want to issue a security through an ICO through a digital token, you are more than welcome to do that. you can issue a security if you want by offering memberships to your gym, you can do a security offering any way you want. It\u2019s just when you do it, you have to make sure you\u2019re complying with the securities. Laws and ICOs are no different. There\u2019s no reason to think that they would be.Peter McCormack: How far does the remit go, because say if I was to issue a security here in the UK to exclude investors from the United States, am I still at risk.Jake Chervinsky: You\u2019re always at risk where the SEC is concerned. Unfortunately, the US government and its enforcement agencies tend to operate as if they can assert a plausible justification for jurisdiction over conduct outside of the US, they may well just do it to see if they can get a settlement out of you. I mean, that\u2019s not true for all regulators. I do think there are some really good people over there who understand that United States world police is perhaps not the best way to conduct business, but, it\u2019s harder than it seems to stay outside of the SEC jurisdiction, if you\u2019re going to do a securities offering so that the SEC explains its perspective on when you do a Securities offering outside the United States in its regulation S and a lot of ICOs are now trying to comply with regulation as basically what reg S says is if you, want to stay outside the SECs jurisdiction, you have to do an entirely offshore transaction.Jake Chervinsky: Meaning the buyer is offshore, the issuers offshore and the transaction itself has executed offshore. That\u2019s why a lot of these ICO contracts will have a clause saying, this ICO sale is being conducted in the Seychelles or something like that. No matter where it actually is. And Second, you have to make sure you do know direct selling efforts to us investors. So like you said, excluding us investors is the start. But that\u2019s not necessarily enough. And the reason for that is, look, if you block IP addresses from the US, but you fly to conferences in the US and you promote your token through speeches to us investors at those conferences and you place advertisements on websites that are seen by us investors and you do interviews for us audiences telling them that they should buy your token, right. It\u2019s not enough just to do the exclusion on the website where the ICO is running, the SEC will see through that. So a lot of the arguments now about how far the SECs jurisdiction extends, is about in the digital age, how you can truly have no direct selling efforts to us investors when all advertisements online are going to be seen by everybody who\u2019s looking at the website. And so I think that is a big issue that still needs to be worked out.Peter McCormack: And the not the only government agency interested in this. Right? It was only from looking through your Twitter that I\u2019ve read about FINRA.Jake Chervinsky: FINRA? Yeah, the financial industry regulatory authority,Peter McCormack: Because they\u2019ve also charged people with issuing securities, right?Jake Chervinsky: So yeah, so FINRA is a self-regulatory organisation, not technically a government agency. I mean it\u2019s a minor technical detail, but they are authorised by Congress to govern the broker dealer industry. So if you are a broker or a brokerage firm or an investment advisor operating in the US, you have to register with and then they administer qualification exams, you have to pass those, you have to do continuing education for FINRA and all this kind of stuff. And when you do that, you subject yourself to FINRA jurisdiction and FINRA shares responsibility with the SEX for enforcing a lot of the securities laws. So FINRA will go after its own registered members in the form of disciplinary actions if they violate the securities laws. And sure enough, very recently FINRA law states first enforcement action against a broker who did his own ICO and lied to his own clients, investors about it, sold it to them and didn\u2019t register it. So it seems like FINRA is jumping into this space too.Peter McCormack: I want to do about the SEC again shortly because I want to ask you about ETFFs, but I also wanted to talk to you about Shapeshift, and I\u2019ll have to thank you. You got me a mention on Laura Shin\u2019s podcast because you quoted my interview with Erik Voorhees. So KYC/AML, a big issue for Shapeshift. What did you make of all that?Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, my pleasure, by the way, I immediately, when I saw the Shapeshift news, I remembered listening to your interview with Eric Voorhees, which was a fantastic interview. This was not a surprise to those of us who are watching this space. We spend a lot time talking about securities enforcement. Securities enforcement is just the beginning of the vast network of regulations that are going to get applied to this space. Anti-money laundering compliance is as big or bigger of an issue for the future of Crypto. Generally, the securities issue is an ICO specific problem that really only came up because people realise that the best use case for Ethereum was to raise capital. I think the securities issue will die out and the anti-money laundering issue is the one that will survive. So basically, here\u2019s how this works.Jake Chervinsky: We live in a highly controlled, regulated global financial system. The point of which is to exclude undesirable people and conduct from the system, right? Pretty much to single out criminal conduct and prevent the proceeds of criminal activity from being introduced into the system. That\u2019s because if you want to spend money on goods and services in the developed world, you need access to the financial system, which means criminals who are committing crime for the purpose of making money are trying to introduce their funds into that system. the way law enforcement functions basically is to conduct as much financial surveillance as possible to catch criminals at the point of entry of their funds into the financial system rather than detecting the actual crime that they committed. Right? So it\u2019s easier to catch, for example, a drug cartel by tracking their money, than by tracking their drug deals.Jake Chervinsky: The issue with cryptocurrency is that it exists entirely outside that regulated financial system. So what Shapeshift was doing was allowing people to convert funds into privacy coins, which are a whole separate issue without any KYC, meaning basically they could get access to financial products that they could spend for goods and services without ever touching the regulated financial system without law enforcement. Being able to understand what they\u2019re doing that is unacceptable to law enforcement as it exists, in 2018. So it\u2019s no surprise that. And look, I\u2019m just guessing because we don\u2019t know exactly what happened with Shapeshift. We know Eric has said basically that he was forced to do this by guys with guns. So we know that there was some elements of pressure from government and that\u2019s why Shapeshift have implemented know your customer requirements. My guess is that FINCEN went to him and said, look, you are a money transmitter. You should be regulated under the Bank Secrecy Act, which defines a money transmitter as a regulated financial institution. That law requires you to implement enhancing money laundering compliance program. The fact that you don\u2019t have one is either a civil or criminal violation of US law. And so really he and Shapeshift would have had no choice but to comply or else get involved in some pretty nasty litigation. So I\u2019m assuming, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s how this one down,Peter McCormack: I think guys with guns is his standard description for the government. Quite interestingly there were a lot of people who have Eric, as an original Bitcoiner and libertarian has moved into a market which involves trading of other altcoins which maximalists don\u2019t like. So, and then he got involved in the New York agreement, which irked some people. There are a lot of people who expecting them to turn around to the government and say, no, I won\u2019t comply and close down shapeshift, but it\u2019s not just as easy as easy as that anyway because am I right in thinking that just closing down, could have had other implications that may have encouraged the government to file charges.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah. So I mean, it\u2019s the same. It\u2019s the same drug dealer example, right? You can\u2019t violate the anti-money laundering rules and then say, sorry, I\u2019ll close my business and then assume the government will just leave you alone. I think the only way to get out of the prospect of liability for that violation was to make a deal and the deal would have included the government promising not to prosecute. You know, also, Eric has a lot of employees and I, you know, I know he\u2019s a controversial figure, but I think he\u2019s generally a pretty good guy. I think he means, well, I don\u2019t think he wanted to put all of his employees out of business, on principle.Jake Chervinsky: I think that, if he had closed the business and the stated reason for closing down was I don\u2019t feel like following the law that applies to me, then he would be liable for, at minimum, breach of a fiduciary duty. So when you have shareholders as I, I\u2019m pretty sure Shapeshift does, you owe them a duty to look out for their best interests and you can breach that duty if you make a decision that isn\u2019t in their best interest. In shutting down your business because you don\u2019t feel like complying with valid laws that apply to you would probably not go over too well.Peter McCormack: So, I\u2019ve got an interesting quote from you and it is going to lead me onto my next question. \u201cThe concept of anonymous crypto exchanges and transactions is a genuine nightmare for regulators and investigators.\u201d And probably why something like Monero has never made it onto Coinbase and never will, ZCash could because it has optional privacy. The KYC/AML requirements for Shapeshift because you could anonymously swap coins into privacy coins, but one of the things being worked on with Bitcoin is full privacy in the future. How do you see that playing out? Could see a scenario where companies such as Coinbase are no longer able to list Bitcoin if it has full privacy?Jake Chervinsky: That is a very hard question and probably my greatest concern about the future of crypto. I mean, you can tell probably by this point, I\u2019m a believer in this, in this asset. I, I think there is very little that can stop it from, from growing in its adoption rate and it\u2019s use cases in the world. I think that at this moment regulators and politicians still don\u2019t understand even the basics of what it is and how it works. I think that the Congress people who are giving these hearings, they still want to know who the CEO of the Bitcoin Corp is. Like they don\u2019t get it at all. So I think that they don\u2019t have the concept of, for example, lightning network delivering, a categorically different level of privacy to Bitcoin. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that they\u2019re thinking about right now, if they were, and when they do, I think that that will be very frightening to them, as I said, the way that law enforcement operates right now is basically by being totally dependent on financial surveillance and catching criminals, by their movements of money rather than by the crimes that they\u2019re committing.Jake Chervinsky: That is only increasing as time goes on. And as we move further away from a cash-based society, I think the idea that we will go back to a world where the government cannot detect crime by analysing our financial behaviour is a very scary thought for law enforcement. And you know, look at the idea does make some sense, right? You\u2019re trying to make it so that crime doesn\u2019t pay, make it harder for criminals to enjoy the fruits of their crime. If you can\u2019t spend your money because you can\u2019t get it into a bank, then you\u2019re maybe less incentivised to commit crime in the first place. That said, this system comes at great costs to our privacy and I think that it is possible that we will be able to impress upon regulators and politicians how important it is that we have privacy.Jake Chervinsky: This is a growing issue now you can see with hearings related to Facebook and Twitter, people are starting to be more vocal about the idea that we do not want the government to know everything about us at all times and our financial behaviour really it goes to the core of who we are. Right? You, you can learn everything about a person by how they spend money. And so my hope for Bitcoin is that either we can convince the people in power that they should allow, I shouldn\u2019t say allow because you don\u2019t really have control over it in the first place, but that they should not attempt to stop adoption of Bitcoin on the basis of the fact that it delivers privacy, which in the US is supposed to be guaranteed by the fourth amendment to the constitution. Secondly, we simply need to get Bitcoin adopted fast enough that it plays an important enough role that, that it would be impossible to attempt to stop it.Jake Chervinsky: That is essentially what happened with the Internet, right? The Internet was its own living creature. It became adopted and became the basis of all commerce and business in the world. All interaction in the world before any regulators could say, hey, we don\u2019t like how this is going. And I think that that in all likelihood, that\u2019s how Bitcoin goes. I will also say there are a lot of intelligent people in this space who\u2019s perspective on this is it doesn\u2019t really matter what the government does or says that if the government were to try to ban Bitcoin, the price, who would shoot up the next day? Um, I like that idea. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s true. My father who I convinced to buy Bitcoin by explaining to him what it is and how it works and how powerful it is and why he should not be left behind, would immediately sell his Bitcoin if the US government were to ban it.Peter McCormack: And I think there are a lot of people like that. I think it would be a big setback for retail adoption. So my hope is that this privacy issue doesn\u2019t encourage governments or law enforcement agencies to take a harder stance on bitcoin. I\u2019m not sure what the timeline is for full privacy within Bitcoin, but I guess with you, I\u2019m hoping it will be too late to stop the juggernaut because I can imagine if the government banned Bitcoin because it was private, the disruption would be huge because the Bitcoin tentacles no stretch through the US economy.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. and you know, it\u2019s also, I mean, it\u2019s interesting to note they have not taken action against the privacy coins that today are delivering privacy. So you had Riccardo on last week who I love and he has this great quote. So, sometime recently Europol, which is the law enforcement agency for the European Union, came out and said, we are concerned about Monero. I think they said ZCash and Dash too. He said, we\u2019re concerned that these products are being adopted by criminals and we can\u2019t track them. And Riccardo has this great quote where he says something like, you know, we don\u2019t tell criminals to use Monero but there sure are a lot of benefits for criminals if they do use Monero. So it\u2019s like everyone sort of knows that these tools could be adopted for, for potentially illicit purposes and yet the government doesn\u2019t seem to be moving against them. We haven\u2019t seen bands of Monero and hopefully you won\u2019t. So it could be that my fears are unfounded and that the desire to have innovation and technical progress will have way the desire of the government to have total financial surveillance of all of our conduct.Peter McCormack: Criminals still have the on and off ramp issue anyway for moving significant amounts of money so I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll still be other sophisticated ways or tracking on ramps and off ramps and who the money is going to.Jake Chervinsky: I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, I think we all know that\u2019s the idea that Bitcoin is for criminals and money launderers and thieves and nobody else is incorrect. I think the statistic is something like less than 10 percent or less than five percent of Bitcoin transactions are in any way related to criminal conduct. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, but I do think that is the perspective of governments and also the legacy finance industry. I think the same tropes that we\u2019ve heard for years are the same ones we\u2019re going to hear for the next five or 10 years, which is Bitcoin is only for criminals and blockchain, not Bitcoin. I think we\u2019re stuck with these things for a long time.Peter McCormack: Let\u2019s talk about ETFs. What is, what is the path to approval here? Because my assumption is one is going to come at some point, but we have had rejection after rejection. We had nine recently, I think in one day. I think we have one outstanding. What is the path to approval? What\u2019s holding things up?Jake Chervinsky: So, I think it\u2019s almost certain that eventually an ETF will be approved. I have no idea what the timeline will be on that. The main issue, the SEC has is with market manipulation. So, you know, the idea of a Bitcoin ETF is to have an ETF share trading on the New York stock exchange or a typical regulated exchange that an institutional investor is going to buy. But it\u2019s going to reflect the price of the bitcoin that\u2019s trading on these unregulated spot and derivative markets, right? The largest Bitcoin markets are not regulated by the US government. That\u2019s both the spot markets where you\u2019re actually trading Bitcoin and the derivative markets like a Bitmex for example, where you\u2019re trading perpetual swaps, which also affects the price of the coin. The SEC is not going to approve any ETF if they are convinced that the price of that ETF share is going to be impacted significantly by manipulation and because they don\u2019t have insight into what\u2019s going on those underlying spot and derivative markets where the is being established for Bitcoin, they\u2019re just not comfortable approving ETF yet.Jake Chervinsky: So, what they said most recently, in the denials of the Pro Shares, Granted Shares and Directions ETFs last month was that what they need to see is a surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size. What that means is they want the ETF sponsor to promise that they are going to deliver to the Sec trading data from those underlying exchanges so that the Sec can see exactly what\u2019s going on those order books to satisfy itself that there isn\u2019t manipulation or to enable itself to prosecute people who are manipulating those markets. I think it is highly unlikely that Arthur Hayes is going to sign a surveillance sharing agreement with an ETF sponsor in the US. And so I\u2019m not sure how the SEC will be satisfied that enough of the underlying spot and derivative markets are surveilled, that they feel comfortable approving an ETF.Peter McCormack: It\u2019s quite interesting the comments of commissioner Pierce. I think it was yesterday or a few days ago also. She seems to be quite a fan of Bitcoin and crypto. Her descent, obviously it was picked up by quite a few people, but she said, I don\u2019t know if you saw it, but our argument that the FCSECC mandate is to focus on determining the quality of the underlying assets. She said that it inaccurately focused on the latter, during the recent rejection of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF. Did you follow this?Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, I did, and I saw her statements and I really like her. She has definitely embraced this. A crypto mom status. I really like her perspective on the role of the SEC, which is that the SEC does need to support innovation and the SECs job is not to eliminate all risks for investors, but rather to eliminate unreasonable risk and enable investors to make informed decisions about what kind of risks they want to take on after all the nature of the capital markets is for investors to take on risk. So I really like her. Her perspective in general on the SECs role, I am not sure how legally sound her position is. So I think you articulated it pretty well. What she\u2019s saying is the SEC should only look at whether the ETF shares themselves will be manipulated on the exchange where the ETF is being proposed rather than looking at whether there\u2019s going to be manipulation in the underlying markets, even if that manipulation in the underlying markets will affect the ETF price.Jake Chervinsky: That perspective goes against about 15 years of SEC precedent. So if you look at the original Winklevoss disapproval order from March of 2017, there\u2019s a footnote where they initially make the statements about looking into the underlying markets and the footnote has a list of dozens of cases dating back to 2004 where in other opinions, the SEC is looking at the underlying markets for other commodities like gold or oil or other precious metals or what have you. And so while I think her theory is interesting, I would be very surprised if the other commissioners decide to adopt it.Peter McCormack: Okay. So back to my original question, path to approval, how long do you think we are away from this, what do you think will actually need to happen before we have an ETF approved?Jake Chervinsky: Well, you know, it\u2019s sort of a chicken and an egg problem because what the SEC wants to want to have in the market before they approve an ETF is enough liquidity and enough price discovery that they can be confident, manipulation, won\u2019t have a significant impact, but we\u2019re not going to get that level of liquidity and price discovery unless we get institutional investors into the space and it probably takes an ETF to get them into this space.Peter McCormack: So, I think there are sort of two ways of solving this issue. I think the first way is for the Bitcoin markets to simply become less manipulated. I\u2019m not exactly sure how that happens. It may be that the DOJ and the CFTC, which are currently investigating manipulation on crypto exchanges, need to get trading data from those exchanges, launch a few prosecutions, you know, demonstrate that they have some handle on the manipulation going on in those exchanges. It may be that Congress needs to give regulatory authority to the SEC or to the CFTC or maybe even to a brand new agency that is specific to crypto so that they have the authority to demand trading data from exchanges, but even then, you know again, Arthu Hayes is probably not going to send trading data to the SEC just because Congress passes a law saying the SEC should get it, so I\u2019m not sure how that works.Jake Chervinsky: I think that the Second and more likely outcome is that some ETF sponsor, we\u2019ll put together a surveillance sharing agreements with enough exchanges that the SEC will be satisfied. It is a significant enough coverage to make them comfortable with their insight into the underlying markets. This is something that the Winklevoss twins are working on right now. They created a new organisation, I think it\u2019s called the virtual commodity association. It\u2019s all of the US exchanges stuck together. I think the theory is if you get a surveillance sharing agreements, at least with all of them, then maybe the SEC will say, that\u2019s good enough for us to approve an ETF. What I think we need is some turnover in the ranks of the commissioners, so we just got a new commissioner in, this guy, Elad Roisman who I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s pro Crypto, but he\u2019s certainly not anti-crypto and that\u2019s progress because the guy who replaced certainly was so it may just be we need some other people in a position of power there who take a different view of this space and are more in favour before we get an ETF approved.Peter McCormack: Right. Okay. So the last thing I want to talk to you about is a Bakkt. You said this is more important than an ETF. It would be good to hear your perspective on why that is and why you were so excited about it.Jake Chervinsky: So, I think the reason that that is more important than an ETF is simply because it\u2019s more likely to get approved much faster than the ETF will get approved. So basically what Bakkt is proposing to do is to launch a one day physically settled futures contract for Bitcoin. One of the things about Bakkt is one of the companies behind it is the intercontinental exchange ICE, which is a very well respected, very well-known exchange that owns the New York Stock Exchange, owns about 20 other exchanges and already has approval from the CFTC to launch futures products. So unlike an ETF which requires this long and drawn out approval process with the SEC, Bakkts, can basically self-certify a futures contract and launch it on its own without the CFTC, which is the agency that regulates futures contracts without the CFTC having to approve it first.Jake Chervinsky: Now granted, if the CFTC doesn\u2019t want a futures contract to exist, then it won\u2019t, but the CFTC has already shown itself to be willing to allow these kinds of products. We already have futures contracts trading on CBOE and CME. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to expect that backs won\u2019t launch in November as they plan to. So I think that simply the fact that we\u2019re going to get Bakkt before we get an ETF is exciting. The Second piece of this is Bakkt is going to roll out in two phases. The first phase is from institutional investors, it\u2019s a futures contract or one contract equals one Bitcoin. That\u2019s obviously not that useful for merchants or consumers because you can\u2019t do business in increments of one Bitcoin, but phase two, it seems is going to be a product for commercial application, meaning you go to Starbucks and Starbucks is one of the companies behind Bakkt. You go to Starbucks and instead of buying your coffee with Starbucks app, which you\u2019ve loaded with US dollars, you buy your coffee with Starbucks app which you\u2019ve loaded with backed, which is truly backed by physical bitcoin.Jake Chervinsky: So, I think that possibility is exciting for adoption.Peter McCormack: And do you share any of Caitlin Longs concerns about rehypothecation and commingling?Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, of course I do. So, she\u2019s the expert on these issues. She\u2019s got 20 years of experience on Wall Street, so she\u2019s really the one to talk to you about this. But I mean I can tell you basically what I know about this rehypothecation is essentially the same problem as fractional reserve banking. It\u2019s a process that creates multiple owners of the same underlying asset, which makes that underlying asset much less stable. A lot of the gold bugs think that this is what has suppressed the price of gold for a long time or that I\u2019m creating paper claims to assets that don\u2019t exist, has suppressed the price of gold. I don\u2019t think we want to see that in Bitcoin. The problem is Wall Street is going to do a Wall Street does and if you ask Caitlin she\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s what Wall Street does, it inflates supply for its own benefit.Jake Chervinsky: I do think that rehypothecation is an issue. There\u2019s an interesting argument that Bitcoin by nature is resistant to rehypothecation because those of us who want our coins will want the real thing, not the rehypothecated version. I think that\u2019s an interesting argument, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to have to play out down the road. Commingling is, is just as much of an issue. So commingling happens when you pledge an asset as collateral to a financial institution, and it throws that asset into a single omnibus account that supports all of the institutions obligations, not just the obligation the institution has made to you, which means in theory, your asset, your Bitcoin is now collateral for someone else\u2019s debt, and if they default, you are the one at risk. So, this is another example of something that I think we don\u2019t want to see happen to Bitcoin and this is what we would call bad financialisaton. But again, you know, it\u2019s something that Wall Street gets to do if it wants to launch products and services that do itPeter McCormack: Well listen, that last question took us to my longest ever podcast. I think you\u2019ve absolutely crushed it. I think you\u2019ve done well on such heavy detail over an hour and nearly 20 minutes. So let\u2019s just finish up with, is there anything coming up we need to be aware of in the market? And also, after that, can you tell anything that\u2019s coming up for you and how people can stay in touch with you?Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, sure. So as far as what I\u2019m watching, I\u2019m sort of, like I said, we were all focused on securities enforcement right now. There\u2019s a lot more types of enforcement coming down the road. There\u2019s anti money laundering compliance issues. We\u2019re going to see crop up, there\u2019s going to be tax enforcement issues, there\u2019s going to be trade sanctions issues, there are going to be trading practices, cases, prosecutions of traders who the government is going to say are manipulating these markets. So I think this space is going to expand significantly and we just have to keep our eyes on all of these agencies to see what they\u2019re going to do and how they\u2019re going to do it. Um, as far as me, I would say follow me on twitter at Jake Chervinsky. You can find me on my law firm\u2019s website, kobrekim.com. I\u2019m really happy to hear from anyone, anyone who wants to reach out to me. I think people who might want to get in touch with me are people who have gotten a subpoena from the US government or think that they might, or people who generally speaking have lost money in the crypto space and they think their losses are due to someone else\u2019s unlawful conduct and they want to talk to a litigator about getting their money back.Peter McCormack: Excellent. This has been absolutely fascinating. Thank you so much for coming on. I can\u2019t wait to get this out and see the response and good luck with everything you do. Next time I\u2019m in Washington, I will meet up with you and we\u2019ll grab a beer and have a proper chat in person.Jake Chervinsky: Yeah, definitely. Thank you.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Have the cryptocurrencies bottomed out or will they fall again after a short pullback? That is the question troubling most of the market participants currently sitting on the fence.A bottom can be confirmed only in hindsight but the analysts try to call it in advance, using various tools.One such prediction is from the virtual currency focused hedge fund, Pantera Capital Management. Its CEO, Dan Morehead believes that Bitcoin\u2019s low of $6,500 is probably the bottom. But, why should we take this prediction seriously?Because, in December of last year, Morehead had forecast that Bitcoin might fall 50 percent, and that is exactly what happened. Also, he is not known to make too many predictions. Morehead expects Bitcoin to rally above $20,000 by the end of the year.He is not alone in forecasting a recovery for the leading virtual currency. Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee has called a target of $25,000 on Bitcoin for this year.Business magnate Tim Draper has projected a target of $250,000 for Bitcoin by 2022. Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on digital currencies has seconded Draper\u2019s forecast.BTC/USDWe had mentioned in our previous analysis that Bitcoin will face resistance at the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and that is what happened. For the past two days, the virtual currency has been struggling to cross the 50-day SMA. Today, the price has turned down.We expect the 20-day EMA to act as a strong support on any decline. Both moving averages have turned flat, which points to a range formation in the short term, instead of a trending move.The support of the range is likely to be $6,757.26. The resistance of the range is still not final because if the bulls break above the 50-day SMA, the next move will carry the BTC/USD pair to $9,400 levels.Our view will be invalidated if the lows of $6700 break. Under that condition, a retest of the February 06 lows of $6075.04 will be on the cards.Traders can continue to hold their long positions with the stop loss at $6700.ETH/USDWe had expected Ethereum to rally to the 50-day SMA, but it turned down from $537.56. It can now correct to the 20-day EMA and below that to the $418.79 levels.If either of the levels hold, the bulls will again try to push the ETH/USD pair towards the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can go long on dips with a stop loss below $355.The 20-day EMA is turning up, which shows the possibility of either a range bound action or the start of a new uptrend. We shall get more clarity in a couple of days.BCH/USDWe had recommended a long position on Bitcoin Cash in our previous analysisat $779. For the past four days, the digital currency has entered into a tight range. If the bears manage to sustain prices below $778.2021 levels, we may see a range bound action.If the BCH/USD pair bounces off the 20-day EMA at $765, a rally to the 50-day SMA at $945 is possible.The 50-day SMA has not acted as a major resistance previously, hence, we expect a rally to $1114 levels.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the lows of $619.7510 are broken. Hence, we have propose a stop loss at $610.XRP/USDRipple is finding it difficult to break out of the 50-day SMA. The bears should now attempt to sink the digital currency below $0.56270 levels once again. If successful, a retest of the April 01 lows of $0.45351 will be on the cards.On the other hand, if the bulls defend the $0.56270 levels, traders can initiate long positions on the XRP/USD pair with a stop loss at $0.45.On the upside, the first target should be $0.7 and above it $0.83.XLM/USDStellar broke out and closed above the descending channel on April 15, triggering our recommended buy levels. The trade is live.The XLM/USD pair has risen above the channel for the first time this year and has broken out of the 50-day SMA after early-February. Both these show that the bulls are accumulating at the lower levels.The moving averages are close to a bullish crossover, which is an added positive.The digital currency can retest the breakout levels of the channel. If the level holds, we should see a rally towards its first target objective of $0.36 and to $0.47 after that.If price enters the channel once again, it will be a bearish move. We shall cover the position if price closes (UTC time frame) below $0.18.LTC/USDThough Litecoin has broken out of the downtrend line 1, it is struggling to scale above the horizontal resistance at $141.026.For the past four days, the LTC/USD pair has been consolidating in a tight range near the overhead resistance.Even if the price breaks out of $141.026, it will again face resistance at the downtrend line 2. If price turns down from the current levels, we may expect a range bound trading action for a few days.As we don\u2019t find any buy setup with a good risk to reward ratio, we remain neutral on Litecoin. We shall change our view once it starts trading above the downtrend line 2.ADA/BTCOur recommended long position on Cardano is moving towards its first target objective of 0.0000323, where partial profits can be booked. The remaining positions can be held with a trailing stop loss, for a higher target of 0.000035.The successful retest of the breakout levels at 0.00002460 on April 14 and the subsequent bounce is a positive sign. The 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA have also completed a bullish crossover.Therefore, we suggest trailing the stops on the ADA/BTC pair to 0.000023 from 0.000021.NEO/USDOur suggested long position on NEO is live from the levels of $64 that triggered on April 12. We had expected a quick move to $88 but for the past four days, the digital currency has been struggling to stay above the $64 mark.On the upside, the 50-day SMA is acting as a resistance. Once this is crossed, the NEO/USD pair should rally to the downtrend line of the descending triangle.On the downside, the 20-day EMA will act as a strong support. If the bulls fail to defend this level, a retest of the lows at $44.16 is possible.Traders should hold the position with the stop loss at $44. We shall close the position earlier if the critical levels break down.EOS/USDTraders who follow us are likely long on EOS at $7.5. We had suggested to book profits on partial positions at $9.5, but the digital currency did not reach those levels. Currently, a retest of the breakout levels of $7.28 is on the cards.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, which is a positive development. The 20-day EMA is just below the critical horizontal support of $7.28.We anticipate a strong bounce from these levels, which should again propel the EOS/USD pair towards its target objective of $11.If the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA supports break down, we might close the positions without waiting for the stops to be hit. Meanwhile, traders should continue to hold with the stop loss at $5.5.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

XRP/BTC and XRP /USDT trading will be available from 14:00, November 24, 2017(GMT+8).What is Ripple?Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), currency exchange and remittance network by Ripple. Also called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol, it is built upon a distributed open source Internet protocol, consensus ledger and native currency called XRP (ripples). Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable \u201csecure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.\u201d It supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. At its core, Ripple is based around a shared, public database or ledger, which uses a consensus process that allows for payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.The network is decentralized and can operate without Ripple (enterprise), it cannot be shut down. Among validators are companies, internet service providers, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Used by companies such as UniCredit, UBS and Santander, Ripple has been increasingly adopted by banks and payment networks as settlement infrastructure technology, with American Banker explaining that \u201cfrom banks\u2019 perspective, distributed ledgers like the Ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like bitcoin,\u201d including price and security.Official Website: https://ripple.com/Block Explorer: https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/graph/Risk Reminder:Investing in digital assets comes with high risks due to huge price fluctuations.

It\u2019s A Life-Saving Movement.Chris HadleyFollowMay 1, 2018 \u00b7 12 min readAlmost 1 million people worldwide have died as a result of suicide, with over 40,000 of those fatalities counted in the United States. In 2000, Kevin Hines nearly became the latest addition to those statistics. Only 19 years old and diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Hines tried to take his own life by jumping off San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge. Were it not for the alert actions of now-retired U.S. Coast Guard officer Marcus Butler and trauma nurse Christy Frecceri, Hines\u2019 story would have died with him.After that incident, Hines would recount his experiences to millions of people whose lives have been altered by suicide through public speeches, one-on-one meetings with families and suicide survivors, TV talk show appearances, and a best-selling autobiography, Cracked, Not Broken: Surviving and Thriving After A Suicide Attempt. Hines\u2019 story also reached over 110 million viewers on Buzzfeed Video.In January of 2018, Hines appeared alongside infamous Youtube vlogger Logan Paul to discuss suicide prevention in a video called \u201cSuicide: Be Here Tomorrow\u201d. That video has racked up over 28 million views since its debut. At the 2018 Grammy Awards, Hines took the stage with several suicide survivors as acclaimed rap artist Logic performed his hit song \u201c1\u2013800\u2013273\u20138255\u201d (also the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline).Now, Hines tells his story \u2014 and the stories of others touched by suicide \u2014 in the full-length documentary Suicide: The Ripple Effect, co-directed by Hines and Baton Rouge-based filmmaker Greg Dicharry.In addition to numerous showings throughout the United States and overseas, Suicide: The Ripple Effect recently played at the Louisiana International Film Festival in Baton Rouge. Its web site offers a complete list of upcoming public screenings, plus valuable information on suicide prevention, and details on how people can organize screenings of Suicide: The Ripple Effect in their hometowns.Hines tells his story on-camera in SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT.Most people associate the tragedy of suicide with celebrities \u2014 Prince, Kurt Cobain, Robin Williams, Amy Winehouse, among others. However, suicide also affects everyday people who\u2019ve felt like there is no way for them to overcome the difficulties of life. The impact it has on their families and friends is devastating. Equally devastating are their shared feelings of not having done enough to save their loved ones.While those effects have been examined in sobering detail across several documentaries and fiction-based films, Suicide: The Ripple Effect shows how it\u2019s possible for something good to come out of the traumatic experience of suicide.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make a sad and somber film. That\u2019s not who Kevin is. Kevin\u2019s story is really hopeful in its message,\u201d Dicharry responds. \u201cWe feel that people who\u2019ve been touched by suicide needed to be uplifted and to not have a downer thing. You don\u2019t reach as many people because they don\u2019t want to watch a downer film.\u201dThe stories that DiCharry and Hines\u2019 documentary capture are examples of that axiom, as is the very name of their project. \u201cOne of the things with the title of the movie early on was that it was natural to see the negative ripple effects that happen with suicide,\u201d says Dicharry. \u201cThere are studies out there that say after with every death by suicide, 115 people are directly affected. That\u2019s huge, but we wanted to focus more on the positive ripple effects of hope that come out of that.\u201dAmong those impacted by Hines\u2019 story are the people who worked to save his life. \u201cOne of the people we interviewed for the film was a trauma nurse (Frecceri), who was the nurse when Kevin came into the hospital,\u201d says Dicharry. \u201cWe interviewed her, and we learned the impact that he\u2019s had on her and his story, and how she uses that story to train other nurses. There\u2019s the Coast Guard guy, Marcus Butler, who helped rescue Kevin, and the impact he\u2019s had. Then, there are just people who meet him. It\u2019s pretty remarkable.\u201dHines (left) with former Coast Guard officer Marcus Butler (right), one of several first responders who helped to save Hines\u2019 life. His story is among many told in SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT.Inspired by Hines\u2019 story and his work, people throughout the world have followed in his footsteps. Hines and Dicharry met some of them in their trip to the Land Down Under, which is presented in their film. \u201cThere\u2019s a young guy in the film from Australia, Sam Webb, who\u2019s an actor. He lost his best friend to suicide. He and his buddy started up a charity called LIVIN to draw attention to the issue,\u201d Dicharry remembers.\u201c\u2026There was the brother and the mother of someone who died by suicide. He\u2019s a speaker, like Kevin, and the mother wrote a book. Another girl who works with us now lost her brother to suicide. She\u2019s determined. Another guy, Joe Williams, was a former rugby player and boxer. He attempted suicide, and now he\u2019s using his experience to help others.\u201dFor families who\u2019ve lost a loved one due to suicide, coping with the devastation of that loss is made harder by their inevitable feelings of guilt. Hines\u2019 efforts to help those families are seen up-close in Suicide: The Ripple Effect.\u201c(It\u2019s great) to see the kind of impact that he has in helping families understand a little bit better or get a little bit more peace,\u201d Dicharry adds. \u201cHe can give them a little bit better understanding that it really wasn\u2019t their fault. He gives them a little more understanding of the reasoning or circumstances behind it.\u201dDicharry also describes how even the short trailer for Suicide: The Ripple Effect has already helped to save lives. \u201cA kid wrote in from Australia. He said he was standing on top of a bridge and was just waiting for that right moment to jump. He scrolled through his phone and he saw the video. He watched it, and when it was over, he called his parents and his friend and got help. Those kinds of things happened repeatedly, numerous times. That\u2019s the really cool thing.\u201dSocial media, particularly the film\u2019s Facebook page, is a significant extension of Dicharry and Hines\u2019 outreach. \u201cWhen we first started, we started what was called the \u2018Suicide: The Ripple Effect Challenge\u2019,\u201d Dicharry explains. \u201cWe had a number of people doing it early on. We\u2019ve had a few lately, but we\u2019ve encouraged people to share their stories of how they were personally impacted by suicide in a short video. We\u2019d post it on our page. There\u2019s a few of those that were submissions that were actually in the film. We\u2019re hoping that when the film starts, people will do more of those. If they\u2019re not comfortable doing a video, they can write something, do a picture, a poem or things like that.\u201dGreg Dicharry, co-director of SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT.Like that of Hines, Dicharry\u2019s story of survival is especially remarkable. A graduate of Arizona State University, Dicharry started his filmmaking career in the glamorous yet tempting atmosphere of Los Angeles. Beginning in the mid \u201990s, he worked on several music video and TV commercials, plus a low-budget feature film. However, Dicharry struggled to cope with the constant uncertainty of when his next job would come along. For him, drugs were the only way to deal with the difficulties of that situation.After taking an additional job as a part-time nanny, Dicharry\u2019s work in the film and TV production industry would increase. Having begun collecting stories for the pilot episode of a youth-oriented 60 Minutes-style newsmagazine called Generation Y, Dicharry spent considerable time with the youth of a Venice Beach-based ministry, Set Free. Meanwhile, Dicharry also worked on the crew of MTV\u2019s celebrity-filled Rock & Jock Softball game.While the work picked up for Dicharry, so did the long hours he spent on both projects. Worse, so did his substance abuse. Boosted by the exciting nature of his work, and by the dangerous power of the drugs he consumed, Dicharry rarely slept. He practically neglected his then-girlfriend. Following a heated argument between them, Dicharry had an experience that initially seemed like a profound epiphany.\u201cWe had a little balcony off our kitchen, and another balcony off our living room. I was tired and pretty buzzed, but I got locked out off the smaller balcony off our kitchen,\u201d he recalls. \u201cRather than bang on the door and wake up my girlfriend, I just laid down on the ground and went to sleep. At some point later, I was startled awake. I don\u2019t know how to completely describe it, but it was like a voice or vision came to me. \u2018If you give it all away, it\u2019ll come back to you a million fold\u2019.\u201dL-R: SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT co-directors Dicharry and Hines.The next morning, Dicharry began to do just that. \u201cI started giving away more and more. it was kind of like, \u2018you\u2019ve given me everything. I\u2019ve given you your clothes.\u2019 I took off all my clothes. I wasn\u2019t on any drugs, but it was like I was. I ended up getting in the middle of the street. It was rush hour traffic. People were honking their horns, but it sounded like music. I was dancing. I came around the corner.\u201dBelieving that he was somehow under the influence of a higher power, Dicharry had no idea he was in danger. The policemen who saw him prancing amid Venice Beach\u2019s traffic, however, had a hunch that he was. \u201cThere was this group of cops,\u201d Dicharry says. \u201cThey were laughing at me. I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to see the Lord.\u2019 They said, \u2018where\u2019s the Lord?\u2019 I said, \u2018in Long Beach.\u2019 They took me to jail where I stayed for a day, and they ended up letting me go.\u201dFor three weeks, Dicharry would be committed to the psychiatric ward at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. During that time, he found out the real reason behind his supposedly spiritual behavior: \u201cThey told me that I was bipolar and needed to take these meds and that if I didn\u2019t quit doing drugs and alcohol, I\u2019d keep ending up in places like that,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThat was kind of the start of it. Smoking a lot of marijuana definitely had a factor in it.\u201dDicharry\u2019s first manic episode would only be the beginning of several incidents induced by work and insomnia. \u201cA number of my episodes after that revolved around working on film projects. It would be kind of the same scenario. I\u2019d be really jazzed up and excited,\u201d he explains. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t sleep and wouldn\u2019t sleep less, and would start getting delusional. When you\u2019re sleep deprived and you start getting a little loopy, it\u2019s kind of like that. It took me quite a while to accept that.\u201dGreg Dicharry takes audience questions after SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT\u2019s recent screening at the Louisiana International Film Festival in Baton Rouge, La.Those mood swings persisted, as did Dicharry\u2019s reluctance to come to terms with his mental illness. \u201dWhat I had experienced with the mental health stuff was that I knew it sounded crazy to people, but nonetheless it was very real to me. It was difficult for people to tell me that it was a disorder because it was so real to me.\u201dEqually strong was Dicharry\u2019s misguided belief that he could keep smoking marijuana. \u201cI had done a variety of drugs, like a lot of cocaine over the years, but the marijuana was the one thing I thought I could never quit.\u201dMore episodes would follow, as would more stays in psychiatric hospitals (over 12, according to Dicharry). After moving to Arizona, Dicharry thought that his life was getting back on track. He had a new job, and a new apartment. Yet, he still had his demons. Having suffered another breakdown, Dicharry returned from his latest involuntary hospital stay in desperate shape. Soon, he pleaded for a sign from above.\u201cThey\u2019re about to evict me. My apartment\u2019s psychotically painted. I lost my job. I fell to my knees, saying \u2018God, please help me.\u2019 What became crystal clear was that similar kind of voice, very real-sounding or just that whole feeling was \u2018help yourself\u2019,\u201d describes Dicharry. \u201cAt that time, I just chuckled. It showed me that something was there, but it also just registered because I had not been willing to help myself on a consistent basis for so long.\u201dWith his filmmaking career postponed, Dicharry focused on rebuilding his life through a special peer support program designed to help those suffering from mental illness transition into the work force.\u201cYou could go through this training and maybe get a job,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just going to think it was to do a part time job to supplement my social security. I went through this training program, and I ended up being hired to this agency to do a training program help people get jobs and keep jobs.\u201dSUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT co-director Greg Dicharry, in front of the U.S. Capitol.After overseeing that program for several years, Dicharry would later join health care firm Magellan Health in a newly created position: that of its national youth empowerment director. Dicharry saw it as the perfect opportunity to blend his personal work experience with the mentally ill with his skills in filmmaking.\u201cAround that time, I got a video camera again and I started filming a lot of things with the youth. They did a lot of presentations and events,\u201d Dicharry replies. \u201cIn 2010, I was able to edit together this short 5-minute video of the youth program. Then, I was able to do some PSA\u2019s for work. Things kind of started melding a little bit. I did little projects over the years.\u201dDicharry would soon meet Hines, who was actively working on a project of his own. \u201cIt was Kevin\u2019s idea to do a documentary, and to do (Suicide: The Ripple Effect). He had been working with another guy for a little while. Initially, it was us three. The guy had sort of fallen off, and together we crafted the different story, elements and ideas. It was amazing working with him, and seeing the kind of impact he has on people.\u201dHines would, in turn, have a significant impact on Dicharry; something he experienced first-hand while working alongside Hines on the film. \u201cHe\u2019s on the road constantly giving speeches, and on top of that, he\u2019s out there helping people one-on-one who get connected with him, call him, and reach out to him,\u201d Dicharry notes. \u201cIt definitely was inspiring and really cool to meet the people that were involved in the scenario, and seeing how much they\u2019ve been impacted by his story, and where he\u2019s at now.\u201dKevin Hines tells his powerful story of surviving a suicide attempt in the acclaimed documentary SUICIDE: THE RIPPLE EFFECT, co-directed by Hines and Baton Rouge filmmaker Greg Dicharry.Working with Hines on Suicide: The Ripple Effect hasn\u2019t just been a mere collaboration for Dicharry. He feels that it\u2019s just one more step in his own life-changing journey.\u201cMy film career was something I had always dreamed of since I was a little kid. I was very confident that I would be successful at it,\u201d explains DiCharry. \u201cIt (filmmaking) was ripped from me, not that I was super successful or anything, but that whole field was pulled from me largely by my own doing. Nonetheless, that loss was a grieving process. Getting back to doing an actual full feature film that\u2019s going to be seen by people is pretty cool.\u201dSome people say that movies have changed their lives. Others say that movies have saved their lives. As Dicharry and Hines see it, Suicide: The Ripple Effect is the rare film that does both. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to reach as many people as possible, and to help build a movement of hope and healing. It\u2019s not just a film. It\u2019s a film and a movement. That\u2019s really the thing,\u201d Dicharry says, adding that Suicide: The Ripple Effect is only the beginning of that movement.\u201cWe (Dicharry, Hines and the filmmakers) are reaching the people who are in need, or who might be in crisis, or who might be on the verge of suicide. We also want to reach the family members and loved ones, so that parents, teachers and people know what signs to look out for, what questions to ask, and how to help people get help. If we can tell a story and have it be entertaining, but also have it save lives, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201dThe official trailer for Suicide: The Ripple Effect can be seen here:Suicide: The Ripple Effect\u2019s web site offers important contact information for worldwide organizations dedicated to preventing suicide, including for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Because of this, the foundation set aside 20 billion STR to periodically give away to BTC/XRP holders. Comments from Stellar.org on the program details:\u201cDecentralized payment network Stellar has announced the final round of its Bitcoin-Lumen Program, where Bitcoin holders can claim its lumen token for free.The program, which began in April 2016, features 19 percent of the total lumen supply, which developers reserved at launch exclusively for Bitcoin users.Of the 19 bln lumens on offer, only 3 bln formed the first round of the giveaway, that was concluded in October 2016. with release details of the remaining 16 bln to be officially announced on March 28.The value of the remaining tokens is approximately $16 mln.\u201dThe STR claim for XRP/BTC holders will end two-months after it begins:\u201cOn June 27th, 2017, we will make available these lumens to any bitcoin holder who wants them, including those that received lumens during the first giveaway round\u201d, says the company in its circular.Seems pretty altruistic and cool, but as you can see in the picture above there is a major increase in the STR volume and price. Cryptocurrency \u2018pump and dumps\u2019 seem to be occurring far too often and those that get sucked into them without knowing how to hedge from the risk can get harmed badly. Here is the original post I found about the giveaway:\u201cBitcoin Holders Can Claim Free 16 Bln Stellar Lumen Tokens\u201dThe Stellar.org link to claim your STRSo, STR has clearly seen a bump up in price the last week per the picture above. It may be a speculation, but there is a major pump going on across Bitcoin (BTC), Stellar (STR), and Ripple (XRP) right now and XRP just passed up Ethereum (ETH) in market capitalization\u2026what\u2019s going to happen here? Looks like a potential mess waiting to happen if you\u2019re not aware of what may be some of the major driving factors.Has anyone participated in a giveaway like this before?In order to protect ourselves as cryptocurrency holders and members of the Steem community, will a 19 billion STR giveaway affect other cryptocurrencies?How might this affect STEEM?Currently, there are only 9 billion STR in circulation.Will this cause massive decreases in STR/BTC/XRP prices once the STR is distributed to BTC/XRP holders?Will STR prices see a decrease in price considering the inflow of coins? Or will we see an opportunistic pumper come in and manipulate?What will happen with other currencies that are dependent on BTC/ETH?I enjoy writing about current and thought provoking happenings along with spreading awareness for specific events like this. Steemit is an awesome community to be a part of so far and I\u2019m excited to connect with more Steemians!!

Major investors and crypto enthusiasts were a bit optimistic after the reversal of cryptocurrency ban by the tech giant Facebook. But unfortunately, nothing positive happened, other cryptocurrencies are following the same downfall as the \u201cPied Piper was being followed by the rat\u201d.Let\u2019s point out the major reasons for the plague in the cryptocurrency.#1BTC has almost had a massive downfall and reached below $6000 mark. As of now Bitcoin is trading at $5895.13. Bitcoin price nearly fell by 0.11% after the South Korean Exchange attack. Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin cash had fallen by 0.5% or more. The historical data from the coinmarketcap shows that there had been decline of nearly $3,00,000,000 in market cap from 8th to 11th of June, 2018.#2The cryptocurrency price fluctuations are to be expected with such a nascent market, according to Matthew Newton, an analyst at the trading platform eToro.The reality is that emerging technologies carrying radically new ideas will always see swings in their value,\u201d Mr Newton told The Independent.\u201cMarket adjustments as we have seen over the past months can help to stabilise prices and move the industry towards a more robust, sophisticated regime. This is good for the long-term future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, giving the industry time to develop.\u201d#3Other factors which might have contributed to the sudden downfall of the crypto market might be the regulatory measures introduced in Japan. Bitflyer, the local exchange aggregator announced that they wouldn\u2019t accept new customers due to the regulations imposed by the Financial Services Agency in Japan.#4Even Ripple suffered heavy loses, major reason being the South korean hack, trading at $0.431157 as of now, wherein the percentage decrease in the last one hour is 0.10%. Ethereum suffered a more tremendous fall, trading now at $411.43, with the percentage decrease in 0.25% in the last hour.Cryptocurrencies can\u2019t catch a break this week as more negative news continues to crowd the market.Traders woke up to the news that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has seized more than $20 million in bitcoin from illicit weapons and narcotics traders on the Darknet, shrouding the cryptocurrency market in a negative light again.#5One more reason is AliBaba\u2019s chairman Jack Ma\u2019s statement where he advises traders against Bitcoin saying that \u201cthe digital coin is a bubble will burst.\u201dSpeaking at a launch event for a new online-payment service for real-time cash transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines, he said: \u201cTechnology itself isn\u2019t the bubble, but bitcoin likely is.About CoinSwitchCoinSwitch is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange aggregator.

This fund was established to support companies that want to pioneer with blockchain. Xpring has announced this week that it wants to invest no less than $100 million in blockchain gaming.Making the game economy more realisticRipple guarantees this amount but it is managed by Forte. This company has only been in existence for a month and is developing blockchain products and platforms for the gaming industry. Forte\u2019s CEO, Kevin Chou, founded the mobile gaming company Kabam, and Forte\u2019s co-founder, Brett Seyler, worked for GarageGames, Unity and Beyond Games.The ultimate goal of the partnership between Ripple and Forte is to make in-game economies more realistic. Games must closely reflect the real world by using blockchain technology.Ripple invests in gaming for a reason. The idea is that XRP will be used in all these in-game economies. Allegedly even that $100 million is paid in XRP.Use between different blockchainsIn order for such an in-game economy to succeed, a few important conditions must be met. It is extremely important that gamers actually own their assets. Blockchain can facilitate this with non-fungible tokens. This is a difficult word for non-exchangeable tokens, each token is unique and can be linked to ownership. These one-of-a-kind tokens can then be processed into smart contracts for buying, selling or trading.Forte wants to build a protocol together with Xpring that makes it possible to send coins between different blockchains. Suppose Fifa has its own blockchain and so does Tetris, you should be able to spend the same coin in both games. Ultimately, that must take the form of a wallet that is integrated into old and new games.\u201cBlockchain technology has the potential to improve games and help developers run better and more successful game economies, but for many developers, it is difficult to develop and implement,\u201d the accompanying press release says.\u201cThe Forte platform makes it easy for developers to apply blockchain technology to their games, increasing engagement and revenue generation with their players.\u201dAuthor: Marko Vidrih@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

After that, the rollback began, and now the capitalization is up again on $272,4 billion.Volatility falls, while the dynamics of volumes suggests that interest in a number of coins still remains. Therefore, the current decline looks natural and fits into the framework of correction.BitcoinBTC after growth at the end of last week is consolidating at the achieved levels. Now prices have gone beyond the lower limit of the trading range, which forced us to temporarily cover short-term positions. Immediate support is around $8,350, but there is a possibility that quotation will fall to the blue line, which is why a new entry point may be formed after correction or in case of a breakdown of $8,800.EthereumAt ETH, the bulls could not overcome the resistance that lies in the area of \u200b\u200btwo-week highs; at the moment there is also a downward trend. The immediate goal is located in the area of \u200b\u200bthe blue trend line. If at the level of the blue line buyers are activated and the volumes grow, you can try to open a small long position with a short stop, but it is worth remembering that the dynamics of the coin is largely subject to general market sentiment.RippleXRP quote has grown, but have not yet been able to reach the target level of $0.48, and together with the market, as part of the correction, they are rolling back to the levels of the beginning of the week. A protective order for profit taking is placed at the level of $0.418, in the case of a breakdown of which there is a high probability that the price will fall to the blue trend line.EOSAt EOS, a beautiful technical picture emerged, on Monday, overcame the $6.9 level, which we noted as the key one for the new trading series from purchases, after which the momentum continued to $8.17. After a slight consolidation, there is a decrease in the correction, in connection with which the position is temporarily covered. As in the case of other instruments, the blue line may become the target of decline, but it is worthwhile to closely monitor the possible formation of new pivotal points on the chart or the continuation of the trend: the coin shows rapid growth rates compared to most other altcoins and there is a high probability that such dynamics will continue.LitecoinIn LTC above $115, long tails began to appear on the chart, after which the quote along with the market went sideways. The blue trend line is very close, so you can place a stop in case of its breakdown. However, since the coin also showed leading dynamics over the last week, we believe that it would be more correct to maintain the opportunity to earn an additional profit, therefore, we hold the position with a stop below the red line.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Only it likely won\u2019t do any of those things.Not the First AnythingIn order to understand why Tidal likely won\u2019t make good on any of the things Jay Z and his companions have promised, one needs to understand how the music industry works. First, let\u2019s get something out of the way that\u2019s been bugging me since I heard it during the launch party last night: \u201cTidal is the first ever artist-owned music service.\u201dNo it\u2019s not. NoiseTrade has been around since 2006, and was founded by singer/songwriter (that means artist) Derek Webb. So already it\u2019s clear that the Tidal team needs to do a better job of researching their claims before making them.No, It\u2019s Really Not \u201cArtist-Owned\u201dNext, the phrase \u201cartist-owned service\u201d is nice and poetic, but it\u2019s frankly wholly untrue in this respect. Let\u2019s examine the laundry list of artists now attached to the Tidal moniker and company:Jay Z \u2014 Signed to Roc Nation (which he owns, and which had distribution deals with Sony Music (2009\u20132013) and Universal Music (2013-present)Rihanna \u2014 Signed to Roc Nation (see above)Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 Signed to Columbia (which is owned by Sony Music)Alicia Keys \u2014 Signed to RCA (which is owned by Universal Music Group)Daft Punk \u2014 Signed to Columbia (which is owned by Sony Music)Madonna \u2014 Signed to Interscope (which is owned by Universal Music Group)Kanye West \u2014 Signed to Def Jam (which is owned by Universal Music Group)I could go on, but you get the point. This is not the \u201cfirst ever artist-owned music service.\u201d Frankly, it\u2019s not really even \u201cartist-owned;\u201d it\u2019s \u201clabel-owned by extension.\u201d Let\u2019s call it how it is, and pretending that these major label artists are independent operators is to fabricate an ideal (but false) reality. While it looks as if these artists belong to a whole slew of different labels, as my previous post on major label monopolies shows, this is a misleading thought process as they are more or less all owned by the Big Three. If anyone thinks that any of these artists will have the power to do things outside the interests of the three major record labels, they\u2019re dreaming.The Big Three Major Labels and Their Subjects; Sony (blue), Universal (green), and Warner (red)Basically the Same LayoutNext, let\u2019s talk about why the business model of Tidal is fanciful and unrealistic. TechCrunch reported earlier some details demonstrating that Tidal\u2019s layout and functionality are basically a ripoff of Spotify\u2019s layout. From what I\u2019ve heard, Tidal basically copped Spotify\u2019s layout, changed the colors, and added a few tweaks \u2014 but it\u2019s not really all that different.Married to An Obsolete Business ModelIn terms of business model, what seems to make Tidal the most different is its decision not to offer a free tier (as Spotify and most other music services do). Rather, they will offer a high-quality lossless music experience for $20/month, and a downgraded, \u201cpremium\u201d lower quality experience for the same $10/month that Spotify and other services charge (which, by the way, is an obsolete business model anyway). Jay Z and others at Tidal are banking on the hope that the rabid music fans out there will want to pay more money for higher quality music, in addition to more exclusive content on the Tidal service first. While some music fans may in fact do this, it\u2019s not a scalable hope because those fans are not the majority of music listeners.Also, note that I said \u201cmore exclusive content on the Tidal service first\u201c \u2014 which means it will definitely be available on other services too, just maybe a week or two later. And why not? Do you really think that the major labels who work with these artists are going to forego any revenue stream, just to keep Tidal more exclusive than the rest?? I don\u2019t.Tidal logoSo basically Tidal is going to offer the same major label music that is available everywhere else (including on non-music centered services like YouTube), but they\u2019re going to nix the free tier (where most of Spotify\u2019s conversions come from anyway) altogether and double the going rate for a monthly subscription. All the while, they will be aiming their service at a more niche market while providing non-niche music. Here\u2019s my reality based on my experience in the music industry: high-fi, low-fi, it really doesn\u2019t matter if your business model is outdated and your marketing strategy is insufficient for an overcrowded market. But yeah, this will definitely end well.An Unscalable Model and Too Many Cooks in the KitchenLet\u2019s move on, and I can\u2019t believe no one has really focused in on this, especially those within the tech community (though it was mentioned a bit in the TechCrunch report): Jay Z has enticed these other major label names into becoming a part of this service not by offering them money up front, but by actually giving them equity percentages of the company. As reports that the equity numbers hover somewhere around 3%, this is an admirable shot by Jay Z. He\u2019s trying to tie those artists\u2019 respective loyalties to Tidal by making the service\u2019s benefits their benefits. If Tidal does well and goes up in value, so do their stakes.There are only two problems with this: 1) it\u2019s not scalable, and 2) too many cooks in the kitchen. In an industry (tech startups) where founders are always told to limit the number of cofounders (the \u201ctoo many cooks in the kitchen\u201d nightmare\u201d), Jay Z has amazingly disregarded the whole thought process and it seems no one has really noticed. What\u2019s more, conducting company decisions in a \u201ctown hall\u201d style is going to spell disaster for Tidal; you just can\u2019t run a company like that. There needs to be one captain at the helm of a ship; any more and the ship will capsize. Also, keep in mind many of these artists don\u2019t even work well with others in the studio \u2014 now they\u2019re all going to run a company together? Right.So to recap: unscalable business model and too many cooks in the kitchen.More Dedicated to the Needs of Which Artists?While I admire the desire by Jay Z and others to create a service that is more dedicated to \u201cthe needs and rights of artists,\u201d let\u2019s also be clear which artists those people are. They are not the artists the world-over who are coming up and trying to find their fanbases; they are the artists who already have legions of fans all over the world. We\u2019re not talking about the girl from Minnesota who wants to be an R&B singer, or the punk band from Toronto who want to find their core fanbase. We are talking about (mostly) pop, rap, hip-hop, R&B, pop-rock, and other well-known stars who want to extend their control beyond their music to dip their toes in the music-tech industry.I\u2019m only critical because these are exactly the kinds of artists who really don\u2019t need help right now. They have enough money, and even if they hop from label to label, their fans will follow. They have already found their fanbases and core listeners. It doesn\u2019t matter which label or service they\u2019re on, those fans will still find them and listen to their new albums and go see them on tour. So basically this is yet another rehashing of the same major label music that we\u2019re already drowning in anyway. And while I\u2019m a fan of some of these artists myself, I nonetheless am critical of what appears to be another desperate money grab. As the following screenshots demonstrate, though Jay Z and others may not see it that way, the point is that most of their fans will ( and do):Comment from BuzzFeed coverage of the Tidal release, number 1Comment from BuzzFeed coverage of the Tidal release, number 2Comment from BuzzFeed coverage of the Tidal release, number 3Comment from BuzzFeed coverage of the Tidal release, number 4Comment from BuzzFeed coverage of the Tidal release, number 5If these artists really wanted to distance themselves from the major labels and the current music business dynamic, they would look for ways to explore other paradigms, rather than look for ways to make an obsolete system work.In the EndIn the end, I commend these artists for taking a step into a new arena, but I question their motives and the realities surrounding Tidal as a company. Personally, I think Jay Z way overpaid for Aspiro, and is seeking to build a service that really only artists (and that is to say a select kind of artist) will really appreciate and use. I don\u2019t think that Tidal sets itself apart enough to really take over the demographics targeted by either Spotify, Apple Beats, or even SoundCloud. I think it\u2019s a lot of bluster, but without any real solid business prospects. Only time will tell, but I think that Tidal is going to have a very tough time right out of the gate. We\u2019ll see if Tidal is part of a rising tide, or simply another ankle-slapper service.Originally published at adammarxsmind.wordpress.com on March 31, 2015.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Music", "Tech", "Business", "Streaming"]}, {"title": "Ripple\u2019s Chief Market Strategist: \u2018Our Main Competition Is Called SWIFT.

Exxon Mobile has a vested interest in seeing that oil is successful, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it is the same thing.\u201d\u201cWe are an enterprise software company for financial institutions.\u201dSuccesses of Ripple During 2018\u201cWe had the best 1st quarter the company has ever had.\u201d\u201cWe signed more deals, we got more companies into production\u2026 we signed all kinds of companies\u2026 remittance companies, banks, financial institutions all over the world\u2026 deals coming probably every six days instead of every six weeks like a year ago\u2026 and yet XRP had the worst quarter we\u2019ve ever had\u2026 So I would argue that they are very much separated.\u201dHow Does Ripple Convince Banks to Sign Up?\u201cWe are already there. We have products in the marketplace. We have got\u2026 over 100 financial institutions using our software right now\u2026 we have moved over a billion dollars across the Ripple network.\u201d\u201cOur competition is this banking consortium that came together in 1973\u2026 It\u2019s called SWIFT\u2026 You know what it isn\u2019t? It is not \u2018swift\u2019! It takes 3\u20135 days to move money\u2026 It\u2019s one-dimensional messaging\u2026 It has about a 4% error rate\u2026 You send a message to move money, and then you wait, and maybe you get something back\u2026 It\u2019s more akin to a homing pigeon than a text message or email.\u201d\u201cThe results we hear back are enormously positive.\u201dWhy Does the Ripple Ecosystem Excite the XRP HODLers So Much?\u201cI think that XRP is, in some ways, Crypto 2.0.\u201d\u201cBitcoin may be the Napster of this technology, where it opened our eyes to what is possible, but the failings of the technology also became apparent.\u201d\u201cThe creators of XRP looked at the possibilities of Bitcoin, and said \u2018Wow, this could be awesome, but this could fall on its face. And so they created something that was a 2.0, a solution to a lot f the problems for Bitcoin. And they did that before they had the imagination of a use case.\u201dWhy There Is So Much FUD Around XRP\u201cBecause people who understand it and who have made a bet somewhere, want to see the other things fail.\u201d\u201cI think there are Bitcoin maximalists who hate XRP because it is not Bitcoin.\u201d\u201cI there are ether holders who hate XRP because hold ether.\u201d\u201cI think there are bloggers and wanna-be journalists\u2026 [who are] biased because they are holding some of these assets and not the others, and by definition, that puts them in a place where they can\u2019t honestly divorce themselves from hoping something is successful and something else isn\u2019t.\u201dBanks Adoption of xCurrent and xRapid\u201cOne of clever things that Ripple did long before I arrived was to create some software that instead of espousing the virtues of anarchy, said that we are creating software for banks that sits behind the bank\u2019s firewalls\u2026 it\u2019s just that the software sits underneath their system, and moves things faster, and that starts to get banks comfortable with our xCurrent product. It\u2019s simply a messaging product, doesn\u2019t use XRP or crypto at all, and I think that the banks can then start to get comfortable with \u2018Oh wow, how can we take this to the next level\u2019, and then maybe they start to use our xRapid product and that will engage them in the world of XRP.\u201dSource", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Btc", "ICO", "Token", "SEC"]}, {"title": "An Overview About RIPPLE", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@theblockchain999/an-overview-about-ripple-d3869d5d28cd?source=search_post", "author_name": "The Blockchain 999", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@theblockchain999", "publish_date": "2018-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-08", "readtime": "3.66", "claps": 199, "voters": 4, "content": "An Overview About RIPPLEThe Blockchain 999FollowSep 8, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readLet\u2019s find out what Ripple isRipple coin (XRP) is a real-time payment system (RTGS) or Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple Protocol. It\u2019s an open source distribution system that is in the beta stage. Many people still think that ripple is the generic name of a digital electronic money. The ripple network was launched in 2012 with the goal of making it easy for people to use banking, paypal, credit cards or financial institutions at an extremely low cost with a fast speed. Ripple uses blockchain chaining technology similar to the Bitcoin virtual currency, which helps accelerate the pace of financial transactions between banks.Ripple development teamRipple coin / protocol was developed and developed by OpenCoin, which : Chris Larsen is chief executive officer and chief technology officer Jed McCaleb. Larsen is the co-founder and also the chief financial officer of E-LOAN and finally, McCaleb is from Mt. Gox. Plus, many other members of the Ripple are experts in virtual currency research, especially they are very knowledgeable about the Bitcoin platform.Is Ripple a replicate of Bitcoin ?It\u2019s a sure thing that while learning about Ripple, many people will wonder is Ripple the same with Bitcoin virtual currency? The answer is \u201cthey have some mutual points \u201c. For example, the XRP unit of the Ripple is a digital based pre-type that works on mathematical formulas and limited release quantities. Both Bitcoin and Ripple use peer-to-peer P2P networks, which means that transactions do not require third party interference. Along with that, the anti-counterfeiting or inflation of these two currencies is similar.However, the reason of Ripple being created was to support Bitcoin, not to become a competitor. The Ripple network is designed to serve currency transfers seamlessly, whether it\u2019s any of the national currencies: USD, British Pound, Euro or even Bitcoin.XRP is a distributed network so it does not depend on any company or organization to manage, so the data and transaction information are guaranteed to be safe, without waiting for confirmation that can go over the network quickly.Ripple\u2019s ratingAccording to the developers of Ripple, there will be about 100 billion XRPs released, half will be held by the company, the other half will be circulated in the market. When KriptoA were writing this article, the price of the Ripple is $ 0.167788 and has a total market capitalization of more than $ 6 billion, which is more than 3 million BTC.The Price Of RippleIf you are interested in this type of currency, you can monitor the rate of Ripple in every single day to understand the price fluctuation of it. Keeping update the latest news about ripple or Bitcoin, as the ripple price will be directly affected by such market information as well as Bitcoin pricing.The attraction of Ripple to large banks all around the worldTalking about partners of Ripple, we can give you some big names such as Google, IDG Capital Partners, Anderssen or AME Cloud Ventures. Ripple has so far reached $ 93 million- an extremely impressive number for a start-up company set up in 2012. According to the Coindesk site, the amount of money Ripple is ranked 4th in the segment of the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Services. The value of the Ripple has increased by more than 25% after announcing that it had raised $ 55 million- Forrtune magazine .Ripple\u2019s global high-flyRipple\u2019s Ceo- Mr. Chris Larsen, said that RIpple is rapidly allocating funds to global stature plans.Here\u2019s a his answer in the interview with CNBC:\u201cWe are expanding the areas where we have offices. Ripple wants to expand further and develop capabilities for new groups. We are rushing to recruit more, and increase the number of programmers to work directly with partner banks in their own country. Only then can we offer the best solutions to our partners. \u201cFollowing the newly established office in Luxemburg, the next destination that Ripple is targeting is Frankfurt (Germany) and Singapore and many other destinations. We have chosen these two sayings from Chris Larsen in order to help you understand more about his ambition :Luxembourg Prime Minister Mr.Xavier Bettel (left side) visits Ripple\u2019s newly opened office\u201cOnce networked devices are on the increase period, in the internet age, small payments across borders will increase\u201d \u201c Banks will need Ripples to solve their problems \u201c .He also said that they are starting to implement a plan to help smaller startup groups in the same field with the goal of global development.After reading this, we hope you will understand more about Ripple, hope you have a good day !", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Btc", "Ripple", "Ripple Coin"]}, {"title": "Ripple & Google \u2014 Will Google Bring XRP to $500?", "post_link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/ripple-google-will-google-bring-xrp-to-500-e76226fb1d8b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2018-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-18", "readtime": "5.86", "claps": 60, "voters": 4, "content": "Ripple & Google \u2014 Will Google Bring XRP to $500?Marko VidrihFollowDec 22, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readOne notable news is currently spreading in the networks of cryptocurrency fans: a large American corporation has a strong interest in cryptocurrency and could even catapult it to $500 per coin. We are talking about the cryptocurrency Ripple, which has an interest of banks, and the Google, Silicon Valley corporation.But how could Ripple be useful to Google?How do Ripple and Google fit together?Interestingly, Google has been working with Ripple Labs for some time. Together, the developers work on a fast and cost-effective transfer form. After all, in the networking world, it will become increasingly important to transfer money.This is where the Ripple Blockchain comes in, because it is just as fast as Visa\u2019s payment processing system, and it does about 1500 transactions per second. The costs are enormously favorable with 0.0004 US dollar per execution. This offers great cost savings and many benefits to customers and dealers worldwide.That new payment methods, in addition to cash and credit cards, are becoming increasingly popular, shows the new pay variants of Apple, Alibaba, and Co.Google has also launched its service Google Pay. Here, customers deposit from their normal credit card or the Paypal account and can now pay with their mobile phone in the shop or restaurant. To further develop this method, make it faster and cheaper, both companies can benefit from each other.Amir Sarhangi from Google to RippleSarhangi has been working on the search engine since 2015 and is now set to build the RippleNet \u2014 the global payment network of the cryptocurrency. A promising message for Ripple and certainly is not that bad for Google.After all, everything indicates that the two partners could interlock more and more, and thereby revolutionize global payment transactions. This would benefit both sides and their investors. Most recently, however, the prices of the two companies fell slightly. But Wall Street and the cryptocurrency market are going through a difficult time in general. That\u2019s not because of the two companies themselves.What Effect Does This Have on the Ripple Course?In December 2018, the Ripple coin \u2014 also called XRP \u2014 listed as the second most valuable cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of about $12.5 billion at $0.295 per coin. Now insiders of the crypto scene put forward the bold thesis that an XRP could soon be worth $500. That would be an increase in the value of 169,931 percent! An invested $1 could, therefore, be worth $169,931.Even if this increase in value sounds rather utopian: There were already strong value gains in cryptocurrencies. And even if the Ripple only rose to one-tenth of the total, $50 per XRP, many investors would be doing the business of a lifetime.And such an increase seems to be possible due to the networking of the company in the business world. The recent news was that the Saudi National Bank (NCB) tested the Ripple system and found it to be good. Now the bank uses the xCurrent system to make cross-border payments, mainly to North America and Asia.The trick is that the bank would not use the system if it was bad or did not work. xCurrent aims to improve the already existing system of cross-border payments.The next step is to implement xRapid. This system is Ripples\u2019 premium offering and is expected to reduce the cost of cross-border payments by 40 to 70 percent, according to companies that tested the system.As a result, the ripple price is expected to continue to rise in the future, though it is currently on a dry spell, like most other cryptocurrencies. The advantages are obvious: On the one hand, the cryptocurrency has real potential for use in global payment transactions. Many cryptocurrencies exist simply as a speculative object or for value preservation. But you can not do something productive with them.In addition, the Microsoft founder and billionaire Bill Gates also relies on the technology of the bank cryptocurrency with his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. By working with Google and many banks such as the Spanish financial house Santander or the credit card company American Express, the the XRP should gain in value.Another advantage is that there is no Ripple mining. Mining is the process by which computers\u2019 computing power verifies and validates the payments and activities of the network. If a calculation task is solved, the blockchain is extended and new coins are created. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum work that way.All ever available XRP in the amount of 99.991.757.426 already exist. There are no new ones created. With supply already set and demand rising, the price will sooner or later increase.Where Could There Be More Potential?We have already seen how the cryptocurrency can advance the search engine giant. And how is it the other way around? On the one hand, the tech giant is already financing the crypto company, on the other hand, there is certainly an exchange of ideas and also a transfer of skilled workers. So good developers from Google go to Ripple or vice versa.This is likely to boost both Google\u2019s share price \u2014 it\u2019s now called alphabet on the stock market. On the other hand, the corporate value of Ripple and therefore also of the currency XRP increases. Ripple and XRP are not the same things.How does Ripple work? It is a technology company that specializes in digital payments. It has been written on the flag to revolutionize international payments. So the payments should be much cheaper and eventually the money in real time change the owner.Through globalization, companies offer their products and services worldwide. Services like xCurrent or xRapid can help with that.Fun fact: One of the most common Google searches worldwide in 2018 was \u201chow to buy Ripple\u201d. This question shows that interest is increasing worldwide. But you can also see that the technological understanding is not yet fully developed. Finally, as discussed above, investors can only buy XRP. But this knowledge will continue to spread in the future.Especially through cooperation, as in this example. XRP is just a kind of lubricant for the system and not to be confused with ripple. This is a technology company that finances itself by issuing and selling XRP tokens. In the best case, both the enterprise value and the value of the cryptocurrency increase.What Are Investors Doing Now?To buy ripple or not? Well, the cryptocurrencies are currently in a bear market. This means that many more people want to sell than buy and the prices are down. However, this circumstance can offer opportunities for risk-averse investors. After all, the Ripple news is good, as can be seen in the example with Google.Other corporations will certainly seek cooperation and thus expand technology and business. So if you want to invest, you can do that right now, but rather with small amounts. At the moment the market is in bad shape. But if you take chances and buy as soon as prices stabilize, you can do good business.What Is the Future Between Ripple and Google?In the future, Google and Ripple could push a lot, in which it incorporates the payment options for its own offers. For example, public transport offers could be directly integrated via Google Maps and paid for in real time via XRP. Also, transactions for the fleet of autonomous cars of the California Tech giant could profit similarly from machine-to-machine-Payment similar to IOTA.Here machines are supposed to pay each other without people being interposed. In the network of the search engine group, there are numerous applications. As soon as the technology is ready, it will certainly be used. Finally, this contributes to an increase in value on all sides.But even Ripple itself could fuel Google and that, by building the new payment system of the future together with the group. After all, billions of people around the world are already using free services.So why not pair these services with an almost free and very fast payment system? How lucrative is that for retailers and businesses when payments arrive immediately? Much better than waiting for days for the money.What Are the Advantages of Ripple?Among the followers of cryptocurrencies, the XRM remains controversial. While many coins and tokens, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin or EOS, are focused on decentralizing payments, Ripple works closely with banks.An advantage or a disadvantage? In the crypto scene a disadvantage, because people just want to make those instances like banks obsolete. But in the real economy and for the future development of the company undoubtedly an advantage.Through the collaboration, Ripple will push Google and himself. A successful future for XRP seems far more likely than many other cryptocurrencies.Author: Marko Vidrih @cryptomarks@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

Like many other cryptocurrencies, there was an inflow of funds from bitcoin, and incidentally, like many other cryptocurrencies, XRP witnessed the quintessential crypto pump and dump on April 2 when the prices skyrocketed to as high as $0.069, almost thrice the price it traded a day before.Source: CoinmarketcapIn order to better understand XRP Market dynamics and Ripple\u2019s perspective on XRP pricing, we had a brief conversation with Mr. Miguel Vias, Ripple\u2019s Head of XRP Markets, who is probably best positioned to comment on the fluctuations in XRP over last quarter.LTP: As per the report, BTC funds saw an inflow into XRP. Can\u2019t it be seen as a dependency on bitcoin, a highly volatile market? Does Ripple have any plans to de-couple XRP prices with BTC?Find out more here.Miguel: Interestingly, the correlation between XRP and BTC is quite low, so I think about the relationship less like a dependency on BTC price action, and more as the most direct path for money to flow into XRP markets. Because XRP has relatively fewer fiat listings, the entry at the moment is BTC, regardless of what its price does. So when there is positive XRP news, the market is likely to move into XRP from BTC. As more XRP fiat pairs are listed, and more payments transfer through XRP, there will be an increase in fiat liquidity and we should see the BTC flows relatively decrease.LTP: As per the report, off-ledger activity for XRP has increased in 2017. Does Ripple have a plan to shield XRP from any \u201cpump and dump\u201d activities rampant on cryptocurrency exchanges?Miguel: Erratic price activity is often a symptom of less than optimal liquidity. As markets mature, volume increases and volatility decreases as a direct result of that volume. So while we have no plans to actively dampen price movements, a direct consequence of our strategy to increase liquidity should be more stable markets.LTP: Can you briefly elaborate on the aforementioned systematic markets operation program? Would love to understand how it works.Miguel: Unfortunately, besides what I shared in the report, I can\u2019t give too many details on that program at the moment.LTP: Can you briefly elaborate on Ripple\u2019s future plans towards providing a viable alternative to SWIFT?Miguel: I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as \u201cfuture\u201d plans, as we currently provide a viable, and superior, alternative to SWIFT. Using Ripple\u2019s solution, financial institutions can coordinate funds movement across multiple ledgers to remove all settlement risk and minimize delays in the payment process. Additionally, with Ripple\u2019s bi-directional messaging, they can validate transactions before funds are transferred and confirm delivery of funds, ensuring straight through processing and negligible tracking and reconciliation effort. Lastly, as XRP liquidity grows, and Ripple fully integrates XRP support into its solution, financial institutions will be able to access on-demand liquidity, thus mitigating the dependency on nostro/vostro accounts.Continue reading here.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ripple", "Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain", "Fintech"]}, {"title": "The Quiet Death of Ripple\u2019s Codiu\u00a7 Project", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@heckerhut/the-quiet-death-of-ripple-s-codiu-project-782c11a17c02?source=search_post", "author_name": "Florian Glatz", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@heckerhut", "publish_date": "2015-06-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-03", "readtime": "5.56", "claps": 7, "voters": 4, "content": "The Quiet Death of Ripple\u2019s Codiu\u00a7 ProjectFlorian GlatzFollowJun 13, 2015 \u00b7 6 min readWhy decentralized infrastructure has still a long way to goRipple Labs Inc, steward of the Ripple Protocol and manager of the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, has quietly shelved the open source project Codius, which it had founded about a year ago and actively maintained ever since. Although the code was eventually versioned to a symbolic \u201c1.0\u201d, the project never gained much more than the curious attention of some hardcore enthusiasts.Now, Stefan Thomas, CTO of Ripple Labs, has outlined the future of Codius in a recent blog post:[\u2026] we\u2019ve realized that Codius is an optimization and \u2014 right now, with a small and nascent decentralization market \u2014 a premature one. We have no plans to work on a Codius 2.0, instead we are building our own decentralized applications \u201cmanually\u201d as described above.Of course, the code behind the Codius project is up for the taking to anyone able to type git clone. But the project didn\u2019t hit EOL prematurely because of a lack of developer resources \u2014 quite the contrary. Rather, the feedback of the community was simply not strong enough to justify the expenditure.Ripple Lab\u2019s decision is interesting for many reasons. Most importantly though, should this event be a warning to all those currently investing their time and money into building a global and decentralized infrastructure?The idea behind Codiu\u00a7Codius is an answer to the following question:How to execute software in an untrusted environment and still be able to trust whatever the software has computed?There are different ways to answer that question and each one comes with a specific set of systemic compromises. Codius was interesting in that it delivered a complementary set of such advantages and disadvantages vis-a-vis the popular Blockchain infrastructure that solves the problem of trusted code execution for networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and many more.Same Same But DifferentCodius too leverages the principle of distributed consensus to achieve the desired trust property of its system. However, whereas Bitcoin & Co build a completely separate communication infrastructure on top of the TCP/IP stack, thereby slowing the network\u2019s computational power down by a factor of ~10000, Codius leverages existing commodity webhosting infrastructure to run arbitrary code at normal speeds and at much cheaper cost than a \u201cVirtual Blockchain Computer\u201d could ever dream to accomplish.The difference lies in the size of the consensus pools when comparing Codius\u2019 and e.g. Bitcoin\u2019s consensus scheme. In the Codius world, there is no \u2018global\u2019 consensus pool as there is in Bitcoin, for the simple reason that a Codius pool does not drive a global payment network. A Codius consensus pool is better compared to >>YOU<< doing some google searches for the purpose of finding the cheapest vendor of a certain tech gadget you plan to purchase. Once you\u2019ve found enough websites referring e.g. to Amazon as the cheapest supplier of the desired product, you\u2019ll eventually settle on making your order in their store.Congratulations.You have reached an inner consensus.The number of google searches you would perform until you\u2019ve decided where to purchase can be roughly compared to the number of Codius instances you would spawn into a specific consensus pool, whose quorum decision you would entrust to perform certain sensitive operations in your name, such as ordering a product on amazon, or paying recurring subscription fees to various services.[1]Codius in a Blockchain Ecosystem: Local vs. GlobalIn order to understand the purpose that Codius was intended to serve in the wider Blockchain ecosystem, one has to understand the systemic limitations of the latter. For all the security that Blockchains are able to generate through their crypto-economic governance and incentive scheme, they suffer from inherent slowness when it comes to general-purpose computation[2], as well as from an inherent blindness when it comes to incorporating rich information about the outside world.This is where Codius\u2019 complementary infrastructure decisions unfold their beneficial value to Blockchain-driven networks. Whereas Blockchains are good at delivering global consensus among thousands to millions of nodes, Codius\u2019 solution is intended to deliver local consensus relevant only to specific individuals.[3]The affordances of local consensus schemes lie mainly in two areas:Computational Complexity and Data Richness.Since instances of the Codius execution environment are hosted on cheaply available infrastructure they can perform resource-intensive general-purpose computation at a fraction of the cost than a \u201cBlockchain Computer\u201d ever could. Same goes for incorporation of outside information, since unlike a Blockchain, a Codius instance has unfiltered access to the whole internet.From a Platform vs. Services perspective, the relationship between Blockchains and Codius looks like this:The Blockchain Platform Model as envisioned by CodiusIf you want to better understand the lower half of the graphic, I advise you to read this. This post focuses on the upper half, i.e. the Codius service layer.From a Blockchain-centric viewpoint, Codius constitutes, what is commonly referred as an \u201cOracle\u201d, i.e. an information gateway between a Blockchain and the outside world. Because the information feed provided by a given Codius oracle has been independently validated by a number of distributed instances, it serves to complement a Blockchain\u2019s inherent trust model.Why Codius\u2019 Trust Model failedIt is mostly unfair to claim that Codius\u2019 trust model really failed \u2014 rather: it has actually never been put to the test. The reason for this is what I initially hinted to as the \u201ccommunity feedback\u201d, which was in some sense lacking.An implicit yet fundamental requirement of Codius\u2019 trust-enabling infrastructure is the existence of a functioning ecosystem of competing hosting-providers that offer the execution of Codius-style containers/vm images. Only if such a market with a functioning competitive landscape is available, does the trust property of Codius\u2019 infrastructure emerge.[4]Codius\u2019 notion of validating outside information works by assuming that although not any singular Codius instance may be trusted, a certain majority quorum of independent instances may indeed be considered trustworthy. As it turns out, the requirement of independence equates to the existence of a complex market-based ecosystem for Codius-style infrastructure provision. An ecosystem that didn\u2019t evolve despite Ripple Labs\u2019s best efforts in terms of generating publicity for the project.What this means for the Decentralization LandscapeIn terms of interpreting Codius\u2019 early exit from the landscape of decentralized service providers, two things come to mind.Firstly, the difference between centralized and decentralized service provision is not valued by a significant share of consumers and businesses in and outside the wider Blockchain ecosystem. Just look at the existing market of centralized service providers for Blockchain-based networks, which is already struggling to find an audience for its products. Conceptually, a centralized service is still much easier to grasp than a decentralized one. Codius never even left the world of command line interfaces.Secondly, the difference between Codius-like oracles and classic centralized services providers is not just an \u201coptimization problem\u201d as Stefan Thomas likes to put it. It is connected the fundamental question of how much power we want to give to users and how much control should reside with the tech firms that increasingly regulate our daily lives.Footnotes[1] Personal Autonomous Agents anyone?[2] As opposed to the much more limited domain of fiduciary code, to which Blockchains are essentially limited to. There is currently no other, equally significant type of code in sight, which would justify the investment of similar economic resources as is done e.g. in the case of Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain, which runs the currency\u2019s internal fiduciary code).[3] Vitalik Buterin talks about three kinds of facts: (1) mathematical, (2) global and (3) local. Blockchains excell at (1) but are completely helpless regarding (2) and (3).[4] To the extent, the decision any miner or mining pool in the Bitcoin network implicitely or explicitely makes, namely whether to use its resources to serve or to attack the network, is an economic one, the same goes for hosters of codius instances. Therefore, only if the business of running such instances in an \u2018honest fashion\u2019 is economically more desirable than starting to tamper with the computational processees of individual instances (because the hoster somehow profits from a specific outcome), is the emergence of trust feasable.", "responses": 1, "tags": []}, {"title": "Facts & Rumors: What the Future Holds for Ripple (XRP)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@RezaJafery/facts-rumors-what-the-future-holds-for-ripple-xrp-69b5179413b4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Reza Jafery", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@RezaJafery", "publish_date": "2017-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-07", "readtime": "1.94", "claps": 121, "voters": 4, "content": "Facts & Rumors: What the Future Holds for Ripple (XRP)Reza JaferyFollowDec 19, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readA famous mantra in trading is, \u201cBuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d.Currently, there are lots of rumors lurking on the interwebz about Ripple, as well as some confirmed information regarding the company.The FactsOn Friday, banks in South Korea and Japan started testing Ripple in hopes that it can cut their same-day transfer costs down by 30% at least. [1]If all goes well, Ripple\u2019s blockchain payments system could carry its first real funds between Japan and South Korea as early as spring 2018. Eventually, the banks aim to send money by using Ripple\u2019s virtual currency, known as XRP, cutting costs an estimated 60% compared with conventional methods.Japanese banks already have developed the systems needed to commercialize blockchain-based transfers. The cross-border trials are set to run through Jan. 31.[2]Tests will conclude on the 31st of January, so you still have some time to make a decision, but if you think the tests will end favorably for Ripple, it might be a good idea to hold.This is HUGE news for Ripple. Japan is the largest consumer of cryptocurrency in the world[3], and South Korea might have the highest % of adoption when it comes to people actually investing in crypto.Banks in these countries picking up Ripple to improve their financial infrastructure could do great things for the coin.The RumorsThere have been rumors floating around the internet that Ripple is going to be added to Coinbase.This image started floating around in the Bitcoin Talk forums a couple days ago.[4]This image supposedly depicts a Coinbase employee\u2019s management dashboard announcing XRP to be added as long as DASH and XMR.It hasn\u2019t been confirmed, and it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone released fake images to try and sway markets if that is the case.However it is interesting nonetheless.If Ripple were added to Coinbase, that could mean huge gains for the coin, especially given its current price point of about $0.73.The cheapest cryptocurrency on Coinbase at the moment is Litecoin, and that\u2019s a little over $300.This is where I buy cryptocurrency with USD (Fiat currency)Click Here to Check out CoinbaseThis is where I buy other cryptocurrencies and Altcoins with BTCClick Here Check out Binance.Sources[1] Japan-South Korea blockchain payments enter trials Friday- Nikkei Asian Review[2] Japan-South Korea blockchain payments enter trials Friday- Nikkei Asian Review[3] World\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, bitFlyer, enters the US[4] Coinbase will add XRP, XMR & DASH on 2018", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Investing", "Crypto"]}, {"title": "Ripple effect v React Native", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@xotahal/ripple-effect-v-react-native-1e0abdc2cc9c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Ot\u00e1hal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@xotahal", "publish_date": "2017-01-13", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-20", "readtime": "2.48", "claps": 3, "voters": 3, "content": "Ripple effect v React NativeJi\u0159\u00ed Ot\u00e1halFollowJan 13, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readNa konci tohoto tutori\u00e1lu budeme m\u00edt p\u0159esn\u011b takov\u00fdto v\u00fdsledekV tomto prvn\u00edm \u010dl\u00e1nku se pokus\u00edm vysv\u011btlit, jak doc\u00edlit ripple efektu nad icon tla\u010d\u00edtkem, kter\u00fd zn\u00e1me z Material Design od Google.To v\u0161e pomoc\u00ed Animated API, kter\u00e9 n\u00e1m React Native nab\u00edz\u00ed.Uk\u00e1zka je p\u0159evzata z open source knihovny react-native-material-ui, kterou vyv\u00edj\u00edm spolu s rezerva\u010dn\u00edm syst\u00e9mem Reservio.My\u0161lenka \u2026Vytvo\u0159\u00edme si t\u0159i View.

UnsplashR I P P L EIs the Ripple Centralized or Decentralized?An investigation in technology and corporateThe Cryptocurrency ConsultantFollowJun 3 \u00b7 14 min readOne of the long-standing questions in the crypto-universe is whether Ripple is centralized or decentralized. Some say that Ripple is hideously centralized, others that it is more decentralized than Bitcoin. We are trying to get to the bottom of this. (I get commissions for purchases made through links in this post.)When writing about Ripple (XRP), it is often said in the same breath that the cryptocurrency is highly centralized. This statement is so common that it is repeated by many under-questioned and only rarely justified. At the same time, many Ripple fans say that Ripple is not only not centralized, but even more decentralized than Bitcoin. Which would make the confusion complete. What now?We\u2019re trying to find an answer to this question here. We\u2019ll look at many different factors, look at Ripple\u2019s consensus mechanism, and try to come to some sort of decent assessment.If you are wondering if a cryptocurrency is decentralized, you are lucky that there is a website that gives the first answer to this question: Arewedecentralizedizedyet.com. Ripple is doing pretty badly here.There is only one client issued by Ripple (formerly Ripple Labs); a single entity controls more than 50 percent of the voting power (Ripple); 78 percent of the available coins are owned by the richest hundred addresses (Ripple is likely to be the largest); and there are no native incentives for nodes, such as the mining reward at Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency Ripple, one could say according to these values, is almost entirely under the control of Ripple.The Finnish stock exchange Coinmotion, after taking up Ripple at the beginning of the year, described the cryptocurrency in a blog post as \u201cextremely centralized\u201d: \u201cThe Ripple network is a set of different applications from Ripple Labs. The stock market describes the company\u2019s position in the Ripple universe as that of a monopolist. And BitMex Research, the research arm of a Bitcoin derivatives exchange known for its detailed reports on various aspects of the crypto ecosystem, concludes an analysis from early 2018 with these words:\u201cThe Ripple system appears to be centralized for all practical purposes. It probably lacks many interesting technical features that Bitcoin has, such as resistance to censorship\u201d.The standard behavior of nodes \u201ceffectively gives the Ripple.com server full control over updating the ledger. At Ripple, the ledger is the account book in which the user\u2019s credit is stored.On the other hand, Brad Carlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said already in October 2017: \u201cRipple is not centralized. To put it clearly: If Ripple disappeared today, XRP would continue to work. For me, this is the most important indicator that something is decentralized.\u201d And David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s CTO, said in August 2018 that the issue of whether Ripple is decentralized was \u201cwildly nuanced and misunderstood\u201d. Ripple is based on an \u201cinherently decentralized and democratic consensus mechanism that no party can control\u201d. Ripple is even much more decentralized than Bitcoin and Ethereum, where a handful of mining lords have control over the blockchain. And as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum become more centralized over time, Ripple becomes more decentralized.So here we are. Some say totally centralized, others totally decentralized. How do we proceed from here?What does it actually mean when we talk about \u201cdecentralization\u201d?A good start would probably be to discuss the question of what \u201cdecentralized\u201d actually means. If we do not have a clear concept of it, it makes no sense to ask whether something is decentralized. Without it, any answer \u2014 \u201ccentralized\u201d or \u201cdecentralized\u201d \u2014 would be both right and wrong, because it depends on how we define decentralization. So what does decentralization mean?It is probably impossible to give a definite answer. \u201cDecentralization\u201d is a more philosophical-political concept. Similar to \u201cjustice\u201d or \u201cfreedom\u201d, and thus always in the eye of the beholder. But there are a few possible clues:No single point of failure: A central network operates around one head. If this head is knocked off, the network no longer functions. It is the \u201csingle point of failure\u201d. If a network does not have such a point, it is decentralized. A snake is centralized because you can cut its head off. It is not a hydra.Similarly, no central party should be able to change the system or manipulate the account book with past transactions. Some people also go so far as to require a decentralized system that even the majority is unable to do so, but that a \u201cconsensus\u201d is needed, which is another vague concept that could be translated into an \u201cabsolute, overwhelming majority\u201d.Aristocracy or equality: For some people, it is enough decentralization if there is no emperor, but only kings. For them, for example, the power structure of early medieval Europe, in which the kings, grand dukes, and prince-bishops of the various territories played their power games, was decentralized. Others, on the other hand, demand that there be no aristocracy either, but that all nodes in the network have equal rights.Freedom of permission and verification: One aspect of decentralization could be that the network must be free of permissions: Everyone must be able to participate, regardless of who they are or where they come from. It must work without trust. Some also require everyone to be able to verify the entire history of transactions from start to finish, to be absolutely certain that a transaction they have received is correct.Fairness: Coins should be fairly distributed. Where fair begins and ends is a question that is quite impossible to answer. But it should be clear that a cryptocurrency can hardly be considered decentralized if a single party has half of all coins. Power should also be fairly distributed in the ecosystem. A cryptocurrency can hardly be decentralized if one party has control over all relevant parts of the ecosystem.That would give us some indicators. It is clear that cryptocurrency is more \u201cdecentralized\u201d if these indicators are better met, and \u201ccentralized\u201d if they are less met. However, this does not mean that they mark a clear limit as to when something is decentralized or centralized. Where this limit is set depends on one\u2019s own needs. For one, it is enough if one coin has no central head; for the other, everything is centralized where he cannot calculate the blockchain on a microcomputer from Genesis on.To apply these categories to Ripple now, we must first look again at how Ripple works.How Ripple creates consensus in the networkIf you are used to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where proof of work by the Miner decides the valid chain, it is very counter-intuitive to understand how Ripple works. But it\u2019s actually quite simple.At its core, Ripple\u2019s consensus is based on trust. Each node is connected to other nodes, and as soon as a transaction is accepted by a certain number of these nodes, it is accepted. In this way, the network comes to a consensus. That\u2019s how simple it is. Not every node counts, but only so-called \u201cvalidators\u201d. Each node in the network connects to a freely selectable number of validators, and as soon as more than 80 percent signal a matching order of transactions, it accepts this order.If the network has no consensus \u2014 i.e. if less than 80 percent of the nodes agree with the order of the transactions \u2014 it stops. Here I have not yet fully understood how this mechanism works, i.e. where the network comes from to consensus that it has no consensus, how the shutdown works, and how it can be reactivated.You should also know that Ripple uses a different booking system than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin uses so-called \u201cUTXOs\u201d (Unspent Outputs) for transactions \u2014 which can be imagined as coins \u2014 Ripple uses \u201cAccounts\u201d. An address does not have a lot of \u201ccoins\u201d (these are the UTXOs), but a balance, like a bank account. In certain time intervals, the entirety of these assets is stored with a snapshot as \u201cLedger\u201d and shared in the network. As proof, a hash tree of this snapshot is shared on the network. This helps to check the update of the ledger. With this system, ripple nodes are able to simply throw away old transactions because the current credit is confirmed by the hash tree.The tokens called XRP are Ripple\u2019s native currency. They are limited in quantity, can no longer be created and transactions with them are, according to Ripple, uncensorable. The XRP serves as spam protection. So you need a small amount of XRP to open an account that is registered in the ledger, and you also need to destroy a small amount of XRP when signing a transaction. This amount increases if there is a spam wave on Ripple. This makes the XRP tokens deflationary in the long run.On the other hand, there are other tokens that represent Dollar, Euro or Bitcoin. They are created by so-called \u201cgateways\u201d which hold the corresponding values in stock. Such tokens can be censored and frozen by the gateways.The huge influence of Ripple LabsNow to the role of the Ripple company in all this. This extends to several core areas of Ripple: first, the distribution of XRP tokens, second, the development of the software, and third, the creation of consensus.Creation and distribution of XRP tokensRipple was originally a payment system without the XRP tokens, which had a rather manageable success. Sometime in 2012 or 2013 Ripple reinvented itself and introduced the XRP tokens. Of these, 100 billion were created. 80 billion of this was given to the now founded company Ripple Labs, 20 billion to the three founders Chris Larson (9.5 billion), Jed McCaleb (9.5 billion) and Arthus Britto (1 billion). While Jed McCaleb has thrown much of his XRP onto the market, Chris Larson has hoarded it. When XRP reached an all-time high of nearly three dollars in January 2019, Chris Larson\u2019s assets briefly rose to more than 50 billion dollars, making him one of the richest people on Earth. According to a graph (no longer available), CTO David Schwartz also received over one billion XRP in 2013; it is known that he sold about 2.8 million XRP in April this year.The Ripple company has since been taking care of distributing these coins wisely and fairly. So far, the company has put around 25 billion XRP into circulation. By the end of 2017, the company had put 55 billion XRP into a trust fund to \u201cmake the amount of XRP determinable with certainty at all times,\u201d as the company writes on its blog. Ripple has used a fiduciary feature of the XRP ledgers to freeze the XRP for a pre-determined period of time. With 55 contracts, one billion XRP was frozen each, one of which is released each month to probably be distributed or sold by Ripple at its discretion. Any XRPs left will be frozen again. Analysis firm CoinMetrics reports that there are discrepancies between what Ripple announced for the escrow system and how it was implemented, how Ripple accounted for the proceeds and how they were actually used.Overall, it can be said that XRP\u2019s money creation was absolutely centralized. The majority of the coins were distributed in a closed circle by founders who have benefited or are benefiting massively from every increase in value since then. Ripple is also responsible for the further distribution of the coins, even if this is limited to one billion XRP per month. In this sense, the creation of money at Ripple is much more central than it has ever been with political Fiat money. The result is one of the most unequal distributions of coins in the crypto-universe.The development of the softwareThe Ripple software \u2014 i.e. the node implementation \u2014 is 100% the responsibility of the software developers at Ripple. The company advertises that it has hired some of the best developers in the world.Ripple writes: \u201cA team of full-time and world-class developers at Ripple maintains and improves the software underlying the XRP Ledger. Ripple acts as a steward and advisor for their best interests while establishing constructive relationships with governments and financial institutions around the world.\u201d The software is open source and can be downloaded and, theoretically, modified by anyone. However, it may be practically impossible to introduce changes that aren\u2019t nodded off by Ripple.It can be said that the development of the Ripple software is completely concentrated on the Ripple company.Photo by Cytonn Photography on UnsplashThe consensusWhen BitMex tested a ripple validator, the authors of the analysis made the following observation: \u201cThe node operated by downloading a list of five public keys from the v1.Ripple.com server. These five keys are attributed to Ripple.com. The software points out that four of the five keys are necessary for a proposal to be accepted. Since the keys are all downloaded from the Ripple.com server, Ripple essentially has full control over how the ledger moves forward.\u201dThis paragraph refers to how the nodes select the validators they trust: They visit a list on Ripple\u2019s server and get public keys from it. The validators they select sign an update of the ledger with this key so that the BitMex node knows they are from them. Of course, the user is free to choose other validators, but as long as the default setting indicates Ripple, the company has virtually unlimited power.By the end of 2017, Ripple would have agreed to BitMex\u2019s findings. The company writes in a post that it \u201cdeliberately chose to be the most trusted validator operator on the network to go through the first phase of the XRP ledger development\u201d. This decision is based on a decision for security and scalability to the detriment of decentralization. In spring 2017, Ripple provided the majority of these nodes with 25 validators.However, in mid-2017 the company initiated a \u201cdecentralization strategy\u201d. This includes that Ripple also includes external validators in the \u201cUnique Node Lists\u201d (UNLs), in which the trustworthy Ripple nodes are located, provided that these nodes fulfill certain conditions dictated by Ripple. At the beginning of the decentralization campaign, this list was published by Ripple and contained only Ripple nodes. However, the company plans to change this; for all two new nodes that meet Ripple\u2019s criteria, the company will remove a separate node. The goal is not to run a validator at all.The list of UNLs from which new nodes select trusted validators, however, is apparently still provided by Ripple. To date, the number of validators in the network has grown to 199, of which only about six, according to the charts, come from Ripple. Of these, however, only about 30 have a place in the UNL list; only a similarly small proportion of nodes have more than 100 inbound connections and more than 40 outbound connections, according to a node explorer. It is likely that this small group of nodes will make up the consensus in the Ripple universe among themselves.It is therefore positive to note that Ripple has indeed reduced its influence on consensus-building arbitrarily. The group of nodes that determine consensus, however, remains relatively small; and Ripple\u2019s influence on which nodes are trusted by others remains immense, as the company determines its default setting with the release of the software and continues to maintain the most important list of validators.Can Ripple\u2019s consensus mechanism be decentralized at all?Of course, the influence of Ripple, the company, is huge. Nobody would deny that. However, what CEO Garlinghouse says may be true: even if the company disappeared, the Ripple network would still exist. This at least meets a very basic requirement of decentralization. In addition, the influence of a single actor is not a systemic property of a cryptocurrency, but merely a temporary state. The fact that Ripple has such a large influence does not mean that it always has to be that way. The more interesting question is, therefore: Is Ripple, the system, able to drive a decentralized network?For some, the great influence that Ripple has on the trust of its customers is in itself a reason not to consider the network capable of decentralization. At Bitcoin, there is a hard, cryptographic proof of which chain is valid: the sheer amount of energy used for proof of works. Anyone can verify that for themselves. With Ripple, there is only trust in the majority of nodes. This could make the system vulnerable to corruption, abuse of trust, and so on. As Friedrich von Hayek said: \u201cThe governments of this world have at all times misused the trust of the peoples in them to manipulate money. Why should things be any different with Ripple?On the other hand, it could well be that Ripple has managed to develop a mathematical function that is very resistant to abuse or drastically limits its consequences. The continuous flow of ledgers tested by Hash trees (i.e. credit balances) should make it very difficult even for a majority to manipulate the system. But here I have to admit that I have reached the limit of my knowledge. I can\u2019t judge the power of a cartel of validators, and it\u2019s hard for me to say anything about how and what individual nodes can lose if 80 percent of the validators they choose betray them. Another difficult question is who decides that the network will shut down when it no longer has consensus, and who will turn it back on. Is this even possible without handing control over to a central office?For many Bitcoiners, another feature of the system might speak against decentralization: The nodes and validators usually only download a number of current ledgers. This is practical because it saves the tedious synchronization of a node, as known from Bitcoin. The full blockchain \u2014 which begins with the creation of the 100 billion ripples \u2014 already requires nine terabytes. And that\u2019s where Ripple isn\u2019t being used as many Ripple fans promise in the future. A point will be reached relatively quickly where it will be more or less impossible to calculate the current ledgers from the beginning, even for large institutions with powerful supercomputers and warehouses full of SSD disks. Will it even be possible to determine whether the history of transactions \u2014 and the entire balance of XRP \u2014 is correct?Finally, there is the question of incentives for nodes. At Bitcoin, mining nodes have massive incentives, to be honest, and invest in strong systems. These incentives do not exist at Ripple. The nodes are operated on a more or less voluntary basis. Sometimes it is said that such a node helps institutions such as banks, for example, to get a fluid contact to the Ripple network while at the same time helping its stability and security. But is that really enough? Doesn\u2019t decentralization need incentives that strike a balance? Wasn\u2019t that exactly Satoshi\u2019s game theoretical stroke of genius?The circle closes \u2026A little we end up where we started: Decentrality is subjective. Ripple certainly meets some of the requirements of a decentralized system, especially when you see the gigantic impact of Ripple Labs as a temporary phase that might pass if the XRP ledger becomes the Planetary Earth account book as planned. Then banks and central banks may invest in XRP developers, maintain their own node lists and invest in validator farms \u2014 while the money supply of XRP has long since been distributed into many hands. The company Ripple would then have done its job and made itself unnecessary. It would be conceivable but does not have to be so.For people who have stricter decentralization requirements, Ripple in its current state is a nightmare of centralism despite its unmistakable progress. For many, Ripple\u2019s consensus model is likely to make it impossible for Ripple to ever meet the high demands for decentralization for several reasons. If Ripple continues to be used and is highly scalable, it would be in the hands of a small cartel, and it would be completely opaque whether it cheats the public.So, as we said at the beginning, it is in the eye of the beholder.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain", "Decentralization", "Ripple", "Bitcoin"]}, {"title": "The Bitfury Group and Ripple Advance Interoperability with Lightning Network", "post_link": "https://medium.com/meetbitfury/the-bitfury-group-and-ripple-advance-interoperability-with-lightning-network-27ec6a90a34b?source=search_post", "author_name": "The Bitfury Group", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@BitfuryGroup", "publish_date": "2017-08-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-23", "readtime": "3.21", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "The Bitfury Group and Ripple Advance Interoperability with Lightning NetworkCompanies Jointly Release Code for Interledger Protocol Supporting Lightning Network InteroperabilityThe Bitfury GroupFollowAug 17, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 August 15, 2017 \u2014 The Bitfury Group, the world\u2019s leading full service Blockchain technology company, and Ripple, the commercial blockchain payments network, announced today that they have together added Lightning Network compatibility to the open-source Interledger project.Interledger is a protocol for interoperability \u2014 connecting payment networks or ledgers, enabling frictionless payments between them. The Bitfury Group and Ripple collaborated to make the Lightning Network compatible with the seven other networks currently connected via the Interledger protocol. The integration and demo code are available on GitHub.Now, those networks which are interoperable with the Interledger protocol will be able to connect across the Litecoin Lightning Network and Bitcoin Lightning Network. This makes the Lightning network more effective for cryptocurrency users because it allows payments to be made to individuals who are not actually on the Lightning network.\u201cThis news is a major step for interoperability of Blockchain and worldwide adoption of the Lightning Network,\u201d said Valery Vavilov, CEO of The Bitfury Group. \u201cBy making the Lightning Network compatible with the innovative Interledger protocol, we have ensured that it will be easier than ever for blockchain and cryptocurrency users to use their assets across different blockchains. This will allow for cross-blockchain, global transactions.\u201dStefan Thomas, CTO at Ripple, said: \u201cThe lack of interoperability across blockchains is preventing cryptocurrencies from becoming mainstream. This latest innovation adds Lightning to a growing list of networks that are interoperable with the Interledger protocol. Now, users of Litecoin Lightning Network can transact across the Bitcoin Lightening Network, and vice versa, instantly and easily, when they couldn\u2019t before. The ability to transact seamlessly this way is essential given the increasingly fragmented, diverse nature of payment systems worldwide.\u201dThe code for the demo and the Interledger protocol plugin for the Lightning network were released on August 15, 2017.ABOUT THE LIGHTNING NETWORKThe Lightning Network is a promising overlay solution that enables micropayments and increased transaction processing on the Bitcoin Blockchain and other blockchains. The Lightning Network operates as a network of bidirectional payment channels that transfer value off-blockchain. The network is also designed to be decentralized, eliminating the need for custodial trust. The security of the network is enforced by smart contracts using blockchain\u2019s built-in scripting capabilities. Increased capacity is achieved by the following principle \u2014 instead of creating on-blockchain transactions for individual payments, the broadcasting of the net result of these transactions is deferred. The Lightning Network can also be deployed on other blockchains, or between blockchains with Interledger transactions.ABOUT INTERLEDGERInterledger is an open suite of protocols for connecting ledgers of all types: from digital wallets and national payment systems to blockchains and beyond. The protocols enable instant, atomic settlement across any number of ledgers, geographies, stores of value and entities. They are the foundation of the Internet of Value, which will allow the world to exchange value as easily as it already exchanges information. Interledger uses connectors to route payments across different ledgers. Conditional transfers \u2014 using Hash-Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), as they are known in the blockchain space \u2014 are used to secure multi-hop payments so funds cannot be lost or stolen in flight. On top of this security primitive, Interledger provides a packet and address format, heavily inspired by the Internet Protocol (IP), to instruct connectors where to forward payments.ABOUT THE BITFURY GROUP:The Bitfury Group is the leading full service Blockchain technology company and one of the largest private infrastructure providers in the Blockchain ecosystem.

If you are afraid of tech talk, read the short, less-techie version here (soon). It may also be very helpful to have a basic understanding about what Ripple is. Here is a primer.One of the turning points in a protocol\u2019s life cycle is when an alternative, from-scratch implementation appears. That is the initial proof that an actual protocol also exists as opposed to a closed ecosystem supported by a single isolated application. The Ripple software itself is open source, but no comprehensive specification exists and fighting through hundreds of files and hundreds of thousands of lines is not a task one would do usually on a lazy afternoon.There are many good reasons to have an alternative implementation for a protocol:find design issuesenable new platforms/products to use the protocolimprove or optimize the protocoland find more design issues, again \u2014 the most important one in my opinionAs in our startup we began having discussions with financial institutions, questions about how the offerings compare to Ripple kept rising, I decided to investigate Ripple more closely than I did before. My aim was to perhaps implement some basic client in Ruby or worst case in Java as I have used ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) APIs previously in them.I started reading articles, creating an account for Ripple Trade, checking out gateways and finally reading the code on github.While reading a lot of code I started to put down a map about how it works and I plan to publish that description as my time allows finishing it. Even though that work is not finished I was really keen to share information about this issue based on my current understanding about how it works.In Ripple the client first has to authorize itself to the network and synchronize with the nodes afterwards.The initial list of nodes (or supernodes) can be either:defined in the configurationdownloaded from https://ripple.com/ripple.txtor obtained from the DNS entry of r.ripple.comUsing the DNS entry option raises a bit of concern as the domain isn\u2019t using DNSSEC, but let\u2019s assume the certificate in SSL/TLS will eliminate the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.Ripple then connects to any of these nodes (usual port is 51235) using HTTP/1.1 over SSL/TLS, initiates a handshake and then switches to its own Protobuf-based protocol with simple framing.The framing consists of two fields in MSB byte order:32 bit size16 bit typefollowed by Protobuf contentI will stop here and won\u2019t go any deeper how the protocol works after the handshake.Let\u2019s focus on the handshake instead. It is done via an HTTP over SSL/TLS request with multitude of custom fields. Two of which are Public-Key and Session-Signature. The node\u2019s public key goes in the first and a signature created by that key over some session data into the second. Every node has an ECC key which is used to identify it, as well as to sign the communication. Well, at least to sign the handshake.In order to create the signature, a shared value has to be established by the two sides of the communication channel. They are using TLS-level data (I will not repeat SSL/TLS from now on) as a shared value known to both parties. This is then hashed in various ways and used with the ECC key to create the signature.What is unusual is using a specific kind of TLS-level data. During the handshake process multiple messages are exchanged between client and server in TLS. Some of these include:ClientHello and ServerHello to set up basic parameters, such as version and supported ciphers,Certificate of the server,ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange to exchange public keys (depending on the cipher),ChangeCipherSpec to agree on the actual encryption parameters and signal the start of the encrypted streamand finally Finished, which is the first encrypted piece of information.First the client, followed by the server sends the ChangeCipherSpec and Finished messages. If both can decode the encrypted messages that verifies the success of the handshake process. This can become more complicated in some cases and it is possible for the server to be the first one sending the Finished message.The OpenSSL library contains two calls to retrieve the last encrypted Finished messages after the TLS handshake process was completed:SSL_get_finished \u2014 \u201ccopies the latest Finished message sent out from this side\u201dand SSL_get_peer_finished \u2014 \u201ccopies the latest Finished message received on this side\u201dFor the eager ones the relevant code is in src/ripple/overlay/impl/TMHello.cpp:unsigned char sha1[64];unsigned char sha2[64];if (!hashLastMessage(ssl, sha1, SSL_get_finished)){  journal.error << \u201cCookie generation: local setup not complete\u201d;  return result;}if (!hashLastMessage(ssl, sha2, SSL_get_peer_finished)){  journal.error << \u201cCookie generation: peer setup not complete\u201d;  return result;}// If both messages hash to the same value (i.e. match) something is// wrong. This would cause the resulting cookie to be 0.if (memcmp (sha1, sha2, sizeof (sha1)) == 0){ journal.error << \u201cCookie generation: identical finished messages\u201d; return result;}for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof (sha1); ++i) sha1[i] ^= sha2[i];// Finally, derive the actual cookie for the values that// we have calculated.result.first = getSHA512Half (sha1, sizeof(sha1));In steps:takes the SHA512 hash of both messagesXORs themtakes the SHA512 hash of the resultbut only carries further the first 32 bytes of the 64 byte hashThis file is also a good starting point to understand the protocol.The two OpenSSL functions above are not available in many programming languages and/or platforms. If one cannot access this data from their language of choice, then they cannot finish the Ripple handshake and proceed past it in Ripple. They are doomed from square 1.Even though OpenSSL is one (if not the) of the most used implementations and it exports those functions, they are not necessarily useful at the application level and might not be available in higher level implementations. I looked at Ruby, Python, Android and iOS to see if they are available only to conclude they are missing.Is there a way to obtain that data without using those two calls? There shouldn\u2019t be as they are not application level data.It should be noted though, that RFC5056 defines a concept called \u201cchannel bindings\u201d:The concept of channel binding allows applications to establish that the two end-points of a secure channel at one network layer are the same as at a higher layer by binding authentication at the higher layer to the channel at the lower layer. This allows applications to delegate session protection to lower layers, which has various performance benefits.This strives to remove redundant work on higher layer protocols and defines how to exchange that information between the two in an application. Basically it defines (or at least suggests) what kind of API calls should be available between the two layers.Furthermore, RFC5929 clarifies the interface to be used with TLS and designates tls-unique as a vehicle to obtain the Finished message:The first TLS Finished message sent in the most recent TLS handshake of the TLS connection. Note that for full TLS handshakes, the first Finished message is sent by the client, while for abbreviated TLS handshakes (session resumption), the first Finished message is sent by the server.That clearly means it will not provide both Finished messages.Even though the two OpenSSL functions are not widely available on all platforms, one can have a much higher success rate with looking for the tls-unique binding. It is available in Python and Go, but not in Ruby, Android or iOS. An enhancement request for Android to support it was submitted last December.The bad news is, both are absolutely necessary for creating the hash and signature in Ripple.To summarize: the reason Ripple is not likely to have an alternative implementation of its protocol in different programming languages is a design choice they have made when using specific features of the SSL/TLS implementation they are using.These features are not exposed to the programmer on many widespread languages or platforms, such as Ruby, Python, Java (Android) or Objective-C (iOS). I did not check Swift, but I assume it follows a very similar set of APIs as Objective-C. It is available in C/C++ though.Why would anyone rewrite it in C or C++ if such an implementation already exists? Well, I do see a point in rewriting it in C in the purists\u2019 eye. That however will not make it available on Android or iOS, the two leading platforms for customer acquisition. I know that that C or C++ code can be integrated into both Android or iOS, but that will not change how low level networking code is accessed on these platforms.How will Ripple work without a C# implementation if they aim to serve modern financial systems and integrate with banks? Not to mention the ancient languages many of these banks still rely on.On the other hand, the above doesn\u2019t means that Ripple can\u2019t be made available at all on other platforms. It just means that somewhere a hosted solution must be available and more importantly, trusted by the clients in order to access the network.My question now is: Will Ripple consider commissioning an alternative implementation and fixing this design problem? Do they have genuine reasons which make this choice cornerstone?

A break above this multiple resistance zone in the next week or so will likely be quickly followed by a test of the psychologically key 0.75 level. XRPUSD is a prime candidate in the next few months to play catch up to Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), where a rotation will continue into other less near-term overbought, top coins that have yet to see an explosion upwards. Except for the weekly Stochastics which is now overbought, the weekly and daily RSI, Stochastics and MACD are rallying.Ripple FundamentalsXRPUSD bulls were encouraged this week by the announcement that MoneyGram (the world\u2019s second largest money transfers provider) will utilize XRP through Ripple\u2019s xRapid product. As part of the partnership, MoneyGram will receive up to USD 50M in capital from Ripple in exchange for equity. The MoneyGram announcement should help Ripple convert more of the 200 plus financial institutions supposedly testing Ripple products into using xRapid \u2014 the product that makes use of XRP \u2014 as opposed to simply using xCurrent. xCurrent installations have the option to upgrade to support use of XRP, but are seeing slow adoption due to the regulatory uncertainty over treatment of XRP. Other ongoing lids on a stronger XRP rally include Ripple holding 60 billion XRP and selling into rallies, and the threat of any legal action against Ripple for being deemed to having issued a security (i.e. XRP) without meeting appropriate regulatory requirements. Increasingly, the pressure against XRP will come from the proliferation of stable coins (including Facebook\u2019s Libra) which have much lower volatility than XRP.Industry FundamentalsFacebook published its whitepaper on its Libra stablecoin project (slated to go live the first half of 2020), but was relatively short on details due not in small part to an expected robust pushback from regulators, central banks and politicians around the world. Much of the unbanked that Facebook is hoping to go after with its low cost payments solution resides in countries where either Facebook or crypto is currently banned. Key investors like Visa, Mastercard, Paypal and Uber have injected USD 10M each to become members of the Libra Association and to manage their own node. The objective is to have 100 investors (from a variety of industries, including telecom, media and e-commerce) with 27 names already on the list. Banks have passed on the project so far.Fidelity\u2019s institutional crypto trading offering is currently available (or in testing) for select clients, with retail brokerage giants Etrade and TD Ameritrade also preparing to launch trading in a few top coins. Longer term industry bulls are increasingly buying on dips as the sector overall gains interest from IBM\u2019s use of the Stellar blockchain for its payment network \u2014 the World Wire. Banks will be able to launch stablecoins on World Wire, or to use Stellar Lumens directly as a bridge currency between different fiat currencies. Ongoing anticipation is building for the coins being developed by other leading messenger apps (i.e. Line, Kakao) and banks (i.e. JP Morgan, Mizuho, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ). The launch of BAKKT has been delayed multiple times with no announced target go live date. A race continues to launch STO exchanges and consultancies ahead of increasing regulatory clarity on STOs.The market is increasingly shrugging off the fears around Bitfinex covering up losses with funds earmarked for backing Tether (USDT), especially as it has apparently already received commitments for USD 1B in its current raise to offset funds frozen by US, Polish and Portuguese authorities. With liquidity on USDT significantly higher than newer, competing USD-backed, audited stable coins due not in small part to USDT enjoying first mover advantage and the network effects from having the longest established history, the market appears to be largely sticking with using USDT which is listed on more crypto exchanges and offers superior liquidity.Ripple (XRP/USD) Weekly/DailyClick here for the rest of today\u2019s technical and fundamental analysis on Ethereum and Bitcoin.Where do you think Ripple (XRP/USD) is going next week?

I will explain why below. But first this is the weekly chart:The cryptocurrency has gained nearly 120% in the last two weeks according to ROC(2). This looks like a trader\u2019s dream. But it could turn into a nightmare.A few weeks ago when I first saw the announcements about XRapid I knew this one will spike higher. I was tempted to join the game. I had to fight hard to overcome FOMO.I have been in the trading business for a while. I know how easy it is to get in the market and how hard it is at times to get out. Trading a security after a 90% drawdown, as shown in the daily chart below, can get very risky.As you can see from the above chart, XRP fell more than 90% from its highs reached earlier this year. This means that a bubble formed and subsequently burst.\u201cSo what is wrong with risking a \u201clittle money\u201d on a trade?\u201dI see this argument made even by some people who promote themselves as experts and it is maybe the worst advice one could give, especially to new traders and the public because:small losses accumulate to generate large lossestrades must be the result of a disciplined approach, not of wishful thinkingI want to make this clear: traders who risk \u201clittle money\u201d on random trades jeopardize their trading discipline. It\u2019s not a question of money; trading success depends on discipline. If a trader loses their discipline by doing \u201clittle money\u201d trades here and there, this usually leads to large losses with high probability.Rule 1 is never lose money. Rule 2 is: never forget Rule 1 (W. Buffett)The above rule goes against the intuition of most traders but staying profitable reinforces psychology of a winner. The idea that one can lose five times in a row and make it up in the sixth may be mathematically correct but from a psychology point of view it can be a disaster and later lead to compulsive actions.Back to XRP: It\u2019s hard to trade anything that has the following volatility profile:The 365-day annualized volatility (365 days) is at 183%. The 14-day ATR as a percentage of closing price is around 11%. By comparison, annualized 252-day volatility (252 days) of SPY is 12.5% and 14-day ATR as a percentage of closing price is only 0.63%.If a trader thinks they can make money trading XRP, must first try to make money trading SPY. Still, one is free to do whatever they want but trading XRP, or any other cryptocurrency, is more like gambling and I understand for some people this is what they want but they should also accept that they are not trading; they are gambling. This is true especially when classical technical analysis is used. Nothing wrong with gambling \u2014 and I don\u2019t use the term here in a negative sense. I only try to make the following point: there are differences between gambling and trading and the most significant one is that usually gamblers have no idea of what they are doing.If you have any questions or comments, happy to connect on Twitter:@mikeharrisNYThis article was originally published in Price Action Lab BlogAbout the author: Michael Harris is a trader and best selling author.

With years of significant contributions to the open source, blockchain, and development communities, his vision for scaling open technology sets him apart. Stefan perfectly embodies the values of the Decentralized Web Summit and we\u2019re excited to share the background and history behind one of the web\u2019s brilliant minds.On His Early YearsStefan is living proof that on the internet, age is just a number and the world is at your fingertips.Now a long-time web developer, Stefan got his early start at the age of 10 building his first website, which he was delighted to be compensated for with Magic the Gathering trading cards. He quickly fell in love with the internet, drawn to the open web for it\u2019s special allure. Later on, working at a small web agency, he encountered the inefficiencies of paying a global network of contractors online.His early experiences set the stage for his love of the web, as well as his interest in payments.Finding BitcoinIn 2010, after years of web development projects and entrepreneurial forrays, Stefan sold his previous company and was looking for something new to dive deep into. He stumbled upon Bitcoin at a time it needed him most.Plagued with misunderstandings and a lack of good PR, Bitcoin\u2019s uncertain early years needed a friendly voice. Stefan spotted this hole and helped usher in an era of global blockchain understanding with the production of the now famous \u201cWhat is Bitcoin?\u201d video that introduced millions of people to Bitcoin. Hailed as a milestone in crypto adoption, Bitcoin was transformed from a scarcely known developer anarchist tool to a global finance phenomenon.At the heart of Stefan\u2019s innovation is community. Conversations with the early community deeply inspired him, through which he learned how people were thinking about cryptocurrency and specifically, the problems they were facing. Catalyzed by these insights, Stefan spent the next year and half creating BitcoinJS, the first implementation of Bitcoin cryptography in the browser, making it exponentially easier for people to engage. Through his research, he got deeper into the protocol-level work.Contributing to the community through development, he encountered inefficiencies that would require changes to Bitcoin\u2019s core protocol to fix. Most of these were already captured on a Bitcoin Wiki page that detailed a wishlist of updates. While contributing to one of the simplest of these changes, Pay-to-script-hash (P2SH), he experienced first-hand the challenges that it would take to scale a cryptocurrency, especially one that had goals of completely changing the financial landscape.Stefan learned that in a system that manages billions of dollars worth of digital currency, even a small change takes many months and a lot of political maneuvering to make happen. Giving the slow pace of development, Bitcoin may have been an important innovation as a currency but it wasn\u2019t going to be the solution to the world\u2019s payments woes.On Joining RippleInspired by the founding team and their practical vision of building a technology that had a need from financial institutions, Stefan joined Ripple. Initially joining as a developer, he quickly became Ripple\u2019s early CTO and helped build the technology that would launch Ripple and it\u2019s underlying cryptocurrency, XRP, into the mainstream.While at Ripple, Stefan\u2019s thoughts started to become clear. Blockchain was a promising technology, but faster development cycles and mainstream adoption were critical to its success.Looking Forward to ScalingThis thought process soon brought him to co-create Interledger in 2015, a new kind of payment protocol not based on blockchain but rather taking inspiration from the Internet Protocol (IP) itself. Interledger is able to process transactions faster and on a larger scale than any blockchain and can integrate with traditional payment systems, blockchains, even future payments technology that hasn\u2019t been invented yet. Similar to how IP passes around packets of data, Interledger has no global state and passes around packets of money.This distinction is critical to Interledger\u2019s success and technological fundamentals.After spending four years contributing to the development of Interledger, Stefan left Ripple to create the first business built entirely on Interledger: Coil, a new subscription service designed to support creators on the web. An efficient, and open payment protocol is a prerequisite for a native method of monetization that could be broadly supported by browsers and websites.To date, it\u2019s challenging for people to do very small payments. Micropayments is an unsolved problem that is holding back content creators, news, media and monetization, and ultimately prevents the web from reaching its true potential.For payments of less than 50 cents, credit cards are prohibitively expensive. As a result, two models of monetization dominate online content today: ads and subscription models, both of which only work for large-scale websites.However, what about small to medium sized sites? Ads and subscriptions fall short. The only way to monetize is to give a large portion of your revenue to Google by hosting ads on your site. Coil gives content creators a new way to monetize independent of ads and without asking users to sign up for each and every website they want to access.A big takeaway in his contributions to decentralized technology has been an understanding in how complexity can creep up on well-intentioned software architects and make a project increasing difficult to manage. Many developers will happily build complex technology as long as they feel they have a good handle on it. But this often makes it very difficult to predict how the system will behave under load, for instance when a lot of money is added into the equation \u2014 a recipe for disaster.Stefan contends that developers should be more humble in the ambition of what they are trying to build, and not push things to the absolute maximum, but build in a \u201ccomplexity safety margin\u201d that avoids them getting overwhelmed as the system grows.On DWeb SummitOne of the biggest benefits of DWeb that Stefan is drawn to is the diverse community. A big supporter of the web, Stefan is passionate about how open it is and how anyone can participate.He notes his favorite elements of the Summit. People come from all backgrounds, working on many different kinds of decentralized tech. The differences in ideology enable new learnings from folks who are tackling various parts of the internet. This may be other protocols or academia, the unique combination of people produce really good insights and certainly very good discussion.DWeb isn\u2019t just about debating which technology we should all use, but more fruitful discussions about the end goal of decentralization at large, leaving the door open for new approaches.With humble beginnings, Stefan is living proof that on the internet, anything is possible. There\u2019s always a big idea waiting for your input, and a community in need of your support. Technology can\u2019t reach it\u2019s true potential without open innovation and mainstream appeal.We embody these themes of community, discovery, and technology at Dweb and we are excited to join Stefan and other innovators in building the future.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Dwebsummit", "Ripple", "Open Web", "Decentralization"]}, {"title": "Weekly: Ripple Joins The Wallet, Two-Side CRPT Token Swap & More", "post_link": "https://medium.com/crypterium/weekly-ripple-joins-the-wallet-two-side-crpt-swswap-more-b281495ee12b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Crypterium", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@crypterium", "publish_date": "2019-08-31", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-31", "readtime": "2.14", "claps": 156, "voters": 4, "content": "Weekly: Ripple Joins The Wallet, Two-Side CRPT Token Swap & MoreCrypteriumFollowAug 31 \u00b7 3 min readHow was your week?

One user drew up a petition calling on Ripple to stop selling XRP in large quantities, and a group of investors sued the company, citing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidelines on digital assets published earlier this year.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on August 28, after several weeks of silence, commented on his company\u2019s criticism.\u201cI\u2019m always struck by the questionable sources (i\u2019m being generous here) spreading FUD about #XRP and @Ripple,\u201d said Garlinghouse.He claims that the SEC leadership was prepared by employees, not the regulator, and is not a law or rule: \u201cIt\u2019s clear XRP is not a security and the UK and others have said as much.\u201dRegarding the active liquidation of XRP held by Ripple, Garlinghouse writes that these sales help the company increase the practical value of XRP by developing RippleNet and supporting third-party companies that use cryptocurrency in their activities.\u201c Reality is we DECREASED our sales by volume Q/Q and since then the inflation rate of XRP circulating supply has been lower than that of BTC and ETH,\u201d he added.CEO Ripple says the company continues to work towards creating standards for the cryptocurrency industry. As an example, he pointed to the XRP sales report for the second quarter, which provides detailed information on the sale of cryptocurrency to institutional investors and its distribution through a network of partners.Garlinghouse\u2019s comments provoked mixed reactions in the community. Some thanked him for trying to dispel investor doubts arising from recent events, while others were not convinced by the explanations provided.

It attracted many new investors because it is easy to invest and it provides better returns than most of the hedge funds.Cryptocurrency trading is like a roller coaster ride that many are unable to digest. However, if they can be offered a less volatile option with comparable returns, most would probably jump into the fray.To cater to this requirement, scores of cryptocurrency index funds are cropping up. These are advertised to be less volatile, providing commensurate returns. If they can prove themselves over a bull and bear cycle, a bunch of new investors should flock to cryptocurrencies.As it is, the large investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Barclays are rumored to be laying the groundwork to start cryptocurrency trading desks. Their entry will increase the volume and deepen the markets.Finally, the traditional banking community is recognizing the importance of digital currencies. The latest boost was provided by a blog post by Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) where she outlined potential benefits of the cryptocurrencies.Many recent prices developments are giving us a feeling that the worst might be behind us and most of the virtual currencies will enter a bottom forming process.BTC/USDBitcoin has hardly gained any ground after breaking out of the descending channel on April 12. It is stuck between both moving averages. The bears are defending the 50-day SMA, whereas, the bulls are buying at the 20-day EMA.If the BTC/USD pair doesn\u2019t break out of the 50-day SMA within a couple of days, traders can raise their stops to breakeven or can close their positions. A failure to cross the overhead resistance will attract selling, which can sink the digital currency back towards the $6,757 levels.If the price breaks out of the 50-day SMA, a rally to $9,400 followed by a move to $10,000 is possible.ETH/USDFor the past four days, Ethereum has been taking support close to the $500 levels. Though the downtrend has ended, we are yet to see buying conviction return.The 20-day EMA has flattened out, while the 50-day SMA is still falling. The ETH/USD pair is stuck between these two moving averages.A breakout above the 50-day SMA can push prices towards $600 and then to $730 levels. On the other hand, a breakdown below the 20-day EMA can sink the cryptocurrency to $418 levels.We don\u2019t find a high conviction setup; hence, we are not suggesting a trade on it.BCH/USDAfter finding support at the 20-day EMA, Bitcoin Cash is moving towards the 50-day SMA. Previously, it has not faced any selling at this moving average. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t expect any major resistance at the 50-day SMA at the moment.Our target objective remains a rally to $1,114 levels where traders can book partial profits. The BCH/USD pair has a history of vertical rallies when it starts a new trend. Therefore, we suggest holding some position with a trailing stop loss.In case vertical rally does take place, traders can expect levels to see the price reaching $1,300 and $1,600 levels. The stops can be raised to $700 levels. We don\u2019t want to stick with the trade if it breaks below the 20-day EMA again.XRP/USDRipple did not correct to the support levels of $0.56270, as we had expected. It has been trading in a tight range of $0.613-$0.70789.The 20-day EMA is turning up and the 50-day SMA is flattening out. Chances of a bullish crossover have increased. If the bulls break out of this range, a rally to $0.83296 will be on the cards.Therefore, aggressive traders can initiate long positions on the XRP/USD pair at $0.71 with a stop loss of $0.61. Partial profits can be booked close to $0.83, and the remaining positions can be held with a trailing stop because a move above $0.83 can push the digital currency to $1 levels.If the price breaks down below $0.61, a decline to $0.56 is likely.XLM/USDStellar is moving towards our first target objective of $0.36, where it can face some resistance. Therefore, traders can book partial profits at this level and hold the rest for higher levels of about $0.47.The RSI has reached close to overbought levels; hence, a few days of consolidation can\u2019t be ruled out.The XLM/USD pair has broken out of a long downtrend. It can now either become range bound and build a base or start a new uptrend. The next dip will give us a better idea of the probable trend.LTC/USDWe have been neutral on Litecoin because we believe that it will face considerable resistance at the $141 mark. On April 17, prices broke out of this level but could not sustain it.The LTC/USD pair is again trying to break out of the range. A breakout will give it a pattern target of $168, but we anticipate another round of selling at the downtrend line.We shall turn positive if the virtual currency breaks out and sustains above the downtrend line. At the current levels, we don\u2019t find a buy setup with a good risk to reward ratio.ADA/BTCCardano reached very close to our target objective of 0.000035 on April 17 when it reached an intraday high of 0.00003405. In our previous analysis, we had recommended booking partial profits at 0.0000323 and trailing the stops higher.The RSI is close to the overbought levels, that\u2019s why a couple of days of consolidation is likely. On the downside, the 20-day EMA will act as strong support.The ADA/BTC pair will pick up momentum if it breaks out and sustains above 0.000035 levels. Therefore, traders can leave a small portion of their position open with the stop loss at breakeven.NEO/USDNEO is currently stuck between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA. It has been trading close to the $64 levels \u2014 our recommended buy level \u2014 for the past five days.A breakout of the 50-day SMA can carry the NEO/USD pair to the $80 levels where it will face considerable resistance from the downtrend line of the descending triangle.Therefore, we have revised our target down to $80 from $88. On the downside, strong support exists at the $64 levels. Any break of this will sink the cryptocurrency back towards the April 06 lows of $44.16. Therefore, we suggest reducing the risk by raising the stops to $54 levels.EOS/USDEOS is trying to start a new uptrend. It successfully completed a retest of the breakout levels and found support at $7.8 on April 15 and April 16.The EOS/USD pair is currently trading inside an ascending channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate bullishness.The current up move can face some resistance in the $9.5 to $10 zone. Therefore, we recommend booking partial profits around the $9.5 mark and holding the rest for a target objective of $11.The stop loss can be trailed higher to breakeven on half of the position, and the remaining half can be kept at $6, just below the support line of the ascending channel.Source", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "W12", "ICO", "Ethereum", "Analysis"]}, {"title": "Altcoin Analysis: ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency Review", "post_link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-analysis-eth-xrp-eos-ltc-cryptocurrency-review-77ab31ad0502?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2019-05-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-03", "readtime": "3.27", "claps": 49, "voters": 3, "content": "Altcoin Analysis: ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency ReviewMay 3, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN MAGAZINEMarko VidrihFollowMay 3 \u00b7 4 min readThe cryptocurrency market on the background of neutral news again added to capitalization, however, this time mainly due to the growth of BTC.Image credit: CoinMarketCapThe main indicator of the market grew to $186 billion, and we believe that if other coins are connected to growth in the near future, then the chances of getting out of a long consolidation of 169- $185 billion and a quick update of the current year highs will increase.EthereumIn ETH, a small position is maintained, although the coin, unlike BTC, does not yet show a clear dynamic. Now the price is in the local maximum of May 30 and we believe that if the bulls can stand up and move the char at least 1% higher in the coming hours, the likelihood of a quick impulse will sharply increase, which will allow us to increase our position with the ability to place a short stop-loss order. While at this stage we remain in position and carefully observe the dynamics of cryptocurrency. Stop below the blue trend line.RippleFor XRP chart can be said that it stuck to the red line and cannot decide on the direction of further movement. In our opinion, in the current situation, it is more correct to wait for any hints and tips from the market, and only after that to make decisions on whether or not to include this asset in the portfolio. While the technical image looks in such a way that in order to be able to speak with confidence about the beginning of the growth phase, the chart needs to pass the level of $0.31.EOSThe price of EOS came close to the red resistance line, the breakdown of which would open up opportunities for the formation of a long position. While it cannot be noted that there are any signs of individuality in the coin. The dynamics of the market, and on the face of a clear lag behind the market indicators of BTC in the last week. However, trading this asset, it is necessary to execute all the signals of the trading approach, otherwise, you can noticeably lose in efficiency. If in the coming hours' chart remain above $4.85, a signal will appear to buy for the first part of the limit.LitecoinThe price of LTC has reached the key level of $75 for the second time in the last week, but so far the bullish trend, apparently, is not ready at current prices. We believe that we just need to wait for a while for the market itself to tell us the most likely direction of movement. While the trading plan is such that in the event of a breakdown of the green line, we will include a coin in the portfolio, not forgetting about placing a stop-loss order.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

The fact that the XRP has the ability to retain increasing amounts of value as compared with the USD and how macro-forces will effect that store of value (XRP) moving forward is what I wanted to illustrate here.Yeah, total volume processed does not equate to market cap \u2014 totally agree. However, the fact that the processed transaction can stay in XRP is the big difference here and could realistically lead to massive amounts of capital flowing into XRP and STAYING in XRP after the payment is processed simply because those accepting XRP may continue to keep XRP or spend it on their company\u2019s bills.Sorry you found this article unhelpful and junk \u2014 there are plenty of Medium authors out there that you can read.

If you want to buy or exchange STEEM, make sure you entered the memo correctly together with the wallet address.

Stellar has the same system of tags, and it is also known as a memo \u2014 be careful!Ripple (XRP) network has its own similar tags \u2014 a destination tag is a short combination of letters for each Ripple wallet. Therefore, when buying or exchanging XRP, make sure that you correctly entered this tag. On the other hand, when you are sending Ripple, you must indicate the destination tag in the payment specification section, which is usually specify next to the address to which you need to send funds to convert.Monero (XMR) works in a similar way, it requires a Payment ID, which identifies each transaction.

The immediate goal is located in the area of \u200b\u200bthe previous highs of 26 June. As expected, after reducing volatility, the bulls started showing again, but everything happened relatively quickly, which means that big money continues to show interest in this asset even at current levels, and the overall market consensus on the future prospects of the first coin is rather positive. From a practical point of view, it makes sense to stay long until the price reaches the resistance level, and the further strategy will depend on the behavior of participants in the $14,000 key point for 1 BTC.EthereumAt ETH, market participants also show increased activity, volumes have increased, but a pronounced progressive upward movement has not yet occurred. Here, the price is most likely trying to pull up following the BTC movement. It is still far from the highs of June 26, but based on the current technical picture, it is still preferable to stay in a long position with a stop loss below the red line at $300. Scenarios can be very different, but the uptrend indicated by the blue line is still upward, and therefore trading from purchases in the calculation, if not for a quick impulse, then at least to continue the trend, while maintaining general market sentiment, can bring positive results.RippleIn XRP, as in the second altcoin, by market cap, nothing changes. Participants are only interested in BTC and ETH, and nothing can be done about it. As part of portfolio management, as we wrote in the last review, it is advisable to keep a small long position for some diversification in order to reduce risk, as well as in case of a sharp change in the current market situation. Everything can happen, therefore, you don\u2019t want to miss the momentum. The strategy does not change. The apparent weakness in the coin of many disappoints, but this is the market. The volume of long is based on current reality. Stop loss below the blue line.EOSIn EOS, consolidation is preserved and for this reason, the strategy does not change \u2014 we are waiting for an exit, and if the chart break through the level of $6.10, a window will open for opening a long position. So far, altcoins are not in demand, but at the same time, the technical picture hints that, if such a scenario is implemented, the impulse may be sufficient to catch a good ride on it. Careful observation of the dynamics and waiting for the moment is now justified from the point of view of possible future prospects.LitecoinIn LTC, the chart attempted to break the upper limit of the range, but then returned. Apparently, there is a demand for coins, but fear in the market is still stronger. Positions are temporarily covered to clarify the situation. LTC, along with other altcoins, is waiting in the wings, and therefore the capital preservation strategy is most convenient here.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Stop loss at $7800.EthereumETH chart did not come close to the blue trend line to give an opportunity to acquire a significant share in the portfolio. However, this creates a local trend, within which the highs are updated, so there is still the opportunity to buy a little. Stop loss below $240, the closest target in the area of \u200b\u200bthe maximum of the 16th day ($275).RippleIn XRP, the technical picture is somewhat similar to ETH \u2014 the correction turned out to be quite deep, but prices did not reach the blue trend line, and therefore the profit/risk ratio did not provide us with a good opportunity to form a significant coin share in the portfolio. At the same time, a small local trend is forming, and this may eventually turn out to be a turning point for this correction, so after buying the first part of the limit, if the red line is broken, you can already look for an opportunity to increase the size of the position. Immediate goal $0.48 with a probability of an increase. Stop loss below the blue trend line.EOSIn EOS, the price movement is also very similar in shape to the ETH and XRP charts, with the exception that the chart is currently below the blue trend line, which, from the point of view of trading practice, presumes some time pause until more certainty. At the same time, it is worth noting that the formation of a local uptrend also takes place, so if the entire market moves, the coin will not stand aside and if the maximum of 15 May is updated, there will be a good opportunity to include EOS in the portfolio.LitecoinIn LTC, after correction, the local trend also forms above the support line, so we believe that it is already possible to gradually form a long position, while not forgetting that until recently LTC had a noticeable weakness relative to other liquid coins on the cryptocurrency market.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

XRP is now listed and available to trade.About RippleOne of the best-known and established blockchain companies, Ripple, and it\u2019s digital asset XRP, trades in significantly high volumes across the world. Ripple was created to connect digital asset exchanges, payment providers and banks via RippleNet for frictionless money transfers globally. RippleNet utilises advanced blockchain technology, boasting scalability and interoperability between networks.XRP, the digital asset used within the Ripple ecosystem, is a source of liquidity for their customers, which include major institutions such as Santander, Standard Chartered and American Express.GBX-DAX Token ExpansionAs part of our commitment to provide the best trading experience for our users, the GBX starts 2019 as a means to go on \u2014 with new digital asset listings on the GBX-DAX. Ripple will be the first of these new digital assets to be listed on the exchange.The recent approval from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) for the GBX to be awarded a full DLT licence, coupled with our new insurance policy, has certified our institutional-grade status. The GBX is the first fully regulated digital asset exchange to be owned by a traditional stock exchange; the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX). Our good governance, transparency, and best practices have been brought over from the team\u2019s experience within the global capital markets.Nick Cowan, CEO of the GSX Group, commented on onboarding Ripple, stating:\u201cRipple needs no introduction; it is one of the top contenders within the growing blockchain industry. Ripple aims to re-shape the old methods of finance and banking, in many ways similar to our work at the GSX Group, transforming the capital markets through blockchain technology. XRP is traded across exchanges globally, and it is only fitting that the GBX-DAX extends that liquidity and connection. We are one big community, with the goal of mainstream adoption, and listing Ripple, who share our objectives, was an easy decision to make.\u201dXRP Trading PairsRipple (XRP) will be available in the following pairs:XRP/USDXRP/EURXRP/GBPXRP/ETHXRP/BTCTo find out more about GBX, visit:Website: https://gbx.giMedium: https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.ExchangeLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/18286558/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/GibBlockEx/Twitter: https://twitter.com/GibBlockExTelegram: https://t.me/GBXCommunityReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GBXCommunity/BitcoinTalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2684176.msg27421066 \u2014 msg27421066YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/GibraltarBlockchainExchange", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Ripple (XRP) Now Supported On The Crypterium Wallet", "post_link": "https://medium.com/crypterium/ripple-xrp-now-supported-on-the-crypterium-wallet-43dcf337dfe9?source=search_post", "author_name": "Crypterium", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@crypterium", "publish_date": "2019-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-29", "readtime": "5.64", "claps": 101, "voters": 3, "content": "Ripple (XRP) Now Supported On The Crypterium WalletCrypteriumFollowAug 29 \u00b7 6 min readWe\u2019re working non-stop to add support for the best cryptocurrencies in the market.

It has been dabbled in its fair share of controversy, and maybe with some good reasons.This fintech startup is doing a great job by using distributed ledger technology to improve cross border payments and remittances.Unpacking Ripple And Its ComponentsThe Ripple network is an open-source network created to facilitate cheap and fast transactions without relying on third-party intermediaries such as banks.Unlike Bitcoin which was never meant to be a simple transactional currency due to its scalability woes, Ripple was developed to rule international worldwide transactions.The best way to understand Ripple is by first getting a good grasp of the problem that it is trying to solve. According to the Ripple website, the current payment rails do not complement the modern times we live in as they were developed in the \u201cdisco era.\u201dThe traditional financial system suffers from:Slowness: interbank transactions take 3\u20135 days to settleExpensive: people lose $1.6 trillion in transaction fees each yearUnreliable: the financial system has high failure ratesThe Ripple platform has its native currency (XRP) and a network of payment providers known as RippleNet.RippleNet ExplainedRippleNet is a network of financial institutions and payment providers such as banks that utilize solutions developed by Ripple to provide a more efficient and cheaper way of sending money globally.In a nutshell, RippleNet provides users with the quickest and shortest route to transfer money from one person to another.Let\u2019s say you want to send money from Japan to Nigeria. You deposit the money into a Japanese bank which accepts the yen. However, since there is no direct financial connection between Japan and Nigeria, your funds in JPY are first converted to a major global currency such as the US dollars.Then, USD is sent to the recipient in Nigeria where it is converted to the local currency, Naira. There are two conversion processes involved and each step involves transaction fees.RippleNet provides a direct route for you to send money from Japan to Nigeria (or any two countries in the world) without manually going through the USD conversion. The end result is a faster and cheaper process.What is XRP?XRP is the token used as a medium for sending value across the Ripple network. It acts as a bridge for both fiat and other cryptocurrencies.It has been described as a joker, in this case, a currency that can act as any other currency. It can turn into a USD or EUR if you want it to.It is also used for anti-spamming purposes, preventing bad actors from intentionally clogging the network by initiating millions of transactions at the same time.History of Ripple (XRP)The initial concept behind Ripple was conceived around 2004 by Ryan Fugger. Jed McCaleb took over from Fugger\u2019s idea and used it to build what is known as Ripple.McCaleb, who has worked on innovative web technologies, steered the technological aspects of the company until he had a disagreement with management on the direction to steer the company. He decided to go his separate ways after the fallout.The company decided to have 100 billion token pre-mined of which 50 percent was kept by the company. This does not sit well with investors who think that the company controls too much stake and can easily \u201ckill off\u201d the token by dumping it at once in the market.This is one of the reasons why the company took McCaleb to court when he wanted to dump all his XRP when he was leaving the company. He had to sell his stash in chunks to prevent what is known as pump and dump.Ripple InvestorsRipple has partnerships with several financial institutions such as banks. Some of its investors and partners include Standard Chartered, Santander InnoVentures, Seagate Technologies, CME Group, Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, IDG Capital Partners, Vast Ventures, and more.The company raised nearly $96 million between April 2013 and September 2016 in multiple rounds of funding.Key Benefits Of RippleBridge currency: several currencies in the world cannot be directly converted to each other. That\u2019s why the USD is used in international trade. People and companies have to pay double conversion fees when exchanging these currencies. XRP creates a bridge between these currencies and makes it easy to convert from one currency to another.Quick transactions: international transactions take between 1\u20133 days to settle. Ripple transactions settle in seconds.Payment networkThe Bottom LineYou should not see Ripple as a competitor to Bitcoin because the two digital assets are completely different, especially from a governance perspective.The Bitcoin protocol is maintained by an independent pool of miners who receive freshly minted bitcoins as a reward for their efforts. Ripple is more of a transactional currency and has real-life use cases in the remittance industry. The more the company inks more partnerships with banks and financial institutions, the higher the value of the XRP token.About CrypteriumCrypterium is leading fintech startup awarded by KPMG and H2Ventures. Our goal is to ensure anyone can store, send, exchange and spend digital currencies with the same ease as traditional money.Crypterium is led by the former General Manager of Visa Central & Eastern Europe, Steven Parker, and C-level executives from global financial institutions like Renaissance Insurance, London Derivatives Exchange, American Express, etc.Join us on Telegram and other social media to stay tuned with our news!Website \u0e4f Telegram \u0e4f Facebook \u0e4f Twitter \u0e4f Reddit \u0e4f YouTube \u0e4f LinkedIn", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ripple", "Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain", "Fintech", "Crypterium"]}, {"title": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency Review", "post_link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-analysis-btc-eth-xrp-eos-ltc-cryptocurrency-review-93fc9babb2fb?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2019-06-10", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-10", "readtime": "3.80", "claps": 3, "voters": 3, "content": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency ReviewJune 10, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN MAGAZINEMarko VidrihFollowJun 10 \u00b7 4 min readFrom Friday the crypto market is on the side. The capitalization index decreased by 2.4% to $246 billion.Image credit: CoinMarketCapIn a number of coins, there were attempts to get out of range, however, as a result, they were unsuccessful, therefore it can be said that the situation has not changed significantly. The news background is rather neutral, but another reminder that India completely prohibits operations with cryptocurrencies and at the same time introduces criminal liability does not add optimism to the market.BitcoinBTC chart struck the upper limit of the trading range in the region of $7,900, but this time it came up against the upper limit of the downward channel, and then returned to the range. The protective order worked on the return, and at this point, it is premature to say that the coin decided on the direction of further movement. In the case of the breakdown of the blue line, it can be assumed that the trend has changed, however, it will still take some time for the final formation of the reversal pattern. Like last time, we believe that the breakdown of support ($7,500) will open the way to a decline of $7,000.EthereumAt ETH, the price broke through resistance and with it the downtrend line. However, the movement did not receive its continuation and chart returned. We were consistent, so a short stop-loss worked. After a false breakdown, it is always important to take a pause so that you can assess the situation in a calm atmosphere. Now the price is below the support level and has reached the price of $230. In the current situation, a further decline seems to be the most likely scenario, so we remain out of position. A key pivot point has not yet formed.RippleIn XRP we also had an attempt to open a small long in the area of \u200b\u200bapproaching quotation to the green line of the short-term trend, however, in this case, the movement along with the market went down, so short protective orders allowed us to get rid of minimal losses. Now there is a decrease in quotation to $0.37, where the medium-term support is held and it will be possible to predict the further trend based on the activity of the coin and the dynamics of trading indicators at this point.EOSEOS also formed a false breakdown, and a short stop-loss, in this case, helped us out. The coin is subject to general market sentiment, however, unlike, for example, from ETH, while the price is trying to rebound from support in the region of $6 per coin. We feel that is worth to wait. There are no signs that there is again a large buyer in the coin until it is observed, so we are watching the dynamics. Now the technical picture looks in such a way that in order to change the situation, the chart will need to show growth and gain a foothold above the level of $6.8.LitecoinLTC is the only one we consider in the review of coins that, one might say, \u201cpulled out\u201d the portfolio from the negative zone following the results of the false breakdown formed in a number of coins. In this case, diversification as a tool to reduce risk has once again shown its advantages. However, it was not possible to pass the resistance of the quote. While the position is covered and now for its restoration quotation need to pass the level of $120.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

With an expected surge of jobs in tech, particularly, this puts women at a serious earning disadvantage.While a gender skills gap certainly exists, let\u2019s not ignore the elephant in the room \u2014 there are several other reasons why women might be hesitant to pursue a career in tech. Last week\u2019s nauseating report on UploadVR\u2019s treatment of female employees is enough to put anyone off, regardless of a higher pay package.Sadly, these reports aren\u2019t anomalous. A recent US study found that one in ten women working in tech experience unwanted sexual attention, and nearly one in four people of colour face stereotyping. So, you can hardly blame women, and women in colour in particular, for believing that tech might not be the best sector for them.The lack of gender diversity in tech presents three big issues: discrimination, unappealing workplaces and a lack of safe learning environments.At Chayn, we believe in equal opportunities and ending workplace discrimination. This is where Ammal, a digital skills sharing network, providing free classes for self-identifying women, was born. Launched with the following plan, Ammal promised to: \u201ccreate an open and collaborative network of women who support and empower each other by passing on the skills they have and the skills they\u2019ve learned to other women.\u201dChayn is a D-I-Y, tech for good charity, formed by founder Hera Hussain when she realised the lack of resources available to women in abusive relationships. Ammal came from a similar attitude of \u2018if it\u2019s not yet available, create it\u2019. Meaning action and hope in Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, Ammal hopes to incite these very values and emotions in its attendees, encouraging attendees to pass skills gained onto other women in their life, upskilling via a ripple effect.Talking about how she first got the idea to set up Ammal, Chayn volunteer, Jessica Morley shared: \u201cWe set up Ammal because we noticed that there was a real need to increase the representation of women in tech, but very often women lacked confidence in their tech skills or didn\u2019t know how to access relevant education.\u201dShe added, \u201cThis was particularly true of women who wouldn\u2019t necessarily have access to formal education routes. Ammal was set up to fill these gaps.\u201dWith courses covering topics like logo design, personal branding, the freelance hustle and careers sessions on improving employability, Ammal was launched in 2015.The pilot was funded by UnLtd, providing sessions to 16\u201330 year olds in Tower Hamlets, London. Following the first session on \u201cHow to get Hired\u201d, the feedback received was extremely positive. While 100% of attendees said that they will pass on skills gained to other women they know, a staggering 92% said that they would recommended Ammal to a friend.The ripple effect had begun.Garance Mourgaud, who attended the \u2018How to get Hired\u2019 workshop and thereafter became a Chayn volunteer herself, found in Ammal, a safe and supportive environment she hadn\u2019t previously experienced:\u201cSome young women can have a tendency to compete and fight each other instead of supporting one another. Ammal aims to empower young women through knowledge sharing and network support.\u201d Garance shared \u201cThis workshop gave me basic yet strong skills and tools to keep teaching myself, and above all, gave me the confidence to keep trying.\u201dPicture courtesy: Catherine BridgemanAmmal organiser, Afsa Akbar agreed that it\u2019s this supportive environment that makes Ammal unique:\u201cOne of our attendees on a recent Wordpress for beginners course had been wanting to learn how to use Wordpress for a while but had found the online courses unhelpful. She wasn\u2019t confident in learning digital skills and wanted someone to show her how to use it, face to face. Attending Ammal and having female organisers take her through it, step-by-step, gave her the confidence to be able to build her own website and apply this valuable skill in her own work.\u201dIn November 2016, following the success of the U.K. branch, the next chapter of Ammal was born, with a bootcamp of four workshops held in Lahore, Pakistan. Female attendees were provided with a crash course on career planning, professional development, CV writing, interview training, and basic digital skills that improve employability.Following the Lahore workshop, many of the attendees volunteered to speak at future bootcamps. However, like the London chapter, Ammal is now working to set these offers in stone, working with MakeSense to figure out how to incentivise attendees to continue passing on their skills gained, with the aim of scaling the initiatives so that they can be replicated nationally, and globally.Ammal is certainly living out its name and we at Chayn are very hopeful that we will be able to deliver workshops through this project in order to upskill women globally.With women supporting one another, Ammal founder Jessica believes these bold plans are certainly possible:\u201cThe main lesson I\u2019ve learned from Ammal is how important it is for women to support women. It\u2019s incredibly important and incredibly powerful.\u201dThis blog post was written by Chayn volunteer, Olivia Jardine.

He added:\u201cWe can comfortably say that we expect to release the world\u2019s first XRP ETP within the next two months.\u201dAmun has also received permission to issue ETP, associated with four more cryptocurrency assets, including BCH, LTC, XLM, and EOS. Although the exact time to launch these products has not yet been determined and will depend on customer interest, he said that the company plans to add to the listing all approved cryptocurrency ETP on SIX by the end of this year.SIX Exchange agreed to launch ETP, which tracks the basket of the largest cryptocurrencies, in November 2018. This product was released by Amun for retail and institutional investors under the ticker HODL. In the past few weeks, Amun has also released Bitcoin and ether based ETP. Rashwan added that today most buyers of cryptocurrency ETP are located in Switzerland, while foreign investors also get access to Swiss markets in accordance with the laws on securities of their countries.Currently, SIX is creating its own crypto-asset exchange, seeking to use distributed registry technology to speed up calculations and trade in tokenized assets. Recently, the R3 Corda Enterprise platform was selected for this purpose. SIX Digital Exchange is scheduled to launch in the second half of 2019. In this regard, Rashvan said:\u201cI don\u2019t think we will have a real licensed and regulated securities token exchange with a professional partner in a reputable country until late this year or early next year \u2014 that\u2019s my guess.

In our case, the purchase orders worked, however, upon the return of quotations back to the trading range, the entire position, taking into account the one bought earlier, was eliminated. Over the past two weeks, the market has twice seen a false breakdown in this coin, in connection with which the conclusion about the adjustment of the current strategy, taking into account the amplitude-frequency characteristics of price movements. It is possible that the next update of the highs makes sense to skip in order to confirm or refute the assumption of changes in market characteristics. We remain out of position for this instrument until the situation is clarified.RippleIn the XRP breakdown of local resistance happened and the position has been increased. Now the share of the coin in the portfolio is held. Currently, the chart is moving within an uptrend, and the blue line can be used as a level for placing a protective order. Immediate goals are $0.32 and $0.342.EOSAt EOS, it was not possible to pass resistance at the level of monthly highs from the first time; as a result, the market forced us to take profit on the breakdown of a protective stop order. We still note that there are buyers in the instrument, so after some consolidation, we do not rule out another attempt to move above $4.40. At the same time, we believe that much will depend on the overall market dynamics, therefore, in the event of a decline in the entire market, we consider the scenario of chart movement to the level of $4 per 1 EOS coin, as quite probable.LitecoinIn LTC, the situation has not changed significantly. The chart is still in the range of $58- $62. It is worth noting that in recent days there has been a narrowing of the trading range and consolidation near the upper border. In our opinion, in case of a breakdown of the $62 mark, one can open long positions. We believe that long-term consolidation could benefit the bulls, as it allowed the coin to clear itself of impatient speculators, and for large participants to form the necessary positions in terms of volume.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Because of this, the foundation set aside 20 billion STR to periodically give away to BTC/XRP holders. Comments from Stellar.org on the program details:\u201cDecentralized payment network Stellar has announced the final round of its Bitcoin-Lumen Program, where Bitcoin holders can claim its lumen token for free. The program, which began in April 2016, features 19 percent of the total lumen supply, which developers reserved at launch exclusively for Bitcoin users. Of the 19 bln lumens on offer, only 3 bln formed the first round of the giveaway, that was concluded in October 2016. with release details of the remaining 16 bln to be officially announced on March 28.The value of the remaining tokens is approximately $16 mln.\u201dThe STR claim for XRP/BTC holders will end two-months after it begins:\u201cOn June 27th, 2017, we will make available these lumens to any bitcoin holder who wants them, including those that received lumens during the first giveaway round\u201d, says the company in its circular.Seems pretty altruistic and cool, but as you can see in the picture above there is a major increase in the STR volume and price. Cryptocurrency \u2018pump and dumps\u2019 seem to be occurring far too often and those that get sucked into them without knowing how to hedge from the risk can get harmed badly. Here is the original post I found about the giveaway:So, STR has clearly seen a bump up in price the last week per the picture above. It may be a speculation, but there is a major pump going on across Bitcoin (BTC), Stellar (STR), and Ripple (XRP) right now and XRP just passed up Ethereum (ETH) in market capitalization\u2026what\u2019s going to happen here? Looks like a potential mess waiting to happen if you\u2019re not aware of what may be some of the major driving factors.Has anyone participated in a giveaway like this before?In order to protect ourselves as cryptocurrency holders and members of the Steem community, will a 19 billion STR giveaway affect other cryptocurrencies?How might this affect STEEM? Currently, there are only 9 billion STR in circulation.Will this cause massive decreases in STR/BTC/XRP prices once the STR is distributed to BTC/XRP holders?Will STR prices see a decrease in price considering the inflow of coins? Or will we see an opportunistic pumper come in and manipulate?What will happen with other currencies that are dependent on BTC/ETH?I enjoy writing about current and thought provoking happenings along with spreading awareness for specific events like this. Steemit is an awesome community to be a part of so far and I\u2019m excited to connect with more Steemians!!

This fantastic organization helps veterans prepare for careers outside the military. Their focus is to help provide training, mentorship and job placement for Salesforce Cloudsource technology careers.The men and women that I\u2019ve met through this great organization never cease to amaze me. Their grit and determination coupled with their willingness to embrace new challenges and conquer new skills is so inspiring.I was blessed to share some thoughts about the importance of connecting and building one\u2019s network the right way with Mervis\u2019 latest class. We talked about networking opportunities, interview strategies and ultimately how to relate some of their military experience to the benefit of their potential employer.To say this was an engaged audience would be an understatement.In speaking with this organization, as well as others that support our transitioning military, it amazes me how nervous many of these incredibly talented men and women are to make the transition to civilian life. I feel like the military could do way more to help these American heroes be better prepared for a life and career outside of the service.That\u2019s why the work that organizations like the Mervis Foundation doare so important.In my time presenting to these transitioning military audiences, it surprises me how difficult it is for many of these folks to get jobs out in the civilian sector. If you ask me, there is a large talent pool that often many employers and certainly recruiters miss when seeking candidates. These men and women show a level of dedication, commitment and a willingness to learn like no others.They just need a chance.The transition from their military career into a civilian job doesn\u2019t always translate directly into a potential job opportunity. Often times this undermines a candidate\u2019s confidence in what positions they even apply for. Many of the conversations I have with these men and women revolve around helping them associate their experience from their military service by expanding upon what they\u2019ve learned through their last career \u2014 problem solving, teamwork, asset management and leadership are all relevant experiences that can and will benefit a potential employer.These skills are an asset to a company of any size yet, hard to quantify and truly explain in a resume. Unfortunately these potential super stars of tomorrow are often overlooked because the resume doesn\u2019t quite tell the story of their experience and how it might benefit an organization.That\u2019s why they need our help.I implore anyone in hiring capacity to look closely into any candidate with military experience that applies for a position with your organization.The resume may not quite tell you why you need to spend some time with the candidate but trust me you do! If you will just take a chance and sit down with them, ask them about some of their experiences in the military and what they\u2019ve learned because of it and just allow a conversation to happen, you will be impressed. I have no doubt you will discover someone you might have otherwise overlooked. Someone willing to give it their all not because they have to but because they want to. It\u2019s ingrained in their DNA.They\u2019ll put in the time to learn whatever you put in front of them. They\u2019ll work harder, smarter and get more done than you could possibly imagine. They\u2019ll prove to you and to themselves what an incredible asset they can be to your company.They just need a chance.This isn\u2019t hyperbole, I actual proved this out in my former company and continue to do some with one of my software companies today. My very best hires all have military experience. In every single circumstance on paper they weren\u2019t necessarily a match for the job I was seeking to fill at the time but I took a chance. I believed they could learn. I believed they could adapt. I believe that they could be a valuable asset to my companies and treated them as such from day one.To say they all surpassed my expectations would be an understatement.I can honestly say I will continue to build my companies around more of these ex-military heroes. Not because they need the charity of a job but because they are likely some of the most loyal and result-focused employees I could possibly hire. I can grow a company with people like that. People who genuinely care as much as I do about the mission and will be there in a pinch to provide cover and support for \u201ctheir\u201d team.And when you invest a little in someone who is hungry, focused and committed to the mission ahead, well my friend you have just created the ultimate Ripple for them, for you and for your company.Get out of the way, these heroes are ready to work.Ripple On!!!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Veterans", "Military", "Career Transition", "Mervis Foundation", "Networking"]}, {"title": "Ripple, xRapid, XRP \u2014 The Game Changer of Transfering Value?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/ripple-xrapid-xrp-the-game-changer-of-transfering-value-7febc737ef8b?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-06-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.30", "claps": 52, "voters": 3, "content": "Ripple, xRapid, XRP \u2014 The Game Changer of Transfering Value?John SaddingtonFollowJun 18, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readRipple, xRapid, and XRP are trying to convince people it\u2019s a game-changer.Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ripple", "Xrapid", "Xrp", "Blockchain", "Bitcoin"]}, {"title": "3 Big Problems Ripple Investors Cannot Ignore \u2014 #OPINION", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/3-big-problems-ripple-investors-cannot-ignore-opinion-bdf067c02ab4?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 4, "voters": 2, "content": "3 Big Problems Ripple Investors Cannot Ignore \u2014 #OPINIONJohn SaddingtonFollowMar 29, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readHere are a few things that Ripple Investor should know about\u2026Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ripple", "Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "How and Where to Buy Ripple", "post_link": "https://medium.com/kriptomat-blog/how-and-where-to-buy-ripple-99a763ac41b1?source=search_post", "author_name": "\u017diga P. \u0160kraba", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kriptomat", "publish_date": "2019-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-27", "readtime": "8.38", "claps": 12, "voters": 3, "content": "How and Where to Buy Ripple\u017diga P. \u0160krabaFollowMar 22 \u00b7 9 min readRipple has been getting more and more attention in the last couple of years.

In order to use cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll need to use a cryptocurrency wallet.At this point in time, there are wallets which can handle more than one cryptocurrency. Of course there are ones that are built specifically for one coin too. Every wallet has two important features. A public address, which you can share with other people so that they can send you funds. You can think of this as you IBAN number.The second feature is your private key. This is a secret code that you should never share with anyone. Anyone with access to your private key can remove all your funds from your wallet. Think of the private key as your bank account password. It is used for proving an address is owned by you.A wallet is essentially like your online bank account, and your address is like your account number.

It\u2019s an open source distribution system that is in the beta stage. Many people still think that ripple is the generic name of a digital electronic money. The ripple network was launched in 2012 with the goal of making it easy for people to use banking, paypal, credit cards or financial institutions at an extremely low cost with a fast speed. Ripple uses blockchain chaining technology similar to the Bitcoin virtual currency, which helps accelerate the pace of financial transactions between banks.Ripple development teamRipple coin / protocol was developed and developed by OpenCoin, which : Chris Larsen is chief executive officer and chief technology officer Jed McCaleb. Larsen is the co-founder and also the chief financial officer of E-LOAN and finally, McCaleb is from Mt. Gox. Plus, many other members of the Ripple are experts in virtual currency research, especially they are very knowledgeable about the Bitcoin platform.Is Ripple a replicate of Bitcoin ?It\u2019s a sure thing that while learning about Ripple, many people will wonder is Ripple the same with Bitcoin virtual currency? The answer is \u201cthey have some mutual points \u201c. For example, the XRP unit of the Ripple is a digital based pre-type that works on mathematical formulas and limited release quantities. Both Bitcoin and Ripple use peer-to-peer P2P networks, which means that transactions do not require third party interference. Along with that, the anti-counterfeiting or inflation of these two currencies is similar.However, the reason of Ripple being created was to support Bitcoin, not to become a competitor. The Ripple network is designed to serve currency transfers seamlessly, whether it\u2019s any of the national currencies: USD, British Pound, Euro or even Bitcoin.XRP is a distributed network so it does not depend on any company or organization to manage, so the data and transaction information are guaranteed to be safe, without waiting for confirmation that can go over the network quickly.Ripple\u2019s ratingAccording to the developers of Ripple, there will be about 100 billion XRPs released, half will be held by the company, the other half will be circulated in the market. When KriptoA were writing this article, the price of the Ripple is $ 0.167788 and has a total market capitalization of more than $ 6 billion, which is more than 3 million BTC.The Price Of RippleIf you are interested in this type of currency, you can monitor the rate of Ripple in every single day to understand the price fluctuation of it. Keeping update the latest news about ripple or Bitcoin, as the ripple price will be directly affected by such market information as well as Bitcoin pricing.The attraction of Ripple to large banks all around the worldTalking about partners of Ripple, we can give you some big names such as Google, IDG Capital Partners, Anderssen or AME Cloud Ventures. Ripple has so far reached $ 93 million- an extremely impressive number for a start-up company set up in 2012. According to the Coindesk site, the amount of money Ripple is ranked 4th in the segment of the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Services. The value of the Ripple has increased by more than 25% after announcing that it had raised $ 55 million- Forrtune magazine .Ripple\u2019s global high-flyRipple\u2019s Ceo- Mr. Chris Larsen, said that RIpple is rapidly allocating funds to global stature plans.Here\u2019s a his answer in the interview with CNBC:\u201cWe are expanding the areas where we have offices. Ripple wants to expand further and develop capabilities for new groups.

It is a common metaphor in social science literature, however it has never been properly defined and expounded as a useful concept beyond the turn of phrase. I believe it can be studied successfully using systems, cybernetic, and network theories and models of the globalized world.Moreover, simply as a literary metaphor, it has underutilized potential in the public \u2018global village\u2019 discourse. The mere suggestion of it as a measurable concept may turn off scholars as it implies a sheer incalculability of effects. We are, after all, talking about actual multi-dimensional ripple effects in social systems, not a tranquil pond.Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t make contemplating our own actions any less important or constructive, especially in the context of the continuing collapse of the global and local into one another. Given the poignancy, utility, and currency of other related concepts such as the \u2018ecological footprint\u2019, \u2018carbon footprint\u2019, and \u2018water footprint\u2019, the \u2018ripple effect\u2019 should be considered for empirical development as a metric for one\u2019s social impact on the world.Sometimes there are directly observable consequences to our actions, but for the most part the effects of our daily routines are unseen in any intelligible way. We see global environmental devastation and social strife on the news but we remain completely dumbfounded as to our contribution to these effects, and we\u2019re at just as much of a loss to know how make a difference for the better.While the risks we face are systemic and seemingly beyond our control, on some level one must reduce society to its individual unit: You. To this effect, risk theorist Ulrich Beck writes,\u201cWhatever propels risk and makes it incalculable, whatever provokes the institutional crisis at the level of the governing regime and the markets, shifts the ultimate decision-making responsibility onto the individuals, who are ultimately left to their own devices with their partial and biased knowledge, with undecidability and multiple layers of uncertainty.\u201d \u2014 Ulrich BeckHere it would seem that our ripple effects are so incalculable that it would be an encumbrance to stop and consider them. Decision makers are expected to do their job with incomplete information. Consequently, they aren\u2019t held accountable when shit hits the fan. This leads us to make decisions and take actions with a sort of indifference or amoral conscience. More specifically, the complexity of it all engenders a sort of wilful ignorance. Along these lines, the famed sociologist Max Weber wrote,\u201cIn the great majority of cases actual action goes on in a state of inarticulate half-consciousness or actual unconsciousness of its subjective meaning. The actor is more likely to \u201cbe aware\u201d of it in a vague sense than he is to \u201cknow\u201d what he is doing or be explicitly self-conscious about it. In most cases his action is governed by impulse or habit.\u201d \u2014 Max WeberThus, the maxim knowledge is power is largely incomplete. First of all, it is more accurate to say that knowledge is power when applied, but highest formulation and most noble would be to say true knowledge applied correctly is conducive to power that is constructive, and thus, more good.Finally, it is not complete unless we reflexively understand the positive or negative effects of our individual power and reform our action accordingly. Thus, Weber\u2019s point highlights the importance of individual reflexivity. By that I mean, we need to continually learn how we create ripple effects are, and what the outcomes they produce.In the global village in which we now live, we must appreciate the effects of our actions on both the micro and macro scales. Our mere participation in society has consequences across the globe. Sociologist Norman Long writes,\u201cparticular social interactions and decisions have a ripple effect on more distant social arenas, or over time create emergent sets of relations that form larger-scale systems or fields of action.\u201d \u2014 Normal LongThis is only becoming truer as global integration increase and technology shrinks temporal and spatial aspects of the globe. Every individual shares culpable for problems we co-create and the burden of living together. We need to take responsibility for ripple effects we send out, causing the current crises, even though its difficult to see how. As Ulrich Beck writes,\u201cwho in a legally relevant sense \u2018causes\u2019 pollution, or a financial crises, is difficult to determine, since these events are the result of interactions among many individuals.\u201d \u2014 Ulrich BeckTaking responsibility begins with a sociological imagination, and continues with expanding ones awareness from their physical reach to the entire earth. It is virtually impossible to disassociate ourselves from the negative effects and byproducts of our levels of consumption and destruction, but this abstract metaphor takes us a long way to becoming aware and finding ways to critique our own relationship to the world.It\u2019s worth mentioning too that we can\u2019t talk about ripple effects without also talking about the butterfly effect, tipping points, and negative externalities.The ripple effect should be distinguished from the \u2018butterfly effect\u2019, a term from chaos theory, which stipulates that a small action in a complex system can be amplified and produce large effects elsewhere in the system. The ripple effect may have more relative application in considering the aggregate effect of individual actions.Therefore, global problems such as pollution, poverty, corruption, systemic ignorance, which are caused by no primary actor, can be explained by the ripple effect, as based on the aggregate empowerment of individuals. Another related term is the \u2018domino effect\u2019 which implies Newtonian transference of energy in a linear system.A tipping point is also different in that it can refer to crossing thresholds, achieving critical mass, or virality. When something reaches a tipping point, the returns on the action can be unexpectedly and unpredictably large, as other facts in the system catalyze and react with the input(s). In the context of sociology, a tipping point indicates a rapid change in behaviour of a group, be it positive or negative. Might I say that we need to reach a tipping point in how we consider our ripple effects.In economics, a negative externality is a cost incurred against a person who had nothing to do with the transaction that created it. (Air) pollution is the typical example. There are direct individual consequences to this (people die from exposure), but more important is the abstract aggregate effect. Anthropogenic climate change is the ultimate catastrophic result of the billions of little acts of pollution.Civilization is deeply interconnected, and all our actions send ripple effects into the world which produce aggregate devastation. Inequality, climate change, racism, war, poverty, terrorism, collapse. For all of these things the complexity outdoes us, and we can\u2019t allow it any longer. We must understand our ripple effects or create none at all.Further reading:Stochastic Terrorism: Triggering the shooters.(This update is to resolve some ambiguity.)

After the breakdown of the highs of May 13 and 15, the conditions for the formation of a long position with acceptable risk are again created. At the moment in the BTC/USD pair quotes, there is overbought, which, most likely, will be withdrawn in the coming hours. After that, continued growth is possible.

Since Monday, the capitalization index has added 1.1%, having risen to a value of $268 billion. It is always tiring to wait for all the conditions on the market to develop exactly as the system approach requires. However, the correct logic of reasoning, in this case, is most likely this \u2014 the longer we wait for the right moment, the less we have to wait for it. In some instruments, the first signs of a change in the situation and the opportunity to make the first purchase already appear.Image credit: CoinMarketCapIt may interest you to know that Altcoin Magazine, with its intention to expand its services, has launced a private Altcoin Magazine Index Fund.

From a technical point of view, if the bulls can pull the price above the highs of the 28th in the region of $9,850 and gain a foothold there, then this trend will be the main one. It will have good chances for its continuation, and therefore it will be time for a new series of trade from purchases.EthereumETH remains in the outset. Over the past two days, the situation has not changed at all. It may be noted that the local level of support has formed in the region of $204. From a technical point of view, a small purchase at current prices with a stop below this level can be justified in the hope of a quick reversal of the market. There are signs of a reversal, so the purchase can be made already now with a little advance. At the same time, the size of the position should take into account the fact that for the time being these are only assumptions about the imminent reversal and much will depend on market sentiment.RippleThe XRP price rebounded slightly from support at $0.305 but continues to sideways and there are no obvious signs of a change in the situation. Break of the red line will be a signal to start trading from purchases. Also, the technical situation should allow making trial purchases with an acceptable profit/risk ratio, in the case of another approximation of quotations to the level of $0.307.EOSAt EOS, the price is a bit \u201cstuck up\u201d in uncertainty. From a practical point of view, there is nothing to do here until price return above $4.40, since the risk of decline remains. At the same time, it is worth keeping in mind the fact that the coin was the first one we considered that updated the local high last week. This may be a sign of a major customer. If this is the case, then after the start of the upward movement to EOS, you should take a closer look. It is possible to redistribute the limit when opening a position in favor of this tool. As we remember, it happened several times already that it was EOS that showed leading dynamics.LTCThere are some changes in LTC. Formed a new local trend. The movement is very technical, which allows you to trade from the purchase with small risk. The target above is $113, stop-loss below the blue line. The ratio of profit and risk, which we wrote about in the last review, as a necessary condition for entering the market, in this case, is observed with a margin.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Compared to Wednesday, capitalization fell by 7% to $228 billion.BitcoinBTC tried twice but could not pass the level of $8350, after which a regular correction began. During the breakdown of $7650, the rest of the position was closed and now the blue trend line acts as a price guide for the current wave of decline. At the moment there is some oversold, large volumes have passed, so trial purchases of moderate size can be made now. In case of approaching chart to it, we will wait for the formation of pivot points and look for a moment to increase the size of the position. Stop-loss below the blue line.EthereumAt ETH, relatively large amounts of money are being spent, the coin has quickened and over the past two days, it looked even more confident than BTC. The correction also affected ETH, but so far everything is happening within the framework of a movement that can be analyzed. We are waiting for the chart to approach the blue trend line or the breakdown of the highs from the 16th day. In both cases, the profit/risk ratio will be acceptable. As for the size of the position, it will depend on the magnitude of the risk at the time of opening the position, if such an event occurs. While staying out of position in this coin.RippleThe XRP is well shot, but now it is also well adjusted. High volumes and volatility remain, however, the renewal of the minima within the framework of this correction suggests that we should wait. While the landmark is the blue trend line. When approaching the chart, you will need to build a strategy based on the price dynamics of the entire market. The coin is relatively light and the indicator of asset volatility is higher than the market one, which should always be considered when forming a position in this coin.EOSEOS showed a reversal formation when it failed to update a maximum of the 15th and after that, the chart fell below the green line. Now the price is below the blue trend line and you need to carefully look at the dynamics of the chart. In the event that chart in the coming hours returns above the trend line or a pivot point forms on a lower timeframe, you can try to restore the position with a short stop-loss. Otherwise, we remain out of position.LitecoinIn LTC there was a sharp breakdown, after which the coin reached the price of $106 by inertia, and then returned to yesterday below the red line. This dynamic suggests that at the moment it is still the weakest tool we are considering and we must be careful with it. While there are no signals, local minima are being updated, so we are watching from the outside.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

To do this we need three key things: interoperability, smart contracts and a blockchain that\u2019s open source, decentralized, permissionless, reliable and secure. For blockchain, RippleNet is built on the XRP ledger which allows on demand real time payments in seconds with incredibly low cost and no settlement risk,\u201d Larsen explained. \u201cW3C is working on interoperability.\u201dAs for Ripple\u2019s relationship with the cryptocurrency XRP, Johnson said, \u201cWe own a lot of XRP, $60 billion of the $100 billion that exists.

Let\u2019s take a first look at the second quarter (Q2) of 2019 and look at how the market around Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin, IOTA and other altcoins behaved. Who were the big winners, how is the market momentum, what are the trends, how did IEOs perform, who was the top coin and more.Crypto Market Up $200 Billion in Value \u2014 Growth of 125%We all realized that the Q2 offered a foretaste of what to expect from a real Bitcoin & Crypto bull-run. We are deliberately talking about a real run here, as we have had a bull market since the end of Crypto Winter since the beginning of this year. But it was the Q2 2019 that triggered a real FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) for the first time since the highs of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and other.The chart shows very nicely how the rise in June could accelerate again and shows that the trading volume has almost doubled since April. The main driver of this strong crypto market performance was, of course, the Bitcoin price, which we will take a closer look at, as well as the other top 5 cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin + 165%, Ripple + 28%, Ethereum + 107%, Litecoin + 103% and Bitcoin Cash + 137%The Top 5 Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are the main drivers of strong crypto market performance in Q2 2019. But we also see clearly that it is in this Ripple (if you want to see + 28% as a loss), because Ripple (XRP) could not keep up with the top performance of the rest of the Top 5 Cryptos (by MarketCap).Surprising for some is certainly the strong performance of Bitcoin Cash, which went hand in hand with the strong Bitcoin price performance and outperformed the rest. Even the Litecoin Halving FOMO was \u201conly\u201d up to 103% plus, with much of it priced in Q1. All in all, the top 5 together rose 108% in Q2 2019, a real top performance if we look at the crypto market over time.Review of the Top 30 Cryptos \u2014 4 newcomers and 1 loser in the Top 30 Crypto ChartsIf we take a look at the Top 30 of all cryptos again (by MarketCap), we see 4 newcomers in the top 30 and 1 big loser. While Huobi Token (HT), QTUM, LEO (Bitfinex Token) and Chainlink (LINK) can look forward to a new placement, Tezos (TZ) has been handed down to 23rd place, losing 6 places compared to Q1.Especially Chainlink was able to accelerate through a huge increase in Q2 and is on the rise after the performance. Nevertheless, the course is now under pressure, we have looked at the whole thing in analysis again.Than who other than Huobi token is here, should not be a surprise since the Exchange tokens such as Binance Coin or Huobi Token are among the top performers in 2019.Author: Marko VidrihImages credit CoinGecko@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

The CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) is a ballot measure set for November 2018, backed by a small team, including a local real estate developer, a former financial executive, and a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst. While several major major tech companies initially opposed the measure, Facebook recently withdrew from the fight. Recent Cambridge Analytica data leaks have added a poignancy to Facebook\u2019s role in protecting user data.\u201cSeveral countries and states in the U.S. have followed GDPR with similar privacy initiatives. Use public support for the initiative to your advantage.\u201dTWEET THISThe CCPA has strong momentum to pass. If it does not, swelling popularity for the legislation is still a call for California companies to clean up their data policies and protect their customers.CCPA: Major Points to KnowThe CCPA would give consumers three major rights:Ask companies to disclose what consumer data they have collected.Demand that companies not sell the data or share with third parties for business purposes.Sue or fine companies that violate the law.Broken down further, the CCPA asks that businesses that collect personal data disclose the categories of information they are obtaining. If a business opts to sell this information, they must explain to individuals what categories of data they are selling and to whom. If an individual does not want their information sold, the CCPA gives them the right to maintain a consistent level of service and steady costs (i.e., not be discriminated against for not consenting). Under the act, companies are required to clearly display a link that says \u201cdo not sell my data\u201d at the bottom of any page that collects personal information. The CCPA also increases fines and penalties for companies that do not take reasonable measures to secure consumer data (as California law already requires).The act applies only to businesses that earn $50,000,000 a year in revenue, sell 100,000 consumers\u2019 records each year, or derive 50% of their annual revenue by selling personal information. Similar to the GDPR, all businesses that sell or collect personal information from Californians, even if they are located outside of California (i.e., Seattle-based Amazon), must comply with the CCPA.The measure\u2019s backers currently have >600,000 signatures, nearly 2X the 366,000 minimum requirement. Present private and public sector coalition backers include the Consumer Federation of California, DuckDuckGo, Consumer Reports, BLUR, DeleteMe, Catalina\u2019s List, the Center for Public Interest Law, the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, and the Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine.Read the full initiative here.The Bad NewsThe practice of collecting consumer data has expanded without regulation for years. Many companies have rapidly built themselves on this information, which underpins their marketing, product development, industry research, and corporate strategy. Now, they must make major operational changes, such as:Tighten and clearly communicate the process whereby customers can request access to their data, have it erased, or transfer it to another data controller.Create new systems with better user management and/or potentially hire more IT staff.Consider outsourcing core services to a managed services provider.Work with pared-down data sets in the event that consumers withdraw their information.California companies that process the data of EU residents are also subject to the same noncompliance fine that EU companies are (the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of the global annual revenue) as the GDPR deadline approaches on May 25.Figuring out what to do to bring your company into compliance has never been more important.The Good NewsSince California is a hotbed of startups, many young and medium-sized teams are flexible by nature. In contrast to industries like insurance, where many teams have processes set in stone over decades, many tech companies are more nimble and willing to adapt to changing circumstances. Already, companies are sending out updated privacy-policy emails to their customers:With the push to comply with the GDPR, and in anticipation of similar regulations like the CCPA, teams are quickly taking action. In addition to email, some best practices are arising on the back end, including identity and access tools, specialized managed service providers, and enhanced anomaly protections for suspicious user behavior.\u201cAuth0 has anomaly detection to protect consumer information.\u201dTWEET THISAnomaly DetectionMany companies are taking advantage of anomaly detection tools to ensure that the users accessing consumer information are (1) who they say they are and (2) behaving appropriately. With large companies giving access to a wide swath of users both internally (IT staff, marketers, managers) and externally (third-party contractors or consultants), it can be difficult to figure out who is logging in when and from where, and who is using what device(s). Implementing identity access and management tools that incorporate anomaly detection can be essential for avoiding fraudulent practices.With Auth0, anomaly detection is customizable. Once enabled, you can set rules that alert administrators to any suspicious activity and block login attempts by specific users if, say, they are working with data they do not have authorization to use or they fail to enter the system with the correct password.Teams have been testing and finding early successes with these and other new features, like user dashboard views. Even if you\u2019re not a hot tech startup, you still have the advantage of proximity to some of the most cutting-edge technologies and resources in the world.Seize the opportunityInstead of facing the CCPA with anxiety or opposition, use the public support for such a measure to your advantage.

However, by now it has already returned, dropping not only below the level of the first test purchase but also below the short-term trend line. In such circumstances, the position should be closed without the slightest regret. The trend formed on the chart has broken. It is very difficult to make a forecast with a high degree of accuracy relative to the immediate prospects of the coin. From a technical point of view, it is equally probable that a movement to the minimum area of \u200b\u200bthe 15th day will occur, as well as a slight correction of the trend line with a continued upward trend. The practical side of trading implies the need to wait for the moment when a point is formed on the chart to open a position with an acceptable ratio of profit to risk.EthereumThis time in ETH the situation is more interesting since the chart only came close to the trend line. The upward trend continues and it may turn out that this is a chance to buy a coin with minimal risk for the first part of the limit. Growth is still limited by the level of $204, which the price did not manage to pass the first time. But with a stop value of $3\u20134, the ratio of potential profit to risk has the potential to open a small long when the price is near the green line.RippleIn XRP, the situation is similar to the situation in BTC \u2014 a breakdown of the upper boundary of the triangle gave this time a good impulse for a market outsider. As a result, the price quickly reached the resistance at around $0.292. After that, during the weekend, chart decreased and eventually broke the uptrend line. It is unambiguous to say which course of events at this point is most likely difficult right now. From a practical point of view, it is still more profitable to take a neutral position and wait for the most convenient moment for trading. For almost a year, this coin has been behaving in such a way that the short-term impulse in it does not mean anything. But it is quite possible that in case of growth of the whole market, we will see positive changes here too since there are signs of a probable change in the situation. To do this, wait for the breakdown of resistance ($0.295).EOSEOS chart remains sideways, there are no changes so far. Trading within the trading range may not be effective in every case. In order to maintain capital, you can remain in a neutral position and wait for more interesting opportunities. A signal for the first purchase may be a breakdown of the highs from the 19th.LTCIn LTC, the technical picture does not change. The chart remains sideways. The attempt of the \u201cbulls\u201d to move the price above the level of $78 was unsuccessful. Now the price is again moving to the support area ($72). Whether to trade from purchases within such a narrow range is a matter of an individual approach to trading and risk sensitivity. It is worth considering that a more global trend has not yet unfolded and is directed rather down than up. For an impulse approach, a signal to start shopping will be a breakdown at the price of a red line.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Go https://developers.chainfront.io now to register, create accounts, and get instructions on how to get an API key. The ChainFront API documentation also includes examples of code and a Getting Started guide.XRP Ledger is at the forefront of blockchain development, with some of the fastest transaction times enabling real applications. We expect XRP Ledger to be one of the first public blockchains to go mainstream. Despite Ethereum\u2019s well known challenges, there is a plethora of top developers and capital working on real applications against that blockchain. ChainFront\u2019s API as a Service can now enable these XRP and Ethereum developers to fast track development while driving usability.Developers can use the ChainFront API as a Service to create accounts, fund those accounts, execute multisig transactions and invoke contracts in Ethereum\u2019s case. Private keys are created inside our secure enclave, and all transactions are signed inside that enclave \u2014 private keys are never transmitted across the internet. Our integration with various multifactor authentication methods means end users still maintain ultimate control and security on transactions. Developers do not need to select or build wallet solutions, nor instruct users on backup procedures nor conduct security audits (think B2B) of their network participants.At ChainFront, we do not believe that end users want to manage their own bank or security \u2014 and the only way that blockchain technologies scale is we remove this hurdle from mainstream adoption. The recent furor over the disappearance of private keys with the demise (or disappearance) of the CEO of Quadrigacx shows the danger of relying on any kind of locally-held, on-device private key storage.With ChainFront, backing up keys and needing to keep track of an on-device wallet is completely removed from the equation and developers can create secure, simple user experiences. Private keys are created within the secure area and never transmitted elsewhere. ChainFront utilizes Vault by HashiCorp as a virtual Hardware Security Module. Vault is a secret key management and data protection tool which offers code-loading support, and powers all of the cryptographic operations in the ChainFront platform. The service is deployed in private subnets of Amazon Web Services (AWS), unreachable via the public internet, using the AWS security model. This security model provides confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability, and authentication. AWS also provides multi-regional backups and redundancy.

Ripple uses the joint network to bundle worldwide payment transactions in one place and to use a common platform. This is important because conventional payment transactions are severely limited in their functionality by a multitude of regulations and incompatibilities.The great advantage of Ripple is its currency independence, as the XRP token used in the network can be exchanged for any currency imaginable. This allows banks to significantly reduce their costs for cross-border transactions.Backgrounds to the RippleNetRippleNet is the name of the network named by the Ripple Community in the Ripple Universe. As with the design of the official logo, the creators behind the payment system have left the naming decision to their own community.This is mainly because the XRP token is an open source project, freely accessible to every developer, and the organization RippleLabs merely advances the basic development of the token. At the same time, RippleLabs organizes and develops its own products, which it sells to banks and financial institutions as a complete solution. These include xCurrent, xRapid and xVia.Ripple has developed its own network for these products, which maps joint payment transactions. The developers can thus concentrate on a generally valid network and bundle their development activities. It is therefore not surprising that RippleNet is already faster than Visa\u2019s competitors.Every bank that uses one of Ripple\u2019s products is automatically a participant in RippleNet. While Ripple\u2019s three major products differ in functionality, they all use the same network. To better understand the background, take a look at Ripple\u2019s solutions.Source: crypto-economy.netThe products in RippleNetRippleLabs currently offers its customers three major software solutions: xCurrent, xRapid and xVia. Each product has a special feature that is designed to solve the existing problems of banks in global payment transactions.xCurrent is used by banks to process global transactions. It is independent of the XRP token and provides a fast interface for payments to other banks and institutions. xCurrent is designed to enable payments over multiple networks and is monitored by a set of rules. This is intended to create a common standard across a large number of networks that do not exist in this form today.With xRapid, Ripple has launched another product on the market that resembles xCurrent in a certain way. It also enables cross-network payments but addresses a known problem. Cross-border payments with a currency exchange incur immense costs for banks.With RippleNet and xRapid, there is now a common standard that is currency-independent and uses the XRP token as the bridge currency. This can save considerable costs and speed up payment transactions.The latest product from RippleLabs is xVia. The system behind xVia is similar to Paypal. It provides an interface through which customers can initiate international transactions. In this case, a bank or other payment service provider serves as an intermediary, who has to support RippleNet accordingly.In addition to fast payment processing, xVia also offers a high degree of anonymity and data protection. Therefore, xVia is another important problem solver for banks, as the urge for secure and anonymous payments is growing.For all three solutions, RippleNet serves as the basis with a decentralized infrastructure. Thanks to intelligent node identification, the network is significantly faster than comparable payment networks. At the same time, charges are calculated immediately and banks can plan their cost management on a long-term basis.Source: ripple.comWhat\u2019s behind xRapid?Ripple\u2019s product is designed to solve a major financial problem. Global transactions cost banks considerable sums in the area of transaction fees. Especially in the case of payments in emerging markets and in countries with strongly fluctuating local currencies, banks are forced to fall back on pre-financed liquidity accounts.These usually cost banks above-average fees and require precise cost analyses before each transaction. Ripple wants to make these problems forgotten and initial tests of payments between American and Mexican banks have shown that xRapid has reduced transaction costs by 40 to 70 percent.Ripple\u2019s XRP token is used as a transaction tool to cover the transaction costs. This means that banks do not have to constantly worry about liquidity in different currencies for global payments, but can access their uniform XRP token pool. In concrete terms, the respective official currency is exchanged for XRP and, after transmission via the fast RippleNet, exchanged for the target currency. The XRP token can be exchanged into almost any currency.At the same time, Ripple guarantees its customers complete security when using its products. As the XRP token is completely independent of the RippleLabs organization, the products will remain in place even after the closure of the organization. Ripple\u2019s products also rely on a high level of data security and privacy. In this context, the organization protects the identity of its users through legitimation checks, so that the customers of the banks are also fully protected.Acceptance of xRapidRipple\u2019s products are becoming increasingly popular in the banking sector. Among the first users of Ripple\u2019s solution were Mercury FX, Cuallix and Catalyst Corporate Federal Credit Union. The first two financial institutions are among the first to participate in the pilot phase and both companies are using the product to process their payments between Europe and Mexico.Catalyst Corporate Federal Credit Union wants to use the XRP-based solution for all payments of the approximately 1400 member cooperatives. The payment service provider MoneyGram also successfully tested xRapid and gave positive feedback. In the future, AMEX and Santander will also use Ripple\u2019s product. With xCurrent, Santander has already successfully deployed another solution from the company.How xVia worksThe xVia solution developed by RippleLabs is based on the fast network RippleNet. It offers a clear platform for worldwide payment transactions while maintaining current security regulations. The great advantage of xVia is the complete traceability of the payment transactions with simultaneous anonymity of the parties involved. Sender and receiver exchange only the most necessary data if required and personal data remains under lock and key. Banks, in particular, can thus protect their customers\u2019 data from misuse.In addition, Ripple\u2019s solution offers the possibility of attaching data and information to the payment. This includes, for example, proofs and invoices. These documents can be attached during the payment process. xVia enables payments via all common payment networks and is independent of currency changes. Thus the system also enables payments of digital and conventional currencies.Source: ripple.comxVia offers opportunities and enables use in ERP systemsRipple\u2019s solution offers new digital trading opportunities to emerging markets plagued by corruption and inflation. Digital solutions can revolutionize electronic commerce and enable secure payments. In Asia in particular, cryptocurrencies are already very popular and offer banks an interesting alternative to their critical counterparts.With its products in this area, Ripple wants to offer a comprehensive solution that brings financial institutions, customers, and companies together in one system.At the same time, Ripple plans to integrate its products into the widely used ERP systems to enable companies to directly access customers and banks around the world. Therefore, Ripple's software is designed to be easily integrated into any system or app. This allows solutions to be created that can be used by both small businesses and large corporations. This creates completely new possibilities and facilitates worldwide payment transactions and prevents high transaction fees.Ripple wants to simplify access to credit and payment networks and offer direct interfaces. By using XRP, a bridge currency will be used that allows switching between any currency. Payments can be tracked and transparently tracked at any time. Thus Ripple and the RippleNet creates a safe platform for enterprises, banks, and customers in the whole world.To get more insights into what Ripple really is, take a look at my posts where I explained the Ripple basics.What is Ripple (XRP)?Explanation & Advantages & Disadvantagesmedium.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Fintech", "Ripple", "Banking", "Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC \u2014 Cryptocurrency Review", "post_link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-analysis-btc-eth-xrp-eos-ltc-cryptocurrency-review-3854dc5b00f5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2019-04-05", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-05", "readtime": "4.29", "claps": 3, "voters": 2, "content": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC \u2014 Cryptocurrency ReviewApril 5, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN MAGAZINEMarko VidrihFollowApr 5 \u00b7 5 min readParticipants in the cryptocurrency market are getting used to new levels, and although volatility is reduced, as long as it still remains at high values. Trading volumes in most cryptocurrencies fell. The market capitalization rate added 2.3% from Wednesday and is now at $175 billion.Now, when interest in cryptocurrency has sharply increased again, when a large number of participants joined the growth, stayed long and waiting for another growth wave, the market needs a pause, to digest what happened. Profitable trades often become profitable, because buying decisions were made long before the revaluation took place, so from the point of view of trading practices, it is not always rational to increase their trading activity in the circumstances that have already happened.BitcoinThe price of BTC at the next update of the maximum did not reach the level of $5300, after which it was corrected. Volumes at the same time significantly decreased. Current movements occur at heightened volatility, which is the natural behavior of most market instruments after rapid changes in price levels. There is no reason to say that the correction is over and soon we will see a new wave of growth.On the contrary, we believe that participants will need more time to get used to new levels, so now we are watching the dynamics from the outside. In the case of the emergence of a new local uptrend, it is possible that points with an acceptable profit/risk ratio will appear on the chart, and then it will be possible to look for a moment to open a new long position.EthereumIn the ETH, the price, after updating the maximum, rolled back down by 12% and is currently making recovery attempts against the background of high volatility. In order to make any predictions, first of all, you need to wait for the volatility to decrease, after which, depending on the patterns, it will be possible to evaluate the technical picture and, possibly, make new rates. In the current situation, we estimate the likelihood of movement both up and down, approximately 50/50, so we stand aside until the moment when the passions in the market finally subside and the emotions of the participants return to a calm state.RippleXRP is in the area of \u200b\u200bhighs, however, looking at the chart, it should be noted that on the background of high volatility, speculators\u2019 emotions are going wild, which makes it impossible to open a new long position with little risk. In the current situation, the decision to stand aside so as not to cut all the profits earned will probably be correct. It is important to take a pause and look at everything that happens with a sober mind. As a rule, the statistics of successful trading indicates that all quality transactions are made until the moment when excessive emotions are present on the market. It is possible that the formation of a new local trend, where there will be points for opening a position with little risk, will give the opportunity for the emergence of new trading ideas.EOSIn EOS, after updating the highs, the price went upwards to about 8% and then corrected. As in the other instruments we are considering, we consider it important, first of all, to wait for the volatility indicators to decline to normal levels before making any trading decisions. In this case, it is difficult to predict the depth and duration of the correction with a high degree of accuracy; moreover, the current formations do not imply a low risk, and therefore, even in the case of long opening, its size will be quite small. In this connection, we are waiting for the formation of a new local trend and reduction of volatility, after which we will look for new entry points.LitecoinLTC is the only coin in which we considered the possibility of re-opening a position by a small volume in the case of updating highs. Expectations were met, and all positions were covered by a sliding foot. Now we consider it important for some time to observe the current dynamics from the outside in order to feel the pulse of the market and, by the nature of the transactions concluded by other participants, to assess the current, and possibly future, moods.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Here are three major cryptocurrencies you should know about.If you\u2019ve been following Inside savedroid, you\u2019re probably already familiar with the original cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which has gained plenty of ground within the domain of online commerce. However, three cryptocurrencies\u2015Ripple, Stellar, and Tether\u2015are pursuing their own set of distinctive goals that set them apart from Bitcoin. These cryptos provide unique opportunities and should not be overlooked. Here\u2019s what you need to know.Ripple (XRP)Ripple is one of the largest cryptocurrencies. Unlike Bitcoin, it is not primarily intended for everyday payments, but instead, is targeted at banks and financial institutions. Ripple\u2019s xRapid platform allows banks to perform fast, inexpensive money transfers and has been adopted by many notable institutions, allowing Ripple to gain significant recognition within mainstream finance.Stellar (XLM)Stellar is also a popular cryptocurrency. It is notable for its role in IBM Worldwire, a new payment system that facilitates international bank transfers. However, Stellar is meant to be more open and inclusive than Ripple, and can easily be used by small banks and other projects. Such minor differences make Stellar an investment that pairs well with Ripple.Tether (USDT)Tether is a stablecoin: unlike Bitcoin, it is always worth $1 USD. Since Tether\u2019s value doesn\u2019t change, you won\u2019t make money by holding it. It isn\u2019t meant to be spent either. Instead, you can quickly sell your Bitcoin for Tether during periods of price volatility, then reinvest when the market settles down. You can sell Bitcoin for regular fiat currency as well, but selling for Tether is generally faster.Ready to Start Saving?Currently, savedroid doesn\u2019t support Ripple, Tether or Stellar.

The market capitalization is $184 billion, which is 5% higher than Friday, but in most cryptocurrency pairs prices are locked inside trading ranges, although they are close to their upper boundaries.When calculating the size of the position being opened, it should be borne in mind that despite the fact that the volatility indicators have fallen, they are still at values \u200b\u200bsignificantly higher than those before growth on April 2, which reflects some uncertainty and nervousness in the actions of traders.BitcoinCharts of BTC for several days at relatively low volumes smoothly approached the level of the previous maximum of April 3, where they stopped. Volatility has decreased and now from a technical point of view, it is important whether the price will be able to consolidate above the resistance level and whether bulls are ready to buy at prices higher than the current ones. We believe that it will be difficult to do it the first time, however, in the case of a breakdown, we see the possibility of forming a new long position with an acceptable profit/risk ratio.EthereumETH was able to break through the highs, but at the breakdown point the charts strongly deviated from the uptrend line, and therefore the opening of the position would be associated with an increased risk. In our opinion, it makes sense to wait for the price to return to the blue line, and local overbought in the instrument will go away, after which, depending on market conditions, a good entry point may appear.RippleXRP has already tried to break through resistance at $0.37 three times in recent days. Now, when volatility has decreased, possible points for opening a new position have become more clearly visible on the chart. This can be done either in case of breakdown of resistance, or when approaching the blue trend line. In both cases, the stop will be short and the risks are low. The emerging triangle increases the chances that after some time we will see another wave of the upward movement.EOSAt EOS, nothing interesting happens so far, the price moves in a wide range and trading from purchases within this range will only be possible if the quotes approach the lower limit. We are watching how the events will develop in the market as a whole, and if there is a confident breakdown of the upper boundary, we will also consider this coin for inclusion in the speculative portfolio.LitecoinLTC looks more technical. A local trend has formed and the probability of a breakdown of the upper boundary of the triangle increases. Now charts are in the area of \u200b\u200bthe trend line, and we are making a small test purchase. The stop is short, below the green line, and if the quotes are fixed above the resistance, a window will appear to increase the proportion of the coin in the portfolio with the transfer of the protective order.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

It has taken a beating this year and is down 43.1 percent year to date.However, funds that are market makers and who trade in arbitrage strategies are having a field day, as some have gained 30 percent in the first quarter.This shows that whatever the market condition, the traders can always develop a strategy to profit from it.The miners are not that lucky. According to Morgan Stanley, the miners of Bitcoin will remain unprofitable if prices remain below $8,600.The big problem is that no one knows how to evaluate the leading cryptocurrency. The targets range from $100 to $100,000 and higher, but when prices don\u2019t fall even during bad news, it is usually a sign that the bottom is around the corner. We believe that most digital currencies have bottomed out, at least in the short-term.BTC/USDBitcoin has finally broken out of the 50-day SMA after remaining range-bound for seven days. Though this is a bullish sign, we still don\u2019t see a strong buying conviction, as the up move is lacking momentum. This shows that the market participants are cautious of this rally.The next target on the upside is $9,400, where we suggest booking partial profits. Once this level is crossed, a move to $10,000 is possible.If prices fail to hold above the 50-day SMA, it will be a bearish sign and prices can fall back to the first support level of $7,900. Therefore, we suggest the traders should keep the stops on the BTC/USD pair at breakeven.ETH/USDEthereum convincingly broke out of the 50-day SMA on April 19, which is a bullish sign. It has become positive and should continue to rally towards $730 levels.Though the 50-day SMA is still falling, the 20-day EMA has turned up. A bullish crossover will provide further strength to the ETH/USD pair.Though we are bullish, we have not suggested any trade on Ethereum. We will wait for a dip or a consolidation to enter fresh long positions.BCH/USDIn our previous analysis, we had noticed that Bitcoin Cash doesn\u2019t face resistance at the 50-day SMA and that is what happened. The price zoomed past the moving average on April 19 and touched our first target objective of $1,114.Traders can book partial profits at the current levels and keep a trailing stop on the remaining position. If the bullish sentiment continues, the BCH/USD pair can rally to $1,300 and then to $1,600.However, we need to caution the traders that the cryptocurrency has a history of vertical falls, so it\u2019s better to protect the paper profits with a close stop loss.We should never allow a profitable position to turn into a loss.XRP/USDWe had recommended long positions in Ripple in our previous analysis. The digital currency easily crossed above our first target objective of $0.83 where we had proposed to book partial profits.There is a minor resistance at $0.9, above which, the XRP/USD pair can rally to $1.08 levels. We like the way it has rallied over the past three days, which shows that the buyers are back. The moving averages are also close to a bullish crossover, which is another positive.Traders can hold the remaining positions with a close stop loss.XLM/USDStellar has broken out of our first target objective of $0.36, where we had proposed traders to book partial profits.The break out can carry the XLM/USD pair towards its next target objective of $0.47. That\u2019s why we had recommended trailing the stops higher on the remaining position.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, which is a bullish sign but it is unlikely to be a one-way move to the highs. Hence, the stops should always be trailed higher.As prices near $0.47, please keep tighter stops.LTC/USDAfter remaining range bound for a few days, Litecoin has found buying support. It is currently attempting to break out of the critical overhead resistance from the downtrend line and the 50-day SMA.If successful, the LTC/USD pair will become positive and rally to $178 levels.The logical stop loss for the trade is at $127, which doesn\u2019t offer us a good risk to reward ratio. Thus, we shall wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending any trade on it.If prices turn down from the resistance, it should find support at $141.ADA/BTCCardano is again moving closer to our target objective of 0.000035. If this level is crossed, then the digital currency will pick up momentum and rally to 0.000045 levels.We suggest trailing stops higher on their remaining position, instead of booking profits at 0.000035.The ADA/BTC pair has started a new uptrend, after being in a downtrend for months. During the start of a new uptrend, the RSI can remain in the overbought territory for some time. Hence, traders should not get perturbed with the overbought levels on the RSI. Keep trailing the stops higher to lock in the paper profits. As prices move up, please tighten the stops further.NEO/USDNEO has finally broken out of the 50-day SMA, but it will face stiff resistance at the $80 mark, from the downtrend line of the descending triangle and the horizontal line.We suggest booking partial profits at this level and raising the stops on the rest to breakeven.If the NEO/USD pair breaks out of $80, it will become very bullish because the failure of a bearish pattern is a positive sign. After breaking out of the downtrend line, there is minor resistance at $92-$94. If this level is crossed, the digital currency should pick up momentum and aim to hit $140.Hence, we are proposing to keep a part of the position open to benefit from the probable rise.EOS/USDEOS has broken out of the ascending channel and the horizontal resistance at $10.0650, which shows bullishness.We had anticipated resistance in the $9.5 to $10 zone, hence had recommended traders to book partial profits around the $9.5 mark.We had initially purchased with a target objective of $11, but looking at the bullishness, we believe that the EOS/USD pair can now rally to $12, which will also coincide with the resistance line of the ascending channel 2.The remaining positions can be held with a trailing stop loss, which can be kept just below the support line of the ascending channel 2.The digital currency will lose momentum if prices again fall into ascending channel 1.Source", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "W12", "ICO", "Daico", "Analysis"]}, {"title": "Ripple Pushes Towards Utility by Giving Away XRP", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@w12.io/ripple-pushes-towards-utility-by-giving-away-xrp-57595e1e1f4?source=search_post", "author_name": "W12", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@w12.io", "publish_date": "2018-07-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-03", "readtime": "1.97", "claps": 19, "voters": 1, "content": "Ripple Pushes Towards Utility by Giving Away XRPW12FollowJul 3, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readSan Francisco based Ripple has become one of the most successful startups in the last decade, which has been full of overnight success stories in the fintech space. Since it launched its XRP token in 2013 it has made its way into the top five cryptocurrencies along with Bitcoin and Ethereum. The 2017 crypto market run-up left the company flush with cash. The only problem they seem to be having is no one is using XRP for the right reasons.Ripple Giving Away XRPXRP was created to bridge the gap between banking and decentralized technology, that is as a way to move money faster and cheaper. The problem is very few people are using it this way according to an article in the New York Times. As utility becomes the watchword for cryptocurrencies success in the future, Ripple has been putting quite a lot of XRP into the world for free.When late night talk show host Stephen Colbert generously announced a donation of $29 million worth of XRP to American teachers it wasn\u2019t coming from his personal account. Nor, when Ashton Kushner presented the equivalent of $4 million of the digital coins to The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund did that come from his pocket. Ripple put up all that XRP as an initiative to get more of their cryptocurrency out into the working world.The company can be so easy with its XRP coins because, unlike Bitcoin which limits the number of its coins entering the world with a transactional formula (more transactions = more mining = more bitcoins), all of the XRP that will ever be was created in 2013.Priming the Pump to Increase UtilityRipple created 100 billion XRP, setting aside 55 billion in escrow which has led to allegations that the company can and has manipulated the price of the token.

GateHub found an increased number of API calls (with valid access tokens) coming from a small number of IP addresses. In this way, the perpetrators could potentially gain access to encrypted secret keys.However, this does not explain how the perpetrator could obtain other information needed to decrypt the secret keys. The suspicious API calls were stopped on June 1 when all access tokens were disabled.Thomas Silkj\u00e6r, a community member who warned GateHub about the injury, revealed the following in a report:Overview of the \u201cGatehub hack\u201dOn June 1 we were made aware of a theft of 201,000 XRP (transaction\u2026medium.com\u201cOn June 1, we were alerted to the theft of 201,000 XRP \u2026 and immediately began the investigation.

For this reason, Ripple is often referred to as a \u201cblockchain for banks\u201d. The organization behind Ripple, Ripple Labs, offers products adapted to business needs. One of these solutions is xCurrent, which is a special software solution aimed directly at banks.Source: ripple.comWhy xCurrent should revolutionize the banking systemWith xCurrent, Ripple Labs offers banks a system to clarify and confirm transactions and transaction details in real time. Successful transactions are processed immediately and the process is recorded in a rule book. This rulebook was developed in collaboration with the RippleNet Advisory Board and maps the operational consistency of each individual transaction. xCurrent is designed to solve existing delays and allocation problems while providing guaranteed data security.In particular, the cross-border transaction and data exchange is to be considerably simplified by the solution from Ripple. xCurrent is based on the fast Ripple network and enables worldwide transactions in a matter of seconds. The customers of the banks no longer have to deal with the liquidity abroad for cross-border transfers and reduce their economic risk to a large extent. At the same time, Ripple's software is very flexible and scalable. It can be used as a basis in payment systems of apps, but can also map entire transaction networks with millions of transactions.Technical view of xCurrentEvery single transaction in the Ripple Network has a unique ID. This enables transparent insight into the status and status of a transaction at any time. Ripple enterprise solution consists of four key components:Messenger: The messenger in the protocol provides a common communication basis between two or more banks or their customers. Direct communication prevents manipulation and creates complete transparency regarding the status and fees of a transaction.Validator: The validators in the network determine the positive and negative outcome of a transaction. They confirm the receipt and status of payment by means of a cryptographic message and at the same time preserve the identity of the respective bank customer.ILP: The Inter Ledger Protocol (ILP) provides basic technology and functionality. It enables the processing of a money transfer and monitors each transaction.FX Ticker: The FX Ticker allows transactions to be booked taking into account current exchange rates. This enables uncomplicated transactions across different currencies and borders.xCurrent meets with great interestAlready at an early stage of the software, some leading banks worldwide are using xCurrent in their networks. These include American Express, MoneyGram, Euro Exim Bank, and Western Union. Ripple\u2019s technology is particularly interesting for the banking industry because of its unlimited scalability. Experts suspect that financial institutions will not rely on traditional distributed ledger technology because it does not provide the necessary flexibility and data protection for sensitive customer data.Ripple\u2019s solutions rely on the ultra-fast Inter Ledger protocol, which is also very reliable. Some banks, including the UK division of Santander Bank, use the protocol in both their internal and customer-oriented applications. Santander has developed the OnePay FX app, a cross-border payment method based on the fast Ripple network.To get more insights into what Ripple really is, take a look at my posts where I explained the Ripple basics.What is Ripple (XRP)?Explanation & Advantages & Disadvantagesmedium.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ripple", "Cryptocurrency", "Banking", "Investing"]}, {"title": "What\u2019s the Ripple Guy doing for the Construction Industry?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@rippleon/whats-the-ripple-guy-doing-for-the-construction-industry-84e17cd55a0f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Steve Harper", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@rippleon", "publish_date": "2018-06-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-13", "readtime": "2.27", "claps": 23, "voters": 2, "content": "What\u2019s the Ripple Guy doing for the Construction Industry?Steve HarperFollowJun 12, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readSome people that know me are confused. They know me as \u201cThe Ripple Guy\u201d. They know me as a published author, speaker and trainer on topics of leadership, customer service, business development and of course, building better relationships.They seemed shocked to hear I also own a software company focused on the construction industry. In fact I own two companies, but I\u2019ll save the other for another time.I am the proud owner and CEO of Owner Insite (OI), a web-based project management software for the construction industry. Our focus is to help the \u201cowner\u201d of a construction project insure they have a formal process and straight-forward approach to insuring the entire team (we call them stakeholders) on their project properly document, track and manage all elements of the project. OI brings a very unique level of transparency and accountability to projects of all sizes.Our company serves a wide variety of owners including real estate developers, health care providers, municipalities and of course education. Our favorite market is the K-12 and higher education space but keep that between us will ya?When people ask what attracted me to this space, it\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s a distinctly different entrepreneurial focus and something that seems far removed from the work I do with The Ripple. Unless you look a bit deeper.Most of my work around the Ripple involves helping people and companies understand the importance of connection; making sure all the kids play nice in the sandbox. A lot of the time I am helping people understand how their communication style and approach to interacting with others is worth exploring. Much of one\u2019s success, including a company\u2019s, is wrapped up in how people interact and communicate with one another.Or another way to put it: No connection. No loyalty. No future.So when I was first approached to become involved in Owner Insite, I immediately saw a problem that permeates many project teams. Egos and poor communication often leads to misunderstanding, missed deadlines, and mistakes. Information silos are prevalent in the construction industry and therefore a unifying platform like what we\u2019ve built helps eliminate many of the barriers project teams face.I\u2019ve seen firsthand how important the Ripple approach can be in getting teams on the same page and focused on the same results. Without a streamlined process and an organized way of communicating, it\u2019s no wonder so many projects run over schedule and over budget.I knew right away that my work through The Ripple could bring a unique perspective to helping construction teams work smarter, communicate better and deliver better results for the owner\u2019s they ultimately serve.By streamlining the process and making it easier for everyone to communicate through our unifying software, we\u2019re proud at OI to have affected the construction industry for the better and have incredible clients who are some of our biggest believers (if you\u2019d like to read some client testimonials, please visit here).So my full title is Steve, The Ripple Guy, also known as Owner Insite Guy.

But sometimes you have to try.Just as Taproot was getting started, one of our members posed such a question: \u201cHow can we (i.e. non-Indigenous Edmontonians) better connect with our aboriginal neighbours to learn more about their local stories?\u201dThis seemed like a difficult question. But when we put it to the members in the summer, many were curious, too. Anna Holtby was interested in pursuing an answer. So off she went. Here\u2019s what she brought back:And here\u2019s the story behind that answer, along with some suggestions for how you can make your ripple.Search engine open, my blinking cursor dared me to start on this big question. Thankfully, my typing fingers quickly took over, and almost instinctively tapped out two very familiar words: truth and reconciliation. I figured they had to fit into this conversation somehow.I soon realized that \u201clearning local Indigenous stories\u201d is inseparable from, and in fact almost synonymous with, the process of truth and reconciliation. How do we hear local stories if we don\u2019t first face the truth of history and Canada\u2019s treatment of Indigenous peoples? How do we build genuine connection without reconciliation?The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established by the federal government in 2008, with a mandate to research and gather testimonies on Indian Residential Schools. From the 1870s through to the 1990s, over 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their parents and communities and placed in these government-funded, church-run schools, where speaking their languages and practicing their cultures were often forbidden. The final report of the TRC, released in 2015, documented both the history and ongoing impact of these experiences for both survivors and following generations.Miranda Jimmy, a Cree Edmontonian, is an intergenerational survivor of residential schools. She shared her story publicly for the first time in March of 2014, when the TRC held its final national event here in Edmonton, where we live on Treaty 6 territory.A year later, Jimmy, who is now running for city council, founded Reconciliation in Solidarity Edmonton, or RISE, to continue the conversations started at the TRC event.When I went to Jimmy, curiosity and questions in hand, the words truth and reconciliation still sounded comforting to me \u2014 like we were finally doing something to seek peace for the past and present, armed with honesty and best intentions. But as we spoke, words like discomfort, awkwardness, and guilt kept coming up. These words rolled into conversations about colonialism and assimilation.It began to click. There is not a lack of accessibility to Indigenous stories, but rather, non-Indigenous people are often missing the necessary attitudes to pursue and invest in truth and reconciliation.This journey is not about going through the motions or attending the right events. Truth and reconciliation requires internal questioning of our own identity, stereotypes, and histories, and developing the right attitudes to process those. Many lack the perseverance to blunder through the discomfort of this self-reflective process. In Jimmy\u2019s words, \u201creconciliation is not about doing something. It\u2019s about doing something differently.\u201dListen again to Jimmy\u2019s words. She does not speak for all Indigenous Edmontonians, and would never claim to. But it felt like her eloquent, honest words made a good frame for the challenge.Here are some practical ways to take that opportunity to make a ripple towards real truth and reconciliation, or at least equip yourself to make a ripple. This list is not exhaustive, and these are not boxes to check. But it is a place to start searching, asking questions, listening, and thinking. As Jimmy said, \u201cthe real work of reconciliation is internal, it\u2019s not external.\u201dMiranda JimmyEventsOct. 14, 2016 \u2014 Conversation@Noon: After the TRC: Writers from the University of Alberta\u2019s Glass Buffalo Magazine share thoughts at this LitFest session on their experiences following the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Report.Oct. 14, 2016 \u2014 Keep Talking: Stories Beyond the TRC: This LitFest event hosts both Indigenous and non-Indigenous writers as they share experiences following the publication of the full Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the 94 Calls to Action.Nov. 17, 2016 \u2014 Understanding Reconciliation: Indigenous 101: A RISE workshop on the terminology related to Indigenous Peoples in Canada and the historical trauma that has led to some of the present-day challenges.You can find more local events related to Truth and Reconciliation on the RISE Events page, and more local Indigenous stories at the monthly Amiskwaciy History Series.Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the RISE newsletter, and following RISE on Facebook or Twitter.Experiences*Canadian Native Friendship Centre: Provides cultural, recreational and social programming, including classes focused on traditional arts, conversational Cree and powwow drum and dance classes.Nehiyaw (Cree) Language Classes: A holistic approach to the language, using a star chart methodology that includes cultural and philosophical teaching in the language lessons.Make sure you ask permission to attend first.ReadingIn This Together: Fifteen Stories of Truth and Reconciliation: A collection of essays edited by Danielle Metcalfe-Chenail on healing and reconciliation, from Canadian Indigenous and non-Indigenous writers.Exploring Reconciliation: Metcalfe-Chenail\u2019s \u201cGreat Stuff\u201d list of books, DVDs, CDs and other media items available from Edmonton Public Library.#IndigenousReads: Your picks for the best Indigenous books: A list of recommended books by Indigenous authors from the listeners of CBC\u2019s Unreserved.Listening & WatchingRead the TRC Report: A series of videos of volunteers reading the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.New Fire: A CBC podcast focusing on conversations important to Aboriginal youth.Stories from the Land: Using an audio documentary style and recorded live storytelling to share Indigenous histories, worldview, philosophy and culture from across Canada.Media Indigena: An interactive, multimedia magazine dedicated to Indigenous news, views and creative expression.Camsell: A short documentary about the Charles Camsell Hospital, where many Indigenous people were sent to be treated for tuberculosis in the mid-20th century.8th Fire: A CBC documentary series focused on the journey to justice and harmony between Indigenous peoples and the settler community.The Pass System: A collection of stories and first-hand experiences of the Pass System, a Canadian segregation law that only allowed an \u201cIndian Agent\u201d to give out passes to allow Indigenous people to leave reserves.REDx Talks: A speaker series featuring elders, artists and activists discussing Indigenous issues from a perspective of resilience and empowerment.This story was inspired by a question by Taproot Edmonton member Valerie Lugonja.

Not a political figure in South Africa, but a US Senator. He was also a rich, famous, successful, white man.He had no business being in South Africa, except that he cared. He cared about ushering forth the end of apartheid. He cared because he knew people were being treated unjustly and brutalized simply because of the color of their skin.He had every reason to not get involved, to sit back and enjoy his own privileged part in society.But he believed in finding ways to create ripples of hope. And he believed that not getting involved is akin to support. And he believed his privilege gave him a responsibility to act for those without.Fast forward to today.

What I am referring to here is how quickly, who we align ourselves with, what we do, how we think, can effect the group mentality, and this can produce effects that are often devastating.This is why we need to take responsibility for our actions.Recently, I have been hearing people say that they haven\u2019t been given enough information with regards the Referendum remain or leave situation. This has dropped my jaw somewhat.Why do people wait to be spoon fed?Google the information. You can download information about the EU, and so on.But people are lazy.Googling stuff requires reading \u2014 and a lot of it too. Most people can\u2019t be bothered. They prefer to just moan or accuse people of waffling when the issues suddenly become a bit more complex.I am seeing a kind of apathy towards learning and knowledge. It\u2019s like people are trying to by-pass the lessons \u2014 not realising that this could lead to an intellectual stagnation and indeed a backward development within society.But most importantly, how many times have you heard the term, \u201cLest we forget\u201d? And yet we are unable to apply the full meaning of this term, to the present.I refer to the brewing hatred toward people that are different, the emerging racism as well as the fear and worry about immigration \u2014 which is beginning to lead us down a path that is not too different than before WW2.You see \u2014 we are forgetting. We are forgetting that human beings are capable of the most horrific deeds.We are forgetting that our personal decisions can be part of a collective and that that same collective may be leading us down a very dangerous path.I know that it\u2019s easier to look the other way, but if we do \u2014 we may just land ourselves in some serious hot soup.Actions have ripple effects, ripple effects that often bite you on the bottom just when you\u2019re not looking.And yesterday\u2019s event was a reminder of this.I urge you therefore, to remember that your actions can add to society\u2019s destructive or negative ideologies because what you sow you will reap and what you give you will receive.Instead \u2014 let\u2019s all make sure that we are not in any way, adding to create a society that is closed and destructive.\u00a9 2016 Deidr\u00e9 Wallace All rights reserved.You can learn more about yourself and relationships at: http://relationshipknowledge.com/About The AuthorI am a fully UK qualified Psychodynamic Relationship Therapist, Life Coach and Teacher.I am not offering relationship advice, I am offering relationship knowledge.I encourage people to think differently and I help people understand how and why we choose our personal and business relationships.Want to find out more?

Is this a gamechanger?Kifaru MweusiFollowOct 9, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readHey there, how\u2019s everybody doing \u2014 before i start i just need to mention that this post isn\u2019t sponsored by BitMax or any other affiliated company, it\u2019s all based off personal opinion and thus should not be considered as investment advice.  (Read disclaimer below)Okay BitMax has made a lot of moves lately, let me put you on to some of them.Trade fee reduction.From 10th October 2018, they will be changing their trading fees from 0.1 to 0.04% for all the following pairs; BCH/BTC, BCH/BTC, ELF/BTC, ETC/BTC, ETH/BTC, IOST/BTC, LBA/BTC, LTC/BTC, OLT/BTC, XRP/BTC, ZIL/BTC. The same will apply to all Ethereum focused pairs.You will notice that this is considerably cheaper as compared to what other exchanges are currently offering. Which is a win. For reference purposes, Bitfinex has fees as high as 0.2% \u2014 which doesn\u2019t sound as much until you realize you\u2019d have to pay as much as $10,000 USD in trading fees if your monthly trade volume is $5 million or more.Sweepstake program.BitMax also made public their sweepstake program, which is purposed to allow the platform\u2019s users to earn points by conducting different activities on the platform, activities such as registering, logging in, depositing at least 0.5ETH, maintaining a minimum account balance, transacting and referring a friend. Points earned will vary based on activities with transaction and referral activities earning the most points. The highest-ranking user currently has over 500,000 points.I\u2019m the biggest fun of competition, which explains my #fortnite addiction, so i can tell you this, this sweepstake program is the best thing you could join today. The grand prize of 10 Bitcoins is still up for the taking, who knows they could be yours. Here\u2019s a link if you\u2019re interested in checking that out \u2014 Sweepstake ProgramIntroduction of XRP.But my favorite announcement of late has been the introduction of #Ripple XRP as a new \u2018tradeable\u2019 currency.Currently at position 3 as the most popular cryptocurrency according to market cap, integrating this awesome coin into the fold could be what converts many users into cryptocurrency trading and give the decentralized economy the boost it so rightly deserves.We\u2019ve seen in recent stories how banks are now turning to #XRP as a faster, more costly way to transfer money and with the introduction of xRapid a product that allows for international transactions within minutes. Therefore, giving users the option to trade in this token could have all the right outcomes both for BitMax and all the potential traders living inside the platform.When South Korean based exchange platform bitthumb was hacked in this year and over $30 million dollars\u2019 worth of cryptocurrency including XRP stolen. The platform decided to disable all deposits on the platform and transfer all the coins to offline wallets to fix the vulnerabilities their security protocols had.BitMax is doing its best to prevent such an occurrence from ever happening to its customers, it has done this by setting up multi-level firewalls to examine the system and control the traffic that\u2019s coming into the network\u2019s devices with the aim of blocking any suspicious activity and unauthorised access.BitMax has also implemented multi-signature requirements to help bolster the platform\u2019s security, this technology will require that users sign off on a transaction before it can be pushed on the blockchain. BitMax also understands that in order to build a secure platform, it can\u2019t just depend on its own in-house security team this is why it has partnered with an experienced security firm who will monitor and perform important checks all with the goal of safeguarding the customer\u2019s financial and personal information from hackers and considering people are using mobile more and more, which tend to be much riskier because of their newness and potential for attracting malware, this security firm will protect BitMax\u2019s users from breaches of privacy and financial losses.So, with great security in place, all the groundwork is already laid out for brilliant trading. Here\u2019s the thing though, decentralized exchanges like BitMax have long been associated with being difficult, difficult to trade with and basically difficult to understand, but BitMax is the exception, with BitMax you can start trading in less than three steps and with their real-time settlements functionalities. Users have no reason not to trade.BitMax will be initiating a margin trading feature by the end of 2018, this feature is important because it allows any trader to borrow money against any funds they must trade in cryptocurrency. This is great for boosting buying power.Conclusion.XRP will feel right at home at BitMax and considering all the partners, BitMax has willing to participate in the platform to enhance liquidity, not investing your crypto in BitMax is not wise.Try this links for information about BitMax and BTMX, the company\u2019s main token.Bitmax Website Bitmax Whitepaper Bitmax on Twitter Bitmax Official TelegramThis Blog by:Rhinoboy11 Steemit Medium Facebook BitcoinTalk Bitcoin Username: @SammygyeIf you like my blogs and would like to see others like this one.

Do you keep telling them over and over and hope they will eventually believe it?Do you? Do you believe that you are enough? That nothing you do to the outside could begin to compare to who you are?

I remember one simple thing from that article and it is that we need to compliment them and show interest in them for things other than the clothes they wear or their looks. We need to skip over saying \u201cYou are pretty\u201d or \u201cThat dress is so pretty on you\u201d and instead seek to say things like \u201cYou are so kind\u201d or \u201cYou are so clever and smart in being patient and figuring that out\u201d and other things that build self-confidence that sticks.I forget that sometimes even when talking with friends or family, which should make it easier to dig deep into saying what should be said. I\u2019ll compliment someone and say \u201cWow, you look so pretty today\u201d when what I really meant was \u201cYou are glowing and your smile always lights up a room and makes me feel good to be around you.\u201dMaybe the reason people are so insecure is that no one is taking the time to really say what needs to be said. Maybe the self-worth and self-comparison lifestyle present in the world has come about not because we are trying to cover up what we really believe, but we haven\u2019t taken the time to discover who we are and to appreciate others in our lives.I do know this to be true, self-confidence is the best accessory if it is real. It can make a woman or man the most attractive, dynamic, and interesting person in the room. Not arrogance, but true self-confidence. They are the kind of person that doesn\u2019t need to draw attention to themselves because they know who they are and they don\u2019t need to get the world to validate them for they know their self-worth. Instead, they make people around them feel important and special. Those types of people start a ripple that can carry on from person to person.Tomorrow compliment someone on who they are and not just on how they appear and start a ripple. Dig deep and take the time to say what needs to be said to let that person know that you really see them. Tomorrow know and wear your self-worth of being irreplaceable, unique, and beautiful within every cell in your body and start a ripple for someone else. Seek to start a ripple and keep other ripples going on and on. Let\u2019s take the time to tell people that they are important. Celebrate them.

From our staff\u2019s current role in co-chairing the Everglades Coalition, a organization of more than 60 coalitions speaking on Everglades issues with a single voice, to water monitoring, to advocacy efforts at the local, state and national levels, the Conservancy is grateful for your continued support in making this work possible.The outbreaks that are occurring right now are part of an ongoing issue that needs a comprehensive approach starting today.In January 2016, Florida experienced another round of devastating toxic algae discharges from Lake Okeechobee. I stress another because 2016 was only the latest round of ongoing water quality issues facing the region and state.As I write this, more than 80 percent of the Caloosahatchee River is experiencing the presence of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), which have tested positive for microcystin toxins \u2014 toxins with serious human and wildlife health impacts. At the same time, satellite imagery of Lake Okeechobee highlights that more than 90 percent of the entire lake is impacted by the same algae.Rob MoherRecent action by Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s administration, advocated by the Conservancy of Southwest Florida, local governments and environmental partners to bolster monitoring of the Caloosahatchee basin, is a much-needed positive development. Without timely and comprehensive data on pollution and water flow, there is little chance of making good decisions for our water quality.I wrote back in 2016 that we needed a three-pronged approach to address the quality, quantity and distribution of water if we hoped to truly solve our water quality crisis. These approaches are still necessary today.My 2016 Blog on Water Quality:Florida\u2019s Water Issues: Time for Talk is OverBy Rob Moher | Conservancy of Southwest Florida President & CEOmedium.comThe first prong is to increase dynamic water storage west, east, north and south of Lake Okeechobee. The good news for our interests in Southwest Florida is that the C-43 reservoir is under construction and will add 170,000 acre-feet of storage on this coast by 2022. In addition, last year the Florida Legislature agreed to expedite the construction of a long-anticipated southern reservoir to reduce the damaging high-volume discharges to the east and west, and instead move water south to feed the Everglades ecosystem and to flow under the now partially elevated U.S. 51 (Tamiami Trail). Pending federal authorization and the federal half of the funding through appropriations, the new reservoir should be up and operating in eight to 10 years.The second prong, however, is noticeably missing \u2014 improved pollution control before the water reaches Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River and our own local watersheds. On this front, we have made little progress while Florida has continued to grow in population. The Legislature should work to update the Statewide Stormwater Standards. If we do not, then new development being planned will continue to add to downstream pollution. In addition, local communities should be encouraged and supported in maintaining and passing stringent fertilizer ordinances to help reduce local sources of pollution, and not have these challenged by our own Legislature.The third prong to help address the cause of our water quality issues is to protect our remaining natural wetlands and flowways. Every acre of wetland loss represents the loss of up to 1.5 million gallons of water storage and purification capacity. Current efforts by the Scott administration to transfer federal oversight for Section 404 wetlands permitting to the state should be halted immediately. Southwest Florida has seen the permitted loss of thousands of acres of wetlands, and though federal oversight is still weak, it has been more stringent in reviewing applications than state agencies.As Collier and Lee counties consider newly proposed development and mines, local residents and interested organizations should seek to preserve these critical wetlands and flowways, and press for tougher state standards associated with treating pollution on-site for these developments.Water pollution has a ripple effect on human health, our economy and our quality of life. We need to press forward on all three fronts if we hope to see meaningful improvements to our waterways.We appreciate your support on this critical issue. We are able to continue to fight this fight because of you, our members, supporters and community.To learn more about this issue and how individuals can help, visit www.conservancy.org/ripple-effect.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Environment", "Water", "Policy", "Politics", "Florida"]}, {"title": "Altcoin News: Ripple Announces Record Inflow of Clients Amid Cryptocurrency Facebook Announcement", "post_link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-news-ripple-announces-record-inflow-of-clients-amid-cryptocurrency-facebook-announcement-c8e26aef90f0?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2019-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-21", "readtime": "1.51", "claps": 3, "voters": 1, "content": "Altcoin News: Ripple Announces Record Inflow of Clients Amid Cryptocurrency Facebook AnnouncementJune 21, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN MAGAZINEMarko VidrihFollowJun 21 \u00b7 2 min readFintech CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, expressed his gratitude to the head of the cryptocurrency project of the social network Facebook announced this week.\u201cI will send a box of champagne to David Marcus \u2014 the guy who runs the Libra.

Thus, the alternative to banks in the crypto sector is broadening. Just a while ago, the start-up had ended a Series C round of investing that was pouring $ 250 million into the coffers.The fintech start-up based in London has been offering various payment services for some time. These include a prepaid debit card, exchange of Fiat currency with each other, exchange of Fiat in crypto and peer-to-peer transactions. In addition, Revolut does not charge for transactions or exchange rates. This has allowed the financial services provider to become an alternative to banks that also offer such services.So far, users have been able to access 26 national currencies and three cryptocurrencies via the Revolut app and transactional transactions. Now the crypto assortment of Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin has been extended by the crypto currencies Ripple and Bitcoin Cash.Demand for cryptocurrencies is growingRevolut CTO Vlad Yatsenko said the demand for both cryptocurrencies was \u201coverwhelming\u201d. Revolut allows people to invest in cryptocurrencies with little or no know-how, as the app buys and holds the coins on their behalf. This provides an easy way for consumers to earn profits without actively trading themselves.The company, originally known as an app-based, toll-free Fiat currency exchange provider, is increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies. Only in December of last year, the use of Bitcoin was added to the app. The success was so overwhelming that it was decided to continue on this path.Financial resources of 250 additional millionsIn addition, Revolut announced a total of $ 250 million in a Series C round. The cash injection gives the company completely new opportunities to expand even wider. In addition to pushing the crypto offering, Revolut plans to move to the US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand this year. For this purpose, the workforce in the areas of technology and design will be expanded.Marko Vidrih@cryptomarksImage via shutterstocksource", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "News", "Cryptocurrency", "Crypto", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash \u2014 Weekly Technical Price Analysis, April Week 4", "post_link": "https://blog.zebpay.com/bitcoin-ethereum-litecoin-ripple-and-bitcoin-cash-weekly-technical-price-analysis-april-week-318671c94b3c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Zebpay", "author_link": "https://blog.zebpay.com/@zebpay", "publish_date": "2018-04-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-26", "readtime": "1.47", "claps": 50, "voters": 1, "content": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash \u2014 Weekly Technical Price Analysis, April Week 4By \u2014 Nirmal RangaZebpayFollowApr 26, 2018 \u00b7 2 min read\u201cThe core problem, however, is the need to fit markets into a style of trading rather than finding ways to trade that fit with market behavior.\u201d  \u2014 Brett SteenbargerCryptocurrency markets have taken a sigh of relief as some major fundamental factors favoring the respective markets flooded in past week.

The respective consolidation is a good signal for cryptocurrency enthusiasts as market is maturing by being responsive and not reactive to situations.Over this current week of stability, we saw Bitcoin Hashrate continuing to climb up despite the inability to cross the price of $10,000, thus, indicating high levels of interest among miners. Meanwhile, Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, said that he predicts the price of Ethereum (ETH) will reach $15,000 in 2018.CBOE saw highest Highest-Ever Bitcoin Futures Volumes in last week and CME too saw a major surge with their volumes almost doubled over their average volumes.

Thus, the capitalization indicator is in the same place \u2014 at a value of $180 billion. The attempt to exit from consolidation once again failed.BitcoinOn BTC chart, the bulls increased activity, and on increased volumes, on Friday the pair, BTC/USD was able to break through the level of $5,600. This opened up the possibility for new purchases with an acceptable profit/risk ratio. However, above the price of $5800, purchases ceased, volumes fell and the price, after the third attempt to move above $5850, swept below the trend line, which was a signal to liquidate a long position. Such dynamics of the chart indicates the uncertainty of the participants regarding the further development of events. The market consensus at this point is more for consolidation than for continued growth. We will closely monitor the parameters of trading and only when the price comes up again \u2014 close to support at $5,600 or breaks through to $5,900 to form a new trading idea.EthereumThe movement in the ETH above the red line, as we expected, caused a continuation of the impulse. Chart moved after BTC, but the bulls didn\u2019t have enough energy to move the price above $170. Now the position is covered, the price has returned to the area of \u200b\u200bthe red line, and so far, despite the entry point that is attractive from the point of view of technical analysis, we consider it important to take a pause and watch for some time the dynamics from the outside. Some weakness is noticeable in the coin, so, for now, we consider it right to refrain from being active in it.RippleXRP chart also tried to catch up with the leader and at the moment punched an important level of $0.31, creating the illusion of the beginning of a powerful movement. However, returning back was as fast as the impulse itself, and the long position that began to form was eliminated at the moment the protective order triggered. The dynamics of XRP chart confirms everything we have said regarding the mood of participants in BTC and ETH, with the only exception that the situation is even more unfavorable for investors \u2014XRP shows a lagging behind for a long time and clearly looks weaker than most other TOP-10 coins. We remain out of position in this coin and follow the further development of the situation.EOSEOS broke through $4.85 and reached $5.18 at the momentum, where, like in the case with other cryptocurrencies we are considering, there was a reversal that quickly returned the price below the red line. As we noted earlier, no individuality in the instrument has been noticed at this stage. The movements completely repeat the general market trends, and therefore the choice of this instrument for trading is a matter of personal preference.LitecoinAt LTC, everything happened in accordance with the trading plan \u2014 the breakdown of the green line was included in the portfolio, and the position was closed on the reverse market movement. It all happened so quickly that the market participants seemed to be surprised at themselves and hurried to return the price back below $75 per LTC. There is some oversold at the moment, so we are not waiting for the acceleration of decline in the coming hours, but the technical picture today is different than it was on Friday. Therefore, we will observe the coin and wait for the formation of new entry key points.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

The market capitalization rate grew by almost 11% to $212 billion.BTC is still the leader of the movement, the rest of the coins are more likely pulled up by inertia, however, in a number of coins, the volumes have noticeably increased, which may indicate that the accumulated deferred demand, under favorable circumstances, can move the charts even higher after correction.BitcoinThe uptrend continues and over the weekend, the BTC/USD tested the $7,500 mark. After almost a month of sawing movement, the most patient and consistent traders get a well-deserved profit. There is nothing new in the impulse itself, so the trade is conducted according to the classics, however, right now there is a regular correction due to the fact that at the moment of chart received a significant acceleration and was in the overbought zone for a long time. While the positions are temporarily covered, there is some uncertainty regarding the continuation of growth in the near future. For new speculations, we are waiting for confirmations in the form of the formation of a new key point and a breakdown of the maximum or a smooth decline in price to the trend line.EthereumETH has also grown on good volumes, but amid the BTC in the dynamics of the coin, the uncertainty of the participants is felt. Chart reaching a psychological mark of $200, rolled back to the level of support. This pattern can be used when opening a speculative position with a short stop, but due to the fact that we have chosen to redistribute capital in favor of coins with brighter dynamics, we are temporarily out of position. It is possible that in the case of a deeper correction, as the chart approach the blue trend line, a good entry point will appear.RippleIn XRP, it looks like the participants are trying to win back missed opportunities in other cryptocurrencies and simply buy something that has not yet risen in price. Such decisions are usually emotional and in most cases lead to the opposite of expected results. The coin shows weakness for a very long time. On higher time frames, this is clearly visible. Internal corporate events are already in the price, but there are no new drivers. Due to the fact that currently there are coins with less risk and a more understandable technical picture, we believe that the activity in XRP can be temporarily reduced as much as possible.EOSThe exit from the triangle to the top nevertheless took place, which, against the background of a general wave of positive, allowed the coin over the weekend to show good forward dynamics compared to most other liquid coins. The breakdown was confirmed by volumes and a large green candle, which allowed speculators using the pulse approach to jump into the departing train, although at that point the risk did not allow taking a decent amount at the entry point. Position size is small. We are waiting for new features. Stop below $5.20.LitecoinLTC chart reached $92 during the impulse. However, now, after the formation of the double-top figure, some doubts arise in the continuation of growth in the near future. It is necessary to wait for the resolution of the situation. The opportunity to open a position with an acceptable profit/risk ratio may appear in case of a breakdown by chart of the previous maximum.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

In addition, the Ripple platform makes international payments not only faster and safer but also more transparent.\u201cThis is also to maintain our leading position in achieving the ambitions of the Bank\u2019s customers whether in the retail or corporate sector and to support SABB\u2019s vision to be the leading global bank in the Kingdom,\u201d said Najm.Currently, Saudi British Bank has integrated support only for the Indian rupee, but the bank plans to cooperate with other countries, as well as add support for new currencies in the near future.Earlier it was reported that in 2019, Saudi Arabia will launch its own cryptocurrency, in the development of which the United Arab Emirates is also involved.Author: Marko Vidrih@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

As a result of the correction over the last one and a half trading days, we saw a noticeable decline in quotations to the levels, from which the last growth wave started on the 25th. Anyway, the growth was impressive, at the moment it was possible to trade even with increased risk. Now the price is close to the support level and the trend line, so it is possible to once again form a long position due to the prospect of recovery of price.EthereumETH as a whole repeats the dynamics of BTC, so here we saw profit taking at higher volumes. Now the chart is on the trend line, so from the point of view of the profit/risk ratio, there is a good moment to partially restore a long position. It is premature to talk about full recovery, since it is necessary that some protective margin is formed for this position, and thus the idea of \u200b\u200brestoring price is confirmed. Stop-loss below the trend line, but necessarily adjusted for high volatility.RippleIn XRP, the bulls tried to break through the level of $0.49, but the negative dynamics of the entire market changed their plans, as a result of which the price quickly returned to the level of $0.40 and still, as before, we don\u2019t see any interesting ideas in this coin. From a technical point of view, the monthly outback is observed in the coin, from which it does not work out to either side. In that case, if from the current levels we see the emergence of a local uptrend, then certainly we can try to play this. The main thing is that the profit/risk ratio should be at an acceptable level and always remain under control.EOSIn EOS, not only the trend line but also the level of monthly support is broken down on the price chart. Now, when the price is at mid-May values, it is necessary to carefully evaluate all possible risks. Recovery of the price is likely, however, for a long time we have seen weakness in relation to BTC and ETH, therefore, the formation of a position is possible only in case of obvious signs of growth. First of all, it is necessary that the chart return above the green line and there are signs of the formation of a new uptrend. So far without a position.LitecoinLTC price also broke through the trend line and now the closest support level is around $102\u2013103. Whether the price goes there or not will depend on the overall market dynamics.

The emotions of the participants have subsided, and now the price chart of the first cryptocurrency is consolidated in a relatively narrow side tick. Now it takes time for patterns to reappear on the price chart, at which the ratio of profit and risk allows you to open speculative positions. In the meantime, the technical picture remains unclear. A small short-term trend may encounter resistance at the level of $11900, so in this case, it is better to keep hold and stay away at least until the breakdown of this level. Only in case of fixing the price above the red line, it will be possible to form a small long position.EthereumAt ETH, investors\u2019 view of the long-term outlook of the coin may change for the better due to the project\u2019s plans for the issue volumes after 2021 announced by the developers. On a short time interval, from a technical point of view, the coin is in the side. The exit of the price above the high of July 3 at a good volume could be a signal for initial purchases to check the strength of the bulls, but so far has not received a boost. Chart return below the red line can be justified in this situation based on the practice of short-term trading.RippleXRP price has not yet reached $0.37, so it can be assumed that from current levels, bulls will increase their activity and the line of least resistance and chart movement will turn up in the near future within a wide range of $0.37\u20130.49. While within the uptrend indicated on the chart by the blue line, it is possible to make trading decisions when trading from purchases with a small volume. It is worth remembering that fundamentally nothing has changed in the coin, weakness has been observed since the beginning of the year, so the size of the position of this cryptocurrency in the portfolio, of course, should take this into account. Stop-loss below the blue line.EOSConsolidation continues at EOS. Technically, the picture is clear and all that remains is to wait for the formation of a consolidation breakdown figure, in which, as a rule, the profit/risk ratio is the most attractive, and the price impulses are among the strongest. In the case of a breakout of $6.10, it will be possible to trade with a good volume, as this will be for many speculators a signal to change the situation and the possible start of a new wave of growth.LitecoinLTC chart also went into a narrow sideways with a range of changes of 3\u20134%. So far, the most justified in this situation may be either a very small long position in order to verify the assumption of a quick change in direction, or a neutral position with buying ideas in the event of a breakdown of the upper limit of the range.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

The questionnaire contained more than 60 items related to issues such as trust in the company, opportunities for realizing potential, daily experience in the company, and so on.Recall that the startup Ripple provides its services to banks and financial organizations for fast and cheap international transfers.

The decrease occurs at significantly increased volumes. After a rebound to the upper border of the descending channel, the angle of which has increased markedly, another series of sales followed. Now the main question is whether the chart has already fallen enough to arouse interest among large buyers and develop a trend. A marked increase in volatility is a consequence of a surge in emotional experiences among participants. This is the only sign that in the area of \u200b\u200bcurrent prices there is a high probability of the formation of a reversal pattern. It is necessary to monitor whether prices will continue to update local lows in the near future while maintaining a neutral position.EthereumIn the second-largest coin by capitalization, support at the level of $204 did not sustain. As a result, there was a sharp landslide decline. Chart fell by 10% in 2 hours of trading, after which, ongoing sales moved the price to three-month lows and only after that there was a slight rebound. In a situation of a high degree of uncertainty, it is not necessary to talk about the trade from purchases. All that remains to be done is to wait for the end of the decline phase, observing market parameters and thinking about the level of reversal. After that, it will be possible to talk about the emergence of opportunities for opening a position with an acceptable ratio of potential profit to risk. Under the current conditions, we can definitely say that you should not rush. Most likely, a wait-and-see attitude will save both money and health.RippleIn the XRP, following the general market trend, chart plummeted, breaking through support level at $0.29. As a result, the annual minimums for this pair were very close. Strong support is taking place around $0.245, created in September last year. When reduced, this level must be traded, regardless of the direction of further price movement. As mentioned many times in past reviews, in this tool, activity should be minimized. Obviously, pressure on the chart remains. Based on the postulate that technical analysis takes into account everything, in order to save money, we simply remain outside the market in this coin. We observe how participants will behave in case prices approach to support in the region of annual minimums.EOSThe decline in the market has not spared EOS. Now chart is in the region of monthly lows. A reversal is possible from the current level, but so far there are no clear signs that this will happen in the near future. Volatility decreases after a sharp increase in the eve. Therefore, in the case of the formation of a local trend, it will be possible to try to make the first test purchases.LTCIn LTC, the price has updated the monthly low and is inside the bearish channel. From a technical point of view, a local rebound is possible, but the trend is still downward. The chances of a reversal are still preserved, but everything will depend on the mood in the market as a whole. It is necessary to observe the dynamics for a while after the sales cycle in order to draw conclusions about the presence or absence of interest in the coin from large players.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

This is the first lawsuit to which Ripple\u2019s allegations must be answered directly. The company has time until September 19th to prepare an answer. Four previous claims in California were successfully consolidated by Ripple into one and submitted to federal court.According to lawyer Jake Chervinsky, the latest lawsuit is \u201cconvincing\u201d and is supported by Susman Godfrey \u2014 \u201cone of the best plaintiff\u2019s law firms in the US\u201d. He also noted that the document clarifies why XRP should be considered security at the federal level and in the state of California:\u201cThis is important because California uses the \u2018risk capital test\u2019 in addition to the [federal] Howey test to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe risk capital test is broader than the Howey test, meaning the plaintiffs could lose their federal securities claims and still win their state securities claims.\u201dPlaintiffs are trying to prove the link between XRP Ledger, the distributed network that underlies XRP, and Ripple.SEC GuideProbably one of the most important differences between the new lawsuit and the previous ones is the reference to the regulatory guidance provided by the SEC to determine whether a particular digital asset is a security.\u201cAlthough the SEC\u2019s Framework is technically only non-binding guidance, the Court will likely give it significant weight in deciding how to apply the Howey test to the facts of this case,\u201d Chervinsky explained.Non-litigation partner Fisher Broyles, Rebecca Rettig, said SEC guidelines for federal lawsuits are being applied for the first time.\u201cAlthough the framework on its own doesn\u2019t have precedential value \u2014 meaning the court is not required to follow it \u2014 it will be very interesting to see how the court handles the utility of the framework in moving forward in determining whether XRP is a security,\u201d she said.\u201cLead Plaintiff and the Class invested fiat and other digital currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to purchase XRP. As explained in the SEC Framework, investment of both fiat and digital currency meets the first prong of Howey,\u201d the filing says and goes on to say: \u201cLead Plaintiff and the Class have entirely passive roles vis-\u00e0-vis the success of the XRP Ledger and XRP. Rather, as Defendants\u2019 own marketing makes clear, the success of the XRP Ledger, and the profits the Class reasonably expected to derive from investing in XRP, are dependent on the essential technical, entrepreneurial, and managerial efforts of Defendants and their agents and employees.\u201dRettig noted that \u201ceach of the [factors in the SEC Framework] are based on underlying federal case law, so the litigants will likely rely upon these underlying cases and not simply the framework [itself].\u201dPlaintiffs also mention statements made by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CTO David Schwartz, which may reinforce their position. So, in 2017, in a conversation with CNBC, Garlinghouse said:\u201cPeople are looking at the success Ripple has been having as a company, and I think that\u2019s increased the value of XRP.\u201d\u201cThe Complaint emphasizes Ripple\u2019s own statements to prove that XRP investors had a reasonable expectation of profits flowing from Ripple\u2019s managerial efforts,\u201d Chervinsky noted. \u201cThis is similar to how the SEC framed its own Complaint against Kik,\u201d the messaging app company that the SEC alleges violated securities laws when it raised $100 million during a 2017 token sale.Tweets as proofIn addition, the document contains about 40 tweets, including messages from Ripple, executives and other employees of the company, which discuss listings on exchanges, Ripple reserves in XRP and other measures to promote cryptocurrency.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many citations to Twitter in a complaint before,\u201d Chervinsky said.The plaintiffs did not stop there and stated that Ripple had misled the general public regarding the use of various products.\u201cOn April 26, 2017, Ripple tweeted a link to an article on its own site, proclaiming: \u2018#Ripple welcomes 10 additional customers to our #blockchain #payments network.\u2019 Neither this tweet nor the article it linked to informed readers that the blockchain payments network did not refer to the XRP Ledger, but rather Ripple\u2019s xCurrent enterprise solution,\u201d the complaint said, adding in the next paragraph:\u201cJust days later, on May 3, 2017, with the price of XRP continuing to rise, Ripple tweeted: \u2018#Ripple adoption is sparking interest in XRP \u2018which has had an impressive rally in the last two months\u2019 via @Nasdaq.\u2019\u201dNot only about securitiesAlso in the new lawsuit, for the first time, some arguments not related to securities laws were included.\u201cFor the first time, the plaintiffs now claim that Ripple violated California\u2019s false advertising and unfair competition laws by making fraudulent statements about the genesis, circulating supply, and adoption of XRP,\u201d Chervinsky said.The plaintiffs demand compensation for the losses they incurred on investments in XRP. The main plaintiff lost $118,100. The losses of the remaining participants in the proceedings have not yet been calculated.More importantly, plaintiffs want the court to recognize XRP as a security.

Price easily brake the upper resistance (red line). The fact of the breakdown gave a good opportunity for thrill-seekers to play big, risking a part of the still unfixed profits, however, if successful, make good money. This time, our expectations were fully met. It\u2019s time to throw off shoulders, everyone decides for himself. It depends on many factors, and primarily on individual sensitivity to risk. While the trend continues, but it is obvious that it is overbought, therefore, further acceleration of price movements without some correction is unlikely.EthereumETH continue to correlate with BTC quote. Another breakdown of the red line occurred tonight, as a result of which the price reached the levels of early August last year. The trend continues, and in this case, due to the fact that after each wave of purchases chart is consolidated at the achieved levels, there is no obvious overheating. So far, as in the BTC, we hold the position, but without any increased risk. Stop loss a little below $315. Due to the high volatility, as well as due to the fact that at the moment we are already risking only a part of the profits, it is impractical to make the stop shorter.RippleXRP is again trading around $0.47, but there is still no apparent demand for an asset from buyers. The movement most likely occurs by inertia in attempts to catch up with the leaders. BTC and ETH are now more interesting for investment, so in XRP we still stand aside and monitor the level of $0.49, the breakdown of which can be a signal to a sharp revaluation of the asset. At the same time, we should not forget that even in the case of a breakdown, speculators need to be extremely cautious, since, in the case of the start of a correction in the entire market, there is a high probability of getting a completely opposite effect.EOSEOS \u201cstuck\u201d at the level of $7.2 and cannot go any further. In this instrument, it is still better to remain out of position until the moment you leave the outset because no profit is earned. In the event that lagging bulls begin to jump into indiscriminate assets, in an attempt to catch up with the departed EOS train, there are good chances for growth, but it is still better to wait for confirmation in the form of a breakdown of $7.6.LitecoinLTC chart remains sideways for a long time. As before, you can only note that there are absolutely no bright ideas here, so we are waiting for a way out of the outset and are looking for a profit in other coins.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Since Monday, the capitalization index has grown by another 15.5% and is currently at $245 billion.As we wrote in the last review, the accumulated pent-up demand entered the market and so far it looks like the rising wave is probably still that time will go on.BitcoinThe breakdown of a maximum of $7,500 took place, after which the upward movement in BTC continued and yesterday the coin was able to test $8,400, which is the maximum value since July last year. As we wrote earlier, in this case, it is advisable to use a portfolio of strategies. This approach improves trade performance and allows for a smoother movement of the capital growth curve. We continue to trade in the direction of the trend, using partial unloading of the position and its restoration, depending on the removal or approach of the chart to the trend line. Stop below the blue line.EthereumThe dynamics of ETH have changed noticeably, more and more participants are joining the upward movement. The movement goes with some acceleration. Technically, it was possible to buy at breakdowns of the highs with the transfer of the foot. Due to the fact that the market periodically there is a need for the redistribution of capital in the direction of stronger tools, in connection with which we temporarily reduced the size of the limit in ETH in favor of BTC. Now the situation has changed and the technical picture in ETH indicates that a certain personality appears in the coin, which should be used to extract maximum profit. We look forward to the formation of a new key point of continued growth and the subsequent breakdown or reduction of the chart on the blue line, which in both cases will give us the opportunity to open a new position with a small risk.RippleAt XRP happened exactly what usually happens in situations where the coin has long lagged behind the leaders. We wrote about this in one of the past reviews that asset revaluation can be very fast. Being under pressure from buyers for a long time, XRP for two days, breaking through a maximum of 11 numbers, grew by 30% and continues its upward movement at high volatility and large volumes. In such a situation, if the positions are open, it makes sense to hold them as long as possible with a trailing stop, since the movement can continue and be very strong for a while, and show a sharp reversal.EOSEOS was again among our leaders in terms of participation in this wave of growth and allowed us to pull out the portfolio for profitability, at which it can be said that the opportunity was not missed. Throughout the movement, we left a long position and the market made it possible for several hikes to increase the share in the portfolio to the maximum possible. Now all that is required is to control the size of the position. Stop below the blue line \u2014 partial unloading on a moving foot or take profit.LitecoinIn LTC, the chart cannot yet move significantly above the red resistance line. However, the situation when a coin lagging behind leaders for a long time catches up with them in a few hours, as we see from the situation in XRP, it is quite likely on the cryptocurrency market. In the event that the pair can consolidate above the red line in the coming hours, we will try to open a long position on the first part of the limit with a stop in case of return of chart below the red line.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Since Wednesday total capitalization fell by more than 12% to a value of $312 billion. Volumes increased again.Credit: CoinMarketCapWe are going to launch our Altcoin Hub Index Fund very soon.

Thus, the entry into the area of \u200b\u200bmaximums from the 26th did not take place, and now it takes time to form on the chart new key points. Such coin dynamics suggests that since the last update of the highs, the alignment of forces between bulls and bears has changed significantly and it is quite likely that the chart will be in the outset with wide boundaries, and therefore speculators will need to endure sit out and save capital for future opportunities. Neutral position again may be the most correct strategy in this situation.EthereumAt ETH, investors also faltered after sales at BTC, as a result of which the price fell to the level of the middle of last month. All positions must be closed at worst in a foot around $300. The update of local minima confirms the downward movement of the last two weeks and indicates that the conditions for changing the trend have not yet formed. Market sentiment has changed, so in the current situation, it is again necessary to wait for new interesting conditions, staying aside from active trading with this token.RippleIn XRP, the potential weakness that has accumulated in the coin since the beginning of the last wave of BTC growth turned into sales below the significant support at $0.37 per coin. It is clear that in such a situation it is better to step aside, all the more so as there is no internal idea in the coin for a long time. Support at $0.32 was reached relatively quickly. The next level of support is around $0.29, but the price going there or not will depend entirely on the dynamics of the entire market.EOSIn EOS, the impulse after the breakdown of consolidation turned out to be really strong, but not in the direction we wanted. We have to admit that a signal to short in this situation would be ideal. However, opening short positions is not available to all participants. In view of the fact that short operations are a significantly more risky strategy for their use in trading, considerable practical experience is needed. So far, in this situation, further reduction to the support area of \u200b\u200b$4.40 is technically observed, therefore, it may be correct to abandon active operations with this coin for some time and stand aside until the situation changes.LitecoinThe situation in LTC is not significantly different from the situation in other altcoins since the decline is of a general market nature and almost all of the most liquid instruments are subject to negative sentiment. The breakdown of the green line contributed to a further decrease in quotations to the psychological level of $100 and in this situation, the strategy of preserving capital and waiting fully justifies itself.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Moods have noticeably improved, and in a number of coins there are signs of the formation of key pivot points, but unequivocal conclusions can be made only after some time, and in the event that buyers increase their activity.BitcoinIn BTC chart, the technical picture is noticeably clearer. For the last three days BTC has twice tested the mark of $7,500. On the chart, a trading range has been formed with the boundaries of $7,500- $7,900, the output of which will show us the direction of further price movement. In case of breakdown of the upper boundary, a new opportunity will appear for the formation of a long position. If the quote break through the lower limit of the trading range, then a further decline to $7,000 is more likely.EthereumA similar situation in the ETH. Quote has not yet been able to confidently break through resistance and gain a foothold above the red line. A downtrend line runs alongside, so if the price leaves the range and breaks the blue trend line, the window for trading from long will open again and you can make your first purchase with a short stop loss position. While out of position, we follow the dynamics.RippleIn XRP, the quote is moving in a downward and is currently going to the area of \u200b\u200b$0.44 as part of a short-term upward movement. It\u2019s difficult to make money trading from long, since the main trend is still downward, and the coin is not only completely dependent on general market sentiment, it is still one of the outsiders since the beginning of this year. However, short-term movement occurs within the trend indicated by the green line, and if the quote reduced to a level acceptable in terms of the profit/risk ratio, you can try to open a small long position with a stop loss below the green line.EOSAfter a decline of almost 30% from ATH, EOS quote found the bottom at the moment. Now the price movement is also in the trading range. The boundaries of the range are indicated, and going beyond it will indicate the most likely direction of price movement in the near future. The coin has undergone sales and at the moment clearly lagged behind the market.

Since the bearish movement started a few hours earlier and was sharp and short in time, volatility indicators did not grow so much. You can not talk about the irrational behavior of the participants with an excess of emotions. The current behavior of the coin suggests a high probability of updating local lows in the near future, at least one more time. Immediate support takes place in the region of the minimum values \u200b\u200bof the end of July ($9150). In a situation of uncertainty, a neutral position fully justifies itself. As the chart approach the $9150 mark, it will be possible to draw some conclusions regarding the development scenarios of further events.EthereumThere were also \u201chot sales\u201d at ETH, as a result of which prices reached value of the mid-May this year. In the current situation, there is a high proportion of uncertainty. The nearest significant level of support is in the region of $155, which implies the potential to reduce another 7\u20138% of current prices. For those who are aware of the risks of opening \u201cshort\u201d positions and make transactions exclusively from purchases, a neutral position remains relevant now. It is necessary to wait for the formation of a key turning point before entering a decent volume of the market. For speculators with stronger nerves, small \u201cshort\u201d positions with a low level of risk and constant monitoring of trades can give a positive result. The question of whether this approach is worth it is more likely to be about the individual personality trader.RippleXRP fell below the support level, but after that, it returned again above the green line. It is possible that over the coming weekend it will become clear whether the time has come to trade from purchases. We carefully observe the dynamics of the coin. In the case of the formation of a reversal pattern or a local trend within the range of $0.255- $0.29, we can think about opening a position in the first part of the limit.EOSThe expected breakdown of the upper boundary never happened. Against the backdrop of negative market dynamics, EOS chart fell, breaking through support at $3.78. Unlike other coins, there was even a small local panic sell \u2014 at the moment the price reached $3.1, which is the minimum since February of this year. Under current conditions, we must wait for the end of the decline and the formation of a key turning point, while being in a neutral position.LTCSupport at $70 was also broken, after which prices only declined. Now we need to wait for the level at which the price will find new support. Perhaps after this, a reversal point will begin to form.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

It solves the problem where an app business needs to pay people in every country small amounts.I\u2019m thinking about IndaHash as another perfect example. By moving to Ethereum they instantly removed the need to even consider which country they were sending payment to.To them they are all just Ethereum addresses, end of story.So this very same use case is going to be tempting for all other sharing apps.What we really need now is an Uber, Lyft or AirBNB to announce that their drivers or hosts can now get paid in crypto. Watch this space!Sponsorship Slothttps://www.thecryptoverse.show/If you would like to earn crypto rewards for watching Chris\u2019 videos then visit TheCryptoverse.show and then click on the \u201cGet Paid To Watch\u201d button, then there\u2019s a 2 minute video that explains how it works.Continuing With The Show!Satoshi\u2019s Vision Conference Recordings Are Uphttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJHGWgmZdkQlZA28fuGfNmA/videosThere\u2019s 3\u20134 hours of technical content here.Yes, it\u2019s Bitcoin Cash focused however what impresses me is that instead of just saying \u201c0-conf\u201d doesn\u2019t work and walking away, they had an entire conference focused on discussing HOW to make it work.So they are coming from the mindset of possibility and innovation for the benefit of the cryptocurrency user, which I will always appreciate.And just to make sure we are all on the same page, 0-conf is short for 0 confirmations which solves that problem where you send some Bitcoin to an exchange and they make you wait for 3 or even 6 confirmations before the money shows up in your account.More hot air from the TRON project which is a shame after I praised their integration with BitTorrent the other dayhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/confirmed-baidu-and-tron-to-cooperate-on-cloud-computing-resourcesI had a feeling this was hype which is why I didn\u2019t report on the rumours going around.About a week ago Justin Sun Tweeted out hinting at a secret \u201cpartnership\u201d with an \u201cindustry giant\u201d that is valued at \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d.It sounds out they are just going to be using Baidu\u2019s basic cloud computing infrastructure \u201cto build, operate and debug blockchain projects\u201d.Look, I\u2019m a veteran of marketing so I understand the need to turn anything into a PR opportunity.However there is a line that is crossed when marketing becomes clearly misleading.\u201cValued at tens of billions of dollars\u201d was intentionally vague so that we would think the deal was worth tens of billions rather than that being in reference to the value of Baidu itself.If you accused Justin Sun of being misleading, he could easily blame you for interpreting it wrong and get away with it.You know I\u2019m an EOS fanboy and one of the reasons is that you don\u2019t see block one doing stuff like that. You can look at their news section to see how they take a much more professional approach.That to me betrays the different audiences they are each appealing to.Justin Sun\u2019s teaser is an appeal to a less sophisticated audience while Block.One appeal to to corporate leaders.IMF: Rapid Growth of Bitcoin and Crypto Will Impact Global Financial Systemhttps://www.ccn.com/imf-rapid-growth-of-bitcoin-and-crypto-will-impact-global-financial-system/If there is one thing I hate in the crypto space it\u2019s when people who still live in the old system state the friggin obvious.You\u2019re damn right it will impact the global financial system.I\u2019d say replacing it can be considered as making an impact.It says:\u201cContinued rapid growth of crypto assets could create new vulnerabilities in the international financial system.\u201d\u2026 they mean expose vulnerabilities not create them, they are already there.The valid point they made is with regards to security. The main reason people keep losing money in crypto is more to do with their poor security practices than anything.I have noticed this myself so I\u2019ve started working on a new course dedicated entirely to secure best practices.Battle Of The DEX: One EOS Decentralized Exchange Records More Volume Than All ETH Exchangeshttps://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2018/10/battle-of-the-dex-one-eos-decentralized-exchange-records-more-volume-than-all-eth-exchanges/There\u2019s no need to belabor this one.You can look on DappRadar and do this calculation yourself any time you want.https://dappradar.com/dappsYes EOS is transacting more monetary value on it\u2019s decentralised exchanges, but to be fair Ethereum is doing a greater number of transactions.For example in the last 24 hours IDEX on Ethereum has recorded 11,687 transactions while NewDex on EOS has recorded 3,996.One thing that is worth highlighting from the article is the difference in the amount of funding that has been put behind decentralised exchanges on each platform.Ethereum has Bancor, which raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Then there is the 0x protocol on Ethereum.So not only are they very well funded they have also had a significant head start in terms of time. Both of those projects have been around for at least a year.Newdex is just some EOS based app that was launched shortly after the EOS network went live and is already 30% of the way to matching IDEX in terms of number of transactions.From a business point of view, it\u2019s much easier from a technical standpoint to build an app on EOS than Ethereum.I think that fact alone gives EOS a huge edge since it will simply attract more apps.Then by the law of averages EOS is more likely to have a handful of apps that go viral, just going by the numbers alone.\u25cf\u25ac Recent Episodes From The Cryptoverse\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cfBitcoin Flash Rally As Tether Loses It\u2019s Peg \u2014 October 16th, 2018An Analysis of Chinese Influence on Bitcoin \u2014 October 15th, 2018\u25cf\u25ac Discount Links For My Courses \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cfThe Secrets Of The Bitcoin Triangle CourseThe Digital Money Revolution Course\u25cf\u25ac Social Networks \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cfPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheCryptoverseSteemit: https://steemit.com/@marketingmonkTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/thecryptoverseTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChrisConeyIntFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Cryptoversity/Telegram: https://t.me/TheCryptoverseEmail: http://eepurl.com/dlPc9PReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCryptoverse/Minds: https://www.minds.com/marketingmonkGab: https://gab.ai/chrisconey\u25cf\u25ac Support The Show \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cfBecome a patron: https://www.patreon.com/TheCryptoverseSign up for Binance: https://www.binance.com/?ref=10890655Sign up for RoboForm: https://www.roboform.com/?affid=c5489Sign up for Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings:https://www.thecryptoverse.show/crypt...Sign up for Private Internet Access: https://www.thecryptoverse.show/piaBuy online courses: https://www.cryptoversity.com/courses/Buy Bitcoin: https://www.coinbase.com/join/56e9586...Buy a Ledger hardware wallet: https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/d1da\u25cf\u25ac Donate Crypto \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cfBitcoin: 3Fo7Uri2R4MLBbZZ3Ja1ryiXnto8BfqFL1Bitcoin Cash: qqjjyt543y0untmq6w5em6h82u60kcaqpywxm7x75wEthereum: 0x0de0E11E0812982652AB68F903643b0cddD4C0a8Dash: XbrDZbmqUvUUYsPnj8eSLTLqccXe6QvGozDigiByte: DBGFU3KLBiLHa6ZfeorxzfeYaA76Joa36BLiteCoin: LKLvp8owSjqbNRo3iT2fwgzCF6XBZVC4igNEO: AYpGCzgWsZvR6f3fvfDKKkbcCKU1KFU8kdEOS: chrisjsconey\u25cf\u25acSources\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cfSources for this story are linked throughout the article.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Podcast", "Investing", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Altcoin News: Bitstamp Receives Bitlicense \u2014 Positive Signal for XRP & xRapid?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-news-bitstamp-receives-bitlicense-positive-signal-for-xrp-xrapid-27369d5721e0?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2019-04-15", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-15", "readtime": "1.96", "claps": 2, "voters": 1, "content": "Altcoin News: Bitstamp Receives Bitlicense \u2014 Positive Signal for XRP & xRapid?April 15, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN MAGAZINEMarko VidrihFollowApr 15 \u00b7 2 min readThe New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has granted a license to the cryptocurrency exchange and Ripple partner Bitstamp.Luxembourg-based Bitstamp may now officially offer its services in New York, giving it the ability to use the Ripple suite for cross-border payment solutions.DFS has engaged Bitstamp USA to provide services that enable its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and selected other cryptocurrencies for USD and vice versa. Bitstamp USA also has the right to transfer funds via the Ripple Network by issuing Ripple balances in USD, other cryptocurrencies and selected Fiat currencies including Australian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed the company\u2019s partnership with Bitstamp back in December and made Bitstamp the fourth crypto exchange to support Ripple\u2019s xRapid software solution, which uses the XRP token.The New York Financial Supervisor is known for the rigor of \u201cBitlicense\u201d and the difficulty of preserving it. XRP enthusiasts are hoping the license will drive the use of xRapid through Bitstamp, which in turn would increase demand for XRP and boost the XRP course.The other three crypto exchanges aboard the payment platform are the US-based companies Bittrex, Bitso, based in Mexico and Coins.php in the Philippines. The exchanges are an integral part of xRapid, accepting Fiat payments from banks and financial institutions, converting it into XRP and sending XRP overseas, where it is immediately converted back to Fiat.Ripple has already released xRapid for commercial use in October. So far, a total of 13 companies have announced to use the technology. The global forex provider Mercury FX is the most open regarding the active use of the technology. Last month, the company announced its first xRapid transfer from the UK to the Philippines on behalf of a customer who sent overseas money to pay for his honeymoon. The company has also sent a number of xRapid payments from the UK to Mexico.Mercury FX says it has set itself the goal of operating about 10 payment routes by the middle of the year, including corridors to Canada and the Middle East.Author: Marko Vidrih@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

This year, Ripple and its executives donated $29 million to DonorsChoose.org to give back to America\u2019s teachers, fulfilling every request listed on the nonprofit\u2019s website. Reading the comments from teachers, supporters and students and seeing the real impact these donations made was surreal. The donation allowed our team to take a minute to step back and help the broader community and world we live in; it was a new dose of inspiration that I didn\u2019t expect. We currently have hundreds of handwritten thank you notes hung up all over the office as a reminder to share the company\u2019s success and bring goodness to the world.\u201dI had the pleasure to interview Monica Long a Senior Vice President at RippleThank you so much for doing this with us! What is your \u201cbackstory\u201d?I\u2019ve always been passionate about and I studied third-world development and economic disparity in college, seeking to understand why it exists and how we might fix it over time. There\u2019s a world of history and many converging factors that have shaped the world we live in so there\u2019s no silver bullet solution, but\u2026I met Chris Larsen in 2007. He co-founded and was CEO of Prosper, one of the first \u2014 and at the time, the largest \u2014 person-to-person lending marketplaces. Chris\u2019 vision was to return lending to its roots in community. The upshot was to financially empower the disenfranchised \u2014 those whose banks would turn them away for loans. I started my career at a PR agency and Prosper was one of my clients. Chris made a lasting impression on me as a visionary and a leader, so when I heard he\u2019d started a new company years later, I was intrigued.When Chris explained to me what he was working on, I saw fireworks. He was more excited about Ripple\u2019s potential to democratize people\u2019s financial access globally than he had been about any past project. He made the compelling point that money doesn\u2019t move fluidly around the world. Held back by antiquated infrastructure and foreign exchange oligopolies, people and businesses in certain markets can\u2019t even participate in international commerce. Growth in the global economy itself has been stifled by outdated technology. Blockchain and digital assets introduced the possibility to finally modernize rusty, old pipes.His belief and ambition to realize this vision rubbed off on me. I joined as Director of Communications and later took on an expanded role as SVP of Marketing and Communications.Can you tell me about the most interesting projects you are working on now?It\u2019s hard to pick! I\u2019ll highlight Swell by Ripple, our customer conference now entering its second year. Swell brings together financial institutions (our customers), regulators, and other industry leaders.It\u2019s so much more than just an event. People sometimes say, \u201cRipple is an enterprise software company.\u201d Yes\u2026 but NO!Ripple is a networks business. Part of our offering is software and APIs but what makes the tech powerful is our role facilitating new connections for our institutional customers. For example, a bank may see a prime opportunity to expand into Brazil but not have a partner institution to work with. We matchmake our customers.Swell is a highly impactful venue to efficiently make connections and to absorb customer feedback. We\u2019re planning a few crowd-pleasing surprises too, so our customers enjoy their time with us.None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse gave me the break of a lifetime and have both been a consistent source of inspiration to me. They believed in me (more than I can say I did!).I\u2019d also say my parents. They taught me to be responsible for my actions and commitments, the discipline and grit to work hard, gratitude for good fortune, and never to sacrifice dignity or integrity. The values they taught me led me to surround myself with good people \u2014 like at Ripple \u2014 and I\u2019m thankful for that. I have endless respect for them.What are the 5 things that most excite you about blockchain and crypto? Why?a. Here to stay: The world is coming to know, understand and embrace this new technology and its potential to affect transformative change. It\u2019s no fad; it\u2019s here to stay. It feels good to share my excitement about the industry with people all over.b. Tipping point: In our experience, institutional adoption of blockchain is the real deal. We\u2019re past experiments and are actively commercializing. We\u2019re reaching the tipping point at which the technology will underpin real world transactions and improve lives in a meaningful way.c. Talent: The caliber of people who want to be a part of the industry and more specifically Ripple\u2019s vision is awesome \u2014 it\u2019s the best and brightest from tech and finance. Having been at the company for almost five years, I have had the fortune of seeing the talent pool grow immensely.d. Regulation: In order to transform and modernize the current financial system, we must work with regulators, governments and central banks. Ripple is working with governments, not against them. I expect when regulation for the space fully comes into focus, it will provide a solid foundation that\u2019ll enable the industry to harness innovation in the technology while protecting consumers from bad actors.e. Impact: I\u2019m most excited to see the impact blockchain and digital assets make in people\u2019s lives across the globe. Making money move faster, at lower costs and with transparency is ultimately about making our financial system more inclusive \u2014 improving the economic opportunities for those at a disadvantage because the current system is prohibitively expensive for them to participate.What are the 5 things worry you about blockchain and crypto? Why?a. Misguided mania: Mainstream interest in our space both excites and worries me. I worry that the interest is misguided; fervor around the \u201cinvestment potential\u201d in crypto in terms of high and hot returns. The focus should be on the technology\u2019s transformative potential to solve real problems and improve lives.b. ICOs trending: Novel ways to raise funds for real businesses are great! But I question the motivation and validity of many ICO businesses; last year, almost half of the ICOs that launched ended up failing. When people raise millions of dollars based on nothing but a whitepaper, I am concerned consumers are getting sucked into scams.c. Representation of minorities: You hear about it, read about it and see it, but the male dominance in this industry is overwhelming. I\u2019m glad to see strong female investors, entrepreneurs, researchers and journalists take leadership (like Meltem Demirors, Katie Haun and Neha Narula) and pave the way for more women to contribute their ideas and enrich the industry overall.d. Religion vs. pragmatism: Many in blockchain and crypto are motivated to apply the innovation in constructive, pragmatic ways \u2014 we\u2019re building businesses to improve lives. There is, however, a vocal minority motivated by ideology and politics \u2014 crypto is a religion to them. The danger is these folks wage holy wars, spreading misinformation about any technology or approach that\u2019s not their religion. And it\u2019s crazy but these folks carry influence in the industry and with press. Point being \u2014 check your sources before you believe what you hear or read.e. Imposters!: Imposter accounts on social media are scamming consumers and spreading false information. Proceed with caution on social media \u2014 check information sources and if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is!How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world? Can you share a story?I\u2019m proud to work for an organization that values and prioritizes giving back. This year, Ripple and its executives donated $29 million to DonorsChoose.org to give back to America\u2019s teachers, fulfilling every request listed on the nonprofit\u2019s website. Reading the comments from teachers, supporters and students and seeing the real impact these donations made was surreal.The donation allowed our team to take a minute to step back and help the broader community and world we live in; it was a new dose of inspiration that I didn\u2019t expect. We currently have hundreds of handwritten thank you notes hung up all over the office as a reminder to share the company\u2019s success and bring goodness to the world.What 3 things would you advise to someone who wanted to emulate your career? Can you share an example for each idea?a. Seek mentors: Seek the advice and counsel from those who have done it before. Chances are the leaders who inspire you and you look up to would love to help you. You just need to ask and come prepared with specific questions or topics to make good use of your time together.b. Trust your gut: Taking on a new industry or new role can be intimidating. I find many friends and colleagues underestimate their knowledge and capabilities \u2014 they may feel deep down like they can take on a challenge but they talk themselves out of it. Sukhinder Singh Cassidy said something that resonated with me at an event recently along the lines of: \u201cSilicon Valley was built by people who had no business taking on the jobs and opportunities they did.\u201d We\u2019re capable of more than we think!c. Embrace risk: Opportunities like this have a huge upside. The only downside is you fail and move on \u2014 and you learn something along the way. Not so bad!Some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this :-)Oprah: I recently listened to the \u201cMaking Oprah\u201d podcast and see why everyone is so inspired by and enamored with her. She is a powerhouse who had the courage and confidence to follow her vision, be true to who she was \u2014 even when she ran against the grain \u2014 and broke new ground for women along the way.Now It\u2019s Your Turn:", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Fintech", "Blockchain", "Science", "Women In Tech", "Inspiration"]}, {"title": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC \u2014 Cryptocurrency Review", "post_link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-analysis-btc-eth-xrp-eos-ltc-cryptocurrency-review-f3918feafedb?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2019-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-15", "readtime": "3.72", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC \u2014 Cryptocurrency ReviewApril 12, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN MAGAZINEMarko VidrihFollowApr 12 \u00b7 4 min readA correction is developing on the cryptocurrency market. From the highs reached on Wednesday, the prices of the most liquid instruments fell within 5\u201310%. Capitalization currently in the region of $170 billion, which corresponds to a decrease of this indicator by 6.5% compared with the values \u200b\u200bof the environment.Volumes are average, volatility indicators are gradually decreasing.BitcoinBTC was able to overcome the $5300 mark on Wednesday, but immediately after that, a correction followed. The false breakdown of the triangle provoked the closing of positions by short-term holders, as a result of which the cryptocurrency tested the price of $4,900. Now the trades are held on average volumes and it is likely that the participants will need some more time to get used to the new price levels after a sharp rise at the beginning of the month. In the case of approaching quotations to the level of $4,800 for 1 coin, you need to carefully look at the dynamics, since it is possible that there will be a moment to open a small long.EthereumETH price could not repeat the maximum of this year (April 3) and also corrected, breaking the blue uptrend line, where our protective stop order was triggered. Now, amid a renewal of local minima, it is highly likely that prices will drop to the support area ($153), where, depending on the behavior of the coin, it will be possible to build one or another trading strategy.RippleXRP, as is often the case lately, showed a markedly greater sensitivity to the corrective movement of the market, with the result that prices quietly overcame the $0.34 level and are even below $0.32 at the moment, which had long acted as an important resistance level. In the event that the chart returns above $0.325 and can consolidate there in the coming hours, you can try to open a small long with a short stop. If this does not happen, then it is quite possible that after some time we will see a price movement in the region of $0.30. Much now in the dynamics of this particular coin depends on the general market sentiment.EOSAt EOS, traders also faced a false breakdown, forcing short-term participants to eliminate all positions. The main thing in such cases is a short stop, which allows you to protect the capital, step aside and calmly without emotion, from the side to look at everything that happens. We believe that the current correction may lead to the fact that prices will fall to the area of \u200b\u200bthe green line, after which, perhaps, there will be good moments for purchases. We remain out of position in this instrument, although it is worth noting the fact that EOS was still able to update the maximum, which indicates the relative strength of the coin and good prospects.LitecoinThe LTC position was also eliminated by a stop in the region of $84.5. On the market saw, a trader is always saved by a short stop and the small size of the position being opened. While in this coin we do not have any clearly expressed expectations. Support is low, so now we can talk about moving towards it, and significant local levels are no longer observed. Therefore, we are waiting for a reversal and in the case of the emergence of a new local trend, we will make decisions.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

This time the capitalization indicator overcame the values \u200b\u200ba year ago. Now its value is $328 billion, which is more than 9% higher than on Friday.Image credit: CoinMarketCapGrowth continues in BTC, ETH is connected. In the rest of the altcoins, the dynamics are far from being everywhere, investors are still cautious, so capital comes mostly in the most liquid coins of the market.We are going to launch our Altcoin Hub Index Fund very soon. So you will be able to invest from as small as $10 to unlimited funds in a secure index fund where real professionals will trade and manage your portfolio for a small (3%) yearly fee.You will also be able to have a live view of how your portfolio is doing and exit any time you want.Stay updated and don\u2019t miss the chance to invest in private Altcoin Hub Index Fund \u2014 only 100 positions are available!BitcoinAt BTC, the price surged through a psychologically important mark of $10,000, almost without resistance, however, the volumes increased significantly, which indicates that the interest from the buyers is large and it continues at current prices. While the price is in the side range and now you can safely hold long positions with a stop at a breakdown of $10,400. The position in the trend should be fully formed, so in case of a red line breakdown, the current profit allows you to consider increasing the share of the coin in the portfolio on your shoulders, but still, this strategy is more a matter of individual risk attitudes for each trader.EthereumETH also moved higher, catching up behind the leader. There were several opportunities to increase the share of the coin in the portfolio, so for the time being, traders who exploit a trend or impulse approach have long positions that are also likely to be formed. If the free limit still remains, it can be done on the breakdown of the red line. A stop is below $300, however, due to high volatility, from a practical point of view, a reasonable decision would be to use not automatic stop, but in manual mode, using the closing prices of hourly candles.RippleIn XRP, in an attempt to catch up with the market, the bulls were putting up quote above $0.47, which we noted as the key to start trading from purchases. However, the continuation, at least for now, did not work out, therefore the positions are covered. The coin clearly lacks ideas for revaluation, but, as is the case with XRP, and we have repeatedly observed this \u2014 reassessment occurs sharply, unexpectedly and in relative terms can be quite significant. Therefore, to completely write off the scenario in which the bulls rush to buy everything that has not yet grown, it is impossible. It is more correct to use the opportunity in the case of another breakdown, only now quotations will need to be fixed above the value of $0.49.EOSAfter the red line breakdown at EOS, the price reached $7.6, but it didn\u2019t work, because prices returned again below the level of purchases, and there were no obvious reasons for taking profits after the acceleration. It should be noted that while in this coin, there is also some uncertainty on the part of buyers. Many participants remember that the coin showed better results than the market from January to May of the current year, but apparently, the situation has changed. Now buyers have gone to other coins, so EOS is best seen as one of the tools needed to reduce the diversified portfolio risk. So far, without a position, and in the case of renewed growth and the formation of a local uptrend, it will be possible to look for an opportunity for a new series of purchases. In case of a breakdown of the maximum of the 22nd this month.LitecoinLTC still shows slurred dynamics. Attempts to break the red line have not yet led to the desired result for us. The coin remains sideways, which once again underlines the fact that investors are selectively approaching all instruments in the current market phase. While we note the absence of explicit ideas. We are waiting for the breakdown level of $143\u2013144, after which, perhaps, we will buy.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

More broadly, no sectors is immune to major overhauls. Today, we\u2019ll have a look at the impact of Disruptors.Nested in Paris\u2019 Le Marais neighborhood, a clever incubator/think-thank called TheFamily, made its mission to chronicle the digital transformation of our society. Largely inspired by the iconic Ycombinator incubator, TheFamily funds and provides all sorts of services to a hundred plus startups. But it also wants to rattle the establishment with an activist posture. Paraphrasing the \u201cBarbarians at the Gate\u201d book title, the incubator hosts a conference series titled Les Barbares Attaquent (Barbarians On The Attack) that examines all the sectors to be impacted by the digital tidal wave.The latest event (#18) featured the book industry. Prior to that, human resources, retail, luxury, housing & construction, health, transportation, education, garment industry, consulting, insurance, finance and other sectors were dissected by TheFamily partners and guest speakers. Each time with a larger attendance.One of the founders, Nicolas Colin, recently made headlines when his blog post (fr) denounced the notoriously archaic parisian taxi lobby (see previous Monday Note), triggering a lawsuit from Nicolas Rousselet, the owner of the main French taxi company G7. (Nicolas is the son of Andr\u00e9 Rousselet, himself one of former president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s favorite oligarchs, anointed TV mogul in the late Eighties). By suing the blogger, Rousselet Jr. wanted to shut down any criticism of his company\u2019s unrelenting conservatism. In fact, he completely underestimated the reaction of the French digital multitude that rallied en masse to support the blogger (and the media La Tribune, that republished the infamous post.)This little Gallic tale illustrates the split between the old and the new economy. It could have happened in Brussels, Berlin or San Francisco where lobbies furiously oppose the rise of Disruptors that threaten transportation or short-term rental housing \u2014 among other things.Before we go further, let\u2019s look at the engine of the Disruptors\u2019 phenomenal growth. It can be summed up to one phrase: unprecedented access to capital.When it comes to technology, Uber or Airbnb are not rocket science. The platform and the algorithm needed to efficiently match supply & demand have been indeed brilliantly implemented, but there is no need beyond off-the-shelf technologies to set up the whole thing. By contrast, when Google started in 1998, it did stretch the limits of the technology of the day (networking and computing power); as for Facebook, despite the relative crudeness of the original concept, it had to deal very early with scalability issues. Actually on its very first day, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s hottest girl matching system (how nice) crashed Harvard\u2019s network. No such headache for Uber or Airbnb who rely on proven technologies: cellular network, mapping, databases, LAMP-based softwares. As shown in the following three graphs, funding has been equally abundant for these areas:Not only have investors poured big money in Uber and Airbnb but they did so extremely fast, boosting the valuation of these two companies to staggering levels. Since there is very little technology involved, where did the money go? Mostly to market share acquisitions, the only way to leave the competition in the dust for good. Take Airbnb: in just one year, its number of listed spaces grew more than doubled to 500,000 listings in 33,000 cities and 192 countries. Its $10bn valuation puts it head-to-head with the giant group Accor that operates 3500 brick-and-mortar hotels and 450,000 rooms.In these new models, the American venture capital ecosystem is acting as a weapon of mass domination. When Uber collects more than $300 million in VC money to expand in 100 cities worldwide, its London-based competitor HailO got \u201conly\u201d $77m and when it comes to the French LeCab, it only raised \u20ac11m ($15m). It shows how anemic the French system is when it comes to funding its startups; instead of patting the registered cabs sector in the back with demagogic promises, the successive digital economy ministers would have been better advised to act decisively to stimulate access to capital.Still, the European way of resisting these new models won\u2019t last for long. To be sure, in Brussels, the ill-named \u201cministry of mobility\u201d decided to simply forbid Uber-like system; in France, the resistance is more messy when hundreds of yelling taxi divers blocked main streets and airport accesses. But grass-root movements are likely to morph into a more anglo-saxon-like lobbying, with highly paid professional hired to defend special interests.Consider this: between 1998 and 2013, the amount spent in Washington DC alone by various lobbies has grown x16 in constant dollars to a staggering $3.23bn. Today, tech firms are the fourth contributor after pharmaceuticals, insurance and oil & gas: when a big pharma spend $1.00 to influence lawmakers, tech companies now spend $0.63 and the gap is closing.Why am I mentioning this? It\u2019s because the capital raised by Disruptors will inevitably find its way to effective lobbyism in Brussels (at the European Commission), and eventually in Paris or Berlin.Disruptors\u2019 lobbyists will argue that new urban transportations system and peer-to-peer housing rental do more good than harm in the community. And for the most part, they might be right. Sharing cars in congested cities via system such as RelayRides definitely makes sense from a environment standpoint when any individual car stays idle 95% of the time. A survey conducted by UC Berkeley (pdf here) on a 6,000 San Francisco residents participating on car-sharing system revealed a drop of 50% in the personal car ownership (the auto industry might not like it, but our lungs will.)On the economic side, there is no shortage or arguments either. Terminating the paid-for license system (the so-called Medallion) would free \u20ac3 billion in Paris, and $10 billion in New York, sums now immobilized and promised to an inexorable deflation. In times of raising inequality, maybe it is not such a bad idea to let people make extra money by renting their apartment or their car \u2014 with limitations, of course. To put some figures on the idea: an Airbnb host in San Francisco is making $9,300 per year on average by renting his/er property 58 nights. As for those who makes their personal car available for sharing though RelayRides, they make on average $250 a month.As for the hotel industry, evidence shows Airbnb\u2019s growth to have very little impact. According to the Boston University School of Management, in the state of Texas, a growth of 1% in Airbnb supply translated into only a 0,05% decrease in the revenue of 4,000 hotels surveyed, while a single percentage point of increase in the supply of regular hotels rooms translated into a 0.29% decrease \u2014 20 times more \u2014 in Texas hotel revenues. Of course, cheap hotels are more impacted than the local Hyatt.Between consumers who are voting with their smartphones, enjoying Uber or Airbnb, and the fact that Disruptors are undoubtedly beneficial to the community, regulators and lawmakers will have hard time defending the status quo.In fact, they are left with two levers: making sure that the consumer is properly protected form any abuse (that\u2019s already the case, basically) and dealing smartly with the tax issue. The digital economy has a long track-record of linking success to hubris \u2014 in practical terms, it means a strong disregard for local tax systems. Here in Europe, the first thing Uber and Airbnb did was setting most of their operations in tax-friendly places such as Luxembourg or Ireland \u2014 like Apple or Google before them. On the long run, that\u2019s obviously a mistake as politicians will seize on the opportunity to further single out these new models. In fact, Disruptors would be well-advised to play by the rules in order to insure the sustainability of their services.\u2014 frederic.filloux@mondaynote.com", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "XRP Trading Volume At Bitrue Surpassed Poloniex & Bittrex", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@bitrue/xrp-trading-volume-at-bitrue-surpassed-poloniex-bittrex-f21001155dc3?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bitrue", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bitrue", "publish_date": "2018-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-10", "readtime": "3.76", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "XRP Trading Volume At Bitrue Surpassed Poloniex & BittrexBitrue CEO Curis Wang Shared The Latest Momentum At Block Space Launch PartyBitrueFollowDec 7, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readWednesday, December 5, 2018 4:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M.We are so honored to have had @Ripple @LTCFoundation @500Startups @Quark_Chain @BlockFishIO StarChain Ventures and a lot more joined our Block Space Launch Party, where trends & predictions of 2019 have been shared, endless discussions have been inspired!Bitrue and Block Space have invited some of the greatest minds in the blockchain space to the biggest holiday party at Block Space\u2019s new incubator office in the heart of Silicon Valley on Wednesday, December 5.

Ripple has extensive reserves of XRP cryptocurrency, the sale of which is one of the main sources of its income.According to the publication, in the second quarter of the sale of XRP Ripple managed to gain more than $251 million against $169 in the first quarter. More than $100 million of this number accounted for \u201cinstitutional direct sales,\u201d $144 million for \u201cprogrammatic sales,\u201d that is, sales made by Ripple partners on the basis of global XRP trading volume.Against the background of disturbing cryptocurrency industry reports of massive falsification of trading volumes, Ripple makes the following statement in its latest report:\u201c In Q2 2019, Ripple sold $106.87 million XRP in institutional direct sales and $144.64 million in programmatic sales. In total, the company sold $251.51 million XRP in Q2. Given the reports of inflated volumes, which Ripple took seriously, the company temporarily paused programmatic sales and placed limits on institutional sales to evaluate the problem in early Q2. Ripple later resumed XRP sales at a rate that was 50% lower versus previous guidance, at 10 basis points of CoinMarketCap reported volumes.\u201dIn addition, to establish reliable data on trading volumes, the company began to use the Top Tier tool of the CryptoCompare portal (CCTT), which includes exchanges with high ratings.In the future, Ripple intends to trust only this tool and promises to limit sales.\u201cRipple plans to take a more conservative approach to XRP sales in Q3,\u201d the publication said.Ripple also notes that in the second quarter there was a slight decrease in XRP volatility and a significant drop in correlation with Bitcoin, while the correlation with Ethereum remained.Earlier this month, the company announced that it had spent $500 million on the development of the XRP ecosystem as part of Xpring.Author: Marko Vidrih@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

It\u2019s On Whether Ripple Likes It or NotW12FollowApr 6, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readIt turns out, you can launch crypto tokens on Ripple\u2019s XRP Ledger, and a small group of coders are seeking to be among the first to do it.Stepping back, that might seem strange on multiple levels. For one, there\u2019s XRP Ledger\u2019s association with Ripple, the San Francisco startup that has largely tried to distance itself from cryptocurrency, mostly focusing on offering distributed ledger tech to some of the world\u2019s largest financial firms. Second, there\u2019s the fact that XRP Ledger, while open-source, isn\u2019t exactly known as a platform.But while ethereum has been the go-to blockchain for entrepreneurs that want to launch cryptocurrencies, it turns out that lately, a significant number of token issuers have been looking for alternatives. And for Allvor, a small Brazil-based company focused on streamlining digital payments, the XRP Ledger is proving an attractive option for running what it hopes will be a significant token-based business.And they couldn\u2019t be more excited.\u201cThe XRP Ledger, which is developed by Ripple Company, is the best and most efficient distributed database technology ever made,\u201d according to Allvor\u2019s white paper, which reads more like a fanzine for the technology.According to the company, XRP Ledger\u2019s main selling point is its speed, but there are several other reasons why they think Ripple\u2019s distributed ledger is the perfect place for crypto tokens.Still, Ripple seems less thrilled about the idea. In statements, the company sought to emphasize that by nature it can\u2019t prevent even exotic uses of its technology due to its open, public codebase.According to a Ripple spokesperson:\u201cXRP Ledger is open-source and a decentralized platform, so people can build whatever they want, but Ripple isn\u2019t interested in promoting or supporting ICOs on the ledger.\u201dAnd that unenthused response might lead to issues down the line.An opt-in airdropFor one, Allvor understands that to succeed in its mission of streamlining e-commerce it needs a system that does more than just settle transactions.It\u2019ll need a system that integrates with merchant\u2019s logistics, customer management and marketing software. As such, it\u2019s launching a token called \u201cALV\u201d and building a platform that the token interacts with.\u201cThe ideal would be if a merchant of any size could install the software or plugin that makes the ALV payment feasible within 10 minutes,\u201d said Cleyton Domingues, the co-founder of Allvor and a longtime staffer in Brazil\u2019s economy ministry. \u201cOur challenge will be to develop the software that makes the integration possible.\u201dYet, the company, which doesn\u2019t have investors but instead has bootstrapped the project itself, remains unfazed, primarily because its executive believes XRP Ledger already offers a variety of benefits.For example, Allvor\u2019s white paper says that the ledger\u2019s \u201chybrid payment gateways\u201d technology will allow them to more easily set up a truly global system.And since users of the ledger have to set up \u201ctrust channels\u201d with people they\u2019d like to transact with, users will feel like they have more control over what crypto tokens they receive. This is particularly important since recently both retail and institutional investors have lamented the spammy nature of token airdrops, whereby issuers seed users with tokens merely based on the amount of another token \u2014 like ether \u2014 they have.But Ripple\u2019s system means that users will have to opt-in to receive tokens.Allvor is creating 100 billion ALV tokens \u2014 with 5 percent being sent to current XRP holders (if they opt-in) based on the amount they held as of March 27.Not the firstStill, investors may be wary of entering a market that\u2019s challenging to exit.Despite XRP\u2019s recent surge in popularity (it\u2019s now the third largest by market cap), Ripple executives have struggled to entice major U.S. exchanges, like Coinbase and Gemini, to list its native cryptocurrency, according to Bloomberg.Yet, Jon Holmquist, an industry entrepreneur and founder of the Bitcoin Black Friday movement, said that might not matter since Ripple\u2019s protocol is designed to work as a decentralized exchange of sorts, capable of representing all kinds of assets.And Holmquist should know \u2014 he was actually the first to launch a token on Ripple in June 2017.Through the ICO, Holmquist earned $1,500 in XRP, but after about a month, he decided to refundinvestor\u2019s money to steer clear of the regulatory hammer, following guidance put out by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on The DAO.\u201cI think a lot of ICOs are hesitant to be the first ones,\u201d Holmquist told CoinDesk.That said, he expects more entrepreneurs to see the benefits of the XRP Ledger for token issuance even despite the lukewarm reception the concept has received.And there\u2019s plenty of untapped potential, he said, adding:\u201cI think the Ripple community is very strong. You can tap into the network with investors sitting on XRP and nothing to do with it.\u201dSource", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "W12", "Daico", "ICO"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/first-responders/the-ripple-effect-how-addiction-affects-first-responder-families-cea1542b6973?source=search_post", "author_name": "American Addiction Centers", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@AAC_Tweet", "publish_date": "2016-01-26", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-13", "readtime": "2.64", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "American Addiction CentersFollowJan 26, 2016 \u00b7 3 min readThe Ripple Effect: How Addiction Affects First Responder FamiliesDrug and alcohol abuse and dependence not only significantly impact the individual struggling with the problem but also everyone connected to that person, including coworkers, the people served in the community, and \u2014 most deeply \u2014 family members. Spouses, children, and extended family often try to look the other way when someone they love first develops a problem with drugs or alcohol. They assume that heavy drinking or occasional drug use may be an excusable part of the job or a signifier of a tough day and nothing more.Unfortunately, when chronic alcohol abuse or drug use turns into addiction, it\u2019s a problem that cannot be ignored. Medical and therapeutic intervention and treatment are needed \u2014 and often not just for the person struggling with addiction but for loved ones as well.If you are living with addiction on the job, here\u2019s what you can do for yourself and your family.Get Right with YourselfBefore you can attend to the needs of your family, you must first take care of yourself. Taking a good hard look at how much you are drinking or using drugs, when you are using, and how it impacts your ability to function at work as well as at home with your family can help you to identify the areas that will need attention first. When you begin the process of getting treatment for drug and alcohol addiction, you can then be available to reconnect with your family.Strengthen the MarriageYou and your spouse are the foundation of your family. In relationships where one party is struggling with addiction, the sober spouse is left to manage the house, the kids, and all the responsibilities. Often, the supporting spouse\u2019s own mental and emotional wellbeing is what falls through the cracks. There may be untreated physical health issues, difficulties with depression and/or anxiety, financial difficulty, career roadblocks, and more \u2014 all of which the sober spouse is contending with alone. In addition to all this, spouses of first responders in this situation must also deal with concerns about addiction and the hardships their spouses face on the job every day.There are various ways to begin to strengthen and rebuild a primary relationship after addiction. You can:Attend couples therapy sessionsEncourage your spouse to attend 12-Step meetings for family members of people living with addictionEncourage your spouse to get treatment for any personal addiction or substance abuse issuesEncourage your spouse to enroll in private therapy sessionsAllow your spouse to take part in other parts of addiction treatment to increase understanding of the addiction disorder and how treatment worksConnecting with the KidsIn some ways, reconnecting with your children after addiction is far more difficult than attempting to rebuild any other relationship after addiction \u2014 and in other ways, it is far easier. The guilt you feel over mistakes you made while under the influence or while prioritizing your addiction can be formidable when it comes to your kids. But remember, they are resilient and forgiving, and they love you unconditionally. Consistency in your effort to spend time with them, listen to them, and be there for them now won\u2019t erase the past, but it will demonstrate how much you love them and the kind of adult they can grow up to be.Making a Commitment to RecoveryThe road to recovery is long, and it can take work to rebuild your relationships with your family members as you work on yourself. But it\u2019s work that is worth it and that can pay off for a lifetime. Don\u2019t wait to get started, and stick with it even when it gets hard.This article was originally published by James E.

Youth Radio Atlanta\u2019s Jenn Steckl offers her thoughts on how the cheating and its aftermath hurt every student in the system.I consider myself lucky. I\u2019m an Atlanta Public School student, but I didn\u2019t go to one of the schools where a teacher erased student test responses and filled in correct ones.I also consider myself unlucky. I\u2019ve watched the headlines about my district\u2019s cheating scandal for most of my time in high school. And those headlines hurt me.As a graduating senior from a tarnished school system, I have to worry every time I apply to a college. My peers and I now have to hope the schools don\u2019t associate the scandal with us. It\u2019s a burden that the guiltless don\u2019t deserve.You may think my generation isn\u2019t up to date with what is happening locally and nationally in the news, but we talk about the cheating story. \u2026 a lot.The investigation has gone on for so long that now it is a normal topic of conversation. The scandal is part of our daily reality.Grady High School, Atlanta (Wikimedia Commons)Last spring, I made a discovery. Letters submitted to the court by teachers. They were included in one of the many news stories I read.One teacher apologized for failing to exemplify the characteristics that he tried to instill in his students. Others pushed the blame away, saying that pressure from superiors clouded their judgment. When I first read these letters, I thought of them as artifacts preserving a historic investigation. But after reading several of them, I was overwhelmed with a sense that something wasn\u2019t right.The students who had their tests altered probably never saw these letters. Most of my peers don\u2019t even know they exist. The students who suffered through the district\u2019s cheating are the ones who need to hear these personal apologies and explanations the most.So what does the cheating scandal mean for all of us? Now we have to work twice as hard. Getting good grades isn\u2019t considered a reward in itself anymore because those grades come from a school system of perceived cheaters. Our offenses are national news. And they\u2019ve become the butt of jokes on late-night talk shows. But it\u2019s no joke for students who have to overcome the perception of a morally bankrupt school system\u2026students who have to rebuild the nation\u2019s trust of the district and its teachers.Jenn Steckl is a senior at Grady High SchoolOriginally published at youthradio.org.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Ripple White Paper \u2014 XRP to Become MORE Decentralized than BTC or ETH!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/ripple-white-paper-xrp-to-become-more-decentralized-than-btc-or-eth-bb2e48c4e4f5?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-02-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.30", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Ripple White Paper \u2014 XRP to Become MORE Decentralized than BTC or ETH!John SaddingtonFollowFeb 23, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readIs Ripple going legit with a truly decentralized framework?Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Xrp", "Ripple", "Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Ripple Asks for MORE Regulation in UK \u2014 The Master Plan is Unfolding\u2026", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/ripple-asks-for-more-regulation-in-uk-the-master-plan-is-unfolding-91b2b338d3ba?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-04-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 5, "voters": 1, "content": "Ripple Asks for MORE Regulation in UK \u2014 The Master Plan is Unfolding\u2026John SaddingtonFollowApr 17, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readRipple wants more regulation\u2026 because it\u2019s cool now?Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Ripple"]}, {"title": "XRP \u2014 The Ethereum Killer \u2014 Launch Your Next ICO on XRP!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/xrp-the-ethereum-killer-launch-your-next-ico-on-xrp-524a2274ba74?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.30", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "XRP \u2014 The Ethereum Killer \u2014 Launch Your Next ICO on XRP!John SaddingtonFollowApr 30, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readXRP is going to put Ethereum to rest?

She wanted to avoid talking to people. Over time, she got more comfortable and learned to network, communicate and grow her leadership skills from fellow AMA members. Everyone is a leader, she says, but they must learn to see themselves a leader and realize that most career success and opportunity comes from well-developed people skills.Dahl says AMA events have also helped her keep current with industry innovation. Early in her career, an AMA member explained how to craft her first e-newsletter. She has never forgotten that help.Once people know how to communicate and innovate, Dahl says they must make themselves stand out among peers. Many people have the job title \u201cmarketing manager,\u201d but few marketing managers share the same skills. \u201cPeople differentiate themselves through the AMA,\u201d Dahl says. \u201cThey create viability for themselves and opportunity through other members. \u2026 You make a difference. You stand out.\u201dDahl says she started to stand out by writing for the Chicago AMA\u2019s newsletter. People read her column and reached out to her, including an AMA board member who wanted her to speak. She says this is how she started getting speaking gigs, first in Chicago, then New Jersey, then Budapest. Doing little things like writing or speaking builds a name, a personal brand, Dahl says. This creates \u201chow people talk about you when you\u2019re not in the room.\u201dAfter Dahl started writing and speaking, she networked and learned more from other AMA members at events. \u201cI get emotional thinking about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI work hard for the AMA. You work hard for the AMA. Don\u2019t rest on those laurels, but just know that they\u2019re going to come back for you tenfold. You get to build a tribe.\u201dThis tribe creates memories and laughter, but it also builds deep connections, Dahl says. At events like Leadership, Dahl says AMA volunteers meet people who may not be able to hire them today, but may be able to hire them or give them a key introduction to somebody in a few years.\u201cAMA has impacted me every step of the way,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re all 2.5 degrees of separation away from each other. \u2026 Everyone will be able to open a door for you down the line.

I\u2019ve been more and more conscious of this social change which is emphasized by commentators pondering the consequences as entire cities are becoming completely cashless; like Seoul or Sweden. The most obvious impact is that it exacerbates inequality even further. Cash is something that can be used by anyone no matter how rich or poor, technology, on the other hand, excludes. Clearly, the implications of a digital economy vary but its effects on cybercrime, the change in criminal behaviour and therefore the new types of perpetrators are alarming. Our guest author Richard has written about such implications. These to are inextricably linked to the growing class divide and I can see exaggerating it even more. What does this mean for the digital economy and digital companies? It\u2019s likely to pave the way for an alternative to the traditional banking systems, we might see more companies using alternative currencies and technologies in cashless transactions, and as such, I can see blockchain eliminating some of these issues but not all. We still have to find a way to include those less fortunate (providing access to necessary technology) but we will also need to be more creative in protecting all in society from those criminals taking advantage of this shift.\u2019The use of cash has been declining for decades. Increasingly, it\u2019s being replaced by a wide variety of digital payment platforms, everything from debit and credit cards to smartphones and cryptocurrencies. As these payment platforms continue to acquire more market share it\u2019s not far-fetched to imagine a world with no cash whatsoever. Because digitized platforms are secure, traceable, and more efficient, some countries have decided to make a cashless shift the centerpiece of their economic policy, including Sweden and Israel. On the other end of the development spectrum, in countries such as Somaliland, India, and Uruguay, the traditional consumer-based brick and mortar banking system is being supplanted by digital platforms to afford citizens greater access to local and global trade markets ill-served by cash.These changes have had consequences beyond personal finance and commerce. It turns out the transition from cash to digital transactions has played a major \u2014 if perhaps unanticipated \u2014 role in helping to reduce street crime. A significant source of cash in poor, high-crime neighbourhoods traditionally took the form of welfare cheques. The poor, lacking access to banks accounts, had to cash these cheques and carry physical money with them or keep it in their homes. This made them vulnerable to predatory crimes, such as theft and robbery. In a recent study, we found that when the U.S. government decided to replace welfare cheques with debit cards, this led to a 10 percent reduction in street crimes like burglary, theft, and assault. Our hypothesis is that the introduction of debit card systems to disburse benefits decreased the amount of cash available for crime.No one fears the demise of cash more than street criminals. For obvious reasons, they want to avoid electronic payments, which are traceable. Cash, on the other hand, is uniquely liquid, anonymous, and untraceable. In other words, perfect for crime. As one street criminal explained to us: \u201cIf they get rid of cash, there won\u2019t be no way for the non-working man to make a living.\u201dOver the past two decades, much of the world has experienced an unprecedented drop in street crime. Many factors contributed to that drop, but certainly among them was the declining use of cash and the rise of the digital economy. By replacing cash, digital payments reduced opportunities for street crime.All law-abiding citizens, especially those in high-crime areas, would agree that this is a welcome development. The evidence suggests, however, that the decreased use of cash and increased reliance on digital payments has been a double-edged sword. It has served to cut street crime, even as it has helped to make cybercrime possible. In that sense, the rise of the digital economy is changing the nature of crime itself, shifting the balance of criminal opportunities from the street to cyberspace. We see this not only in news reports of ever more spectacular hacks of global corporations, but also in the massive increase in identity theft and online credit card fraud.But the movement away from cash in favour of digital transactions is not only changing the nature of crime. It\u2019s also changing the nature of its victims and offenders. We doubt, for example, that many of those reading this column have been robbed at gun or knifepoint, whereas many of you have had your credit card information stolen.Put differently, the real beneficiaries of the almost universal drop in street crime aren\u2019t you and me, at least not mostly. They\u2019re the residents of the world\u2019s toughest and most tragic neighbourhoods. That\u2019s where most street crime happens. Now, with the increasing dominance of the digital economy, crime victims are starting to look a lot more like us \u2014 and so are the offenders.What is happening to offenders in the face of a rapidly digitizing economy? Street criminals haven\u2019t abandoned robbery, burglary, and theft to take up cybercrime. This is where we see the criminological impact of the so-called digital divide; street criminals are being left behind because they lack the technological skills and access to keep up.As the gap widens between the digital haves and have-nots, we\u2019re creating a modern form of feudalism, where the poor are locked into place not just by a lack of money, but by a lack of access to a new world of technological and financial criminal opportunities. A new breed of cybercriminals is taking their place, and they\u2019re much better off, both financially and technologically. Essentially, crime is a resource, and the rich are in the process of stealing it from the poor.Few will lament the fact that the rise of the digital economy offers few opportunities for street criminals to ply their trade. It is worth pondering, however, what will become of these individuals as cash disappears altogether. A glimpse into that future might be provided by the homeless populations of the world\u2019s urban centres, whose plight can only be exacerbated by the march of technology.The new challenge will be figuring out how to protect ourselves against the emergent threat of cybercrime, where the losses are potentially much greater, more widespread, and perhaps perpetrated by an offender living on another continent. It certainly will require new forms of cooperation between governments and industry, but what those might look like remains very much in flux.One thing is clear. Much like the street criminals they were established to control, local law enforcement agencies too are in danger of being left behind by rise of the digital economy, and the new breed of cybercriminals it has spawned.Originally published at nilehq.com.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Payments", "Digital Economy", "Cashless Society", "Cybercrime", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "MercuryFX Confirms xRapid Trials Successful \u2014 Ripple for President 2018?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/mercuryfx-confirms-xrapid-trials-successful-ripple-for-president-2018-f515f6566b58?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-05-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "MercuryFX Confirms xRapid Trials Successful \u2014 Ripple for President 2018?John SaddingtonFollowMay 2, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readWhat exactly is MercuryFX and will this be huge?Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Mercuryfx", "Ripple"]}, {"title": "Coinbase \u2014 Can Now List Security Tokens \u2014 XRP Next?

It feels like the collective is either screaming with rage, weighed down in despair, or checked out. I stare at my screen and wonder, \u201cWhat should I share? What is truly needed?\u201dI can\u2019t tell you the number of people I\u2019ve talked to recently who have said, \u201cI don\u2019t go on Facebook anymore,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m spending as little time online as possible.\u201d If I didn\u2019t do most of my work online, I\u2019d probably log off too. The collective roar of virtual anger, sadness and despair can feel overwhelming.I think we\u2019re going to see a rise in live events to counter online fatigue, but the web isn\u2019t going anywhere. Whether you share your thoughts online personally, or professionally, I think it\u2019s important for all of us to think about how each word, image, and video we share online has a ripple effect.In my opinion, there are four qualities we need to cultivate in our online communication during these stressful times:Truth. The web has made communication and sharing so easy that many of the rules of good journalism have been thrown out the window (e.g. fact-checking, researching the validity of sources, giving credit to work that is not your own). As we enter into a time when the term \u201calternative facts\u201d has become part of our lexicon, it\u2019s more important than ever to share the truth online. That means everything from making sure quotes are attributed to the right person (even inspiring ones), to not assuming everything you read online is true, to researching and crediting sources, to not painting our lives as being full of unicorns and rainbows.2. Grounded. Information overload + emotional overload = overwhelm and shut down. People need concrete, relevant, accessible, timely information right now (e.g how to cook dinner for your family after working all day, how to manage post-election anxiety, how to start journaling, how to contact your Congressperson, how to cultivate a daily exercise routine, how to be an intersectional activist). So many people are asking, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Help them channel their fear and anxiety into practical actions that will help them feel calm and empowered.3. Uplifting. Just like when you\u2019re carrying a heavy box for a long time, you have to stop and rest once in a while, we need to have breaks from the unrelenting bad news, or we\u2019ll shut down. Reading something funny, hopeful, inspiring, or entertaining can re-energize us. There\u2019s a reason that comedic takes on the news (e.g. The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Full Frontal with Sam Bee, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, SNL\u2019s Weekend Update) are so popular. They allow us to laugh at horrible things. Give your people a reason to feel hope and joy again.4. Safety. There\u2019s sooooooooo much that we need to talk about right now, but we can\u2019t do it if we feel like we\u2019re going to be virtually screamed at when we share our opinion. One of the beauties of social media is that it is social. It can facilitate conversation and sharing. Unfortunately, it can also encourage trolling and verbal abuse. In order to foster online discussions, we need to create safe spaces where people feel comfortable voicing their opinion and sharing their story. One way to do that is to create very clear commenting and discussion guidelines, and to jump in quickly if they aren\u2019t being followed.What do you think of the state of our online conversation at the moment?How has it changed what, or how you communicate online?Photos by me.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Communication", "Blogging", "Social Media", "Civil Discourse"]}, {"title": "Invest in Ripple or XRP? \u2014 Fleetcor Pilots XRP \u2014 #EXPANSION", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/invest-in-ripple-or-xrp-fleetcor-pilots-xrp-expansion-3a2c9e7d3272?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-03-09", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.30", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Invest in Ripple or XRP? \u2014 Fleetcor Pilots XRP \u2014 #EXPANSIONJohn SaddingtonFollowMar 9, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readWait\u2026 should you be investing in Ripple or XRP (or both)?!Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ripple", "Xrp", "Fleetcor", "Blockchain", "Bitcoin"]}, {"title": "Bitcoin No Longer Relevant \u2014 Better Choice is RIPPLE? \u2014 TODAYS FUD!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/bitcoin-no-longer-relevant-better-choice-is-ripple-todays-fud-8c57b63a4152?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-01-04", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.30", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Bitcoin No Longer Relevant \u2014 Better Choice is RIPPLE? \u2014 TODAYS FUD!John SaddingtonFollowJan 4, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readIt\u2019s really hard to ignore Ripple at this point in time guys!Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ripple", "Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "The Ripple Effect: Creating Successful Startups", "post_link": "https://healthtransformer.co/the-ripple-effect-creating-successful-startups-ed08e3b487ed?source=search_post", "author_name": "StartUp Health", "author_link": "https://healthtransformer.co/@startuphealth", "publish_date": "2017-12-06", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-04", "readtime": "1.33", "claps": 51, "voters": 2, "content": "The Ripple Effect: Creating Successful StartupsDoug Galen of RippleWorks on connecting fledgling startups with accomplished entrepreneursStartUp HealthFollowDec 6, 2017 \u00b7 2 min read\u201cRippleWorks is my fifth startup,\u201d said Doug Galen, CEO & Co-founder, RippleWorks. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve learned in all five is if we\u2019re lucky enough to get the product market fit to scaling stage, the number of people that have actually sat in our seat and experienced scaling is [small].In this episode of StartUp Health NOW, Doug Galen chats with Unity Stoakes, president of StartUp Health, at the Health 2.0 2017 Conference in Santa Clara, California.

One could venture that popular categories like comedy, fashion/beauty/lifestyle and pop culture could be among the first verticals launched given how successful they have been categorically across media formats, and in digital.Gilman and Ziemianski are no strangers to the strategy. With a background in traditional entertainment, Gilman was brought on to run digital video for Fremantle Media North America and set up its digital studio, TinyRiot!. Under her tenure, TinyRiot! built and ran food-centric property \u201cMunchies\u201d in partnership with Vice. She also, with Ziemanski, ran and relaunched The Pet Collective, which recently merged with Jukin Media.At Big Frame, Ziemianski led the teams that stood up three vertical brands \u2014 Forefront, an urban brand, Wonderly, targeted at the geeky girls, and Polished, a beauty and fashion brand.\u201cAfter working together at Tiny Riot, we realized that, although we came to the online video business from different disciplines, we shared many of the same creative sensibilities. That struck us as an opportunity to forge a great partnership,\u201d said Gilman.Ripple\u2019s parent company, Red Arrow, has built a solid international business from owning specialized entertainment production companies equipped to produce and distribute linear programming. It currently operates a stable of entertainment production companies in Europe and the US including Mark Burnett\u2019s United Artists Media Groups, but as the market has started leaning more in favor of digital, the company saw a clear need to expand the skillset and expertise there.According to Red Arrow CEO Jan Frouman, the decision to launch Ripple Entertainment is an undertaking with the highest level of internal corporate endorsement. \u201c[Ripple] has been a topic discussed to the highlest levels, even at Prosieben with a real commitment to build this over next few years including investment ambition and investment requirements.\u201dIndustry sources familiar with building and launching standalone brands like this indicate that a single brand launch is roughly a $2\u20135 million commitment over three years, minimum. Realistically, Ripple Entertainment is an endeavor banking in the tens of millions.On the financials, Frouman added: \u201cIt\u2019s a multiyear plan with a significant investment commitment.\u201d This is a startup and a startup has estimated capital that needs to be deployed.

The network focuses on digital payments in any governmental currency like USD or Euro. It works with a number of institutions including UBS, Santander and American Express to apply blockchain technology to payments, making them faster and cheaper.This is what makes Ripple different from Bitcoin; Ripple wants to simplify transactions of existing coins, where Bitcoin wants to have its own coin. Over 100 banks are already part of the Ripple network, with American Express, the Spanish bank BBVA or the France based Cr\u00e9dit Agricole as examples.Over 100 banks are already part of the Ripple network, with American Express, the Spanish bank BBVA or the France based Cr\u00e9dit Agricole as examples. All transactions are logged in a specialized blockchain that gives the necessary transparancy, all this in a timeframe of somewhere between 3 and 5 seconds.The Ripple network has its own digital currency, called XRP. One of the benefits of this currency is that it allows for the cheapest currency conversion possible. For some transfers, USD will be directly converted to Euro, but if this isn\u2019t the most cost-efficient path then the currency conversion can go from USD to Yen to XRP and then finally to Euro.Looking at the reason why the Ripple network is booming, we would have to look at the recent success of Bitcoin, where Ripple rides along the same wave. Apart from that, investors are looking for a cryptocurrency where the \u2018big boom\u2019 still has to happen. So to conclude, the steep increase in value is based on nothing substantial, but the Ripple network is here to stay.Buy, sell and exchange Ripple XRP at https://covex.io/", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ripple", "Ripple Xrp", "Cryptocurrency", "Cryptocurrency Investment"]}, {"title": "XRP Struggling \u2014 Lawsuits to Not Being as Useful as People Think \u2014 Western Union Doesn\u2019t Think So", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/xrp-struggling-lawsuits-to-not-being-as-useful-as-people-think-western-union-doesnt-think-so-76e38557528c?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-07-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.32", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "XRP Struggling \u2014 Lawsuits to Not Being as Useful as People Think \u2014 Western Union Doesn\u2019t Think SoJohn SaddingtonFollowJul 18, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readXRP has a lot of lawsuits and there are more coming!Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Xrp", "Ripple", "Lawsuit", "Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Ripple Tarnishes Reputation by Inviting Bill Clinton to Keynote SWELL Tech Conference!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/ripple-tarnishes-reputation-by-inviting-bill-clinton-to-keynote-swell-tech-conference-448f4d9aa21e?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-08-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.32", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Ripple Tarnishes Reputation by Inviting Bill Clinton to Keynote SWELL Tech Conference!John SaddingtonFollowAug 3, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readRipple decides to get in bed with Bill Clinton\u2026 and the world will never be the same.Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bill Clinton", "Ripple", "Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@CrowdConscious/the-major-difference-between-processing-payments-in-the-usd-and-the-xrp-is-that-we-are-unsure-what-c75ebf042c67?source=search_post", "author_name": "CrowdConscious", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@CrowdConscious", "publish_date": "2018-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-02", "readtime": "0.97", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Very misleading\u2026you are implying that Volume = Value\u2026.they301Stephen CarbaughCrowdConsciousFollowJan 1, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readThe major difference between processing payments in the USD and the XRP is that we are unsure what the market supply for the USD looks like, but have an exact number of XRP that will be put into existence.When you\u2019re looking at the macro picture and big numbers like Visa or Mastercard\u2019s payment processing volume, you need to remember that the value can be transferred FROM the USD to the XRP where it may be retained.Since the USD is so liquid, so utilized, we don\u2019t truly know how many are out there.

I am dedicated to building Dorm Room Fund because I believe deeply that the start-up industry is the best place to work and build a life-long career. Working in startups demands action and teaches you how to maximize your impact by offering no alternative other than failure.Tons of lessons come from this experience, but the most valuable may be the confidence to put your ideas out there. Learning that your ideas deserve a place in this world, must be built and tested and subjected to the judgement of the market takes a ton of courage. Learning to start up is about much more than starting a company. It is about finding your voice.My hope is that Dorm Room Fund helps convince as many students as possible that it is not good enough to work their ass off to graduate and get 1 great job but that they must work their asses off to graduate and go on to create 1000 jobs. In this piece in the Wall Street Journal, Joey Pomerenke described the ripple effect that we can create by getting more students to become entrepreneurs and by helping them do this while they are in school.The Ripple Effect of Entrepreneurial Students. If the key components of an entrepreneurial curriculum in universities come together, outside forces will come into play and drive a series of positive effects. If we can enable stronger entrepreneurial students, we are guaranteed to see a wellspring of external resources and opportunities for these students. Like \u201cDorm Room Fund,\u201d new tools and support will follow the trend of skilled and motivated students.Even if a student isn\u2019t successful in starting a company or \u201cfails\u201d their entrepreneurial program, they will have learned more through independent action in that year or two than they could have learned in any other program. These are the students who will be more desirable to employers through their experience and perspective \u2014 their \u201creal world\u201d knowledge. Entrepreneurship has largely built America. We should be encouraging these people, these mentalities, in our school systems \u2014 but this will only be possible if we can provide the right resources and get out of the way so that students can be entrepreneurial on their own. Instead of perpetuating a system that teaches students how to be job takers, let\u2019s focus on empowering the next generation of job creators.I love the way he describes the impact this ripple effect can have and will liberally borrow his words to describe my mission with Dorm Room Fund.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Finextra: Ripple signs first two US banks", "post_link": "https://blog.faisalkhan.com/finextra-ripple-signs-first-two-us-banks-f8c32289a535?source=search_post", "author_name": "Faisal Khan", "author_link": "https://blog.faisalkhan.com/@faisalk", "publish_date": "2014-09-24", "last_modified_date": "2016-04-20", "readtime": "0.36", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Finextra: Ripple signs first two US banksFaisal KhanFollowSep 24, 2014 \u00b7 1 min readOpen source payments outfit Ripple Labs has snared deals with two US banks who plans to use its real-time settlement protocol for cross-border money transfers.Source: www.finextra.comWell done Ripple!

According to CNBC (and ostensibly confirmed by Kevin himself) the banking institutions include: Standard Chartered, Accenture Ventures, SCB Digital Ventures, the venture arm of Siam Commercial Bank, and Japan\u2019s SBI Holdings.That Ripple is raising is not unheard of \u2014 to date, they\u2019ve raised around $93 million, and continue to try to journey towards profitability. This recent fundraising round is undoubtedly pushed forward on the recent news of the consortium of banks creating their own protocol based on Ripple (which I talked about a couple of weeks ago).UBS, the Swiss bank, pioneered the \u201cutility settlement coin\u201d and has now joined forces with Deutsche Bank,Santander and BNY Mellon \u2014 as well as the broker ICAP \u2014 to pitch the idea to central banks, aiming for its first commercial launch by early 2018.Ripple does contain some interesting properties presently unique to it\u2019s protocol, which are nicely explained on WhatIsRipple.info. The first two things listed there are pretty common to any blockchain-based currency.One of the more interesting principles, though, is the decentralized exchange/transaction facilitation.There are many other payment providers on the Ripple network.Brent is a customer of Justcoin, and his Justcoin balance is stored on the Ripple network alongside the Bitstamp balances of Alice and Bob.Brent also wants to buy from Alice. However, Alice does not accept his Justcoin balance. She does not want to sign up with Justcoin to withdraw her money.Bob does a lot of business with other Justcoin customers, and so he wouldn\u2019t mind a Justcoin balance. Because Bob agreed to this, the network will automatically transfer some of Bob\u2019s Bitstamp balance to Alice, in exchange for an equivalent Justcoin balance from Brent.Bob acted as an intermediary and facilitated a payment between Brent and Alice, and two different payment providers. He can choose to charge a small fee for this service.Because customers from different providers constantly want to send money between each other, there are many people like Bob on the network, and the market will keep the exchange fee low.It\u2019s early days with Ethereum, and this capability could easily be written into an Ethereum token, but currently only exists in Ripple-based blockchains. This another reason why banks are gravitating towards this protocol, since it has the built in functionality of handling the ownership and transfer of multiple financial instruments \u2014 even instruments that have their own blockchains.As I talked about a couple weeks ago, the Ripple protocol isn\u2019t without it\u2019s downsides. Ripple has some fundamental flaws that must be examined and weighed both for the benefit of banks looking to move to this new technology as well as folks looking to innovate on blockchain technology in the crypto-sector. A report commissioned by distributed ledger consulting group R3CEV and authored by bitcoin developer Peter Todd has raised questions about Ripple and it\u2019s ability to withstand the rigorous security demands of high-finance.\u201cRipple still holds the majority of XRP, and it is in their favor for its value to increase,\u201d says the report. \u201cRipple justifies XRP as an \u2018anti-spam mechanism\u2019 to deter transactions\u2026 However, as the volume of transactions increases the server load, transaction speed is slowed while the cost of the transaction and the amount of required XRP continues to increase.\u201dTodd next walks readers through a number of theoretical attacks that could take place against the Ripple protocol, discussing his estimates of the cost, scope, duration and probability of the scenarios.Perhaps the most glaring, Todd\u2019s writing infers, is the damage that could be done due to a \u201csoftware backdoor\u201d, as he finds that Ripple \u201cdoes not provide a secure way to download any of their software\u201d.\u201cThis is a serious omission that has lead to significant monetary losses in the past. Ripple Labs should be following industry best-practice by signing git commits and tags as well as PGP signing their Ubuntu packages,\u201d Todd added.Todd ends by highlighting the potential real-world implications of these attacks in an elaborate scenario involving a dispute between the Russian government and Shell Oil, forecasting how these parties might attempt to achieve their aims through coercion on the network.This is a common flaw in some implementations of cryptos as well \u2014 those looking to launch a new cryptocurrency and looking to avoid being 51% attacked during the nascent moments of the life of the coin may look to private mining or some other form of centralization, but in these cases, they\u2019re creating honeypots for hackers as well as the key thing blockchain technology was designed to mitigate: central points of failure. As we discussed in the Bitfinex post a couple weeks ago, the common key component to every major loss, theft or hack in cryptocurrency history has been central points of failure.My prediction is that this group of banks will move forward with their implementation of Ripple, and see some gains from using this new technology, and likely use it as a stepping stone to more open versions of the technology in the future. As I said, this is technology of particular importance to financial institutions, but it isn\u2019t remarkably complex technology, and could easily be achieved on a more robustly supported blockchain like Ethereum, or even future updates to Bitcoin.The post Ask Doctor Bitcoin: What Makes Ripple a Unique Blockchain Technology? appeared first on Mark \u201cRizzn\u201d Hopkins.via WordPress http://ift.tt/2cGv8iC", "responses": 0, "tags": ["IFTTT", "WordPress"]}, {"title": "Take a Ripple to the Heart", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@YummiDelish/take-a-ripple-to-the-heart-2f79cadf9c64?source=search_post", "author_name": "Yummi Delish a.k.a.

The structure of rosters will look different as players move fluidly back-and-forth between teams. The two-way contracts allow for improved integration between the NBA and their D-League affiliates. But with such a change comes perhaps some unintended consequences.To clarify a few things, each NBA team (including those without D-League affiliates of their own), may sign up to two players to two-way contracts. Players may move freely back and forth between both teams as the two-way players do not count against the 15-man NBA roster.A player may spend a total of 45 days on the NBA roster before a team must provide them with a qualifying offer to keep them on the NBA side. Players with three years or fewer of NBA service may sign a two-way contract. For more details on salary, click here for a breakdown.Reputation To Be BuiltFirst, NBA teams will be navigating uncharted waters with two-way contracts. Speaking to a number of NBA front office people, some suggest two-way deals will be offered nearly immediately after the NBA Draft, while some suggest teams might wait it out through training camp.Whatever the case may be, teams will need to establish credibility with this first year of two-way contracts. Teams may bring two-way players up to NBA rosters for up to 45 days, but there is no guarantee they will do so. The minimum a two-way player can earn is $75,000, while they can cap out at approximately $275,000 if they are on an NBA roster for the maximum allotment.At first teams will be cautious about making sure players don\u2019t use up those days early (unless they have outperformed their deal at which point they will max them out and sign them to a qualifying offer thereafter). With that, teams should take consideration into ensuring a player does see those 45 days on their roster.Obviously a player has to earn it, and should be treated on a case-by-case basis, but if a player has, for example, 22 days left on their deal, teams should call up that player for the remaining 22 days of their deal in order to maximize their salary and reward them for signing a two-way deal.Most of this is done on handshake agreements between teams and agents obviously, but teams who provide players with greater opportunity on the NBA side will definitely see greater attention the following year when teams can offer new two-way deals.Watered Down D-League DraftI\u2019ve written extensively on the draft and its needless length. Each season the D-League seems to acknowledge this by reducing the number of required rounds. Last season, the draft was reduced to six rounds from eight, with only the first four rounds required for draft selection.As reported this past week, the D-League is acknowledging this once more by reducing the draft to four rounds in total according to a league source. Any teams who traded for fifth or sixth round picks will not be compensated for those picks, nor are teams allowed to trade those picks (obviously).Two-way contracts just add another layer to D-League rosters that make the draft value plummet. Add your two-way contracts, plus affiliate players (up to four from NBA training camp), as well as returning players (some teams had five returners this past season) and you are already at 11 players, before the draft even takes place. D-League rosters are allowed a maximum of 12 players, with 10 being active on game day.Thus, it will be even more challenging for players to make a roster outside of the first round of the draft.Add in the fact there will be three new teams added to the D-League next season and a late first-round pick doesn\u2019t hold the same value as it did even two years ago (19 teams took part in the 2015 as opposed to 25 next year).Thus, in the first four rounds you\u2019ll hear 100 names selected with a majority being waived roughly 10 days later at the end of training camp. That isn\u2019t to say gems can\u2019t be found in the draft. Marcus Posley was selected 44th overall by the Skyforce and has been a valuable rotational piece for them this season.Fewer 10-Day Deals?I\u2019ve heard multiple opinions on this concern. Does the addition of two-way contracts negate the need for 10-day contracts? Yes and no.Two-way players don\u2019t count against the NBA roster and thus are 16th and 17th addition for guys who can earn minutes on the NBA side to continue their development. That being said, the two-way contracts are for those on the cusp of the NBA but aren\u2019t quite there yet, thus some D-League seasoning could help them on that path.10-day deals, typically, are for teams looking for someone who can contribute immediately. Whether that\u2019s through a rebuilding process and turn a new leaf over with a roster, or for a team looking to add a piece for a playoff piece. That\u2019s certainly not always the case, but for the most part 10-days are for the immediate future, whereas two-way deals are viewed as the long-term option for teams.Plus, if a team needs a point guard but neither of their two-way players are such, they can add a point guard from the D-League or free agency through a 10-day deal to fill that roster void.The other question becomes, where do all the minutes go? With the addition of the two-way contracts, it\u2019s been predicted the minutes for 10-day deals next season might be cut in half next season as a result of two-way contracts. That remains to be seen, but it would seem reasonable to think teams have a greater investment in two-way players thus giving them limited minutes would take priority over a 10-day deal.Risk/RewardTeams will often subsidize the low D-League salaries with training camp guarantees. Those can range anywhere from $50,000, up to $250,000 (Ben Bentil). That will no longer be the case with two-way contracts as players will only be allowed to receive a maximum $50,000 guarantee per the new NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement. If a player is signed with a greater training camp guarantee, that player is not allowed to sign a two-way deal with that team. That being said, this could work a number of different ways.$50,000 could set the market for some teams across the board for two-way players and affiliates. Teams might be inclined to invite players to camp and offer all $50,000 with the possibility of signing them to a two-way deal based on their camp performance. If a team offers more they can\u2019t do that so it\u2019s possible this is the new market standard for camp players across the board.Obviously for teams like the Nuggets, Wizards, Pelicans, Trail Blazers, and Clippers, that won\u2019t be the case as they won\u2019t have affiliate players to send to their non-existent D-League affiliate, but this could set a trend moving forward. Again, it all depends on when teams wish to unload their two-way deals. Some teams may choose to be forthright and make a move immediately after the draft, while others might wait to see what a player brings to training camp.While a player can earn up to $275,000 on a two-way deal, there is a possibility they could earn more if they seek a D-League buyout and sign overseas. That option won\u2019t be afforded to players on two-way deals, as the NBA team controls their player rights. Players who sign D-League contracts are eligible for player buyouts should an opportunity overseas arise.This begs the question, will players take a deal that limits their potential earnings if they aren\u2019t called up to the NBA roster, or opt to control their own destiny via the D-League with the possibility of signing a 10-day deal or heading overseas? That remains to be seen.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["D League Digest", "Dleague", "Gleague", "Nbadl", "Two Way Contracts"]}, {"title": "Edge Wallet Adds Support for Monero and Ripple/XRP", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@edgewallet/edge-wallet-adds-support-for-monero-and-ripple-xrp-f871fb96b853?source=search_post", "author_name": "Edge", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@edgewallet", "publish_date": "2018-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-10", "readtime": "1.19", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Edge Wallet Adds Support for Monero and Ripple/XRPEdgeFollowJun 21, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readOver the last few releases our developers have been focusing on performance, optimization, and the little details that make the Edge Wallet not only a great multi-asset wallet but an application that feels great to use.Today, we\u2019re excited to our announce our latest release, v1.2.1, which includes support for some exciting additions including but not limited to new assets, in-app buy/sell with debit & credit cards, and advanced features such as private key sweeping!We\u2019ve been listening to our user base and have successfully extended our support for a few more top 20 crypto-assets that many in our community are aware of or have expressed great interest in.

I don\u2019t even remember exactly what we disagreed about, but I definitely remember how much I enjoyed that back and forth with her.Our discussion was so lively that it spilled over into an hour-long conversation after the workshop ended, and sparked a lifelong friendship.A few weeks ago, my partner, Yvette, and I headed down to the Outer Banks of North Carolina to visit and vacation with Rita, who\u2019s now retired.On our second evening with her, we ate at The Tale of the Whale, a restaurant with one of the most spectacular views, and delicious food.Toward the end of our meal, Rita excused herself to use the restroom. When she sat back down, she noticed that her dinner companions were now a strange man, eating dinner with his lovely wife. \u201cOops,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cI must have sat down at the wrong table!\u201dLaughter ensued and Rita quickly made her way back to our table. Moments later the woman joined us at our table, nudged Rita over to make room for herself, and proceeded to laugh hysterically.She returned to her table after a few moments, and we all continued to laugh for the rest of our meal.When the bill came, I heard Rita whisper something to our waitress, who was also their waitress. I wasn\u2019t at all surprised to learn later that she had taken care of their bottle of wine.Emulating RemarkableI keep thinking about Rita\u2019s generous nature, and I\u2019m struck by the ripple effect of knowing her. As a result, I find myself wanting to emulate that level of generosity in my life.It\u2019s left me asking myself a few simple questions, like:What behaviors do I encourage in others by the way I behave?How can I gain that same great feeling afforded by Rita\u2019s way of being?In what ways can I share my resources?Am I generous? How do I know?When am I stingy, and why?How to I spend more time with people who inspire me the way Rita does?Sure, Rita is retired from her leadership role at DuPont, but she\u2019ll never be retired from her leadership role in life.Rather than focusing on how you can get more out of your people, consider helping them discover, grow and share all they have to offer.

Watch his full talk and all of our fireside chats with leading financial services executives, fintech startups, and venture investors here.Since its earliest days, Ripple has been focused on how it can unlock \u201cthe Internet of Value,\u201d according to Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of enterprise blockchain firm Ripple.\u201cWe acknowledge we\u2019re on Mile 1 of a 26 mile race,\u201d stated Garlinghouse while speaking to Fortune\u2019s Jeff Roberts at CB Insights\u2019 annual Future of Fintech conference.Ripple, which offers a blockchain-based cross-border payments solution, is built on top of its associated cryptocurrency XRP.Despite some controversy, XRP is uniquely positioned to solve cross-border payments, according to Garlinghouse, using its product xRapid to fund real-time liquidity.With so called \u201cbridge currency,\u201d Garlinghouse claims \u201cwe can accelerate the engine of commerce on a global basis \u2026 enable payments to move the way information moves today.\u201dHe went on to say that while money transfer giants like Western Union have spent 100 years optimizing their massive treasury operations, Ripple has optimized its product and made it just as efficient within 6 months.While talking about the company\u2019s target market, he mentioned that banks won\u2019t be the company\u2019s first customers. Ripple currently has 6 different pilots with payments providers, but expects 1 bank to use XRP in its payment flow this year.\u201cIt\u2019s faster, it\u2019s cheaper \u2026 and so, why wouldn\u2019t someone use it? \u2026 if banks can use a product like [this] to fund real-time liquidity \u2026 that\u2019s a big shift in a positive way.\u201dWhen challenged about whether Ripple had control over XRP (as the company owns a majority of outstanding XRP), Garlinghouse noted that if Ripple shut down tomorrow, XRP would continue to operate.\u201cXRP is not a security. If Ripple shut down tomorrow, [the] XRP ledger would continue to operate \u2026 if you buy XRP, you\u2019re not buying shares of Ripple.\u201dOn blockchain in general, Garlinghouse noted there\u2019s a lot of misinformation in the market and we\u2019re seeing these \u201cHoly Wars\u201d play out across the space.But, this revolution of blockchain isn\u2019t happening outside of the system. Garlinghouse argued that since the government isn\u2019t going away, banks aren\u2019t going away. Thus, it makes sense to partner with banks and financial institutions.Brad Garlinghouse was one of dozens of speakers we hosted at Future of Fintech.

In more details we will investigate the ways of buying Ripple.5 ways to buy Ripple:How to buy Ripple with USDHow to buy Ripple stockHow to buy Ripple with credit cardsHow to buy Ripple on BinanceHow to buy Ripple with LitecoinLet\u2019s go!How To Buy RippleRipple (XRP) is a digital cryptocurrency that allows you to conduct payments anywhere in the world as fast as possible. The coin was established in 2012. Ripple issuance is not limited and it cannot be mined. Currently, Ripple technologies are being adopted by banks and financial companies for interbank payments. Ripple\u2019s advantages include fast transactions (they take about 4 seconds), while regular bank transfers take up to several days; the possibility of scaling (1500 operations per second are being performed right now, but this parameter can be increased to the amount that the Visa payment system has right now, 50 000) and very low fees. Ripple\u2019s code is open source and published on GitHub and serves as a great example of the blockchain.This article explains how to buy Ripple coins in two ways. The first option is to go on cryptocurrency stock exchanges. You can trade Ripple there for another crypto coin or fiat money. Be mindful as some stock exchanges do not allow you to buy ripple in USA so the best place to buy Ripple for you really depends on your place of residence. Another option is buying Ripple on cryptocurrency exchanges. It is a simple and quick way of obtaining Ripple, however, the stakes might not be great. In both cases, you will need to get a suitable wallet for Ripple.Where To Buy RippleAs mentioned above, there are two simple options to buy Ripple cryptocurrency. To prove a point, let\u2019s take a closer look at them and begin with stock exchanges. As soon as the price and turnover of the cryptocurrency market reached billions in dollars, hundreds of exchanges appeared. There, people can buy ripple cryptocurrency with bank accounts, credit cards and electronic payment systems, trade in various altcoins and turn them into fiat money.Any crypto stock exchange consists of computer hardware base and appropriate software. The software shell signs the user up and creates an account that they replenish with their digital and fiat money, where they withdraw funds from, and where they place to buy and sell orders. Many exchanges provide additional features, like chat, a news feed, course analytics, etc. The hardware is represented by servers on which operations are performed and data about users, their accounts, transactions they carry out are stored.Usually, the signing up process is free and presents no difficulties for the experienced Internet users. You\u2019ll need to enter your name, a password, and most exchanges require an e-mail address. But if you do not want to share your personal info just create a new one. On some exchanges, users are ranked and verification is required to increase the rank. Verification includes sending photos of your documents. You can\u2019t preserve your anonymity in this case but you will have access to more trading operations, ways to deposit and money withdrawal.4 best places to buy Ripple:How To Buy Ripple StockIf your questions are \u201cHow do I buy Ripple stock?\u201d and \u201cWhere do I buy Ripple stock?\u201d consider using Exmo stock exchange platform where to buy Ripple stock you will have to make the least amount of effort. Ripple and other well-known cryptocurrencies are traded there. The launch of the Exmo platform took place in 2012, and in 2014 the number of customers reached 100 thousand. In December 2017, more than 1 million traders from around the world became Exmo\u2019s customers. The trading volume reaches about 10 thousand BTC per day, and according to this number, Exmo is among the world\u2019s top 25 largest cryptocurrency exchanges. However, Exmo is not the best website to buy ripple in USA and you would do much better using Coinbase or Bitstamp if you are looking at the options to buy Ripple cryptocurrency in USA.The guides on how to buy Ripple with Bitstamp and how to buy Ripple with Coinbase are pretty much identical. You will need to sign up, refill your account and place an order to buy Ripple at the desired price. Both platforms have an option to buy a coin quicker but bear in mind that the rate would be worse.How To Buy Ripple With Credit CardIf you are not a fan of the answer that explains how to buy Ripple on Binance and would much rather prefer to buy crypto with credit card without any extra steps you should check out Coinbase.To buy Ripple from Coinbase, you will need to sign up and confirm your identity. Unfortunately, this is a necessary step for a successful exchange. After your account is complete you can connect your credit card or bank account to it and start placing ordered on buying crypto. If all the data is correct, then within 5\u201315 minutes Coinbase will make the transfer of cryptocurrency to your Ripple wallet address.Obviously, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to call Coinbase the best app to buy Ripple (as everyone has different needs and standards) but the advantages of this exchange are prominent and it\u2019s worth checking out.How To Buy Ripple Cryptocurrency With USDSo, if you decide that the time has come to buy some promising Ripple coins then know that the most profitable way is to buy ripple on the cryptocurrency exchange. The exchanges are distinguished by the available currency pairs, commissions for internal operations, as well as for depositing and withdrawing funds from the exchange.Today, Binance is one of the fastest growing trading platforms out there. It provides services for traders from around the world. There is an important piece of information that is crucial for a beginner to know: Ripple cryptocurrency on Binance can only be bought for cryptocurrency. That is, one option is using an online exchanger to exchange fiat currency for Bitcoins, transfer BTC to your account on Binance and exchange them for XRP. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no simpler option of how to buy ripple with USD on Binance. If you are not keen on making so much effort maybe use Binance only if you are interested in how to buy Ripple with Litecoin or some other cryptocurrency.Best Place To Buy RippleIf a person gets a question regarding where to buy Ripple they first remember the stock exchange. This is not surprising, as these platforms offer the best rates and the highest security level.We highly encourage you to make an account on one of the mentioned above websites and confirm it with the maximum amount of personal info that you are comfortable with sharing as the authorized users are provided with more favourable conditions.Originally published at https://changenow.io on May 21, 2019.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ripple", "Cryptocurrency", "Crypto", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Captain Ripple Is Here!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/blockchain-cuties/captain-ripple-is-here-fc61ed0ac439?source=search_post", "author_name": "Blockchain Cuties", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@blockchaincutie", "publish_date": "2019-01-25", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-25", "readtime": "2.50", "claps": 450, "voters": 9, "content": "Captain Ripple Is Here!Blockchain CutiesFollowJan 25 \u00b7 3 min readYesterday Blockchain Cuties Hero Squad got a new awesome member \u2014 Captain Ripple:The sale for this unique limited edition cutie has already started and they are going fast.Unique Cuties - Blockchain CutiesDon't miss your chance to get super rare pets now!

The market capitalization rate fell by 7.1% to $178 billion.Credit: CoinMareketCapThe news background is neutral, so the acceleration of the correction is most likely caused by technical factors \u2014 protective trades worked at key points for a number of traders, which contributed to a sharp decline in most liquid cryptocurrencies.BitcoinBTC was unable to update the maximum of the 24th day and eventually went into the zone of the placed protective orders. There is a sharp increase in volumes on the background of the decline to the blue trend line, which also shifted slightly. In the current situation, the most appropriate solution may again be a decrease in trading activity until the technical picture becomes clearer and new key points are formed. In the case of another decline to the blue line, it may be worthwhile to use the opportunity to open a small long position.EthereumETH chart at the moment testing the support line at $154. Volatility has increased, long shadows form on the candles, which indicates uncertainty among the participants, but it is at such moments that key turning points are usually formed, so we are closely following the dynamics and waiting for the formation of a local trend, within which it will be possible to increase the share in portfolio with the prospect of mid-term position holding.RippleA small position in the XRP is closed by a foot during the breakdown of the support line ($0.317). The chart reached another support a month ago at the level of $0.295 and so far they are consolidating around this price. While the current dynamics does not allow us to make the assumption that the bottom is formed since at the moment there is a weakness. However, in this asset, the dependence on general market sentiment is most noticeable, therefore, scenarios of future movement both up and down are possible. In this regard, we prefer to stand aside until the time of greater certainty.EOSEOS chart did not meet with any support at $4.9, but at the moment it identified a new local level of $4.57. At the current coin, the probability of a decline to $4.4 remains. However, for medium-term traders, the coin still looks promising, so in case of a change in the current trend in the market as a whole and the formation of a local trend in this instrument, there may be good conditions for new purchases.LitecoinLTC chart is below support and moves within a downtrend marked on the price chart with a blue line. In the current situation, there are no other ideas besides just waiting. In the event that chart can break the trend and return above the green line, it will be possible for traders to reconsider their attitude to the coin and only in this case look for points with an optimal ratio of profit for the formation of a share in the portfolio.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

DorseyFollowAug 23 \u00b7 5 min readBy James M. DorseyA podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, and Patreon, Podbean and Castbox.Recent diametrically opposed responses to repression of Muslims by China, India and other Asian countries highlight deep differences among Gulf states that ripple across Asia.The different responses were evident in Gulf reactions to India\u2019s unilateral withdrawal of Kashmir\u2019s autonomy and Qatar\u2019s reversal of its support of China\u2019s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in its troubled, north-western province of Xinjiang.The divergence says much about the almost decade-long fundamentally different approaches by Qatar and its main detractors, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, towards an emerging more illiberal new world order in which minority rights are trampled upon.The UAE and Saudi Arabia lead a more than two-year-long economic and diplomatic boycott of Qatar in a so far-failed attempt to force the Gulf state to alter its policies.The feud and divergence reflect the Gulf states\u2019 different efforts to manoeuvre an environment in which the United States has sent mixed signals about its commitment to Gulf security and China and Russia are seeking to muscle into US dominance of the region.In what was perhaps the most surprising indication of differences in the Gulf, Qatar appeared to reverse its tacit acquiescence in China\u2019s clampdown, involving the incarceration in re-education camps of an estimated one million predominantly Turkic Uyghur Muslims.Qatar did so by withdrawing from a letter it initially signed together with dozens of others countries expressing support for China\u2019s human-rights record despite its clampdown in Xinjiang.In a letter to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Ali Al-Mansouri, Qatar\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, advised the council that \u201ctaking into account our focus on compromise and mediation, we believe that co-authorizing the aforementioned letter would compromise our foreign policy key priorities. In this regard, we wish to maintain a neutral stance and we offer our mediation and facilitation services.\u201dSignatories of the letter included Qatar\u2019s detractors \u2014 Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt \u2014 as well as Kuwait and Oman, who together with the feuding Gulf states are part of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).The withdrawal coincided with a US warning that kowtowing to China\u2019s \u201cdesire to erode US military advantages\u201d in the Middle East by using its \u201ceconomic leverage and coercion\u201d and \u201cintellectual property theft and acquisition\u201d could undermine defence co-operation with the United States.\u201cMany investments are beneficial, but we\u2019re concerned countries\u2019 economic interests may blind them to the negative implications of some Chinese investments, including impact on joint defence co-operation with the United States,\u201d said Michael Mulroy, the US Defence Department\u2019s top official responsible for the Gulf.The Qatari move also came against the backdrop of the Gulf state, home to the largest US base in the region, being the only country and the greater Middle East to host an expansion rather than a reduction of US facilities and forces. Qatar is believed to have funded the expansion to the tune of US$1.8 billion.The United States has withdrawn some of its forces from Syria and is negotiating with the Taliban a US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.Nevertheless, Qatar, an enlightened autocracy that has yet to implement at home what it preaches abroad, was unlikely to reap the full soft power benefits in liberal Western democracies of its withdrawal from the pro-Chinese letter despite Uyghur and human rights activists welcoming its move.It was unclear what prompted the Qatari change of heart that followed an incident last month at Doha\u2019s Hamad International Airport that drove home the limits of China\u2019s ability to flex its financial, economic and political muscles to control the fallout of its clampdown beyond its borders.The limits were evident when Ablikim Yusuf, a 53-year old Uyghur Muslim seeking protection from potential Chinese persecution, landed at the airport. After initially intending to deport Mr. Yusuf to Beijing at China\u2019s request, Qatar reversed course.But rather than granting Mr. Yusuf asylum under its newly adopted asylum law, the Gulf\u2019s first, Qatar gave him the time to seek refuge elsewhere. Even that was in sharp contrast to countries like Egypt and Turkey that have either deported Uyghurs or entertained the possibility.As a result, Qatar\u2019s withdrawal drove one more wedge into the Muslim world\u2019s almost wall-to-wall refusal to criticize China for what amounts to the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history.Turkey, Qatar\u2019s ally in its dispute with Gulf states, as well as the Turkic republics of Central Asia have been walking a tightrope, attempting to balance relations with China and domestic public criticism of Chinese policy in Xinjiang.Kazakhstan this month silenced a detained Kazakh rights activist of Uyghur descent by forcing him to plead guilty to a hate speech charge and abandon his activism and public criticism of China in exchange for securing his freedom.The Qatari withdrawal complicates the Turkish and Central Asian balancing act and strengthens the position of the United States that is locked into multiple trade and other disputes with China.The withdrawal and the US criticism of Chinese policy in Xinjiang put Muslim states, increasingly selective about what Muslim causes they take up, in an awkward position.The UAE, in sharp contrast to Qatar, has not only maintained its support of China, but also, alongside Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, ignored requests for support on Kashmir by Pakistan, their long-standing regional Muslim ally.Adding insult to injury, the three Gulf states are rewarding Indian prime minister Narendra Modi for his undermining of Kashmiri autonomy and imposition of unprecedented, repressive security measures.Mr Modi is scheduled to travel this week to the United Arab Emirates to receive the country\u2019s highest civilian honour and on to Bahrain for the first-ever visit to that country by a sitting Indian prime minister.Meanwhile, Saudi national oil company Aramco announced a US$15 billion investment in an Indian oil company as Mr. Modi was clamping down on Kashmir.For its part, Qatar, has remained largely silent about Kashmir, advising its nationals to leave the region.If the policy divergences in the Gulf say anything, they suggest that differences among the region\u2019s rivals s as well as in in the greater Middle East are likely to deepen rather than subside.A study last year by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace concluded that conflict in the region was fuelled by a \u201cdearth of regional communication channels, dispute resolution mechanisms, and norms for warfare as well as a surplus of arms imports.\u201dThere is little on the horizon to suggest that this state of affairs is about to change any time soon.Dr. James M.

Perhaps the only exception is LTC, which due to growth in recent days has firmly entrenched in 4th place in terms of capitalization. The news background is neutral. Volumes are average. The most active part of market participants is in anticipation of greater certainty.BitcoinBTC once again pushing off support in the $7500 area, broke through the upper resistance of the downward trend line, identified as a layer of the downward trend. Now you should carefully look at which way the exit from the range of $7500- $8050 will occur. In the event that bulls will be able to move the price beyond the upper trend line and gain a foothold there, there will be a good opportunity for a new series of purchases of this coin with relatively low risk.EthereumIn the ETH, the dynamic of the quote for the last days cannot be called technical. After a false breakdown of the upper border, a false breakdown of the lower border of the trading range followed, which is why a conclusion arises about the absence of any pronounced unidirectional interest among the participants. The most likely scenarios do not work, which is why we believe that at the moment it makes sense to take a short pause and pay attention to other, more technical instruments of the cryptocurrency market.RippleIn XRP, chart stuck in the middle of a downward trend line. Despite the report regarding plans for further expansion of the startup, there have been no noticeable changes in the moods of speculators over the past two days, which is why, as we wrote earlier this week, we will make any predictions based on the price dynamics in the support area of \u200b\u200b$0.37. If the market moves up, then in this coin, first of all, it would be advisable to wait for the breakdown of the upper boundary of the downward trend line.EOSEOS chart is still locked in the outset of $6.00\u20136.80, so there is also no significant changes here. Exit above or below the specified level will tell us the most likely direction of travel in the near future. We remain in a waiting position and, in case of a breakdown of the level of $6.8, we will begin to consistently form a long position.LitecoinLTC maintains a leading position in terms of relative price increase since the beginning of the current month. As we mentioned in the last review, there is a large buy opportunity in the coin. For a while, LTC took a short pause, but after that, the purchases continued, which allowed us to ride on another wave of growth from the $120 level, which we identified as the key one. While we are doing everything according to the classics \u2014 we hold the position, purchases of LTC coin continue.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

To date, the capitalization rate is at $285 billion, showing an increase of 8% since Friday.Image credit: CoinMarketCapBasically, the increase in the indicator is due to BTC. In the rest of the coins, the upward movement occurs rather as a movement by inertia behind the leader, however, as we know, the revaluation can occur here at any time.BitcoinThe price for BTC has broken through the level of $9000 and, by inertia, without meeting any resistance, reached the level of $9300. Now, when prices have reached annual highs, from a practical point of view, it is more correct to have patience and hold the position as long as possible. Stop loss can be placed at $8,800, which gives a chance to participate in the next wave of growth, and in the case of a reversal will allow you to save most of the profits.EthereumETH quote is pulled up behind the leader, however, in this case, the dynamics are not of a pronounced nature and the movement occurs in a sawtooth uptrend. So, the purchase from the support line, of course, brought its positive results, but there is no certainty in the continuation of the upward movement in the near future. Resistance at $276. Stop loss placed below the trend line.RippleIn XRP, the technical picture has changed. First of all, it is worth noting the fact that the quote is leaving the down support line. The probability of moving to the $0.475 mark has now increased markedly, but from a technical point of view, it will be difficult to choose the entry point in this phase of the market. Small positions can be opened within the current short-term trend with a stop below the previous local minimum in this trend. At the same time, there are more technical tools on the market for active trade in large volumes. Level $0.47\u20130.48 is key to changing the situation over a longer time interval.EOSEOS broke through the upper resistance of the trading range, but so far there has not been a strong impulse. In the current situation, it may be worth staying in a position with a stop loss below the red line in case quote return to the range. If the scenario is implemented, in which a maximum of $7.16 will be updated, this will serve as a signal to increase the share of the coin in the portfolio.LitecoinLTC chart at the moment punched the trend line, then bounced back. As a result, the trend line is slightly adjusted and, presumably, in this situation, there will be some pause for speculators, so that you can look at what is happening and draw conclusions without emotion from the outside. What is happening in the coin now is not at all like the presence of a pronounced tendency. Buyers who moved prices up in the first half of June changed their trading behavior, so an outside view should help to take a more sober look at the current situation.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

The price again reached the level of the trend line, which should have prompted speculators to decide to restore or increase their positions. The technical picture has a long hold. Stop-loss order, in this case, it is logical to place below the blue line. The increase in volatility is alarming. However, if the chart in the near future holds above the trend line, then the probability of another growth wave remains.EthereumAt ETH, the bulls made an attempt to break through the upper line of the trading range at the level of $233, but they were not able to buy the offer set above this price either the first or the second time. So far, technically, the price continues to move in an uptrend. From the point of view of the ratio of profit, risk and potential of the upcoming movement, it is still more advisable to make purchases if the price manages to gain a foothold above resistance. Then it will be possible to count on momentum with acceleration. Now, the growth potential is small. Probably the right decision would be to wait some more time, remaining in a neutral position.RippleIn the XRP, the bulls were quick to push up prices following the general market trend and break through resistance at $0.325. However, it did not work out to stay there, the chart quickly returned to Monday price and even lower. Such dynamics only confirms that there is no internal strength in the coin now, and all movements are exclusively speculative in nature. It is quite possible that now only in case of price reduction to the area of \u200b\u200b$0.305, where the nearest support takes place, will there be any interest on the part of the participants. From a technical point of view, nothing changes \u2014 the chart is locked in the trading range, and all market activity is concentrated on other market instruments.EOSEOS price once again could not gain a foothold above $4.40. Following market leaders, speculators here also made an attempt to give the price an acceleration, but in fact, there was a false breakdown. This is unpleasant, although slightly sawed off the trading account. It is worth noting that the breakdown was not supported by volumes, which should have alerted the most attentive speculators. But, as always happens in such cases \u2014 there is a strong struggle between the mind and emotions, and sometimes emotions overpower. Now you need to take a break and just watching the dynamics, wait for the formation of a more understandable and clear technical picture.LitecoinThere was a halving in LTC. The event was expected and taken into account in prices, however, speculators at the moment easily pulled out quotations of 10 percent. It is possible that this happened against the backdrop of increased volatility and speculative movements in the market as a whole. Two factors at once simultaneously influenced the dynamics, which caused a sharp, almost instantaneous impulse. One way or another, further growth here did not work either, and by the current moment, the price is again in the region of the blue trend line. The approach of trading from purchases within the current trend is fully justified. Now again there is the opportunity to open a long position with a short stop-loss, per another cycle.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

And while everyone criticises market cap as a metric in abstract, Messari explained what\u2019s wrong with Ripple\u2019s XRP market cap: it\u2019s \u201clikely overstated by $6.1 billion\u201d, or 46% of its current value. Don\u2019t miss the next episode!THE RIPPLE EFFECTDrop a pebble in the water: just a splash, and it is gone. Or notIt\u2019s sad when potentially healthy backlash translates into threats \u2014 which Ryan Selkis claims to be receiving from the XRP community. Many argue \u201cthe Ripple leadership team bears some level of responsibility\u201d for that, so it will be interesting to see the outcome of the battle. Meanwhile, even more interesting is to follow Su Zhu\u2019s advice and remember to focus on the wider war \u2014 developing new metrics applicable to all tokens.As Qiao Wang, who also works at Messari, explains, this is a critical problem all across the space. Because \u201cwhen you overestimate the circulating supply, you may underestimate the level of potential selling pressure\u201d. But, in the case of XRP, few are getting the point that the reduction in circulating supply actually means there\u2019s potentially less selling pressure. Anyway, if you still want to look at the charts over the weekend, we recommend following Hsaka\u2019s constant analysis and DonAlt\u2019s support and resistance levels.WHAT YOU CAN\u2019T MISS TODAYDon\u2019t leave for the weekend what you should read today\u25aa Adena Friedman, NASDAQ\u2019s CEO, believes \u201ccryptocurrencies could still be a global currency of the future\u201d. But, before, projects need to be transparent and fair.\u25aa You\u2019ve likely heard about the latest troll attack on Bitcoin by the Bank of International Settlements. If not, Larry Cermak did the best summary of the 31-page report.\u25aa To better understand what a good attack on Bitcoin\u2019s model after miner rewards end, read Matteo Leibowitz excellent analysis of this threat and the road ahead.\u25aa Many believe Bitcoin\u2019s code is resilient. But Galen Moore argues \u201dnot all hacks are technical\u201d and that \u201cthe social layer is key to crypto success\u201d Must-read here.\u25aa This week there were several boring news articles about Seattle and Wall Street-backed crypto investments. But only Jessica Klein managed to make sense of the shenanigans.\u25aa Lastly, everyone is talking about the leaked photos of the new Samsung S10 phone, which shows a cryptocurrency wallet. But all that matters is a Google Pixel wallet.QUOTE OF THE DAYHigh-brow crypto enthusiasts love to shun TA. But the best recognise its value.\u201cIt\u2019s funny (\u201clumbar support\u201d), but I have nothing really to say about it. A lot of people are going to send me this comic, so I might as well tell you now that I have seen it. Also I should say that I have become more sympathetic to technical analysis as I get older. The terminology can be silly, but go read that paper I linked above \u2014 about how people are constantly buying the wrong stock because they can\u2019t keep the tickers straight \u2014 and tell me that a stock chart is a random walk.

Unfortunately, our years on this beautiful planet are limited, but you shouldn\u2019t look at the negative side of such a relatively short life span. Instead, you should look to make the most out of the years you are granted in this life and attempt to create an impactful life through lasting relationships.Remember, life\u2019s experiences are best when they are shared with other people. Let\u2019s learn some strategies that you can use to help you find and create lasting relationships with othersAfter consuming my blog or social content or reading my book, people often ask me, \u201chow do you put the ripple strategies to work for you?\u201dThe answer to that begins with you, my friend.Putting the ripple strategies to work for you is about differentiating yourself in a way that allows people to remember you. People gain some sort of value from you because you are simply you. Whether it\u2019s your enthusiasm, your energy, your positivity, or your approach to problem solving, that is what people truly crave.Also, the ability to have a conversation with people and carry yourself in a manner that sucks people in and makes people show genuine interest in you, is special. Society has become very superficial and most of the conversations that are taking place are very surface level.In this post, I\u2019m going to offer you some strategies that you can start practicing so that you can become a more influential and impactful rippler!Ripple Strategy #1 \u2014 Show Up as Your Authentic Self \u2014 BE YOU!Surprisingly enough, in the age of social media, people aren\u2019t being social. And when they are being social, it seems as if a vast majority of the conversations being had are putting down other people or not accepting others for who they truly are.Because of this, lots of people don\u2019t understand that they are worth anything. Let me just tell you here and now, you are good enough!Screw the people that don\u2019t like you for who you are and don\u2019t support the different approaches that you take towards living your best life. After all, the life that you are currently living is yours, and yours only. No one else has control or can dictate the course of your life but you. So, stop letting the words of other people bring you down. This life is yours to live, so take advantage of it!There are people out there that will rise up and support you for who you are, you just need to make an effort to surround yourself with those kinds of people! Once you begin to find these kinds of people, you will find the results to be very positive and impactful.Ripple Strategy #2 \u2014 Have a Detective MindsetAs a rippler seeking connections, you must be willing to come to a conversation with an inquisitive mindset. Or as I\u2019d like to put it, a detective mindset. You need to be willing to have conversations and ask the right questions.For a manager or leader of a team, these questions can be as simple as:Why are you here? What excites you? Where are you from?Asking such questions show others that you are truly interested in learning more about them and ultimately, connecting with them. When you create opportunities to have authentic conversations, you will get authentic answers in return.If you\u2019re an executive and want to get the most out of your people, you should be curious about those working for you.You need to make time to engage with your people.If you would like to get the most out of them, you must be the top engager within the organization. If you set out to be the top engager, your people will be more inclined to not let you down and do the best work that they can because their leader has made them feel valuable by setting out to connect with them.When you set out to have conversations, you will win the hearts and minds of your people over.Ripple Strategy #3 \u2014 Reveal and Leverage Connection PointsSomething that I strongly believe to be essential and important to any relationship is connection points. Some of your that are reading may be unfamiliar with the term connection points, so allow me to explain.In my eyes, connection points are the bite-sized morsels of information you learn about someone. Perhaps where they are from, a hobby or how committed they are to their family. These unique qualities about someone stand out and make them how they are in your heart and your mind. Leveraging connection points can quickly connect you and bond you to other people in a way that much more powerful than job title, profession or other surface facts about someone.For example, using these little nuggets makes your relationship more memorable leveraging these items to continue your conversations with them can contribute to your relationship in a very positive manner. Things that only you and the other person can relate to which immediately creates a sense of uniqueness in your relationship hopefully for both of you.Connection points can be something as simple as having a similar childhood experience, being from the same state or city, liking the same sports team, having a distinct interest in a hobby like mountain biking or underwater basket weaving (I made that last one up).You get the point.As you can see, I believe strongly in connection points and how powerful they can be to anchor new connections and built sustainable longer-term relationships with the people already know but want to know better.It\u2019s not just about learning things about other people. It\u2019s about creating strong inroads and leveraging connection points to establish a deeper, more meaningful relationship with another human being. It\u2019s about creating that Ripple.Get good at taking notes, capturing information and finding opportunities to reengage people. It tells people that you want them in your life personally or professionally and it shows that that you have genuine interest in their life.Put These Strategies to Work!Using these strategies will help you find a way to make an impact on other people in a positive way \u2014 big or small. It will also develop you into someone unique and worth paying attention to.I would love to hear how these strategies work for you.These strategies certainly have been essential to my personal and professional brand, and I continue to use these strategies on a consistent basis because I have found them to be beneficial and worth using!Ripple On!!!P.S.

Before her time at Ripple, Gilman served as the VP and General Manager at Tiny Riot Studio, a division of Free Mantle Media.Recently, Gilman helped Ripple Entertainment expand its SNARLED brand from a standalone content channel to an all-encompassing network geared towards a female Gen Z audience. In this week\u2019s \u201c5 Questions,\u201d Gilman touches on some of the biggest challenges in expanding SNARLED, and her strategy behind grabbing and retaining an audiences attention.VideoInk: There\u2019s a lot of competition for the hottest commodity \u2014 attention \u2014 what are you doing with Ripple\u2019s brands and entertainment strategy to grab and retain audience attention?Gale Gilman: At SNARLED we are creator and audience driven, which allows us to explore and create content for progressive GenZ females that\u2019s more provocative and meaty, which is what the SNARLED community essentially demands of us. We are able to cover topics like race, relationships, style, beauty, video gaming, gender, politics and everything in between, all through the lens of SNARLED, SNARLED creators and the SNARLED audience.What has been the biggest challenge in expanding SNARLED from a standalone content channel to an all-encompassing network?For SNARLED, growth has not been the challenge; expanding into SLAYTRIX, HissyFit, Colorburn, Saucy and Skinny Dip was (&will be) a natural progression as those verticals were dictated by the interests and demands of our audience and the creativity of SNARLED talent. We know our audience really well, so when it came time to expand, identifying fashion and beauty, gaming, and in the future topics such as food, horror, and arts and culture as the verticals that we\u2019d focus one was seamless. Our biggest challenge has been keeping up with the pace of our growth and publishing content at such a rapid speed and volume that maintains the integrity of the SNARLED brand.What has been the biggest lesson learned in creating a network targeted at Gen-z?Understanding and celebrating that this is a multi-dimensional group of young females! Their interests are constantly changing and it\u2019s extremely important to know and relate to those interests in a genuine way so that SNARLED stays relevant. GenZ women have a unique point of view of the world. But no matter what we talk about, we strive to be inclusive, while retaining a sense of humor whenever possible.We\u2019ve seen a lot of the publishers in video heavily embrace SnapChat, how are you approaching emerging platforms and working with your talent to help them grow audience in those places?Our business model is focused on growing SNARLED as a brand across platforms where our audience engages. We are active on social media channels where discovery and new trends are at the forefront. For content we focused on video, and in terms of scale, for us that\u2019s YouTube and some OTT platforms and partnerships with other digital content companies. When it comes to discovery, for some companies in the space it\u2019s SnapChat, but for SNARLED it\u2019s Instagram.5. What has been the growth area for Ripple?We are growing two key areas at once: video content and audience. We\u2019re building the SNARLED brand by investing in our own original content, series, and shows with the creator community. We are building a strong brand, across YT and now other platforms, that offers a distinct content proposition.

With an almost complete absence of fresh news, volumes fell markedly.

Against the background of low revs, chart approached the lower border of the upward channel. The risk at this point is relatively small, but the growth potential is limited by the movement of 5\u20136 %. For speculators practicing a trend or impulse approach, new trading ideas on the horizon of the next few days are still not visible. In the event of a breakdown of the lower boundary of the channel, we will probably see an increase in volatility. After that, it will become possible to make some forecasts depending on the behavior of the asset price in the area of \u200b\u200btwo-week lows. In the opposite case, the saw-shaped sidewall may last some more time.EthereumFrom a technical point of view, at ETH is also nothing new. The sideways pattern remains, prices at the moment are on the trend line. For traders from the levels of speculators at this point, it is possible to open a small position with minimal risk. It is worth remembering that the potential of the movement is limited. The main trend manifests itself in the form of a saw-shaped sidewall. It is relatively not difficult to open a position, place a protective order and indicate the purpose of the movement. It\u2019s much harder to calculate the trajectory and wait for the result. This is not at all the case when a movement has a pronounced tendency. For this reason, a neutral position in the current environment may still be the most justified.RippleThe price continues to drift in the lateral range. In anticipation of chart going beyond this range, it is advisable to observe the dynamics from the side while being out of position. For traders who use the impulse or trend approaches, a window will open for purchases in the event of a breakdown of resistance at $0.292.EOSA similar situation in EOS \u2014 chart remains in the lateral range of $3.44- $3.78 for almost two weeks, volumes are reduced, the activity of participants has fallen. In this regard, you should wait for the breakdown of the upper border of the trading range and then you can start trading from long. Up to this point, uncertainty is too high.LTCThe sidewall is saved. Range $70- $78. LTC may become interesting to buy, in the case of passing the cost of the upper limit of the trading range. The sidewall has been going on for almost two weeks. It is not possible to see how long it can still last. If we add a little philosophy to our reasoning, we can definitely say the following: the more we expect good opportunities, the less we have to wait for them because sooner or later they will appear. From which it follows that the wait-and-see strategy, in this case, is probably the most convenient for short-term speculators.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

A fantastic campaign out of the US is launching today creating an amazing call to action around gender balance. We\u2019re thrilled to see this taking place, and of course, love the lessons and shared learning about how we can all get behind this campaign.It\u2019s an extremely timely discussion, but Canada\u2019s been leading this conversation for a while. With our Prime Minister\u2019s appointment in 2015 of a gender-balanced cabinet, we\u2019ve seen this issue get important airtime, but we know that other institutions have been working toward this for some time.December 6th Mural \u2014 York U Lassonde School of EngineeringWe\u2019ve been working with the incredible team at the Lassonde School of Engineering, York University, who launched Canada\u2019s first 50:50 challenge for an engineering school. Over the past few months, we\u2019ve been learning about the world of STEM, and getting to understand the experience of women in this industry. For more than 30 years, many in the scientific and tech communities have asked about the lack of women\u2019s involvement. Despite some initial breakthroughs with dedicated programming and resources through the 80s and 90s, progress towards better gender balance has slowed. To overcome this, Lassonde set this ambitious goal to see their faculty, student body and their approach to engineering education transform. We\u2019ve been hanging out at Lassonde to better understand these efforts, and to help them to develop a new strategy to achieving this ambition.York U Lassonde School of EngineeringCan we find a way forward so that women and other underrepresented groups find their ways to opportunities in STEM, to stay within the sector and succeeded at creating new innovations for us all? Follow along as we explore these questions as part of our work to support the Lassonde 50:50 Challenge: Canada\u2019s first engineering gender parity challenge.

The currency (shortened as XRP) has shown an astounding value appreciation over the past year by as much as 4000%. That is $40K for every $1000 that was invested.XRP\u2019s original promise (fast block mining) is exciting and make it a potential alternative to fiat-currencies for daily transactions, but I wouldn\u2019t be so optimistic about its future. Here\u2019s why:1. Ripple is better off with no volatility[embed]https://youtu.be/vsEVF4LV_gI[/embed]As Brad Garlinghouse states in this interview, the goal of Ripple, the company, is to become a professional alternative to SWIFT and other traditional money-transfer services. He believes Bitcoin is not the way banks would go, because, for starters, it can split, plus, it was not created with such professionalism in mind, it is the wild west of cryptocurrencies. So, a cryptocurrency with high volatility is not in Ripple\u2019s best interests. Because if people have expectations that it will go so much up in value, they will not spend, they will hoard, making it impossible to replace fiat-currencies. Hence Ripple decided to lock up $14B in XRP cryptocurrency, rendering itself as a relatively stable resort.2. But the primary XRP exchange is no longer associated with Ripple!Here comes the second piece you should be aware of before buying into XRP. Ripple, the company, and Ripple, the currency are now two different things. While Ripple still develops and maintains the Ripple source code, its primary exchange (where you can actually buy XRP directly with cash or its equivalents) is now part of a smaller company called Gatehub. This decision makes sense for the business. Operating an exchange should be messy. Ripple, still a small operation, needs to focus its limited resources on one thing; and that is, as of today, is to sell its solutions to banks. However, this also means that there is not a single reliable exchange that supports direct fiat-currency to XRP trade as of today.3. XRP is NOT as decentralized[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNXedeCyNg[/embed]Thirdly, XRP, by design, is not as decentralized as Bitcoin. It is very much under the wings of a single company. My experience entertaining it, if you install a node, it will not hold a wallet, but it will just serve to prove transactions. The official wallet clients of Ripple rely on third party full nodes to transact. And as Ripple Chief Technologist David Schwartz explains in the video above, Ripple -the company- has the power to identify each node on the system and can shut them down if they ever feel threatened.4. Goldman Sachs is going with its own.Last but not least, a patent awarded to Goldman Sachs suggests that the company is already considering or working on its own cryptocurrency to facilitate intercontinental transactions. While this is certainly great news for the blockchain industry as a whole as it validates its potential, it may not be the best for Ripple, as it also validates that they will not be able to partner with one of the world\u2019s biggest banks.5. Fast mining? Ethereum already has that!If what makes Ripple a sexy alternative to Bitcoin is its fast mining, then it faces stiff competition. Ethereum, which is already more popular, positioned as the de-facto currency of ICOs, already has quick transactions as short as 15 seconds. Moreover, Ethereum\u2019s liquidity levels are higher, as it is available for direct trade in most popular exchanges.All in all, Ripple as a company may have a future, but would that have any impact to XRP as a currency is another unanswered question one should consider. If one day a credible exchange like Coinbase decides to support Ripple, its value may jump like it did with Ethereum just recently. But we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to happen, or whether that\u2019s what the company wants or would let happen; so it\u2019s full of question marks.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Analysis"]},

received a blockchain patent: what are the implications for Ripple XRPICO & Crypto NewsFollowJul 17, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readBack in February 2018, Western Union confirmed that it was testing the development of Ripple, a company that announced ambitious plans to optimize payment systems. Applications for cooperation with various money transfer services and pilot projects involving xRapid have for some time successfully supported XRP afloat, feeding investors with promises. However, it seems that the testing of Ripple offers did not bring companies satisfaction.In this month Hikmet Ersek, CEO of Western Union reported that displeased at the price consequences of the use of XRP. He expected that introduction of NT would shorten expenses and will promote efficiency. Judging on statements, changes did not happen in the best side.Ripple representatives immediately responded to critical statements from Ersek. Ashish Birla, senior vice president of the company said:\u201cIf they moved the large volumes facilities, maybe, they would get a due effect. But conducting only 10 transactions, there is nothing to be surprised, that no obvious economy is visible. A company accomplishes million of transactions in a month, and I am not surprised, that 10 translations through our decisions did not show staggering results\u201d.Now Western Union gave a patent request on cryptocurrency application. We will mark that neither Ripple nor XRP in her not mentioned. The mutual relations of Western Union and Ripple lasted all the half-year. WU, alike, did certain conclusions decided that did not want to be limited to only one cryptocurrency.Some believe that this is another bad news for Ripple\u2019s cryptocurrency: from the beginning of the year, from time to time, the topic of the overvalued and uselessness of XRP, the insolvency of the asset for investment, emerges from time to time. Optimists also stress on another point: regardless how the situation affects the XRP, payment giants are interested in technology.

Some people love it, others hate it. A core of die-hard crypto believers don\u2019t view it as cryptocurrency at all, seeing it as a centralised protocol that doesn\u2019t use a blockchain and is just another tool to help banks and bankers do what they have always done: siphon money off the rest of us.Ripple launched in 2012 as a B2B solution for financial organisations. Its token, XRP, trades just like other cryptos on most exchanges. Ripple doesn\u2019t exactly use a traditional blockchain: instead it has a distributed consensus ledger that relies on a network of validating servers. It\u2019s not open like the bitcoin blockchain, more \u2018semi-permissioned\u2019, involving gateways and so-called trust lines.The market treated XRP much the same as other cryptos in the bubble at the end of last year. Traders certainly believe Ripple has a future as a payment network between banks. But is it crypto? That depends on your outlook.Ripple is a different model to blockchain. It certainly represents an improvement on existing money transfer protocols, which is why many banks are starting to take an interest (fuelling that speculative demand for XRP). It won\u2019t be for everyone, especially the more libertarian of bitcoin believers. It\u2019s more open than existing banking solutions, but hardly in the same category as popular blockchains.Will it be part of the new financial order?

The immediate goal is in the region of $6800, but given the amplitude dynamics of the pair in recent times, it is highly likely that the movement to this point can be stretched over time.EthereumETH is trying to catch up with the leader, however, while buyers are cautious, as a result, the chart did not manage to overcome the maximum of the current week. As we already wrote in the last review, at such moments it is more correct to redistribute capital in favor of the leaders and carefully observe the dynamics of those who are lagging behind. Such behavior of participants may not necessarily be a signal of weakness, and sometimes even the other way around \u2014 a kind of pent-up demand is being formed, which, as practice shows, can, in turn, provoke a rather sharp reduction in the spread between these two crying coins. One way or another, the immediate goal of $184 remains, but so far there is no good opportunity to open a position with an acceptable profit/risk ratio.RippleThere is still a weakness in XRP. Chart fell to the level of support is are now trying to rebound. Such dynamics are preserved for a decent period of time, and in this coin, we do not take any actions until it becomes obvious that the situation has changed somehow.EOSEOS dynamics is ragged and well reflects the state of investor uncertainty. Spikes in volatility at key points clearly confirm this. While it is impossible to say at the moment who will be stronger \u2014 the bulls or bears, so we remain out of position and wait for any prompts. In the case of going up, things are not as clear as they might seem at first glance since the volatility factor creates market noise, which clearly interferes with making trading decisions.LitecoinChart of LTC at the beginning struck the lower boundary of the converging triangle, after which it simultaneously turned around and went beyond the upper boundary. Such dynamics also reflect the uncertainty among the participants, so before making a decision on the formation of a position in this coin, we consider it important to wait until the moment when volatility decreases and the technical picture becomes more obvious.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

The price is growing in a trend, highs are updated, volumes confirm the direction of movement. In other words, the picture is just like from a textbook on technical analysis. At the moment, the price is already higher than the maximum of 21 June. There is some overbought at the moment, but it is quite possible that this is not a reason to take profits. Partial position unloading can be used within risk and size management systems. The volatility indicators are normal and the correction should not be deep. On the contrary, it is likely that it can be used to increase the position of the most aggressive traders. Stop below the blue line.EthereumETH chart, as it happens recently, is catching up behind the leader. The trend of growth is maintained, but the trend line has to be constantly adjusted, due to the fact that its borders are somewhat blurred. The upper limit of the trading range in the $233 area is almost reached. It is also the goal of the current movement. In terms of the profit/risk ratio, it is probably the most appropriate decision to temporarily take profits in this instrument. In the event of a breakdown of resistance, chances of continued growth will appear. A window will open for new purchases as part of the impulse strategy.RippleThe price of XRP is locked in a range of $0.305- $0.325. There is also an upward movement to the upper limit of the range. The apparent weakness in altcoins persists, therefore, preference within the framework of managing a portfolio of digital assets is given to tools with the most pronounced demand, in particular, BTC and ETH. The signal for starting purchases in XRP can be a breakdown of resistance indicated on the chart with a red line. Up to this point, the risks are too high to consider XRP as an investment item.EOSEOS price still below $4.40, which is indicated by a green line in the chart. According to the current technical situation at the moment, the level of $4.40 is key to the coin in terms of maintaining the current or developing a new trend. While the price fails to consolidate above this level. The expectant position will be the most justified, based on the practical side of the issue regarding the most efficient trading.LTCIn LTC, a security order set at $94.5 triggered. Thus, having saved part of the profit, after which the chart reached the blue line. So far, the price of the pair continues to move within the uptrend. However, the dynamics have changed noticeably, which implies increased caution when making new decisions. As part of the uptrend, you can trade from purchases at the time of approaching quotations to the blue line.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

The capitalization rate from Wednesday rose by 1.2% to $178 billion.BitcoinBTC chart remains within the trading range and, moving in a trend, continue their smooth ascent to resistance around $5,400. Thus, over a longer period of time, the consolidation process has been going on for more than two weeks. As before, we believe that small purchases within a trend can be justified only at points where the risk is minimal, i.e. when approaching chart to the trend line itself. For more aggressive purchases, conditions are still being formed, so this will become possible only if the upper limit of the trading range at the level of $5,400 is broken.EthereumETH after the rebound from the support continued the upward movement. Within the local trend, as well as in BTC, it is possible to make small purchases with a short stop. The likely target is in the resistance area ($184). Over a longer period of time, our view of the technical situation does not change \u2014 the chart line is within a wide trading range with borders of $154- $184.RippleIn XRP, there is a situation of uncertainty about the direction of further movement of quotations. Prices returned above the support line, however, against the background of the dynamics of a number of other cryptocurrencies, this did not happen very confidently. You can see the formation of a local uptrend, so you can try to open reasonable in volume long positions with a small stop if the chart approaches the blue line.EOSEOS, like other cryptocurrency market heavyweights, remains sideways. The chart is moving within the trading range of $4.90- $5.90, which was formed after the rapid growth at the beginning of the month. You can buy in small volumes from the blue line with a stop below the trend line itself, or do nothing and wait for clearer signals in the form of reaching the upper or lower border of the trading range. Due to the fact that at the present time the technical picture of the most liquid instruments is approximately the same, and the dynamics of a single coin, by and large, depending on the overall market dynamics, for short-term speculation everyone chooses his own tools based on personal preferences.LitecoinIn LTC, the strategy does not change \u2014 we remain in a small long, and in the case of a breakdown of the red line, it will be possible to increase the share in the portfolio.

On the 24th of July, it was time again: the XRP Market Report from Q2 for the year 2019 was published.It was mainly about the sales of XRP tokens by Ripple itself, the XRP trading volume and the use of xRapid. Ripple tries to create more transparency in the crypto room with these regular and detailed reports. With this, the company hopes to further increase its confidence in Ripple and XRPRipple will take over $400 million in XRP sales in 2019According to the report, Ripple has raised a total of $251.51 million in Q2 2019 through the sale of XRP. That is about 48.45% more compared to the XRP sales from Q1 2019. Ripple was thus able to generate a total of 420.93 million US dollars from XRP in the first two quarters.In the last 6 months, a total of 6 billion XRP have been issued from the Ripple Escrow. But 4.4 billion of these have returned. The remaining 1.6 billion XRP were sold or used for partnerships. Thus, the number of XRPs in circulation has increased by about 3.88%.Ripple wants to restrict XRP sales and recalculate XRP trading volumeResponding to the community\u2019s concerns over the XRP sales and pricing pressures, Ripple has now responded and plans to restrict XRP sales in the next quarter. The reason for this is not only the concerns of the community but also the recalculation of the daily XRP trading volume.The fake trading volumes on the Exchanges are now also penetrated to Ripple. Since the sales from the Escrow are also dependent on the daily trading volume, they have to be recalculated. This serves as protection so as not to put pressure on the XRP price through their own sales.xRapid transactions increase by 170%Ripple\u2019s XRP Market Report also revealed the current status of xRapid. Based on the information in the report, xRapid transactions increased 170% from Q1 to Q2. In addition, the number of live xRapid partners has increased by 30%. This could have something to do with the xCurrent 4.0 update. This gives the xCurrent partners the opportunity to use xRapid directly. Unfortunately, the report does not provide information about the exact number of XRP transactions via xRapid.Ripple continues to build on XpringRipple also refers to Xpring, the company\u2019s fundraising arm, which \u201caims to help the developer\u2019s open source community by building on the decentralized XRP ledger and use cases for XRP in that ledger.\u201dThis support comes in two ways:1) supporting innovative blockchain projects through partnership and investment; 2) Building the Crypto Infrastructure by contributing to open source crypto protocols such as the XRP Ledger and Interledger projects.In addition, Xpring is building a developer platform to help open source developers to leverage these protocols.Ripple\u2019s positive development could boost the XRP priceThe XRP Market Report clearly shows that Ripple\u2019s upswing in 2019 was strong. However, this positive development could hardly move the XRP course. In the meantime, the XRP price has risen to about $0.40 in the meantime due to several messages but was unable to hold on to it and has since fallen back to around $0.31.The positive development for xRapid is probably the only thing that could somehow move the XRP course upwards. We are all looking forward to the report from Q3 and how it will continue for Ripple and XRP in the coming months. Maybe by this time, the XRP course can start to tighten. The prerequisites for this are at least given.Author: Marko Vidrih@cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

After the breakdown of local support, chart rushed to the area of \u200b\u200bvalues \u200b\u200ba month ago. Volumes are high and sales are much more aggressive than it happens in BTC. The current correction shows in a certain sense the \u201ccleansing\u201d effect of the market, in the sense that after the growth cycle and price reduction occurred, it immediately becomes clear what kind of cryptocurrency investors are really interested in. In this token, also without ideas, it is necessary to wait for the formation of a key point, so that the level from which new market conditions may be formed will become clear.RippleIn XRP, the rate of decline slowed down, and against the background of general market sales, the coin shows relative stability, although at the same time the current price is lower than on Friday. The level of $0.32 has been passed, so the immediate goal of the decline remains in the support area of \u200b\u200b$0.29. While everything is also without ideas and positions in this instrument, there are no fundamental changes, and the technical picture does not dispose of performing active operations.EOSAt EOS, the decline continues. The level of $4.4, which is significant support, is also broken at the moment and now the price is in the value \u200b\u200bof early April. Thus, it can be said that all growth has completely disappeared since April. In the event that the price will not be able to return above the green line in the near future, the likelihood of further decline will increase markedly, which will tell us that there are any active actions in this instrument. Also, if possible, it is better not to take any action until the situation is fully clarified.LitecoinIn LTC, in the context of a decline in the entire market, sales are also observed. After the breakdown on Saturday of the psychologically important mark of $100 per 1 coin, have already lost about 13%. The weakness, not only in LTC but in other altcoins too, is obvious and persists. The immediate support for this decline is around $83. However, taking into account the rate of decline, bears can try to push the price lower and into the region of $75 per LTC.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

So, the situation obviously will not change in the near future, however it also and does not mean that disputes around XRP will dwindle into nothing.In business, real tests of Ripple only ahead.A few months back, Commission the SEC of the USA, maximum gave a hint clear, that it looked after two certain currencies. It was initially set in Commission, that a cryptocurrency asset of Ethereum (ETH) is not a security, though it frequent use and had a lot in common with ICO. If for Ethereum now all more or less was settled well, then remains unknown, whether analogical approach will be applied in relation to XRP. In Commission still did not take away the decision on this question and there are no hints in regard to that, how the fate digital asset of Ripple will develop.In the moment of writing the material, Ripple obviously not in the best position. Against a company a third case is filed already, and, taking into account that all three cases were filed during the last two months, becomes clear that for Ripple there are too much obstacles for the simple decision of situation.So, it becomes firmly established in the third lawsuit, that in Ripple Labs broke the state and federal laws on securities.

From Wednesday, the capitalization indicator added about 3% to $265 billion.Image credit: CoinMarketCapTrading volume is on average. At the same time, there is a demand in a number of coins, and the technical picture at the same time looks quite understandable, which allows us to use the situation to form the long positions.BitcoinBTC went beyond the trading range, breaking through its upper resistance. The price movement occurs within an uptrend and generally looks technically. Now there is an opportunity for a gradual increase in position with the transfer of the foot below the trend line or the level of the previous local minimum. The purpose of the movement is located in the highs of the current year \u2014 $9000.EthereumETH also followed the breakdown of the red line, but now the quote has been corrected again. From a technical point of view, at this point there is a good opportunity to buy, however, since recently in the coin we have already twice witnessed a false breakdown, it\u2019s about the presence of uncertainty among the participants, and therefore, in the size of the position being opened certainly should be considered. Stop loss below the trend line.RippleIn XRP, the situation has remained stable for a long time \u2014 the chart is still in the middle of the downward resistance. Now any active operations in this asset will be associated with a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future price dynamics. To change the technical picture, first of all, the chart needs to exit the downward line.EOSThe chart of EOS is still locked at the outset of $6.00\u20136.80. From a practical point of view, it can be said that now the major market participants are laying the foundation for future growth, i.e. there is a stage of accumulation of a coin. Breaking the boundaries of the trading range will tell speculators the most likely direction of price movement in the near future. In the event of a breakdown of the upper limit of the range, it is worth participating in the growth, so we wait for the moment and closely monitor the dynamics.LitecoinLTC quote approached the uptrend line, which gives a chance to increase the position with a small risk and in case of subsequent growth, to get a good profit, which can fully compensate for all the emotional experiences of the last week related to the appearance of false breakdowns on a number of coins.

The index of the total market capitalization fell to a value of $265 billion. It lost about 1.5% from the level recorded last Friday morning.

At the same time, the amplitude of local cycles increased along with the increased volumes, which may be an indirect sign of the growth of interest in the instrument at this level. Draw conclusions early. Under current conditions, a neutral position probably still has an advantage, as it allows to preserve both capital and health in the \u201csaw-like\u201d market movement. Earn in the last two weeks, probably, it would be possible if you know how to predict the future. Otherwise, it is unlikely that the time spent by the speculator could be adequately compensated by the profit from trading.EthereumETH chart is also stuck on the sidelines. Over the past three trading days, the picture is almost unchanged. The upper limit around $234 serves as a level, the breakdown of which will open a window for trading from purchases as part of a pulsing strategy. A decline to a two-week minimum in the region of $195 may be the beginning of the formation of a double bottom figure on a higher time frame. It will also provide an opportunity to open long positions with an acceptable profit/risk ratio.RippleXRP unexpectedly found local support in the region of $0.30. Such a price is more psychological than technical value, but the factor of the level influence on the decisions of the participants is obvious. The statistical significance of support is declining due to the fact that trade has recently been conducted on small volumes. However, for making trial purchases, to check the strength or weakness of a given cryptocurrency pair, the level can be used. In a longer period of time, there are still no ideas in the coin. In the market, the usual \u201csaw\u201d. The current phase of the movement involves finding the quote in the \u201csleep\u201d mode, in which the participants are minimally active and completely unprincipled. Probably, a neutral position for some time will still look the most correct from the point of view of the final economic sense in any trade.EOSIn the EOS after the breakdown of the level of $4.40, the opposite movement occurred and prices returned to the values \u200b\u200bof the middle of last week. For the time being, speculative positions should be temporarily covered, since the impulse has not received its continuation. This means that buyers act with an eye on general market sentiment, which lately has a rather negative tone. The attempt of the coin to break away from the general movement is fixed, and this information should be kept in mind, it is quite possible that on the next upward wave, it will still be useful to us. Maybe the blue trend line will be adjusted soon. Then on returning price above $4.40, you can once again try to enter a position in a small volume.LTCLTC is again unchanged. The chart is in the middle of the outset $78- $113, so moving in any direction will be quite difficult to use. Considering that when opening a position, the ratio of profit and risk should be at least 1:2, and preferably 1:3, in order for the statistical advantage to being on our side. For this reason, a neutral position and here is most preferable until the formation of a more understandable technical picture.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Volumes have fallen markedly, and the quotes went to the side.Chart credit: CoinMarketCapAlthough the capitalization rate since Friday added 6.2%, this was due to a rebound after the correction at the end of last week.BitcoinIn BTC, the bulls were able to keep the price above the blue line. Trading volumes are still low, so in this phase of the market, most likely, a small long with a stop-loss below the trend line will be the most reasonable position in terms of market speculation. In the case of the breakdown of the blue line, it will be possible to make more accurate conclusions about whether it is time to take a pause and again temporarily step aside. To change the technical picture of the chart, it will now be necessary to break through its 2019 maximum on May 30.EthereumThe dynamics of ETH quote does not have any clear focus and, against the background of low volumes, it seems that market participants took a pause to overestimate the situation, get used to prices and wait for the moment when it will be possible to generate new ideas. As we wrote in the last review, the immediate goal, which is seen in the current situation, is around $230 per 1 ETH, so for now, just watching everything happening from the outside. The situation may change if the price reaches new levels higher than this year maximum of 30 May.RippleA small local uptrend has emerged in XRP. At the weekend, the bulls felt more confident here than in BTC and ETH. However, now we will talk about possible purchases only after the coin quote break through the level of $0.48. For the time being, we simply note the fact that in the short-term period there is a slight change in the mood and views of investors on this coin. About what is behind such changes, it will become clear after some time.EOSEOS showed different dynamics from other liquid coins, having updated the highs since the beginning of the current year after correction.

Like in other coins, here while out of position, we observe the dynamics from the outside, but at the same time, we keep in mind the relative strength of the coin until the recent past.LitecoinLTC quote is in the side with the boundaries of $105- $120. Now the exit from the trading range will be a signal for participants regarding the direction of further movement.

The company itself is building on top of the decentralized XRP network to create applications like xRapid for on-demand liquidity, xCurrent for enterprise payment processing, and xVia for frictionless cross-border payments.Asheesh Birla is the Senior Vice President of Product Management at Ripple. Asheesh sat down with PCMag to talk about the difference between cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, regulation around the world, Ripple\u2019s cross-border payments goals, and the future of decentralized apps.PCMag: Let\u2019s start with the price conversation and get it out of the way. XRP hasn\u2019t been immune to the big swings and market drops the cryptocurrency market has experienced this year after the boom of 2017. XRP and ETH have leapfrogged each other a couple times in recent months as the second-largest cryptocurrency. How big a factor is price of the cryptocurrency to Ripple\u2019s day-to-day operations as a separate company?Asheesh Birla, Ripple Senior VP of Product ManagementAsheesh Birla: Day-to-day, we don\u2019t think about the price. Back in 2013, when most digital assets were nearly worthless, we didn\u2019t really factor price into it. We don\u2019t factor it in all that much right now either; we take a longer-term view of the entire market. I think our founders have done a good job of laying out a vision and making clear that if you\u2019re here for a one- or two-year blip, this is not the place to be. Your [crypto] project has to be tuned into the long-term instead of the day-to-day volatility.This is my third crash now in the crypto-market, and I am not phased by it. The flip side is that sometimes you crash and take out all the folks who are not focused on solving real problems and real use cases. And, I think you are going to see some really interesting companies come out of this next downturn.That\u2019s a sentiment I\u2019ve have heard from a lot of people as I have covered crypto the last couple of years; blockchain companies separating the coin from the technology. I often find the perception of cryptocurrencies as digital stocks to be frustratingly reductive. How much focus do you think should be put on coin price and market cap compared to the actual underlying technology at work and what it\u2019s being used for in the real world?So, at the end of the day, what is going to drive volume and liquidity through a digital app? If you have volume and liquidity, then it remains a prominent digital app. But, it is solving real-world problems. It has to be a product, in Silicon Valley, we call that a 10x better experience, and [if] you can\u2019t deliver a 10x better experience using blockchain, then don\u2019t use blockchain. We\u2019ve seen a lot of products come out of the last few years that are sort of like blockchain tourism. Like, that sounds like a database. That sounds like something you should use Google Sheets for, not a sophisticated decentralized blockchain database. So that\u2019s been the frustrating part. When prices are climbing, people are using it as marketing either to get funding or to get rid of [their coins].People always talk about whether next year\u2019s the year that \u201cblockchain goes mainstream,\u201d but that\u2019s a surface-level cocnversation. What does Ripple see as the most widely deployed blockchain based apps that scale? Meaning blockchain apps that go beyond a database or Google Sheet, as you said, to actually use this decentralized computing model to solve real-world problems.The underpinning of this technology is that without friction, without permission, I can move value from one blockchain to another. Today, if you want to money across borders, you are essentially trusting Citi Bank, JPMorgan, or HSBC. Those three banks control most of the cross-border flow. Either directly or indirectly, you are going to trust those three companies to move money on your behalf and they charge whatever fees they want. If they don\u2019t care about the emerging market or the other firms then expense just goes up and up and up.So what a digital app allows you to do is, instead of trusting those three companies, you can now start moving value internationally using digital assets. That\u2019s what Ripple has with xRapid. Customers tell us that they either have to trust Citibank, where they have to pay an arm and a leg and it takes days, or if I want an instant payment I have to open up a local bank account in my destination for every country. That takes months. Those are my two options in 2018. You can get an Uber to your house in two minutes, but getting money internationally is still a mess.What we\u2019ve done with xRapid is to use a digital asset and this new infrastructure, using digital exchanges like Bittrex and so forth, and convert from US dollars into XRP, move that XRP instantly into let\u2019s say Mexico and then have it traded again for Mexican pesos and paid out. That all happens in minutes, for far cheaper than I can today, and I don\u2019t have to set up accounts in the destination countries.On that subject, Ripple has a really interesting perspective on cross-border payments around the world given all the markets in which you\u2019re operating. What would you say are the countries or markets where you\u2019re seeing the most activit on this front, or citizens in the most dire need of these types of solutions for things like remittances, for instance in Venezuela.Good question; a lot of it is driven by regulation. We are seeing a lot of activity in Southeast Asia, where regulators are realizing that this technology can help boost their economies even further. Just like they did with cell phones and mobile devices, they want to leapfrog the west in terms of modern financial inclusion.There are a couple of trends behind that. One, the regulators are really friendly. Two, these economies\u2019 GDP is growing at 7\u20138 percent a year, and number three, they are going from cash to digital via mobile payment at a crazy clip. So those countries are now saying we\u2019re going build a modern day financial product. We are not going to use the 1950s wire technology or SWIFT technology; we\u2019re going to use blockchain.Regulation is an important point. Beyond whatever government agencies in the US like the SEC are doing, worldwide we\u2019re seeing a lot of countries lay groundwork to open up so-called crypto havens for business and investment. Are there particular markets where you think the regulatory environment and the financial factors are ripe for blockchain-based payments tech to scale really fast in the next year or two?All of that criteria is true of most Southeast Asian countries. Even right now, if you just look at the interest in digital apps that 80 some percent of all trading volume in crypto is coming out of Asia. So there is a lot of consumer interest, there is a lot of regulatory interest, and I think in the last trend is that these countries are growing so fast that going from cash to digital you are seeing all sorts of new tech products come out that are going to be the next generation financial companies in the region.I go to Asia probably twice a year, and every time I go back it\u2019s a different story. The last time I went back there was a vegetable stand owner that didn\u2019t speak English and couldn\u2019t read very well, but accepted payments via a mobile device. Just eight months before that, he said he didn\u2019t have a phone and only accepted cash. It\u2019s changing right before our eyes.How is Ripple this potential payment market of however many billions or trillions of dollars? What are the biggest goals for building financial infrasructure on top of that?The big thing is pushing further into the countries that really matter. Let\u2019s take India, for example. That market is moving so quickly that I not only need to think about the bank that accepts the payment and the regulated financial institution that receives the payment, but I need to be at the next-generation financial institution as well. We want to connect with mobile phones. In the next five years, especially in India, people will access their bank accounts primarily through their phones. The other goal is educating regulators that this is a fundamentally different and better way to move money. Our regulatory team is continuing to build on that progress.Going back to this evolution of blockchain technology in 2019 and beyond, aside from payments, where do you fall on the debate over the types of blockchain apps and distributions that will lead the charge? Public vs. private blockchains, cryptocurrency vs. blockchain apps and services, etc.On digital app part of it, you should think of it like the combustion engine. You really can\u2019t do anything alone with the digital asset. You need to build something around it. You need the rest of the car. Public digital assets like XRP and Bitcoin hold a lot of value, but they\u2019re one piece of the puzzle. What I think Ripple has learned in the past five years is that you have to build around that technology to make it useful.On private blockchains, my opinion is that I just don\u2019t see the point. I think it\u2019s another word ofr a database. If you\u2019re building your entire product on a private blockchain, you\u2019re a great marketing company.Ripple has partnered with a number of banks and financial institutions, like Santander, AMEX, and BBVA among others, but Ripple CTO David Schwartz told Reuters earlier this year that for banks, blockchain-based cross-border payments still aren\u2019t scalable for a number of reasons. How does Ripple straddle that line between working with traditional financial markets while also building these open-source solutions that decentralize what banks have centralized?We decided to work with financial institutions and I think that has paid off, but you also have to think about all the financial requirements and regulations. In 2013 there was that Bitcoin maxim of \u201cwe don\u2019t need any of that. We don\u2019t need government or banks or corporations anymore, just Bitcoin.\u201d That approach doesn\u2019t work. Working with financial institutions and regulators is a longer road, but it\u2019s the right one.Those two ideas don\u2019t always coexist well\u2026to the point where the International Monetary Fund has started talking about governments setting up their own central bank-backed digital currencies.I haven\u2019t read the IMF piece, but I do know a lot of the larger banks have some sort of what I call \u201cblockchain tourism.\u201d There\u2019s always a side team or collection of innovation labs working on a blokchain product. But at the end of the day, even if a country like the United States created a centrally backed coin, the reason Ripple works for cross-border payments is because there is no central bank for the world. It\u2019s unlikely that the US central bank would trust the Argentina central bank. That\u2019s why it\u2019s useful to have a digital asset that both entiities could essentially trust.But for that level of cross-border trust, central banks would have to give up some control.Yes, they would have to be willing\u2026which doesn\u2019t seem likely. All the central banks would have to come together, probably somewhere like Davos. But can you imagine the US government saying \u2018\u201cWait, hold up, my credit is way up here, and you want me to trust the Argentine peso?\u201dOn that subject of connecting the world, I also wanted to talk about some of the social impact initiatives you guys are working on around cross-border payments and remittances. Specifically in serving the under-banked populations of the world, are there particular markets that you guys are focusing on and that need the most help and that Ripple really thinks you can provide some tools to the people there?Mexico is our first xRapid corridor. We\u2019re seeing a lot of traction there because it is an underserved population. In these markets, the larger correspondents don\u2019t want that business anymore. They\u2019re folding and restricting on it so that the largest banks now only take up 8 percent of their market. It\u2019s just too expensive to operate. So I think that is a perfect insertion point for us to come in with something that is far cheaper than anything else they\u2019ve been seeing, that we can get up and running in a couple weeks.Lastly, I want to touch on future trends. What are some of Ripple\u2019s blockchain payment goals on the horizon for 2019? Maybe a partnership with a big e-commerce provider? I would look at a lot of the companies building apps on top of XRP. Ripple is one company with cross-border payments. Coil is another company building on top of the XRP ledger going after micropayments. It\u2019s a technology that goes through the browser and then you go to different websites to automatically pay for streaming content. Omni is another company building on top of the XRP ledger operating to use XRP for renting and storage.Those are both involved with Xpring, a Ripple initiative that will invest in, incubate, acquire, and provide grants to companies and projects using the XRP digital asset and ledger. Early entrepreneurs Xpring is offering support to include Scooter Braun, Stefan Thomas (Coil), and Tom Mcleod (Omni).Read more: \u201cIn Venezuela, Cryptocurrency Is an Oppressor and a Lifeline\u201dOriginally published at www.pcmag.com.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Technology", "Finance", "Money"]}, {"title": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency Review", "post_link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-analysis-btc-eth-xrp-eos-ltc-cryptocurrency-review-7dcba6908da5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2019-05-24", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-24", "readtime": "3.29", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency ReviewMay 24, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN MAGAZINEMarko VidrihFollowMay 24 \u00b7 4 min readThe cryptocurrency market stays stable.

The capitalization rate is $249 billion, which is the same as at the start of this week.Credit: CoinMarketCapBitcoinBTC chart continues to move sideways, while over the past two days there has been an attempt to break the blue trend line down. Such a nature of the movement makes speculators trading in machinery refrain from active actions and remain in a waiting position. While here without ideas, we observe the dynamics from the outside.EthereumA small position in the ETH is closed on the breakdown of the blue trend line. As in the BTC, the market participants had some uncertainty about the immediate prospects of the coin. The blue line is broken, and this is a signal that the upward trend of the last two weeks is broken. However, this does not negate the continuation of growth in a longer period of time after the correction or the outset. The current development of the situation requires a choice in favor of capital preservation, therefore we remain out of position until the formation of new key points on the chart.RippleThe position in the XRP is maintained, but the stop-loss position is already very close \u2014 below the blue trend line. Nothing interesting is noted in this coin, the dynamics of XRP chart completely depends on the mood in BTC and ETH. We will wait for any changes after the current levels have been negotiated, the participants will get used to the prices, and a new wave of growth is outlined in the entire market.EOSIn EOS, an interesting situation develops \u2014 the formation of a downward triangle is traced on the price chart, so it is likely that we will see prices lower than the current ones in the coming days. While the figure is still being formed; To draw more obvious conclusions, it is necessary to wait.LitecoinIn LTC, a small long position, opened by us based on the movement to the level of $96, is closed on the breakdown of the trend line. As in other liquid coins of the market, here at the moment, the positional advantage is more likely on the \u201cbears\u201d side than the \u201cbulls\u201d. Therefore, it is quite possible that in the near future we will see a decrease in price to the blue line. If the situation over the weekend changes dramatically, and we see a chart increase, then a breakout of $96 will be a signal for us to start buying.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Will the events draw investors \u2014 or scare them away?A movie advertising Saudi\u2019s Red Sea project on the sidelines of the three-day Future Investment Initiatives conference at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh last month (AFP)Paul CochraneThursday 9 November 2017 15:28 UTCLess than a week old, Saudi Arabia\u2019s anti-corruption drive has snared dozens of princes, including three of the country\u2019s wealthiest people.The arrests are being portrayed as a clean up of the kingdom\u2019s investment environment to realise economic reforms. Even those fiercely critical of the way it\u2019s been conducted acknowledge the need for a system overhaul.The sweep is also clearly a move by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to consolidate power, leaving some skeptical that corruption is the sole motivator \u2014 if at all.Much of it was to tell the Al Saud family to stay out of government-related business which, in itself, is a very good thing- Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School of EconomicsYet for investors trying to read the signs from the outside, whatever the machinations and motivations behind the arrests, it brings reforms that have been needed for ages.\u201cClearly, the clamp down on corruption is a good thing as the Saudi economy has been hindered by corruption for many decades,\u201d said Jason Tuvey, a Middle East economist at London-based Capital Economics.\u201cFor one, small firms have struggled to compete with large firms that previously had a close relationship with the royal family, but also individuals and businesses had to rely on an army of brokers to cut through bureaucracy.\u201dStill the detention of 11 princes, four ministers and dozens of others on Saturday, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, may have a chilling effect on investment \u2014 both inside and outside the kingdom \u2014 in the near term until there is more clarity over whether the drag net will widen.A Saudi man chats with a robot on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiatives conference held at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh at the end of October (AFP)After all, just days after it served as the site of the kingdom\u2019s \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d, a foreign investment conference, the six-year-old Ritz Carlton essentially became a prison, an overnight conversion that has to have rattled onlooking investors.Likewise, from Twitter to Citigroup to Apple, many of those thought to be detained inside the hotel hold significant stakes in multinational corporations. Questions have even been raised about whether London\u2019s Savoy Hotel, owned by bin Talal, could become Saudi government property.While the ramifications have not yet been significant and have yet to fully unfold, one clear epicentre is Lebanon, which is on edge after Prime Minister Saad Hariri\u2019s resignation from Riyadh on the same day as the arrests, and given the close economic ties between the two countries.Many fingers, many piesSaudi Arabia is desperate to attract investment to diversify its economy away from oil. Vision 2030, the reform programme announced by MbS in June 2016, aims to create 450,000 jobs in the non-governmental sector by 2020, and bolster the private sector\u2019s share of GDP to 60 percent from 40 percent in 2014.The latest sweep of arrests, in addition to solidifying MBS\u2019s control over the kingdom, is also a warning to get in line with the reforms, say observers.\u201cMuch of it was to tell the Al Saud family to stay out of government-related business which, in itself, is a very good thing,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, Associate Professor in Comparative Politics at the London School of Economics. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how much collateral damage there is in terms of capital flight and business confidence.\u201dSo far, although detainees have lost their wealth as shares in their companies have dropped, there has not been a negative impact on the Saudi economy. While the crackdown froze the detainees\u2019 banks accounts, putting $33bn of personal wealth at risk, according to Bloomberg figures, company accountants have not been frozen.Prince Alwaleed bin Talal owns sizeable shares in Newscorp, Twitter and Citigroup via his Kingdom Holdings company (AFP)However, the full extent of these princes\u2019 investments in the Saudi economy is unknown. \u201cI\u2019m sure they have fingers in many pies,\u201d said Tuvey.To maintain investor confidence, Riyadh will have to quickly demonstrate that the arrests will not result in show trials, and is purely about removing the old order that had monopolised the economy.On this front, the kingdom may take lessons from other GCC countries, including the UAE, which have started their own anti-corruption campaigns, said Theodore Karasik, a senior advisor to Gulf State Analytics, a Washington DC-based consultancy.\u201cNow it\u2019s Saudi\u2019s turn. It is meant to send a message to everyone in the kingdom and the region that the new Saudi is anti-corruption and graft, and is seeking to open up to investors in a new and transparent environment,\u201d Karasik said.READ MORE\u25baSaudi Arabia seeks to reassure investors after royal purgeThe Saudis, however, have already taken a different tack: the Emirati campaign was carried out less publicly and over a period of time, not a sudden announcement that rounded up the big shots in a five-star hotel.And it\u2019s the speed and breadth of the clampdown that may deal a short-term blow to the economy as investors are warded off sinking money in an already muted investor climate.\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that investment in Saudi contracted by 16 percent last year,\u201d said Tuvey.\u201cThe last thing they need is political upheaval as they\u2019ve been trying to court foreign investors as part of Vision 2030, but given uncertainty, and reliance on partnerships with those detained, it will probably hold that back as well.\u201dNo international probesGiven the uncertainty surrounding the scale of the anti-corruption probes, international investors may be wary that they, too, will become snared in the sweep. Allegations of bribery to secure contracts in the kingdom go back decades, including British Aerospace (BAE), which was investigated by the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office in the 2000s.But it seems that MbS does not want to go that far.\u201cThe focus is not on bribes paid by international corporations to Saudi ministers or businessmen. I think MbS would be reluctant to snare big international firms in the public domain,\u201d said Tuvey.\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell, but as going after many more non-royal businesspeople would be very costly economically, I\u2019d guess that the main future targets, if any, will be other princes and officials,\u201d said Hertog.Karasik however said he had heard more people will be rounded up for alleged corruption over the next fortnight.Construction companies a key targetSome of the arrests took analysts by surprise, especially those related to media companies, which have traditionally backed the Saudi royal family, like Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, which owns Al Arabiya TV, and bin Talal, who has an 80 percent stake in Rotana.The clampdown on individuals with construction firms, however, was much less shocking. \u201cConstruction companies were inevitable, as in the past have been brought up for claims of over-inflated contracts,\u201d said Tuvey.The biggest firm caught up in the campaign belongs to Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the Saudi Binladin Construction Group, one of the key developers of the holy city of Mecca.But what is notable is that the firm was already in bad economic shape, having lost billions of dollars after not being granted government contracts following a crane crash that killed 107 people in 2015. The company laid off 77,000 foreign workers in 2016.The other firm is Saudi Oger, which was established by Lebanon\u2019s Hariri family and went bust in July. One of the arrested princes, Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd, held a large informal share in the company, according to Hertog. \u201cSaudi Oger was involved in questionable projects under (kings) Fahd and Abdullah,\u201d he said.Ironically, it was Saudi Oger that built the Ritz-Carlton Hotel where the princes are currently detained.A poster of Saad Hariri \u2014 saying \u2018God protect you\u2019 \u2014 seen in the northern city of Tripoli this week (AFP)With Hariri\u2019s resignation hours before the arrests, there has been a great deal of speculation as to whether there is a connection between the resignation and the probes. \u201cIt is hard to know what is going on, but there are rumours that Hariri is caught up in this corruption clampdown,\u201d said Tuvey.On Thursday, a top Lebanese government official told Reuters that many in government believe that the kingdom is holding Hariri against his will.\u201cKeeping Hariri with restricted freedom in Riyadh is an attack on Lebanese sovereignty. Our dignity is his dignity. We will work with (foreign) states to return him to Beirut,\u201d he was quoted as saying.There is further speculation as to whether the clampdown was coordinated between Riyadh and Washington, with Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, having made an unannouncedvisit to the kingdom in October to meet with MbS.Curiously, there are also allegations that some of those arrested, such as bin Talal, were connected to US lobby firm the Podesta Group, whose founder, John Podesta, is the former campaign manager of Hillary Clinton.Bin Talal, who was pro-Clinton, famously made his opposition to Trump\u2019s presidency public on Twitter during the 2016 campaign.\u201cYou are a disgrace not only to the GOP, but to all America,\u201d he tweeted at Trump. \u201cWithdraw from the US presidential race as you will never win.\u201dThe Lebanon connectionAccording to Karasik, the arrests are also connected to the \u201cmixing of moneys between Lebanese and Saudi banks subject to baksheesh(bribes). This is why Hariri resigned, and he\u2019s now helping the Saudis with uncoupling the Lebanese-Saudi banking system to create a new culture around it to go after Hezbollah.\u201dSaudi Arabia is part of the Anti-Terror Quartet (ATQ), which includes the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt. The ATQ has blockaded Qatar for six months over Doha\u2019s alleged funding of terrorism, and is staunchly opposed to Iran and its proxies like Lebanon-based Hezbollah.If even a few billion dollars in deposits were withdrawn, it would affect the economy- Senior manager at a Lebanese bankLebanon\u2019s financial sector is under pressure following the US\u2019 Hezbollah International Finance Prevention Act (HIFPA) of December 2015, with the US considering further additions to the act.If the Saudi probe widens, the risk is that Lebanese banks and construction firms become embroiled. Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia accused Lebanon of declaring war on the kingdom because of Hezbollah\u2019s aggression. If Riyadh follows through with this line, Saudi and other Gulf actors may withdraw money from Lebanese banks.\u201cIf even a few billion dollars in deposits were withdrawn, it would affect the economy,\u201d said a senior manager at a Lebanese bank that wanted anonymity. \u201cThe bigger threat is if the Saudis kick out Lebanese working there, as the Emiratis have done. It would be a major disaster, as a lot of remittances come from the Gulf.\u201dRemittances from the Gulf account for around two-thirds of all inbound payments to Lebanon, according to the Union of Arab Banks, equivalent to nearly 15 percent of Lebanon\u2019s GDP.\u201cThere is a major risk for Lebanon, and we have highlighted the threat that the Gulf could impose sanctions on Lebanon. Lebanon is heavily reliant on deposit flows into its banking system,\u201d said Tuvey.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Saudi Arabia"]}, {"title": "Ripple \u2014 An App For The Olympics \u2014 #WindowsPhone #Android #iOS #Apps #Olympics", "post_link": "https://irelandstechnologyblog.com/ripple-an-app-for-the-olympics-windowsphone-android-ios-apps-olympics-7646587b9fee?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ireland's Technology Blog", "author_link": "https://irelandstechnologyblog.com/@ITB_News", "publish_date": "2012-07-07", "last_modified_date": "2016-12-06", "readtime": "0.38", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Ripple \u2014 An App For The Olympics \u2014 #WindowsPhone #Android #iOS #Apps #OlympicsIreland's Technology BlogFollowJul 7, 2012 \u00b7 1 min read\u201cRipple Sports is an amazing way to experience sports events.

This is the message of David Schwarz, Chief Technology Officer of the company. He answered questions about the company at Quora\u2019s \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session.Schwartz insists that the San Francisco-based company has no control over XRP, making it different from Bitkine in the eyes of the radical Crippure Purists who make up the early Cripp class.He said: \u201cAbsolutely not. XRP Ledger is an open source technology with a solid community of developers, so if Ripple disappears, XRP and XRP Ledger will remain. The XRP project is an independent digital asset and transactions are verified in a fully decentralized way through the consensus process \u2014 meaning that the stakeholders in the network are the ones who collectively manage the transactions and not every physical or legal person\u201dIn the past, many critics have pointed out that XRP is a highly centralized token in the hands of a parent company known as Ripple, which still owns more than 50% of XRP\u2019s total offering. Critics also claim that the coin is not backed by a traditional block but instead uses a method known as \u201cHashTree,\u201d which is patented by Ripple Labs. According to them, Ripple does not differ from the existing financial system.Schwartz explains in detail why XRP is decentralizedRipple and XRP are not the same things. Ripple is a block startup. XRP is his native token and will continue to function even if Ripple Labs are shut down.Owners of XRP do not own shares in Ripple.Ripple is fully decentralized because it has only 7 out of 150 validators that feed XRP block.Schwarz added that they held 54% of XRP to ensure price stability. \u201cIt eliminates any worries that Ripple will flood the market with XRP at once \u2014 which, incidentally, would not be good for us,\u201d he said.The Swiss Stock Exchange adds an XRP Derivative (ETP)According to their official website, Switzerland\u2019s main stock exchange, SIX, today added an RTP (RIP) based exchange-traded product (ETP) on April 2.As reported in March, the stock exchange has already confirmed that it plans to include the product called Amun Ripple (AXRP). Hanni Rashvan, co-founder and CEO of Amun, the AXRP cryptographic developer, claims to be the first such product on the market:We can safely say we expect to release the world\u2019s first XRP ETP over the next two months.In addition, Rashvan also told the media that the company also received the SIX approval to release four more ETPs for other bottles \u2014 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM) and Eos (EOS). In November last year, SIX also added the world\u2019s first ETP to track an index of multiple Cripp assets based on BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH and LTC.In early March, the company also launched ETH ETP, and in February it listed the ETC for tracking the BTC.As noted in December, these developments appear to be part of a wider trend that sees the United States being left behind, where it is crypto-wave ETP compared to Europe.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ripple", "Xrp"]}, {"title": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency Review", "post_link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-analysis-btc-eth-xrp-eos-ltc-cryptocurrency-review-6bb01755cc3a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2019-09-04", "last_modified_date": "2019-09-04", "readtime": "4.99", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency ReviewSeptember 4, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN MAGAZINEMarko VidrihFollowSep 4 \u00b7 5 min readThe cryptocurrency market continues to recover.

As a result, over the past two days of almost recoilless growth, the chart of the coin added about 9%. Due to the high uncertainty and relative strength of Bitcoin, there is a chance of unexpected growth. The closest target is in the highs of July 20 ($10,900), while a protective order is logical to place in the $10.400 price range.EthereumIn ETH, the trend for following movements in BTC remains. There was a breakdown of the level of $174, which was noted as significant for the start of trading from purchases. But such a movement was made possible thanks to positive changes in Bitcoin. An unambiguous choice of strategy, in this case, most likely does not exist. On the one hand, there is a clear weakness and the next wave of decline is highly likely that ETH will again show worse dynamics than the market.In one hand, why to bother with altcoins if there is such a tool as BTC. On the other hand, technical factors favor ETH purchases. In this case, it is advisable to redistribute the limits, while participating in all the signals in the monitored instruments. One or another trading signal should not be missed just because there is no faith in what is displayed on the chart. With a situation can change at any second. Sometimes it happens that as soon as a trader violates his own trading rules, he will immediately skip almost the best opportunity in his life.Discipline, money and risk management \u2014 these are the tools that allow you to survive and make money in any financial market. But understanding this comes with experience. Based on the foregoing, in this case, it would be most correct to have in the portfolio some share of this coin with a stop below the red line, monitor the dynamics and add it with the transfer of the protective order in case of trend development.RippleXRP also show positive dynamics against the backdrop of Bitcoin growth. It is likely that the limit on the instrument should be reduced, but it is necessary to strictly follow your own trading rules. Now there is a trend formation from the level. It means that the probability of growth higher than the likelihood of further decline. Stop loss below the blue line and increase the position at points with an acceptable ratio of profit to risk.EOSIn EOS, it is somewhat difficult to uniquely identify levels and points of trend formation. Due to the period of increased volatility at the end of the last and the beginning of the current week, as well as the presence of long shadows on the chart. There is a trend, so if in the near future chart can gain a foothold above the green line, there will be an opportunity to open a long position.LTCAs expected, the price of the coin went above the breakdown of the upper resistance of the trading range. LTC clearly stands out from other altcoins. At the moment, the chart is near the trend line. There is an opportunity to increase the position and closely monitor the dynamics. Stop loss below the blue line, but taking into account volatility indicators.Author: Marko VidrihCharts via Investing.com powered by TradingView and ICONOMI@cryptomarksThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

This pattern of coin movement is observed after investors dropped crypto throughout the market at the time of accelerating a decline under the influence of emotions. In this regard, volatility indicators at the end of last week increased sharply. From a technical point of view, a rising triangle figure has formed on the chart, so a confident breakdown of the upper resistance will be the first signal to start trading from purchases.EthereumETH has a rather interesting technical picture. A triangle figure acts as a reversal figure, which is not so common. The breakdown of the upper resistance made it possible to make the first test purchase, however, at present, a reversal in the market is still being formed. The potential of this wave is limited by resistance in the region of $204. For those who did not have time to buy, there will still be plenty of opportunities. In the current situation, both the movement to the red line region ($204) and the decrease to the trend line indicated on the chart by the green line are equally probable. In the case of chart approaching the green line, it also makes sense to trade from purchases as part of an emerging uptrend.RippleThere is some kind of animation in XRP. At the level of $0.27 a local resistance was formed, after the breakdown of which a small impulse is observed. If the position has not begun to take shape on the breakdown, then it is definitely not worth rushing now with purchases. So far, we can only draw conclusions that there are positive changes in the dynamics of the coin. We monitor the activity of the participants, and in case of another approach of the chart to the red support line ($0.27), or to the green trend line, it makes sense to open a position on the first part of the limit with a short stop-loss.EOSAgainst the background of a general market rebound, EOS is trying to get out of the trading range upwards. Since the upper limit of the range is not clearly defined, there must be some additional confirmation to identify the reversal, which may appear a bit later. At the moment, there are tools with a more understandable technical picture, so careful monitoring of the dynamics and a wait-and-see strategy still remain relevant.LTCIn LTC, chart went beyond the upper boundary of the downward channel somehow uncertainly. The price continues to move sideways, with borders of $72- $78, so a signal to start trading from purchases in this coin may be a breakdown of the upper limit of the trading range.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Events began to develop in the least likely scenario. The market did not see another update of the lows at this stage. Now the price is moving within the short-term trend. This is not a reason to talk about a complete U-turn. We already saw this behavior last week, only volatility was then slightly higher. It makes sense to closely monitor the dynamics and make transactions from purchases as the trend develops at points with minimal risk and with clear control over the position size. Definitely to say where the price will be in a day or a week, in this case, is very difficult. However, if the bottom is passed, then there is a risk of missing a good opportunity. Stop loss below the blue line.EthereumAt ETH, a sideways pattern formed over the weekend. In almost all instruments, including ETH, participants make certain trading decisions with an eye on the dynamics in BTC. In our case, these statistics are also confirmed, which is why there is no obvious trend in the coin. A neutral position with regular monitoring of participants\u2019 activity is the most profitable strategy at this point in the market. It is possible that only in case of a confident breakdown of the level of $174, a window will open for new purchases for the first part of the limit.RippleXRP chart \u201cstuck\u201d to the level of $0.255. Further dynamics will largely depend on general market sentiment. The fact that there is a large seller in the coin for a long period of time is obvious. However, some time ago, there were still signs of a decrease in pressure on the chart. This phenomenon, one-time, or the seller has completely left, can only be said after some time has passed. As mentioned earlier, the purchase makes sense only in the case of the formation of a reversal pattern or a local trend within the range of $0.255- $0.29. There are currently no such conditions.EOSPeriodic outbursts of volatility in the coin indicate the completely divergent views of the participants regarding its immediate prospects. There is still a small short-term trend. If you can buy with little risk, then the situation can be used. In this case, placing limited orders will help. There is no need to talk about a confident trend, so the position size should take this fact into account. In general, the dynamics of the coin is completely dependent on the dynamics of the market leader represented by BTC.LitecoinTechnically, something similar to a reversal is being formed. Perhaps at $62, the price found support. Therefore, a coin can be represented in a portfolio with a small volume with a short stop. However, there are no vivid signs of personality. Everything will depend on general market sentiment.Author: Marko VidrihCharts via Investing.com powered by TradingView and ICONOMI@cryptomarksThe latest Tweets from @cryptomarks (@VidrihMarko).

Chunka Mui is the managing director of the Devil\u2019s Advocate Group, a consulting team that helps organizations design and stress test their innovation strategies. Mr. Mui published a popular book titled The New Killer Apps.What fascinates me about these scenarios is the sheer breadth and depth of societal impact. In this segment, Chunka Mui does a great job of describing this impact. Here is a seven minute animated version of our discussion that picks up where segment two left off:You can view segment one here.You can view segment two here.Download The PDF Version of the TranscriptBeyond the Driverless CarAn Interview with Chunka MuiTranscriptSEGMENT 3 of 5: The Ripple EffectFrank Diana: So, I want to shift gears. I want to focus on the ripple effects of these future scenarios. Specifically, but maybe more importantly, how the ripple effect starts to more intensely blur the boundaries across these various industries and I find that this autonomous vehicle scenario works extremely well to get leaders to see just how broad and deep the impact clearly is; and so, one of the things that you have done extremely well in your writing is to kind of make that real for leaders. Talk about the various things that the autonomous vehicle will impact and how it does cross industry boundaries, so walk us through some of the industries impacted, examples would be things like municipal revenue streams drying up because traffic accidents or traffic violations don\u2019t occur or parking revenues drying up. Those kinds of things that people don\u2019t normally think about. So, give us an example of some of the breadth and depth of this scenario.Chunka Mui: Sure. If we think about autonomous technology, I think there is a breakpoint if we think about extreme scenarios. There is a breakpoint at whether or not the car is autonomous \u2014 whether or not it requires a driver. That\u2019s the extreme case, so if we have totally driverless cars, consider this possibility \u2014 business models today, automotive business models today are built on individual car ownership. If you did not require a driver in autonomous cars, you could:imagine a driverless taxi service that instead of requiring you to buy a car that came to you and in a few minutes time took you point to point;Then you start imagining that people might take uber-like services, instead of owning a carAnd there has been financial modeling that says that those services could actually operate for about 20% the cost of owning a carSo dramatically less costly because you\u2019ve taken the most expensive element of a car service, the driver, out of the equationOkay, so let\u2019s imagine that scenario:You start having uber-like car services, instead of car ownershipEach year about 500B flow through US car dealersSo, if you started having a shift away from individual car ownership to mobility servicesThat money, that channel gets dramatically impactedNow, people will still buy cars, because services like uber will still be buying cars, but they\u2019ll be buying them as whole fleets, as opposed to individuallyAnd they\u2019ll be buying them from manufacturersSo here\u2019s one technical capability that translates to enormous business model disruption\u00bd trillion dollars a year\u2026Frank Diana: Yep. Great example and what about things like less cars on the road, impact to the environment, fuel efficiencies that come from the ability for driverless cars to drag behind one and other. The need for infrastructure diminishes, because you again have less cars on the road. What about those kinds of things. You get a lot of that happening as well as this scenario plays out. Correct?Chunka Mui: Well, here\u2019s another interesting statistic, in downtown city centers some studies find that as much as 30% of traffic is people driving around looking for parking spots. So, if you have a driverless car that drops you off and then drives away by itself, either to park itself far away in a cheap lot or just go to next passenger, you can dramatically reduce the traffic that\u2019s going around looking for parking spots. And here\u2019s another interesting ripple effect from that. Once you have that, then you start asking yourself \u2014 do I need parking garages? More specifically, do I need expensive parking garages downtown or even if I need parking garages at all, can I move them further away?And suddenly you start thinking well what do you do with all that real estate that\u2019s now devoted to cars? In some ways that\u2019s good because you can repurpose that real estate for other uses. You might turn them in to parks; you might turn them in to commercial areas. But then suddenly, you also have this massive amount of real estate that\u2019s flooding the market which may have dramatic negative effectsSo, as you start thinking about these simple, relatively simple technical capabilities you can imagine the ripple effects on industry is dramatic.Now, one of the things we have to realize is we don\u2019t always understand exactly what\u2019s going to happen.In the sense that, if we make transportation cheaper by 80%, does that mean we have less cars on the road or do we have more cars on the road?We certainly have more efficient use of infrastructure, if we have don\u2019t have any more cars on the road, but we actually may actually have miles traveled go up.Those are the kinds of question you have to think deeply through, if you\u2019re in one of those industries where that\u2019s a critical issue for you.Frank Diana: Yep and to your point there\u2019s no way of knowing exactly how those scenarios play out. To your point on more cars on the road, the fact that young children that can be driven by driverless car and the parents not required or the elderly or disabled start driving again. All those things could actually lead to more cars in the road. Correct?Chunka Mui: Absolutely, absolutely. So that\u2019s, I mean those are both challenges and opportunities. They\u2019re challenges if you sit in an existing industry that\u2019s built upon current assumption. So, for example, $80B a year is spent in the US on collision and auto repair \u2014 well when you start having fewer accidents that\u2019s a bad thing, but if you\u2019re in the business where you might profit from more people moving from the driver\u2019s seat to the passenger\u2019s seat, for example if you sell content or if you\u2019re in commerce that may be a good thing. So, you have to take these developments and follow the trail of effects.Frank Diana: Well, I think in terms of the objective of that question, objective met because clearly we can see how many different industries, and we just touched the tip of the iceberg here, are impacted and how broadly and deeply you need to think about these scenarios if you\u2019re going to be successful navigating them.Well fascinating stuff Chunk and unfortunately, we\u2019re out of time.

Volatility has decreased and, judging by the mood of the participants, the probability of the market moving to new \u201chighs\u201d is increasing.BitcoinThe BTC continues to consolidate around the resistance line, which is a sign of the continued strength of the bulls. Volatility has decreased and the chances of further upward movement increase. On the chart, a figure of an ascending triangle is formed, in case of a breakdown of its upper limit and price movement in the region of $5300, again there will be a good opportunity to open a long position with a short stop.EthereumETH chart returned to the blue line, where, as we noted in the last review, there is a good opportunity to make a first test purchase to check the strength of customers and their confidence in the upcoming growth. Now you can hold the position with the stop below the blue line and carefully monitor the dynamics of the asset. In the case of updating the maximum of the 7th, the share in the portfolio will increase with the transfer of the protective order.RippleXRP also pushed off the uptrend line at first, but ultimately the chart did not hold in the triangle and slipped below the blue line. Trial purchases that we make in such cases, one of their goals have a test of one or another assumption about future dynamics. In this case, the position is covered and we can conclude that now, in order for the market to believe in growth, the coin must be fixed above the resistance line in the region of $0.37. Up to this point, we prefer to stay out of XRP position. However, given that the rate of volatility of the asset\u2019s return relative to the entire market for this instrument is high, we believe that if the entire market grows and the red line breaks through, the momentum may turn out to be fast.EOSEOS chart came close to weekly highs. It is difficult to say whether the triangle will continue to narrow, or we will see a way out of it in the coming hours. To open a position, it is worth waiting for the breakdown and subsequent confirmation in the form of fixing chart above the level of $5.85 for some time, picking up the position gradually. In general, the technical picture for the coin develops favorably. Obviously, there is a purchase even at these levels, so the chances of growth are good.LitecoinLTC came down from the triangle, and therefore the idea of \u200b\u200bforming a pulse is soon canceled, but this does not mean that it is canceled over a longer time interval. In the event that chart still can break through resistance at $96, the impulse is most likely to occur. Now, when the volatility has decreased, and there are signs of the emergence of a local trend, we are again starting to gradually form a long position with a stop below $84.5 per LTC.DISCLAIMER:All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

The current capitalization surpasses $300 billion, which is about 5% higher than the value of the environment.Image credit: CoinMarketCapBTC dominance in the market exceeds the weight of all other cryptocurrencies together and continues to grow. The rests of the coins at the same time trying to catch up with the leader of the inertia, but at the same time, show a more or less coherent dynamics is obtained far from all.BitcoinAt BTC, we once again saw confirmation of an uptrend after chart bounced off the blue line and rushed up, updating a maximum of the 17th. While the long position can still be held, however, it is worth remembering that the psychologically important level of $10,000 for 1 BTC is already very close. The further strategy will depend on how the dynamics develop at this particular point. It is likely that the first time the bulls will be hard to overcome the mark, and we will see some roll backs.EthereumETH broke through the level of $276 upwards, that is why right now there is an opportunity to buy coins for the first part of the limit and then increase the share in the portfolio as the uptrend develops. Despite the fact that growth is not as impressive as at BTC, the volumes on breakdown have increased significantly, so it is possible that market participants will still start buying the second most capitalized asset, which is noticeably behind the leader. At the moment there is a local overbought, after the removal of which there is a high probability of continued growth.RippleIn XRP, the lack of understanding continues. There is a side event, and even the growth of BTC to new highs does not allow the coin to somehow rehabilitate itself in the eyes of short-term speculators. In general, this dynamic is not surprising, since, as we noted in the last review, XRP lags behind the leaders since the beginning of the year, regardless of the market phase, and it is obvious that at present this cryptocurrency tool does not cause any interest among participants. However, it is always worth remembering how quickly reevaluation and access to new levels occur in XRP. It is quite possible that for this reason, it makes sense to place orders to open a position during the breakdown of $0.47 in case the growth of the entire market continues.EOSAt EOS, the trend line did hold, and the price again moved to the resistance area of \u200b\u200b$7.2. Here, everything in the whole strategy is unchanged \u2014 we maintain our position with the prospect of its increase in case of a red line breakdown.LitecoinLTC show slurred dynamics. It is impossible to say unequivocally what happens in a coin. It is possible that after consolidation, the bulls will again attempt to break the maximum of the 12th and this will be a signal to the new series of purchases. In the meantime, there is lateral dynamics and lack of ideas.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

Such dynamics should not come as a surprise. Technically, the level of $12,200 has long been clearly visible on the chart. The bulls failed to pass it last week from the first or second time. We believe that for some time, the chart will remain sideways, so speculative trades in small volumes from the lower border of the trading range are possible. It is always worth remembering the profit-risk ratio and the fact that in the current market situation the growth potential is limited by resistance at the level of $12,200.EthereumETH chart, as expected, over the weekend reached support at $204. At that moment, the bears even made attempts to break through support. However, while demand at this price exceeded supply, as a result of which there is a slight rebound. From a technical point of view, local low is being updated. Until the formation of a reversal pattern, the risk of trading from the long may not be justified. In the current situation, it will take some more time to carefully observe the dynamics of the pair in relation to other market instruments to understand the relative strength of the coin. A neutral position is most preferred at the moment.RippleChart of the XRP, breaking through support, quickly reached the next level in the area of \u200b\u200b$0.293, and then went sideways. If you look at the technical picture over a longer time interval, then, as before, there is nothing interesting here yet. The weakness in the coin is confirmed, as in other altcoins, XRP holders from the beginning of the year have to get nervous much more often than BTC and ETH holders. In the short term, the technical picture is more interesting. If the chart in the near future can stay above the support of $0.293 and show a slight increase, then the price will consolidate above the level of $0.305. At that moment, there will be a chance that trading from purchases can give a positive result. So far, a neutral position and a strategy for observing dynamics from the side are fully justified.EOSThere is no pronounced trend in EOS. It can be noted the formation of a short-term upward trend. However, it is not a fact that trading in it in conditions of general market noise and inaudible dynamics of the entire market will be the right choice of strategy. You need to be patient and wait for the formation of key points. If the negative trend continues, then it is likely to see the price even in the region of $3.6. In the meantime, we simply note the fact that the rebound in the coin after sales is the most technical.LTCLTC chart bounce after a decline. From a technical point of view, the formation of a reversal pattern cannot be noted. Everything looks exactly like a rebound, although a breakdown of the trend line has taken place. It is necessary for some time to carefully monitor how the coin will behave in comparison with other market instruments. There are no signals to open a position. A hint about whether there are large buyers here or is it just a small speculative rebound will come in the coming days.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

While many fans believe that there is hope for a significant increase in XRP in the future, a Twitter user and an XRP supporter, known as \u201cImperator Emhyr,\u201d is of the opinion that XRP can never hit $ 10,000, contrary to what some members of the crypto community say.According to him, XRP can not have a significant price jump, although it can not prove what it says at the moment. He said, \u201c\u2026 I do not believe he will hit 10,000, I think even $ 1,000 is a frivolous assessment. Personally, I see XRP reaching a 3-digit amount, $ 100- $ 300. I can not create facts, because right now is the future and I can not predict it. I\u2019m glad to be rebuked in my allegations, though unlikely. \u201cOther Twitter users agree with it that XRP cannot reach a significant price, not now, not in the future. Jay SPQR is one of them, but he is like an open book, claiming: \u201cThere is one thing I know as a fact! Crypto markets will do what they want, \u201che said.Some hope that the asset will eventually jump, but only when it becomes very useful as a utility token and when the SEC determines its status by distinguishing it from security. Imperator Emhyr agrees to this point but puts his forecast at just over $ 10, for which XRP has a long way to go.I do not count on $ 100 +, I just see it as a possibility. For $ 10 +, I think most of us would agree that it was a \u201cwalk in the park\u201d for XRP, just not going to go.XRP is trying to keep its price of $ 0.30, but so far, the battle is tough, and a retailer has said that this is the decisive moment for XRP and can be shot over $ 0.30 or drop to a level that will be very difficult to overcome.The market as a whole is rude over the past two days, but most of the top crypto-lite players are also struggling. When the restoration is done, XRP may come out of the current difficulty and move toward something higher.As for Imperator Emhyr\u2019s forecast, the market is indeed unpredictable, and XRP can bring significant profits beyond what one has ever imagined. So far we all have fingers and we can only hope for a better future.Saudi British Bank launches an immediate cross-border payment service based on RippleDuring the first edition of the Financial Sector Conference, part of the Financial Sector Development Program, held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on 24 and 25 April, Saudi British Bank announced the launch of its payment services for immediate cross-border payments.In the official report posted on SABB\u2019s website, this step of the Saudi British Bank is listed as part of the \u201cBank\u2019s strategic plan for digital conversion and enrichment of customer experience.\u201dIn 2018, with the support of the Saudi Monetary Administration (SAMA), SABB managed to become one of the first banks in Saudi Arabia to join the Ripple Block Technology Network. SABB then made its first successful cross-border transfer, based on Ripple, which was made in December 2018 with Indian rupees.Saudi British Bank is positive for the CrippSABB Deputy Governor of Corporate and Institutional Banking, Majd Nazm, said this step by SABB is an indication of their ongoing efforts to present their clients with the best banking services. He added that the use of the latest technology and global banking products creates methods and tools that save time and effort for customers and that the launch of block technology through Ripple not only makes cross-border payments to customers faster and safer, but and more transparent.This is also the preservation of our leading position in reaching the ambitions of the bank\u2019s customers, whether in the retail or corporate sector, and in support of SABB\u2019s vision of being the leading global bank in the Kingdom.So far, SABB has only integrated Indian rupees into their system, but plans to \u201cconnect more countries and currencies in the near future.\u201dThe Bank has accepted not only opens the blockchain technology, but also the crypotools. Almost six months after he announced that the trade in Bitkine was illegal, Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates, tested the water by launching its own cryptography to facilitate cross-border payments.McAfee Hypes His Own Crypto Debit CardControversial crypto bull and software legend John McAfee has shared a series of Twitter posts that will issue his own debit card for crypto Looks, which will be universally accepted. According to a report, Maccabi intends to work with Visa to issue the card.According to the publications, the card will allow users to load BattleKnight and use it in any country because it has a feature that allows Britain to convert into local currency, making it potentially acceptable in every part of the world.The cards may relate to Macafi\u2019s presidential ambition for 2020 as they have the logo and image of his presidential campaign, which he believes the only 12,000 will have.Cards are already printed with Visa and can be used by the public soon. This is a rather unexpected development, as Maccabi is currently in exile from the US for not paying taxes for eight years.This makes card issuance a little mystical since it is unlikely that the government will allow such cards to be issued in the name of a recognized tax credit. While this is true, maps can be useful for encouraging the use of Bitkine and not the sterling currencies in several countries around the world.Companies like Binance also offer an option to use credit cards to buy Battle, but the cards do not charge BTC, making Maccabi\u2019s technology different. The Coinbase map is the one that may look like Makafi, but it is different in that it supports different cryptoLooks. The McAfee debit card is for Battle only.This is the first time in the history of crypto-points, in which a person issues a debit card on his own. If this happens as planned, Maccabi will go into history as the first person to do something like this, and maybe the first of several others that can follow his steps.There is also potentially huge publicity about his presidential campaign before 2020 and who knows? This can make everything different.Philip Morris is turning to a blockLike many large businesses, Philip Morris International, the tobacco giant, decides to look at the block as a money-saving mechanism. Leader of the company recently announced that it will start using the technology.\u201cWe want a public block,\u201d said Philip Morris, Global Head of Architecture and Technology Innovation, Ntin Manoharan. It appeared on April 25 at the London Blockchain Expo.The specific application it uses is to track the excise label on the cigarette cases. Banders cost a lot, considering how small they are, about $ 5.50 for one excise label and they are easily falsified, costing industry and governments $ 100 million a year. Just for Philip Morris, tracking legitimate blockbonds will save $ 20 million.The reason why Manoharan wants to turn to a public block is pure ambitious wattage. He wants the company to be the industry leader to which other companies can join. He said:Attempt is a block of the whole industry where stakeholders can get in, join and take advantage of it. If they do not see any value, they can just leave.The plan is to build the new technology in combination with Ethereum and MultiChain. It will have differences from being just another public project of Ethereum, insisted Manoharan.He believes block technology is a solution to many problems with this industry and integration and will be the right move for the company.Allowed block projects are quite simple. The option is small and you can achieve everything that blocked blocks do with existing infrastructure and existing tools.Banderolles do not seem to be the only application of Philip Morris technology. They have five more ideas on how to implement a blockade in 2019 and will consult with local authorities on how to stay within the law.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Fintech", "Ripple", "Xrp", "Tobacco Road"]}, {"title": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency Review", "post_link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/altcoin-analysis-btc-eth-xrp-eos-ltc-cryptocurrency-review-5812f05aeb3d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2019-08-26", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-26", "readtime": "5.28", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC Cryptocurrency ReviewAugust 26, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN MAGAZINEMarko VidrihFollowAug 26 \u00b7 6 min readIn the cryptocurrency market, there is complete uncertainty regarding future trends.

The price is at the same levels as on Friday. An analysis of the situation reveals continuing uncertainty. From a technical point of view, a short-term upward channel has developed. However, on a longer time slice, there is no need to speak of a pronounced tendency. In such a situation, the shortage of new trading ideas still persists. The neutral position is probably the most reasonable based on trading practices. During such periods, the foundations of future strong movements are usually laid on the market. It is important to save capital and patiently wait for the right moment.EthereumETH also does not show any signs of a change in the situation. Lateral dynamics and periodic bursts of volumes indicate mixed moods among the participants. Below is the trend line, and above is resistance at $204. Of course, there is a small place for maneuver. It is worth remembering that in such a market as it is now, waiting without a position is much easier than waiting for your price while in a position. This is not the case when a rapid revaluation brings the portfolio to the plus and there is a margin of safety. In this situation, the best solution may be to wait for the best opportunities.RippleLooking at the XRP chart, by and large, there are no questions. We all remember the relative weakness of the coin for quite some time. Recently, there are signs of a change in this situation, which have not yet been confirmed. The observed price range of $0.255\u2013$0.292 has been going on for almost two weeks now. For speculators with a relatively low-risk sensitivity, it is possible to trade within the range, both in the formation of a short-term trend and in the case of chart approaching the lower border of the trading range. However, for those who can wait and prefer to act for sure, to start trading from purchases, a more significant argument is needed. For example, a breakdown of resistance at $0.292.EOSIn EOS, the sidewall continues in the range of $3.44- $3.78. Exit from this range will indicate the direction of the main trend in the near future. In the meantime, the conditions for future movement are only being laid. It is nevertheless more correct to minimize participation in the coin, which has already been mentioned more than once in past reviews. The dynamics of the pair is subject to general market sentiment. It is a little embarrassing that a relatively large number of experts are still waiting for some revenge from altcoins after they have lagged behind market leaders in recent months.LTCIn LTC, the situation is similar to EOS. Several long tails led to an increase in volatility indicators. This is not indicative, however, in the tools of the cryptocurrency market, the average capitalization has not been a rarity lately. Price moves in the trading range. Support is at $70; resistance is around $78- $79. The technical picture at the moment is such that for speculators practicing the impulse approach, the coin is likely to become interesting to buy only in case of a breakdown of the red line.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

What Does Ripple Actually Do?Nikolay PeshevFollowJan 8 \u00b7 6 min readWhat is RippleIn order to improve financial transactions between banks by making them faster, cheaper and more reliable, Ripple has already managed to attract large financial institutions to its network, including Santander, BBVA and RBC. Ripple took another major step in expanding into Asia by announcing plans for a new office in Singapore, today\u2019s Asian FinTech Innovation Center. With an experienced leadership team and the ever-growing Ripple network, the company\u2019s prospects look promising.Although Ripple offers a destructive solution to the real problem, a large group of individual investors in the block industry are angry with the company. The main problem that the blockchain community seems to have with Ripple is the fact that it is completely centralized and that they aim to increase the effectiveness of the global financial system. This is at odds with the beliefs of the stubborn block community, which wants to bypass this (in their opinion) unreliable and irresponsible industry using cryptoLooks and Blocks.Ripple\u2019s only goal is to make transactions between financial institutions more efficient and has repeatedly stated that they are not interested in facilitating transactions between individuals.What does Ripple actually do?At present, our global banking system is experiencing a lot of disappointments in international financial transactions. We, as bank customers, experience this when transferring funds to other countries, as this may take 3 to 5 days. Taking a plane with a bag of money is still faster than most international transactions.However, we are only experiencing some of the problems with these transactions. Most of these problems are faced by banks. Since financial transactions tend to pass through multiple intermediaries there is a high failure rate, the process is costly and slow and there is no coherent global network or structure for these transactions. Ripple strives to make this process incredibly effective by using the blockchain technology and its own XRP crypto Light.Ripple\u2019s block is currently one of the fastest in the crypto-space, with a transaction speed of only 4 seconds. To illustrate how quickly this is actually, Etrier block transactions take more than 2 minutes, and Bitcoin sometimes takes more than an hour to confirm a transaction.Adding to the fact that both are facing scalability issues, Ripple is definitely the most effective transaction crypt of the three. In addition, Ripple is scalable if the number of transactions increases too fast. Currently, it can handle 1500 transactions per second.XRP, Ripple\u2019s crypto, acts as a digital asset to facilitate international transactions.That\u2019s how it works. Bank A wants to send Bank B $ 1,000,000. Instead of sending the money using the standard method, Bank A will buy an XRP amount that costs $ 1,000,000 and will send it to the bank\u2019s institutional portfolios B. Bank B will convert it into the fiat currency in which it operates and the transaction is settled within minutes. Banks will not have to buy and sell XRP on an exchange but will have private access to Ripple\u2019s Transaction Network.What Ripple DoUnique Price Determinants of XRPIn addition to the huge increase in Ripple transactions, the cost of these transactions is extremely low and will be paid in XRP. This is done by destroying a very small percentage of the sent and received XRPs.This means that cryptoLight is subject to deflation, as the total amount of coins is smaller and each deal is made. Therefore, the price will increase with each transaction, although it will be hardly noticeable in the short run. However, when you think long-term, this is something to be taken into consideration.However, there is one major problem with the amount of XRP in circulation and its cost. The amount currently in circulation is only 38% of the total number of all XRP coins. At present, Ripple still owns 62% of its XRP, which is one of the main concerns of individual investors.Banks require a stable price to be able to properly conduct financial transactions, and it is assumed that this is the reason why Ripple does so. However, the real reason for this is still not officially given. CompetitionTrying to facilitate global financial transactions, Ripple faces a giant called SWIFT. If you have ever made a transaction from your bank to a bank abroad, it is likely that SWIFT has been used by banks to facilitate the transaction process.At present, over 11,000 financial institutions in some 200 countries and territories are linked through SWIFT to complete banking transactions. SWIFT encourages banks to join their network to increase the ease of transactions, which sounds very similar to what Ripple is doing right now. VISA and Deloitte are also looking for ways to acquire a market share from SWIFT.All three companies have announced investment in research and development aimed at blockchain technology to increase transaction efficiency and gain a competitive advantage in this industry. In this regard, Ripple seems to have a lead, as their block is already being used and is gaining momentum. The Ripple Team and NetworkWhile examining Ripple\u2019s management team, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed by our long-standing experience in a number of industries targeting mainly FinTech and the financial sector.Executive Summary Executive Director Brad Garlinghouse is a good presentation of this. He worked at Yahoo as Communications SVP, who served several positions on board and was CEO of Hightail. Interestingly, the global strategic account manager, Marcus Treacher, was on board SWIFT, the market leader in the industry where Ripple is trying to penetrate.Besides an experienced leader, Ripple currently has over 160 employees, making it one of the largest blockchain employers. Looking at Ripple\u2019s growth and the combined experience of his senior management, the team looks solid.A number of large financial institutions are already members of the Ripple Network and the size of the network continues to grow on a regular basis. Well-known banks such as Santander, Reisebank and RBC are examples of these large members of the network.Besides the network, Ripple has some reputable investors looking for their future. Google\u2019s venture capital investment group supports Ripple financially, like Accenture, Andreessen Horowitz and Seagate. With such support, you can say that this is a serious business.For a full review of Ripple Network members, see https://ripple.com/solutions/Reviews of RippleBlockchain investors have quite opposite views on Ripple. It either seems like you love him or you hate him. Why people love it is quite simple: it offers a proven solution for a real and global problem. However, hatred for Ripple and his operations also has some content.The first argument against Ripple is that the company still owns 62% of all the coins it has created. The real reason for this is still unclear, but puts Ripple in a position where they can easily manipulate the price to their liking. Another problem with Ripple is that it is centralized. This arouses many block enthusiasts, as a block is a way of decentralizing the world by preventing any country from controlling all data and accounts.However, it makes sense for cryptographic data facilitating inter-bank transactions to be centralized, as banks need to have control and accessibility to the history of all transactions. This opposes the anonymity and ownership of your own information, which is a key feature that is part of the popular share of encrypted financial transactions.Finally, the most common argument against Ripple is that they cooperate with the \u201cenemies\u201d of the bloc\u2019s ideology: governments and financial systems. Using block technology to the exact opposite of what BitCoin means (that is, no central power stations and more control and privacy) has created a serious dislike for Ripple, no matter how useful their technology is.Investing or not investing?Generally, Ripple and their XRP crypto-wave are subject to many arguments in favour and against. However, their target market and technologies are solid.Betting on banks never seems like a good idea, but heavy competition can be expected. Why do banks use the crypt of an outside company when they can create their own block inside? Visa simply can not be ignored when it comes to financial transactions between banks and it is unlikely that they will not come up with a counter-strategy.However, Ripple\u2019s network is impressive and expanding. The highly qualified leadership gives confidence for a strong vision and strategy. Price manipulation can happen and there are many committed Ripple officers but who need individual investors when you have the support of big players in the financial system.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ripple", "Xrp"]}, {"title": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC \u2014 Cryptocurrency Review", "post_link": "https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/btc-eth-xrp-eos-ltc-cryptocurrency-review-52851eccf673?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marko Vidrih", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko", "publish_date": "2019-04-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-22", "readtime": "3.51", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Altcoin Analysis: BTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, LTC \u2014 Cryptocurrency ReviewApril 22, 2019, by Marko Vidrih on ALTCOIN MAGAZINEMarko VidrihFollowApr 22 \u00b7 4 min readOn the cryptocurrency market, the outset continues. The capitalization rate fell from Friday by 0.5% to $177 billion.The previous significant price increase on the market took place against the background of neutral news flow and was caused, to a greater extent, by technical factors, so even in such conditions as the current, the situation may change in some moment. All the most interesting movements in the market take place exactly when the majority of participants begin to believe that the current continuing side trend is for a long time.BitcoinThe technical picture in BTC has not changed significantly. Chart moves to the upper boundary of the trading range of $4800- $5400 as part of an uptrend, while from Friday the price is at the same values \u200b\u200band is consolidating in the range of $100. Due to the absence of significant changes, our strategy also remains the same \u2014 trading from purchases in small volumes in the context of an uptrend and waiting for the formation of favorable conditions for trading the main limit. Such conditions may be formed in case of breakdown of the upper border of the trading range.EthereumAt ETH, the trend, the goal of which was to move to $184, was broken and the quotes adjusted. Now the price is in the middle of the trading range of $154- $184. A small position is covered until the formation of new opportunities.RippleIn XRP, the emerging trend did not develop and the trend was broken already on Saturday. The support line at $0.317 once again became the \u201ccenter of attraction\u201d for the chart of this coin. In the area of \u200b\u200bthis price, you can try to make small purchases in volume, with a short stop to check the strength of the market and with the prospect of increasing the position, if the chart still manages to break away from the level and form a local uptrend.EOSIn EOS, movements are subject to the influence of general market dynamics, therefore there are no ideas here now. The blue trend line is broken, and it is possible that we will soon see the price at $4.9, which is the lower limit of the trading range. However, it is impossible to give an unambiguous forecast here, therefore, in the case of the emergence of a new local trend and the presence of points with an acceptable profit/risk ratio, you should not be afraid to open speculative positions, because the coin has shown advanced dynamics in relation to the whole market for a long time and there is no reason to believe that the situation has changed.LitecoinLTC chart is again at the bottom of the trading range, which allows speculators to open/increase positions with a small risk. The dynamics of the coin lately does not differ in individuality, so this is just one of the market instruments in which, against the background of the outset, a convenient entry point has been formed. Further movement at this stage is likely to depend on general market trends.DISCLAIMER: All Content on this site is information of a general nature and does not address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.
