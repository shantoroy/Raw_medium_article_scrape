They\u2019ve done some great work, and we plan to continue working with them, so please don\u2019t poach them too aggressively!This is the same UI you saw previewed at Devcon 3 by the giant dinosaur. That wasn\u2019t Dan Finlay, aka Dino Dan, but was in fact Dan Tsui from Kyokan sharing his team\u2019s work.The new UI isn\u2019t just polish, it also includes several long-overdue features (achem, native token sending). Here\u2019s a basic overview of where things are:I think my personal favorite thing to click here is the \u201cOpen Full Screen Mode\u201d button, which lets you really stretch out and enjoy your account in a new way:You\u2019ll notice Ether on the left tops your new token list, and adding tokens now auto suggests popular tokens, and makes it easy to safely add tokens you know by name, and makes it easy to send them, and review token sending transactions.Don\u2019t get your hopes up, we didn\u2019t have a token sale, that\u2019s just a MetaMark, our April Fool\u2019s joke from last year ;)Really, the entire interface has been overhauled, and it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer to fully document it all, so let this be a sneak peak at some of the cool stuff we have packed in there.Naturally, all of these changes released at once mean there is a slightly above average chance of hiccups. That\u2019s why we made it easy to opt-in to the new interface, as well as opt back out, in case anything isn\u2019t quite up to your standards yet. If you want to get back to the old interface, you\u2019ll find it on the settings page, under the main menu:We have a lot more cool features planned with this slick new UI, we hope you enjoy it! If you have any issues, bugs, or features to report, please email them to us at support@metamask.io, or if you\u2019re savvy with GitHub, chime in on our issues!", "responses": 18, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Never Use Passwords Again with Ethereum and Metamask", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/never-use-passwords-again-with-ethereum-and-metamask-b61c7e409f0d?source=search_post---------1", "author_name": "Alex Miller", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@asmiller1989", "publish_date": "2017-03-23", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-26", "readtime": "5.99", "claps": 714, "voters": 238, "content": "Never Use Passwords Again with Ethereum and MetamaskAlex MillerFollowMar 23, 2017 \u00b7 6 min readI build a lot of proofs of concept at ConsenSys for various clients and usually they want something that leverages the Ethereum blockchain to solve some business use case. Strangely, these systems often get designed with standard web logins (i.e. with a username and password).I always ask myself why I\u2019m designing things this way since, after all, this is an annoying aspect of every web application that Ethereum can solve today.So I\u2019m finally putting my foot down and designing that solution.JSON Web TokensOne very popular way to log into a standard web system (and/or use its API) is to submit a password (which is hashed client side) to an authentication endpoint and receive a token in return. This is (usually) called a JSON Web Token and is typically valid for some finite period of time (minutes to days). Here is a nice tutorial on a standard implementation.JSON Web Tokens are nice and dandy, but I got to thinking that it\u2019s very easy to authenticate yourself on the blockchain. In fact, when you use Ethereum, you are constantly doing it.If you think of an Ethereum address (which is just a sha3 hash of your public key) as an account on a website, it is very easy to prove you own that account by signing a piece of data with your private key. This data is arbitrary and can be any random string that the website\u2019s API serves up. Thus, we can use an address as a username and bypass the need for a password. In fact, we don\u2019t even need to use the blockchain to do this.Here\u2019s what it looks like using Express:First we need to do an elliptic curve signature with a private key:var ethUtil = require(\u2018ethereumjs-util\u2019);  // >=5.1.1var data = \u2018i am a string\u2019;// Elliptic curve signature must be done on the Keccak256 Sha3 hash of a piece of data.var message = ethUtil.toBuffer(data);    var msgHash = ethUtil.hashPersonalMessage(message);    var sig = ethUtil.ecsign(msgHash, privateKey);    var serialized = ethUtil.bufferToHex(this.concatSig(sig.v, sig.r, sig.s))    return serializedDon\u2019t worry too much about what these parameters are yet. There is some cryptography going on here and I encourage you to read up on elliptic curve signatures. The Bitcoin wiki is a decent place to start.Anyway, once we have our signature components, we can package them along with the user\u2019s address and send it all to an authentication endpoint.POST /Authenticatevar jwt = require(\u2018jsonwebtoken\u2019);var ethUtil = require('ethereumjs-util');function checkSig(req, res) {  var sig = req.sig;  var owner = req.owner;  // Same data as before  var data = \u2018i am a string\u2019;  var message = ethUtil.toBuffer(data)  var msgHash = ethUtil.hashPersonalMessage(message)  // Get the address of whoever signed this message    var signature = ethUtil.toBuffer(sig)  var sigParams = ethUtil.fromRpcSig(signature)  var publicKey = ethUtil.ecrecover(msgHash, sigParams.v, sigParams.r, sigParams.s)  var sender = ethUtil.publicToAddress(publicKey)  var addr = ethUtil.bufferToHex(sender)   // Determine if it is the same address as 'owner'   var match = false;  if (addr == owner) { match = true; }  if (match) {    // If the signature matches the owner supplied, create a    // JSON web token for the owner that expires in 24 hours.    var token = jwt.sign({user: req.body.addr}, \u2018i am another string\u2019,  { expiresIn: \u201c1d\u201d });    res.send(200, { success: 1, token: token })  } else {    // If the signature doesn\u2019t match, error out    res.send(500, { err: \u2018Signature did not match.\u2019});  }}So basically, given some piece of data, an address, and the components of an EC signature, we can cryptographically prove that the address belongs to the person who signed the data. Pretty cool, huh?Once we are satisfied the signature and address match, we can sign a JSON Web Token for that address server side. In this case, the token is valid for 1 day.Now we just need to put in some middleware to guard any routes that would be serving or modifying protected information.middleware/auth.jsfunction auth(req, res, next) {  jwt.verify(req.body.token, \u2018i am another string\u2019, function(err, decoded) {    if (err) { res.send(500, { error: \u2018Failed to authenticate token.\u2019}); }    else {      req.user = decoded.user;      next();    };  });}app.js// Routesapp.post(\u2018/UpdateData\u2019, auth, Routes.UpdateData);\u2026If the provided token corresponds to the user who sent the request, we continue to requested route. Note that the middleware modifies the request. It is this new `user` parameter that we need to reference because we know it got set in our middleware.POST /UpdateDatafunction UpdateData(req, res) {  // Only use the user that was set in req by auth middleware!  var user = req.user;  updateYourData(user, req.body.data);  ...}And there we have it! Your user has literally signed in, but didn\u2019t need a password.UI stuffBut how does a user actually sign this data in the browser? Metamask to the rescue! Metamask is a neat chrome extension that injects web3 into your browser window.mycomponent.jsxmakeSig(dispatch) {  function toHex(s) {   var hex = \u2018\u2019;   for(var i=0;i<s.length;i++) { hex += \u2018\u2019+s.charCodeAt(i).toString(16); }   return `0x${hex}`; }  var data = toHex(\u2018i am a string\u2019); web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({ id: 1, method: 'personal_sign', params: [web3.eth.accounts[0], data] },   function(err, result) {     let sig = result.result;     dispatch(exchange.authenticate(sig, user))    })  }}render(){  let { dispatch, _main: { sig } } = this.props;  if (Object.keys(sig).length == 0) { this.makeSig(dispatch); }  return (   <p>I am a webpage</p>  );}This will trigger Metamask to pop up a window asking the user to sign the message:Once the callback is invoked, it will call the following action:authenticate(sig, user) {  return (dispatch) => {    fetch(`${this.api}/Authenticate`, {      method: 'POST',      body: JSON.stringify({ owner: user, sig: sig}),      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }    })    .then((res) => { return res.text(); })    .then((body) => {      var token = JSON.parse(body).token;      dispatch({ type: 'SET_AUTH_TOKEN', result: token})    })  }}And once you have the auth token saved in your reducer, you can call your authenticated endpoints. And there we have it!Note that v, r, and s values must be recovered from the signature. Metamask has a signature util module that shows how the signature is constructed. It can be deconstructed like this:var solidity_sha3 = require('solidity-sha3').default;let hash = solidity_sha3(data);let sig = result.result.substr(2, result.result.length);let r = sig.substr(0, 64);let s = sig.substr(64, 64);let v = parseInt(sig.substr(128, 2));where r will be parsed as either 0 or 1. Note also that this uses the solidity-sha3 module to make sure this hashing algorithm is the same one being used as solidity\u2019s native hashing method (we are hashing the hex-string that was signed earlier).Production readyI can\u2019t emphasize enough that every web application using JSON web tokens could easily take advantage of this today. Any user with a Metamask extension could simply bypass the login screen with arguably better security than whatever you\u2019re currently using to manage logins. This means fewer forgotten passwords, less wasted time, and a happier user base.And, you know, if you want your users to pay each other (or you, or users on on any other system that uses this) without an intermediary or if you want to take advantage of Ethereum\u2019s million other features, this sets you up to do that too.Make the switch today.

To get the latest word on that migration process, check out the Truffle 3 migration guide. We will eventually update this tutorial for Truffle 3, but until then, if you just want to get your feet wet, maybe try this tutorial out with Truffle 2.0. npm install -g truffle@2. You might also find Truffle 3 to be easy to start with Webpack using this video tutorial.If you\u2019re interested in building web apps with the Ethereum blockchain, you may have found the Truffle web framework to be a nice fit for your needs.For many types of Dapps (Distributed Apps), Truffle does everything you could want: It compiles your blockchain contracts, injects them into your web app, and can even run a test suite against them!This is all great for you, but what about your users? Truffle has some great defaults for users who are willing to run a local Ethereum JSON RPC server on their computer, but what about your users who just want to sign on and get started?With Metamask, all your users need to do is install our Chrome plugin, and they will have their own secure blockchain accounts right there in the convenience of their browsers.Metamask is just a Developer Preview right now, and has not been released to the general public. We don\u2019t recommend putting serious funds in it, but instead encourage you to use it to help prepare your dapps for Ethereum browsers.It\u2019s possible your Truffle Dapp is already compatible with Metamask, but if you\u2019re like me, you want to go through your project and see what it\u2019s like from your user\u2019s perspective.Just in case you haven\u2019t used Truffle before, I\u2019m going to start by describing how to scaffold a minimal Truffle dapp. If you already have one set up, feel free to jump ahead to Setting up Metamask.Installing Truffle DependenciesYou\u2019re going to need to have installed node.js.From there, you need to install truffle (npm install -g truffle).Also, you\u2019re going to need to run a local blockchain RPC server to test and develop against. I recommend using testrpc, which you install by running npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc.Next let\u2019s make sure we have our testrpc running in the background. Open your terminal and run the command testrpc. That's all! It runs on port 8545by default, just like most Ethereum RPCs, and so does Truffle.Also note that when testrpc first starts, it prints out a list of accounts that will be pre-funded with ether, along with a twelve-word seed phrase for re-generating those accounts. You can use this seed phrase to initialize your MetaMask client with the same accounts, and you\u2019ll have lots of Ether when you start! (Ether is used to pay for network usage, or gas, on the Ethereum network)If you wanted to start up testrpc with the accounts you already have in MetaMask, you can tell testrpc what seed phrase to use with the -m flag. For example:$ testrpc -m \"concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic\"Setting up a simple Truffle DappNext, let\u2019s generate a basic Truffle dapp. The default result of truffle initis a simple example currency.To get it up and running, run these commands:mkdir my-money # Create a folder for your new dappcd my-money # Move into that foldertruffle init # Initialize a default truffle project in that foldertruffle migrate # Build, compile, & deploy the dapptruffle serve # Host your web interface on port 8080We just deployed a simple alt-coin called MetaCoin to our local blockchain, and it's available to our browser on http://localhost:8080!If you visit it, you\u2019ll see that by default this new Dapp template signs you in with the first account on your testrpc account list, which happens to be the same account that got pre-populated with 10k shiny new Metacoins! That's because when you ran truffle migrate, Truffle used your first account as the contract publisher, and the contract says to fund the creator's account with 10k coins.You can now send those coins to any account you want, for example, the second account in your testrpc list! If you enter an address and a value, and hit send, you'll see your balance go down!If that seems a little too easy, I\u2019d agree with you! That\u2019s why Metamask gives the user an opportunity to approve every transaction that a Dapp attempts, and that\u2019s more secure!Let\u2019s try connecting to the same account through Metamask, and see how easy it is!Setting up MetamaskNow you\u2019ll want to install Metamask from the Chrome store.When you first open Metamask, it will let you either create a new wallet or restore from a seed. Since both Metamask and testrpc use the bip44 standard for wallet generation, you can Restore Existing Vault, and enter the mnemonic that testrpc output when you first started it. It should be 12 words long.You\u2019ll also need to provide a password, which is used to encrypt your wallet.By default you get three accounts, and they\u2019ll be the same as the first three accounts in your testrpc list.To use Metamask with your testrpc accounts, you need to point it at yourtestrpc address as its RPC provider, which by default is localhost:8545. MetaMask provides a menu item for quickly switching to this local port.Open MetamaskClick the current network name in the top right.Select your current testrpc address, which is probbly Localhost 8545.Metamask will close at this point to restart itself.You can now sign into your Dapp with Metamask.Open MetamaskEnter your passwordReload the Dapp page (some dapps will notice when you change accounts, but this basic one doesn\u2019t)You should now see your first account\u2019s MetaCoin balance! If you switch accounts, you should see theirs (none, unless you\u2019ve sent to one!).To send some Metacoin to one of your Metamask accounts, you\u2019re going to need that account\u2019s address.To copy a Metamask account\u2019s address:Open MetamaskClick the details arrow next to the account whose address you want.Click the \u201cCopy Address\u201d button.You now you have a copy of your address to send to!Sending Metacoin from Metamask: So Meta!If you connect to your first account, you should see you have some MetaCoin, and if we look in our Metamask plugin, we should have some ether too!It\u2019s important that we have ether, because it\u2019s not only a currency for trade, it\u2019s also the currency for processing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This processing fee is referred to as \u201cgas\u201d.Let\u2019s try sending some Metacoin from one of our Metamask accounts to another.Select the account that has the Metacoin and Ether, so that the Dapp shows a MetaCoin balance.Now we want to copy the address of another account you control to send to. In MetaMask, click the Switch Accounts icon in the top right.If you only have one account, click the + at the bottom of this screen to add a new account.When you see another account in the list, click the Copy Address button on it, and then you can paste that into the Dapp\u2019s To field, along with how much MetaCoin you'd like to send, and hit Send!You should see a notification pop-up, notifying you that you have a transaction to approve.You can now Approve or Reject the transaction, or close the notification, and review the transaction in MetaMask later.This is one way that Metamask is a safer Ethereum browsing experience than running your own RPC. While a pre-authenticated RPC automatically approves all requests sent to it, Metamask gives the user an opportunity to review and approve or reject each transaction that\u2019s requested by the dapp. Long term, making transactions easy to intelligently review is an important priority for MetaMask.Wrapping UpThis has been a simple example, but hopefully shows how Truffle and Metamask work together. They are able to pretty much work out of the box! That\u2019s because Truffle helps you write web3-compliant dapps. Web3 is a Javascript API declared by the core Ethereum team, and Metamask injects it directly into the Dapp\u2019s context!This makes connecting to a Truffle Dapp with Metamask as easy as connecting with your own RPC, but it\u2019s a lot easier for your users.That\u2019s because Metamask is a hyper-light client that doesn\u2019t replicate the entire blockchain locally, but it does let users manage their own accounts, so they can casually benefit from the security of private key management, while placing trust for block validation on Metamask\u2019s configured RPC provider.We hope this has been a useful introduction to developing with Truffle and Metamask!Please, leave a comment or question, start a discussion on github, or Tweet at us on Twitter.

They stated that MetaMask is broadcasting user ETH addresses to third parties.This means that your browsing behavior can be tracked through the ETH address you use in Metamask.Even transferring ETH between accounts still links you back to your last known identity (which is linked to your MetaMask account) and can be used to change your rates on employment opportunities, health insurance, loan risk factors, etc based on your proclivities or health metrics. \u2014 projectoblio on GitHubThere were also concerns that platforms like Amazon, Google, and PayPal can potentially link your blockchain transactions to your credit card payments and you identity. There is also a risk of exposing the last person you transacted with.According to projectoblio this privacy concern can negatively impact the long term value of ETH.What can I do about it?MetaMask has a privacy mode that is designed to hide your ETH address unless you give the Dapp your consent to view it.It is not enabled by default, so to use it you will have to expand your MetaMask window.Enter the settings menu by clicking on your account picture.And then manually enable the privacy mode.There is still a debate on whether this mode completely ensures your privacy.The MetaMask team promised to focus on improving the privacy aspect of their service in the future.Cutieneers, are you concerned about privacy issues in crypto?Keep rocking, keep exploring and see ya on Blockchain Cuties!Check out the latest news in our publication and make sure you follow us on our social profiles like:\ud83d\udcd8 Facebook,\ud83d\udde3 Telegram,\ud83d\udc26 Twitter,\ud83d\udc9f Discord,\u2764\ufe0f YouTubeand here \u2014 on \u24c2\ufe0f Medium for more updates.Clap, if you like cuties!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Technology", "Tech", "Cryptocurrency", "Crypto"]}, {"title": "A Starter Guide to Using the Bloom Mainnet DApp: MetaMask + Signing Up", "post_link": "https://blog.hellobloom.io/a-starter-guide-to-using-the-bloom-mainnet-dapp-metamask-signing-up-77f403d13f9b?source=search_post---------6", "author_name": "Shannon Wu", "author_link": "https://blog.hellobloom.io/@shannonwu", "publish_date": "2018-01-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-15", "readtime": "3.07", "claps": 1379, "voters": 120, "content": "A Starter Guide to Using the Bloom Mainnet DApp: MetaMask + Signing UpShannon WuFollowJan 2, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readYou will be able to interact with the Bloom dapp starting today. Here is a guide on getting started: https://app.bloom.co/signupBloom requires you interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the Bloom smart contracts to participate in the dApp. The easiest method of doing this is through MetaMask. You should either import the wallet which has your BLT into MetaMask or transfer your BLT to MetaMask.Once MetaMask is set up, you will need at least 0.1 BLT in your MetaMask to continue.Note: Read Part 1 to set up your MetaMask. Read Part 2 to confirm BLT ownership inside MetaMask.Part 1: Setting up MetaMaskIf you already have MetaMask set up and your BLT is already in your MetaMask, feel free to skip down to Part 2: Confirming BLT Ownership.Step 1: Click here to get the MetaMask extension for Chrome. Otherwise, check out their site here.Step 2: Add MetaMask to your browser. For example, click \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d to Install MetaMask as an extension.Step 3: Click \u201cAdd Extension\u201d to confirm.Step 4: Read the MetaMask Terms and Conditions which will pop up when you click on your extension in your browser (upper right corner).Step 5: Create a new vault and enter a strong password. On MetaMask, you receive your seed (12 words) which will help to secure your account. Make sure you store your seed in a safe place. Without these 12 words, you cannot restore your wallet.Make sure your MetaMask Extension is unlocked to use the Bloom app. To unlock MetaMask, just hit the MetaMask icon on the top right of your browser and enter your password.Part 2: Confirming BLT OwnershipYou will need to own BLT to use the Bloom dapp. You can also ask for an invite from someone who owns BLT.Step 6: Make sure you are on the Main Ethereum Network. If not, click in the upper left corner and change to \u201cMain Ethereum Network\u201d.Upper Left Corner \u2014 Change to \u201cMain Ethereum Network\u201dStep 7: Unlock your vault with your password and fund your account.

It\u2019s what led us to create a secure, decentralized identity in the BloomID. We believe that all users should have a safe and good experience when interacting with products. It\u2019s the context for how we think about our platform \u2014 from our smart contracts, to our dApp, to how users interact with our protocol.This also means thinking broadly about the user experience of our community as a whole.MetaMask is an innovative Chrome extension that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, including the Bloom dApp, through your web browser. It manages your wallets and allows you to seamlessly issue transactions and vote in our Bloom platform from the web. We strongly believe that the entire crypto space has greatly benefited from the services that MetaMask provides \u2014 it\u2019s a fantastic tool.Due to the fast moving nature of the space, we also know that security is an ongoing evolution, so we would like to proactively point out a few possible attacks that users should be aware of.Two weeks ago, we wrote a blog post about a theoretical attack vector against MetaMask. Today, Bloom advisor and security researcher Brandon Arvanaghi created a proof-of-concept site EthWalletSecurity, an independent project that interactively demonstrates this attack vector, along with an extended look at MetaMask\u2019s attack surface, for all MetaMask users.We encourage any MetaMask user to explore this site and interact with the attack vectors presented. We care deeply about the Bloom community\u2019s security, which is why we go to great lengths to discover potential attack vectors and educate users on the potential threats they pose.These attacks can happen to both unlocked and locked MetaMask accounts. I will address both in this article. Let\u2019s start by taking a look at unlocked accounts.Part 1: An Unlocked MetaMaskYour unlocked MetaMask exposes the currently selected address in MetaMask to every tab you have open. If you ever switch between accounts in MetaMask while it\u2019s unlocked, every tab you have open will also know about that other account.Since the blockchain is public, knowing an account\u2019s address is enough to tell you every incoming and outgoing transaction in its history. If you visit EthWalletSecurity with an unlocked MetaMask, it shows how any site owner can use Etherscan to see your most recent incoming and outgoing transaction.Figure 1: A site owner can use Etherscan to enumerate your most recent transactions when you visit it with an unlocked MetaMaskFrom knowing your most recent transactions, an attacker can leverage highly targeted campaigns against your MetaMask wallet.Here\u2019s how it could happen:Approach #1: Your Last Outgoing Transaction FailedThe first example on EthWalletSecurity demonstrates how the site can produce a fake MetaMask notification stating that your most recent outgoing transaction failed. The fake notification would have all the real details about your last outgoing transaction, including its value, the destination address, and the date.Figure 2: A phony notification with real details about your last outgoing transactionUpon hovering over this fake notification, EthWalletSecurity shows how the site can present you a MetaMask transaction for the same amount, but subtly to a different address. Because there is no standard for how Chrome extensions present notifications, a MetaMask user would have no way of knowing that this kind of pop-up, which created a transaction upon hovering over it, is fake.Approach #2: Sign For Your Last Incoming TransactionSimilarly, the site could take your most recent incoming transaction, with the real details about the sender address, ETH amount, and date, and claim that MetaMask requires a signature to accept it. This is not unlike signing for a package arriving at your door.While experienced blockchain users will know that incoming transactions do not require any action on the recipient\u2019s side, it may be easy to overlook this detail when a MetaMask lookalike presents accurate details about your most recent transaction.Figure 3: A fake request to \u201csign for\u201d your most recent incoming transaction, gathered from EtherscanApproach #3: Cloning MetaMask\u2019s CSSA malicious site could take the CSS of the MetaMask pop-out and make an identical, interactive version that shows accurate details about your most recent transactions, like so:Figure 4: A fake pop-out showing how easy it is so spoof the full MetaMask behaviorThe phony pop-out would populate itself with your transaction history from Etherscan, with the exception of your most recent transaction, which the pop-out would maliciously claimed failed. The pop-out could then encourage you to re-issue the same transaction, swapping out only the destination address in the new transaction. This is identical to how MetaMask would show a real transaction failing when you click the extension.Part 2: A Locked MetaMaskBrowsing the web with a locked MetaMask does not expose any of your MetaMask addresses to any sites. However, it does tell every site you visit that you are a MetaMask user.Approach #4: Coercing the User to Unlock Their Real MetaMaskAs mentioned earlier, visiting a site with an unlocked MetaMask means that site (along with every tab you have open) will know your wallet address, its balance, its tokens, and all of your transaction history. For an advertiser, this might be their entire goal. For an attacker, this information makes phishing the user significantly easier.EthWalletSecurity interactively demonstrates how a phony notification for an incoming transaction would likely be enough for a user to unlock their MetaMask, and thus expose their wallet address, balance, and transaction history.Figure 5: A fake notification encouraging a user to unlock their MetaMaskApproach #5: Phishing the UserThe alternative to having the user open their real MetaMask is to create a fake MetaMask popout for the user to enter their password, seed phrase, or unencrypted private keys. Having a password is valuable, but an attacker would still need access to the user\u2019s encrypted private keys. Having the user\u2019s seed phrase or unencrypted private keys is game over for the user.Approach #6: The Timing AttackAs mentioned in this blog post by co-founder John Backus, the malicious site can wait in the background until it detects you have unlocked MetaMask in a different tab. Presumably, you unlocked MetaMask in another tab because you were expecting to make a transaction on that site, whether a dApp or exchange. Since MetaMask does not tell you from which site a transaction originated, the malicious site (no longer the tab you\u2019re currently viewing) can present you a transaction immediately upon detecting you unlocked your MetaMask, tricking you into thinking it came from the site you expected.EthWalletSecurity provides users a chance to experience this timing attack firsthand. You can recreate this attack yourself by visiting the site with a locked MetaMask extension. Once on the site, open a different tab to a different site, and unlock your MetaMask there. Despite being in the background, EthWalletSecurity detects that you have unlocked your MetaMask in a different tab and presents you with a transaction immediately upon your unlocking!Concluding ThoughtsBloom is committed to making interacting with Ethereum dApps more secure, whether from a Chrome extension or from the command-line.We encourage you to explore EthWalletSecurity and learn more about your wallet security. The site is highly interactive. Interacting with EthWalletSecurity from a locked MetaMask shows you different content and attack vectors than when you visit it from an unlocked wallet. We encourage users to learn about both sets of attack vectors, and to stay vigilant when issuing transactions.", "responses": 6, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Metamask", "Ethereum", "Security", "Developers"]}, {"title": "How to Join AI Crypto Pre-Sales and ICO Using MetaMask", "post_link": "https://medium.com/aicrypto/how-to-join-ai-crypto-pre-sales-and-ico-using-metamask-783e0ce22f51?source=search_post---------8", "author_name": "AIC_Sharon", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@AIC_SharonS", "publish_date": "2018-05-07", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-17", "readtime": "2.38", "claps": 600, "voters": 87, "content": "How to Join AI Crypto Pre-Sales and ICO Using MetaMaskAIC_SharonFollowMay 7, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readHello!

This is already done by exchanges like 0x and EtherDelta, and is summarized in our recent article Scaling Web3 with SignTypedData.Beyond that, we\u2019re probably waiting for other blockchain scaling solutions like Plasma and Sharding to reach production, both of which rely on Proof of Stake, which is one of the reasons that it\u2019s so important for this ecosystem to grow.We hope this overview has been helpful!", "responses": 7, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "Cryptokitties", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Setting up MetaMask for the Gimmer Token Sale", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@GimmerBot/setting-up-metamask-for-the-gimmer-token-sale-2c8242ae4b27?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gimmer", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@GimmerBot", "publish_date": "2018-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-05", "readtime": "1.82", "claps": 1315, "voters": 48, "content": "Setting up MetaMask for the Gimmer Token SaleIn this short guide, you will learn how to setup an ERC-20 wallet using MetaMask, which you can use to receive your Gimmer Tokens (GMR) during the Gimmer Presale and Token Sale!GimmerFollowJan 11, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readPlease note: this guide is for only setting up MetaMask, to navigate here to read the full Token Sale Guide!01.1 Adding the MetaMask Plugin to ChromeNavigate to MetaMask\u2019s website and click on \u201cGet Chrome Plugin\u201d (we advise you to use Chrome for this).Click on the blue button \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d.

There were lots of fascinating talks about the future of Ethereum and wallet software.One of the most important takeaways for me came from Dan Finlay, one of the creators of MetaMask. I want to make sure dapp developers know one thing:MetaMask plans to phase out the injection of Web3.jsToday, the MetaMask Browser Extension automatically inserts a Javascript file into every single web page you visit. This allows dapp developers to talk to Ethereum via the MetaMask wallet quickly and easily.Right click on this page, click Inspect Element, and search for Web3 to find it.There are several drawbacks to the current approach. Most of them circle around users\u2019 privacy. As Dan puts it:MetaMask currently shows the selected account to each site that is visited. This is not an acceptable privacy feature, and user adoption has escalated the urgency of addressing this issue.It has also been also criticized that the web3 API is visible at all, even to sites a user did not explicitly show it to, since this also provides some identifying information.We need to shift away from doing this. It will require dapp developers to make changes to their apps. It is best to do this now while the number of daily active dapp users is fewer than a million.John Backus, from Bloom, even worries that advertisers might be targeting people based on their Ethereum holdings:I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some advertisers are already collecting this information. The information is rather easy to collect and has significant use in terms of targeting cryptocurrency holders.Using an In-Browser Ethereum Wallet? Here\u2019s Some Things You Should KnowWhile developing the Bloom dApp, we frequently stumble across noteworthy design considerations of the platforms we are\u2026blog.hellobloom.ioWhat we need is a system where users can opt in to connect their wallet to the web. That is exactly what the team at MetaMask have been working on:https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/714We think this flow is a huge improvement for users and developers. We should not be shy about making breaking changes to dapps now: no one is using them.It will dappen. Give it time.At Balance, our goal is to make it easier for people to make and use dapps. We recently released WalletConnect, our solution for getting dapps and wallets to talk to each other more easily. A large part of that project is WalletConnect.js, a drop-in library for developers to make it easier for them to add support for lots of wallets to their web-based dapps.This is the popup that dapp developers can use from WalletConnect.jsThe flow for people logging in to dapps will then be very simple and safe. You can opt in to a dapp, connect your wallet and interact with a dapp. Here is a mockup of what it would look like if you were using CryptoKitties and the Balance Wallet app.Demonstrating the nitty gritty with the kittiesThe plan is to introduce this change in stages. As Dan puts it:I think we also agreed at the WalletConf that it could make sense to ease-in to this breaking change, by allowing end-users (who understand the new expectation of deliberately signing in) to first \u201cenable\u201d full-web3-stealth-mode.Once we have that live, and enable the \u201crequest login\u201d API, hopefully Dapp devs will see the new API as beneficial to migrate to, before we perform a hard break.We will make sure that WalletConnect.js is ready for developers.

Today we\u2019ll dive into a few malicious APKs in the Android ecosystem that are targeting cryptocurrency users.For each of these APKs, I used the jadx decompiler to see what the code is doing.A fake Trezor wallet \u2014 com.trezorwalletinc.cryptocurrencyPhishfort notified me of a fake Trezor app in the Google Play Store. We decided to investigate.The Google Play Store product pageI wanted to see if the app was Trezor-branded throughout, so I downloaded the app using BlueStack4 and gave it a whirl.Surprisingly, the splash screen is branded differently, but the icon is still branded as \u201cTrezor Wallet.\u201dThe splash screen on the left and the home screen on the right after signing up with an email and password.This piqued my interest, as they are using the Trezor branding to get downloads but are offering a completely different product (branding wise).I ran the APK through HTBridge and their report told me it contacted a foreign domain coinwalletinc.com, which was registered earlier this year.$ whois coinwalletinc.com   Domain Name: COINWALLETINC.COM   Registry Domain ID: 2355647446_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN   Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.namecheap.com   Registrar URL: http://www.namecheap.com   Updated Date: 2019-01-26T12:53:03Z   Creation Date: 2019-01-26T12:51:09Z   Registry Expiry Date: 2020-01-26T12:51:09Z   Registrar: NameCheap, Inc.

Using jadx decompiler and analysis tools, here\u2019s what we found:Since you need to use the app with an email and password, which suggests the wallet is custodial, I decided to look into sources/com/wallet/cryptocurrency/ActivityPackage/LoginActivity.java and I noticed a couple of things\u2026When you try to log in, it sends a request to coinwalletinc.com/nf5/index.php \u2014 which has a particular unprofessional default JSON response:They are also exposing their error_log, which can be handy at gaining some intelligence \u2014 we know they are using a MySQL database to store things, and using the PHP mysqli API to interact with it. We can also guess that the earliest hit was 2019\u201302\u201301.Anyway, after it authenticates you, it populates some strings in the app for your wallet balances, email, and name.Throughout the code, in multiple files, it looks like they forgot to alter some of the StringRequest parameters, as the URL is a placeholder. For example:See line reference 209Pretty bizarre \u2014 surely this wouldn\u2019t even pass UAT.Anyway, I look to my receiving BTC address because \u201cI want to start using this as a wallet because it has a really nice UI\u201d \u2026It looks like the receiving address is hard-coded in the application to display and set the text of the clipboard.Notice the seciliKod parameter \u2014 1Lsj9BGpB3Nv15id9FWP71SRKKUFJPepfP0In fact, there is a method stub to create an address for the user, but it is only a stub.The method stub for creating a user addressI created an account, grabbed a list of receiving addresses, uninstalled the app, reinstalled the app, created a fresh account, and grabbed a list of the receiving addresses.

Looking at the way it handles the response, we can see it grabs the user addresses from the backend and puts them into the fragment properties and then commits them to the deviceSharedPreferences \u2014 a completely custodial wallet (not your keys, not your coins) with dodgy branding to bring in downloads.More fake wallets \u2014 com.coin.mycrypto, com.exchange.idex, com.wallet.metamaskWe were recently notified on our Discord channel about a MyCrypto APK being indexed on search engines. It\u2019s not on the Play Store, so you\u2019d need to download it from a third-party store.Again, we decompiled the APK to investigate, and it\u2019s a simple branded phishing screen that uploads your secrets to a Firebase instance.I remember being notified about a MetaMask one last year with very similar functionality, so I decided to search for a couple more\u2026The decompiled code for these are all very similar (only minor differences due to branding) but they function the same \u2014 all pushing secrets to (different) Firebase instances.See line 23, 47, and 51 for login inserting into the Firebase instanceThe Firebase instances are open, so let\u2019s see what has been phished from these malicious APKs:Mnemonic phrasesPrivate keysKeystore files & passwordsEmail addressesWe can graph when the phished addresses were last \u201cseen\u201d by the network, and get a clue on how active the backend was monitored and what timeframe the phishers were most active.A total of 244 unique secrets were phished for the 3 malicious APKs ( com.coin.mycrypto , com.exchange.idex, com.wallet.metamask ) and we scanned the first 5 paths for all mnemonic phrases for mainnet network activity \u2014 a total of 302 phished addresses.We can use DuneAnalytics to graph the activity of these addresses and see when they were last active (minus any WHG_1 sweep activity). The earliest activity on these addresses was at block 5,084,303.Surprisingly, a lot of them are active pretty recently, and the most recent was in block 7,759,898. Coincidentally, the address was involved in another type of phishing scam that Dave and I covered back in November 2017 \u2014read: is this a phishing scam? \u2014 and similar was covered by r/cryptopolice in 2018.When we run our query at the time of block 7,760,355 \u2014 we get some nice data (this is a dump of the first 15 results \u2014 see more on the DuneAnalytics Dashboard).address: 0x7f893d78d2e7d4667c3c068b4129525a29047f8eblock: 7,759,898address: 0x5e9ee17f885d4f330fcb5d795bd0d327b879a825block: 7,748,166address: 0x05475a982140d70026662270d51e1dadf85d87b1block: 7,745,323address: 0xfb17695c25ce2fafedcb158d0649fbde1f2f8137block: 7,742,000address: 0xba47a8098636cb62c22948a74a8622ebb6313db7block: 7,741,993address: 0x242868db6074fa6428bc25187c3d6fa29eb3a17cblock: 7,741,984address: 0x70928cf142dd54443812c3e5593df84d0fae2598block: 7,741,980address: 0xff80ea0919affce235534297e5cd0e81d54914ebblock: 7,741,962address: 0x498dc72d94d230a2f6a9fe53a4837b3e50352458block: 7,741,954address: 0xe366f2d6a219561d88f27c3d50a842ff5bd5aef6block: 7,741,941address: 0xf48f3fb224e7e584648f9af1ae167ff99e22aeb1block: 7,741,933address: 0xf95326cc928a241102085bb02d1e886e8e8ffb5bblock: 7,741,914address: 0x697169b1e871e7f3c0b2801110e072eabe32e3a8block: 7,741,912address: 0x2d0afa35b1542ab39321d599cf5122af0bf3fde4block: 7,741,909address: 0x6499a1e10693ed7daba1ebb4b8402a1ee29a7deeblock: 7,741,909As these APKs are a year old, the sweep addresses have mostly been identified.For example, this transaction where the sender private key was found in com.exchange.idex Firebase instance goes to a marked Etherscan address ( Fake_Phishing397 ) which has 20 inputs from the phished addresses (not counting token transfers){   \"address\": \"0xa319fb522330d8fa3f82d8e6e5a3365e9241d618\",   \"msg\": \"This account was compromised in a fake Idex andriod app - Harry\",   \"sig\": \"0x654fa929992c74091080989fe67ac46e4268bf9f63b92e33fd47a2461f41ad5f3937ee46de212a1c022894af53e05ee7495ef410bd98a891fa7e7d40325901111b\",   \"version\": \"2\" }A 2019 MetaMask phishing appWhilst looking at the APKs above, I came across another MetaMask APK that was published in 2019 \u2014 looking at it, it behaves different to the others.This application behaves differently because instead of directly interacting with a Firebase instance to store keys, it actually loads a Ngrok server with webview, imitating the MetaMask UI to phish for keys.Lines 61 and 62What\u2019s super interesting is that Ngrok provides a tunnel to a localhost \u2014 and can be closed and opened at will. Because of this, it\u2019s very hard to investigate.This type of infastructure to phish users isn\u2019t new, we saw it being used on Cryptopia users, which I tweeted about (see embedded thread below), and to phish users keys under the guise of testing a new exchange.How can I keep my cryptocurrency safe?There are a lot of attack vectors that a cryptocurrency user needs to be aware of so they can best adjust to keep their funds safe and secure \u2014 we have an extensive guide written, but let\u2019s focus on mobile wallets.Only download reputable wallets from trusted stores (i.e, App Store, Play Store).Seek out the legitimate app for the brand you want to use \u2014 if they don\u2019t have an application advertised, they don\u2019t have one published, so don\u2019t trust a random someone on Discord telling you xyz is legitimate.Use a mobile wallet as a hot wallet, like you\u2019d treat physical cash notes. Don\u2019t store more than you\u2019re willing to lose \u2014 it\u2019s not cold storage.If you\u2019re looking for a reliable mobile wallet, check out Ambo! The Ambo team are now part of MyCrypto and dedicated to onboarding and building for those who aren\u2019t too familiar with cryptocurrency.Ambo uses the standardized procedure for exporting a keystore, something that the user is already familiar with. In a trustworthy wallet, the developer will encrypt the keystore in secure storage within the device. For people who are not familiar with the keystore process, Ambo walks our new users through the steps of preventing the loss of funds.Support Future Research & ContentPurchase through our affiliate links:LedgerTrezorKeepKeyTalk To Us & Share Your ThoughtsTwitterDiscordMediumGitHubHelp & SupportRedditFacebookPeepethLinkedInPress Inquiries", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Security", "Blockchain", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "MetaMask Hackathon Guide", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-hackathon-guide-a88a161416ce?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@danfinlay", "publish_date": "2017-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-11", "readtime": "2.41", "claps": 576, "voters": 92, "content": "MetaMask Hackathon GuideDan FinlayFollowOct 20, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readIf you\u2019re new to developing for Ethereum and MetaMask, it can be a daunting task!

Check it out!Your First Smart ContractIf you want to get your feet wet with your first smart contracts, a popular language at the moment is Solidity. You can always get the full docs for solidity on The Solidity Docs Site.There are a ton of tutorials on Solidity out there, but a some that we\u2019re fans of are:Learning Solidity series by Karl Floersch.Getting Started as an Ethereum Web Developer by Alex Miller.For messing around & trying out your first Solidity code, you can\u2019t do much better than a zero-install, in-browser IDE like The Remix Solidity Editor.Remix lets you write, deploy, and even interact with your first smart contracts, either on a virtual local virtual machine, or onto a live network!If you find your code is in need of automated testing, and a more mature deploy process, there are a variety of Solidity frameworks to choose from:Truffle (Full framework, includes UI building tools)Dappsys (Small, modular systems for deploying Solidity)OpenZeppelin (A suite of common, reusable smart contracts)Embark (Full stack framework, includes UI development)Building an Ethereum User InterfaceThere are a lot of ways that users might interact with a blockchain, and some applications (like Internet of Things) might not have an interface at all, but for a hackathon, there are few kinds of interfaces as easy to get up and running as a web UI with MetaMask.MetaMask takes two of the hardest parts of building an Ethereum interface, and provides you a simple API so you don\u2019t have to think about them:User account management.Communication with a trusted blockchain data source.Both of these things are provided via the web3 API, and when MetaMask is installed on a user\u2019s browser, it can be easily detected in every page load:if (typeof window.web3 !== 'undefined') {  // This user has MetaMask, or another Web3 browser installed!  var ethereumProvider = web3.currentProvider  }The web3 API is primarily exposed as the EthereumProvider object, and usually you\u2019ll initialize your favorite abstraction with it.For example, if you were using the web3.js library, your initialization, and looking up a user\u2019s balance might look like this:var Web3 = require('web3') // The web3.js libraryvar myWeb3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider)myWeb3.getAccounts(function (err, accounts) {  myWeb3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0], function (err, balance) {    console.log('Your balance is ' + Web3.fromWei(balance, 'ether'))     })})Or if you prefer promises, you might use EthJS, where the same lookup might look like this:var Eth = require('ethjs')var eth = new Eth(web3.currentProvider)eth.accounts().then((accounts) => {  const account = accounts[0]return eth.getBalance(account)}).then((balance) => {  console.log('Your balance is ' + Eth.fromWei(balance, 'ether'))})There are a variety of JavaScript libraries for interacting with smart contracts via the web3.currentProvider, so when asking for help, always make sure to specify what libraries you\u2019re using. Maybe ask the library\u2019s own experts!For general MetaMask API best practices, we try to keep this Developer FAQ up to date.Live Web ExamplesI\u2019ve started collecting live, editable, in-browser examples using WebpackBin, so you can see how some real apps might be assembled.

But now, you do not need to transfer ethers or tokens to MetaMask before dealing with contracts, cutting off one time-consuming task!Moreover, since Trezor guards your private keys, you no longer need to rely on MetaMask to keep your keys safe. Your keys remain only in your Trezor, protected by the hardware.* For complete \u00d0App support, the \u00d0App developer must first implement this integration.So, how does this work?Using MetaMask with TrezorOnce you connect an Ethereum account from your Trezor device, it will be shown in MetaMask as a \u201cTrezor\u201d account. Upon opening it in the app, you will see its entire transaction history, balance, etc.However, when you want to sign a transaction or a message, or execute any operation using keys stored in your Trezor device, MetaMask will send that request to your Trezor, and you will have to approve the action on your device.All operations involving your keys, including signing, happens inside your Trezor device. Your keys are never exposed.You can disconnect your Trezor after importing your account, and your transaction history will be remembered in MetaMask, as the app stores the public key to your connected account. To delete your history from the app, disconnect your account in MetaMask settings. Your account balance will remain intact.The following animations capture the Trezor Model T emulator to illustrate the workflow.Sending transactions using MetaMaskNote that the operation has to be confirmed on the Trezor device.SourceSigning messages \u2014 example with CryptoKittiesNote that the message can be reviewed on the Trezor device.SourceLet\u2019s get started!Download the latest version of MetaMask and install it in Google Chrome (the only supported browser at the moment).Use the beta interface for now. How?Click on the account icon at the top right corner and select \u201cConnect Hardware Wallet\u201d.Plug in your Trezor and click on \u201cConnect Trezor\u201d.Trezor Connect will pop up, with a request to export public key.

These users reported that they had been locked out of their MetaMask accounts, and when entering their recovery seed phrases they were given different Ethereum accounts from the accounts they had previously associated with that seed phrase.These users have our sincerest concern, and we wouldn\u2019t wish this experience on anyone. We\u2019ve done a good amount of internal exploration of potential causes to these reports, but these 17 cases remain mysterious.What You Should DoAlthough this issue affects a very small subset of the Metamask user base (about 1% of 1%), in the interest of exercising extreme caution and transparency, we advise all users to re-verify their seed phrases immediately. This step is necessary even if you have previously backed up your seed phrase before. Here\u2019s how.Please let us know via email or our support portal if the seed phrase you see is different than the phrase you originally backed up.What We SuspectIn the worst case scenario, this could mean that some users were shown an incorrect seed phrase to back up their current accounts, and should re-verify their seed phrases immediately. It could also be user error via a mis-written seed phrase, or some other confusion, but since we cannot verify the cause, we want to be as safe as possible by involving the community in this effort.This does not mean that anyone\u2019s accounts have been compromised by any external malicious individuals. If this is a real bug, it probably either exists in our core MetaMask Controller, or our main Keyring Controller. The bug would need to initially show a user one seed phrase, and after their confirmation, generate a fresh vault, and use it to generate their accounts.Although MetaMask data is stored locally on each device and is encrypted with the user\u2019s password, if your computer has a storage glitch, you will need to restore with your seed phrase, and if you have written the wrong seed phrase, you will lose all of your current accounts. That\u2019s why we are asking all of our users to take precautions and back up their seed phrases again. Even if you backed up your seed phrase originally.BountiesFurthermore, we are issuing a pair of our very first bug bounties for anyone who can identify a related issue in MetaMask on GitCoin and on Bounties.network. We will be occasionally increasing these bounties, and are starting small out of caution for these new platforms.If you are concerned about this issue but are not affected, you can contribute to these public bounties via bounties.network or Gitcoin. To be eligible for the bug bounties, a bounty-hunter must be able to reproduce behavior where a user is shown a different seed phrase than is used to generate their first accounts. This can be done through automated tests of our code or through manual reproduction steps.Finally, we will be hosting an AMA on /r/ethereum on MetaMask\u2019s key storage and account generation code for interested bounty-hunters in two days, on Wednesday, November 15, 2017 starting at 11am PST. The AMA is available here.In ConclusionWe thank the community for their cooperation, understanding, and help.

Overall, this has been a painless experience, but I have found a few gotchas that I want to share. Hopefully this will save some developers time in the future.1. Make sure your Ethereum client is up to dateMy first roadblock came from an error that I discovered in the transaction popup window. For some reason, when I hit \u201caccept\u201d to send my transaction, I was greeted by an endlessly spinning orange circle. Upon expanding the popup\u2019s console, I saw:AssertionError: The field v must have byte length of 1 at FakeTransaction.setter [as v]Hmmm\u2026 what does that mean?I pinged Kumavis on slack and he told me it was related to EIP155, which was just recently supported. Any older version of testrpc would lack this support, so I upgraded and things worked fine:npm i -g ethereumjs-testrpc2. Reset your network every time you reboot testrpcAnother testrpc problem! Once you open up metamask and type in your password, you are connected to that provider. If you switch providers (e.g. from main net to kovan) and refresh the page, it will reset your connection and you will need to enter your password again.But what happens if you reset testrpc? You should still be listening to localhost:8545, but you\u2019ll find that once you refresh the page, things won\u2019t look right. In fact, things will look very, very wrong.This is because metamask is tracking the block number and when you reboot testrpc that number resets to zero. This is a recipe for disaster. Fortunately, there\u2019s a relatively easy way to avoid this: whenever you reboot testrpc, open up metamask and re-select localhost:8545 as your provider. Now refresh your page, click on metamask, and type your password. Voila! You\u2019re connected to the new testrpc instance.3. Always check for typeof web3Your app will probably run into a race condition if you don\u2019t properly check for web3. If you try to render your actual app before web3 is injected, everything will break. So I highly recommend something like the following for your app\u2019s landing component (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re using react):if (typeof web3 == 'undefined') {  return (    <NoMetamask/>  );} else if (web3.version.network == 'loading') {  return (    <WrongNetwork/>  );} else {  return (    <Landing/>  );}Note that checking if (web3 !== undefined) or if (web3) or anything equivalent will not work. You need to compare the typeof the injected web3 object.4. Pack all your metamask calls into a util fileThis is may be more of a developer\u2019s preference than the other ones, but I strongly recommend abstracting all your metamask calls into one file because you will find yourself reusing metamask calls a lot. Rather than collapsing a bunch of copypasta versions of the same function later, why don\u2019t you just start with one metamask file in your util directory? And don\u2019t worry about not having access to web3: it\u2019s just a javascript object that you can pass around like a hot potato \u2014 it can go anywhere!// metamask.jsexports.doSomething = function(web3, param) {    // I have access to web3, even though I'm not in the DOM!    const user = web3.eth.accounts[0];  // Do stuff}5. Don\u2019t wait to advance the UX!I can\u2019t believe I still see this in production. As an ecosystem, we\u2019ve gotten better about this, but I want to extinguish it like smallpox. Please, people. Ethereum has a ~15s block time. That may seem fast in the blockchain world, but it is a lifetime in the world of fast, reactive web applications. And if you\u2019re using testrpc for development, you will probably find yourself forgetting how slow blockchains are. Do not forget how slow blockchains are. Say it out loud every day: \u201cWaiting for Ethereum transactions is a bad user experience.\u201dPlease please please don\u2019t make your users sit around twiddling their thumbs after submitting a transaction. It\u2019s so easy to handle a sendTransaction callback (which is a transaction hash) by dispatching that hash to a queue and periodically checking for a receipt on it. Consider the following:// metamask.jsexports.doSomething = function(web3, param) {  const user = web3.eth.accounts[0];  web3.eth.getTransactionCount(owner, (err, nonce) => {    // Form your tx object...    web3.eth.sendTransaction(obj, (err, res) => {      if (err) { cb(err); }      else { cb(null, res); }    })}// component.jsxcallMetamask() {  metamask.doSomething(web3, 'something', (err, result) => {    if (err) { console.log('Error doing something.') }    else { dispatch({ type: 'QUEUE_TXHASH', result: result }) }  })}With that hash in your queue, you can display it in the toolbar and the user can happily continue with your app while waiting for the transaction to go through.If it really is critical that the transaction is processed before advancing your UI (and you can honestly tell me this is the best UX flow you can think of), please give your users something exciting to look at \u2014 maybe the Ethereum whitepaper or this cat with a shower cap.6. Yes, it\u2019s really this easyThree weeks of heavy metamask development and these are really the only gripes I can come up with. Really, metamask is marvelous and easy to set up. Generally speaking, you should be good to go if you follow the rules/suggestions outlined above and properly reference the web3 API (remember to always use asynchronous calls \u2014 synchronous ones won\u2019t work in metamask).If you have a question, but it wasn\u2019t answered here, I recommend checking out the Ethereum stack exchange.\u2014If you like my articles, follow me on twitter or check out my company, ConsenSys, because we do awesome stuff.And, as always, there is an open invitation to join the Ethereum communityand help us conquer the world.Hacker Noon is how hackers start their afternoons.

Electron enables easy packaging for all desktop platforms.We need to access some system capabilities (eg Keybase).That was what pointed us to Electron. It would give us the security and user experience control that we aim for.Why MetaMaskIt\u2019s the easiest way to interact with Web3. A lot of people are already used to it in the ecosystem.No gigabyte download is needed to run it. This makes the FTUE (First Time User Experience) really smooth, as seen below.It\u2019s very user friendly. It still needs a lot of work on the UI/UX front, but it will progress.They have plans to become a light client, so AFAIK it won\u2019t need INFURA to work in the future.Our threat modelSince we\u2019re paranoid, our threat model is that no matter if the attacker managed to get malicious code inside Aragon, it could not attack the whole operating system or the user\u2019s wallet (MetaMask).By default Electron basically lets its contained application to execute any arbitrary NodeJS code, meaning that a successful attacker could effectively own your operating system.We removed this attack surface by turning nodeIntegration to false, so the dapp is as sandboxed as it would be running in a normal browser.We would run the code that requires operating system calls (eg the Keybase integration) in Electron\u2019s main process and leave the rest running in renderer processes (sandboxed).When disabling NodeJS integration, the standard way to do IPC in Electron is gone. So we had to develop our own safe, secure IPC method, called Intertron.Embedding MetaMaskMetaMask\u2019s build target are browser extensions. So how did we manage to embed a browser extension like MetaMask into our Electron app?We had to:Implement a lot of dummy APIs faking Chrome\u2019s so we didn\u2019t have to distanciate a lot from their codebase.Replace their default communication method between the extension and the webapp (using Ports) with an isolated, inter-origin communication using postMessage.Implement custom protocols so Aragon is served over aragon:// and MetaMask over metamask://. This way, we enforce different origins, thus providing full context isolation (eg there\u2019s no way the Aragon dapp can access MetaMask\u2019s private keys).Show MetaMask when we detect a transaction that needs user input.SummaryThere is a lot of work to be done in the ecosystem to advance how we package dapps from a security and easy of use standpoint.We want to thank the awesome team at MetaMask for their efforts, and look forward to continue working with them.You can check out our MetaMask fork, which I hope it won\u2019t exist for long and will eventually be a part of the upstream repo \ud83d\ude4c", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Decentralization", "Dapps", "Development"]}, {"title": "How to install MetaMask plugin and get a Ropsten Test Ethereum", "post_link": "https://blog.bankex.org/how-to-buy-ethereum-using-metamask-ccea0703daec?source=search_post", "author_name": "BANKEX", "author_link": "https://blog.bankex.org/@bankexcom", "publish_date": "2017-07-27", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-04", "readtime": "1.75", "claps": 728, "voters": 43, "content": "How to install MetaMask plugin and get a Ropsten Test EthereumBANKEXFollowJul 27, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readAfter reading this article, you should be able to buy Ropsten test Ethereum using MetaMask plugin.

In the case of the Car Token it\u2019s a real car and in the case of the Real Estate Token it could be a house, an office or any other building in some part of the world.First go to: http://dev-web-prototype-bankex.azurewebsites.net/ and click on the \u201cMenu\u201d button.Then click on the \u201cHome page\u201d button.Click \u201cCreate Asset\u201d.Click \u201cCar Token\u201d or \u201cReal Estate Token\u201d. For this demo we choose to click \u201cCar Token\u201d, let\u2019s say we want to tokenize a Volvo XC90 we own.Once you have finalized your choice of asset, click \u201cCreate Asset\u201d.Enter all the data about your car in the General Information field:The user will be responsible for the information provided. It will then be checked by BANKEX to ensure its legitimity.As a bonus the user can check that the car was used by a non-smoker. This information will then be checked by an IoT sensor designed specially for this purpose.Upload a real picture of your car and associated papers. Finally, click \u201cCreate\u201d.You will see a loading window.You will then see a MetaMask window pop up where you will need to click \u201cSubmit\u201d in order to create the Car Token. The fee will be around 0.011079 ETH.Finally, you get the smart asset details for your Car Token.BANKEX is available at:Website \u2014 Telegram \u2014 Twitter \u2014 Facebook \u2014 Bitcointalk \u2014 Youtube \u2014 LinkedIn \u2014 Reddit \u2014 GitHub \u2014 Steemit", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Fintech", "Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Boom"]}, {"title": "How Bounties Translated MetaMask", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metamask/how-bounties-translated-metamask-28179c5dabd0?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@danfinlay", "publish_date": "2018-03-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-11", "readtime": "2.95", "claps": 378, "voters": 28, "content": "How Bounties Translated MetaMaskDan FinlayFollowMar 21, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readA Story of MetaMask and GitcoinWe\u2019ve wanted to make MetaMask available to an international audience for a long time, but the adoption rate in Ethereum got to a point where we were really forced to spend much more of our time doing essential maintenance, like bug fixes, and getting the application working more smoothly, so translation initiative always seemed like something we weren\u2019t going to get around to until the project was either much more mature, or we had a much bigger team.We\u2019ve been trying to hire, as I think everyone in this space has been, and it\u2019s been really challenging to get people with the skill set to fully contribute to our project. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve been gradually learning to post bounties to Gitcoin on outstanding issues, and have had some pretty great early results with that strategy.It has been important for us to learn that bounties have well defined acceptance criteria.The first type we had great success with was bug bounties. A bug bounty is a classic way of creating a sort of incentivized diligence that can last beyond your immediate attention. Bug bounties are not the easiest to write criteria for, but if you have a suspected bug that you can\u2019t keep looking for, writing those terms is least you can do.The second type is fast bug fixes. When a bug is really bad, and causing people distress, you really can\u2019t fix it fast enough. Also, a bug fix is usually really easy to write acceptance criteria for (which turns out to be a big deal for a bounty), usually something like \u201creproduce the bug with a test, get the test passing\u201d. In these situations a fix bounty can make sense, although it\u2019s important to communicate to these bounty hunters that they\u2019re very much in a race, you\u2019re trying to fix it first, and they will only get paid if they deliver before you.The third type of bounty we\u2019ve begun to use is for small features. Lately, I think our experience with the other types of bounties (and some larger features, which have been a little messier to accept) has helped us develop a sense of what features are more bounty-achievable. We\u2019ve started using Github tags to mark these issues for discussion, and eventually posting bounties.I think our first feature bounty was a very small feature that lets people choose their account icon type in settings. Most people don\u2019t know about that feature yet, and honestly most people don\u2019t care, but some people care a lot about their icon type, so it was a nice gift to that community. A feature like that wasn\u2019t likely to make it high up our priority list, but someone was willing to complete it for a surprisingly small bounty, so it really got us thinking more about what old features might be bounty-able.Our roadmap has had to become a bit dynamic, to deal with the constantly changing ecosystem, but one thing that we\u2019ve always known we needed to do is translate to other languages. We posted the bounty mid-December, and by mid-January Nick Doiron had picked up the issue, and had his PR open a day later. That was it!It\u2019s a little sad, but we were so wrapped up with launching the beta for our new user interface, that we didn\u2019t even get to properly validate his contribution for another month after that, and after a few small tweaks to make sure it was working well, we merged it.Once we had merged in multiple language support from a bounty, it unblocked the path to all other translations, and what better way to get lots of different translations than with bounties from our community? A single tweet of publicity and we had something like 20 language requests, and 10 language pull requests. It\u2019s been total magic. Translating has easily been the easiest, and most community-involving bounty program we\u2019ve run so far, and I think the experience just has us asking more and more: What other issues could be bountied?MetaMask\u2019s translations are undergoing final merges and will appear in the beta UI of our next release.

We have since shipped a fix, so if you did not experience the issue, no further action is required.BackgroundOver the course of May 30\u201331st 2018, MetaMask rolled out version 4.7.0. to our users. Among other changes, this new version modified how we store account nicknames, to allow some of our architecture to evolve more easily.A side effect of this was a change to our data schema, and while updating our user interface to match it, a bug appeared that caused the account list to use the full nickname list to render available accounts. This full list included any accounts that had previously been used by this installation of MetaMask, even after the vault had been restored with a different seed phrase.ResponseUpon identifying this issue, we worked continuously until we produced a patch (#4486) that removed these invalid and historical account nicknames from the MetaMask storage, and reported the problem to a central server, where we\u2019ve been recording the number of affected users. The patch was then pushed to all clients via auto-update.Using the metrics we\u2019ve collected on this bug, we have estimated around 2000 installations of MetaMask were affected and automatically fixed. Most of these accounts were never used. A majority of the used accounts were barely used (less than $10 worth of ether), and most of the rest have some activity, implying they are safely backed up and usable on another computer.Finding the bug quickly was in part thanks to Mukesh Mali and Dhananjay Prajapati, who reported the issue to MetaMask and worked closely with us to help us resolve the problem as quickly as possible.To thank them for their contributions, and in the spirit of our bug bounty program, MetaMask has awarded them a bug bounty for their efforts.Were You Affected?To be affected by this bug, you would have to have:Used MetaMask over this weekend.Saw an account that you had never used, or hadn\u2019t seen in a long time, and did not have the backups for.Copied this account\u2019s address, and sent ether or tokens to it.If these things happened to you, you may have sent ether or tokens to an account that can not be recovered with your main seed phrase.It is possible that these accounts were associated with an older seed phrase that you used with MetaMask. If this is the case, make sure to back up your seed phrase again, to make sure you have all the latest info copied down safely.ConclusionMetaMask takes your account security very seriously. We began making this tool to empower people to use the decentralized web, and we can\u2019t deliver on that goal without protecting our users to the limits of our ability and the boundaries of this developing technology.If you ever experience an issue in MetaMask that cannot be easily explained, do not be afraid to open an issue on our GitHub, where we will continue to do our best to respond to pressing issues as quickly as possible.For other user support questions, feel free to reach out to us at support@metamask.io", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Security", "Ethereum", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "iExec Dev Letter #10: Metamask and Brand New Website \u2014 23 Oct 2017", "post_link": "https://medium.com/iex-ec/dev-letter-10-22d87ff615f6?source=search_post", "author_name": "Julien B\u00e9ranger", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@julienbrg", "publish_date": "2017-10-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-09", "readtime": "2.01", "claps": 398, "voters": 25, "content": "iExec Dev Letter #10: Metamask and Brand New Website \u2014 23 Oct 2017Julien B\u00e9rangerFollowOct 23, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readWelcome to the iExec Dev Letter #10.

I saw a tweet from Gitcoin/RT from MetaMask that this would be available.Nick: I have some experience with internationalization. In 2015 I wrote a multilingual Chrome app which was a finalist in a contest for USAID/All Children Reading. So I figured I had the unique relevant experience to solve this.Working The Issue Alongside MetaMask / ConsenSysNick went on to complete the largest chunk of the pull request later that day, with intermittent thoughts from the MetaMask team.Nick: [The MetaMask team] gave clear instructions, such as which branch to work from (since MetaMask was in the middle of a UI redesign). I\u2019m also happy they believed I could do it and let me run with it. I came back partway through for some feedback and got thumbs ups, though I didn\u2019t know if it was going alright and how it would get merged.Dan: It\u2019s a little sad, but we were so wrapped up with launching the beta for our new user interface, that we didn\u2019t even get to properly validate his contribution for another month after that, and after a few small tweaks to make sure it was working well, we merged it.Great contribution, Nick Doiron!Nick: There was sort of a long time where no one was working on it and I was starting my new job.

Trails are being blazed with decentralized applications built on the Ethereum blockchain, with the MetaMask extension providing a bridge to explore and handle decentralized applications (Dapps) from a web browser.Following the October 2017 ETHWaterloo Hackathon, Brave became the first desktop web browser to suggest MetaMask upon visiting any Web3 site. Brave users see a notification that offers enabling MetaMask to view the content:Brave\u2019s MetaMask integration enables an additional level of awareness for mainstream users, providing notifications as they encounter sites that contain Dapps. Brave users don\u2019t simply browse, they discover and explore the blockchain ecosystem.Brave\u2019s MetaMask extension can also be installed via Settings even if the user does not initially visit a Web3 site. With the flip of a switch, Brave opens up a new world of decentralized applications, and the ability to connect with the Ethereum blockchain:What are Dapps?The State of the DApps, a curated list of over 1320 decentralized apps, defines decentralized applications as:\u2026applications which run on a P2P network of computers, instead of one computer. They are considered to be a form of software program designed to function on the internet without being controlled by a single entity. \u00d0Apps can have front-end code and user interfaces written in any language, just like a traditional application, which can make calls to its backend.What is MetaMask?MetaMask is an account manager for Web3 applications, and it allows users to run Ethereum Dapps in their browser without running a full Ethereum node. Instead of trusting websites to manage your accounts, MetaMask allows you use your own Ethereum-based accounts on sites you visit, allowing everything from payments, fundraising, voting, peer to peer trading, and so much more, all without paying fractional transfer fees to middle-men, and with explicit, client-side user consent, so that no site can ever perform an action or transfer without the user\u2019s approval. Users new to Dapps or Ethereum should view this video or peruse an introduction guide to get familiar with MetaMask before initiating their first transaction.How MetaMask Works in BraveWith Brave, you can be up-and-running with MetaMask in only a few seconds. Start by navigating to Preferences (CMD+, on macOS, Ctrl+, on Windows) and open the Extensions tab. From there, enable MetaMask and wait for the download and setup process to complete. Once the extension has been loaded, a new tab will open to MetaMask\u2019s How it Works page.Opening MetaMask for the first time (via the newly-placed icon near your address bar) will present you with the option of creating a new wallet or importing the seed terms for a pre-existing account. Once your account has been established, you can proceed to deposit Ether or begin exploring Dapps.As you browse the web, the MetaMask extension will inject a bit of code into every website, exposing the web3 API, and enabling Dapps to communicate with the MetaMask extension itself.Brave will inform you when you\u2019ve navigated to a Dapp if MetaMask isn\u2019t already enabled. If MetaMask is enabled, pages will be able to prompt you to login, initiate transactions, and more!Three Neat Things You Can Do with Brave and MetaMaskPost bounties on GitHub issues with GitCoin.Make peer-to-peer trades with Airswap.io.CryptoKitties!Other options include registering names on ENS, which could eventually be used to link to websites, and using Aragon for transparency when managing an organization.More details about leading Dapps can be found here:http://www.stateofthedapps.com/Case Study: Using MetaMask in Brave with AirSwap.io for P2P Token TradingIn this case study, we\u2019ll illustrate how a user can access AirSwap.io to purchase a Basic Attention Token (BAT) with Ethereum (ETH) using MetaMask in Brave.The user begins by navigating to https://www.airswap.io/trade.Brave notifies the user that AirSwap contains a Dapp, which can be accessed if MetaMask is enabled.The user clicks to install MetaMask, and checks the box to remember the decision for future use.Once enabled, the MetaMask icon appears next to the Brave shield menu icon.The user clicks on the MetaMask icon, and enters their MetaMask password to access their account.In this case study, the user already has some ETH in their MetaMask account.The user then clicks on the Connect button on the AirSwap page to open the wallet connection options.The user selects MetaMask from the wallet connection options.The user clicks the Sign button to allow the connection between AirSwap and MetaMask from the MetaMask menu.Once the connection has been established, the user selects BAT from the token options, and places a request to sellers to purchase 1 BAT.AirSwap searches for available sellers, and presents an offer to purchase the token.The user agrees to the offer in AirSwap, and then clicks Submit to confirm the offer in MetaMask.AirSwap then completes the purchase, and confirms success.The user can view the successful transaction in MetaMask, and also view the transaction from Etherscan.If the user wishes to view different tokens in MetaMask, they can also add the BAT contract address in the Token menu, and see the BAT they have purchased in MetaMask.FutureWe\u2019ll soon be announcing deeper integration with MetaMask and Ethereum in general with a built-in ETH Wallet, so stay tuned!A special thank you to Dan Finlay, Lead Developer from MetaMask, for his collaboration on this blog.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Brave Browser", "Metamask", "Basic Attention Token", "Ethereum Blockchain"]}, {"title": "MetaMask Tutorial to Get your AppCoins", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@appcoins/metamask-tutorial-to-get-your-appcoins-f1394ec3e1d4?source=search_post", "author_name": "AppCoins Official", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@appcoins", "publish_date": "2017-12-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-14", "readtime": "0.95", "claps": 290, "voters": 17, "content": "MetaMask Tutorial to Get your AppCoinsAppCoins OfficialFollowDec 13, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readQuicklinksHow to Buy AppCoins using MEWHow to Configure MEW to Show Your AppCoinsHow to Buy AppCoins using Metamask1.

2017 \u00b7 5 min readThe AppCoins pre-sale is bullish, and there are only 3 days left to enter and get 30% discount on token price, until we hit the deadline on Monday, November 20th, 2017. We\u2019ve compiled a complete guide on how to participate here, but we thought we\u2019d make it easier and faster for you to buy your AppCoin tokens using MetaMask.MetaMask is more than just an Ether wallet, it is rather an Ethereum browser that allows you all the same functions, features and ease of access from regular Ethereum Wallets, and all without the need to download the blockchain or install any software. With MetaMask, you can just install it as a Google Chrome Extension, and you\u2019re good to purchase those tokens you\u2019ve been wanting to buy.Prerequisites:To follow this guide, you will need:A web browser.A certain amount of ether in the account that you control. Please notice, only ETH will be accepted for the AppCoins ICO.Getting StartedIf you don\u2019t have a ERC20-compatible address to send from, or ether (ETH) to contribute, start from Step 1. Otherwise, go to Step 5.Step 1: Creating an accountFirst type \u201cmetamask chrome extension\u201d in to Google, and click the link that begins with https://chrome.google.com. You will be taken to the install page, where you can click \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d.Now you will see the Metamask fox in your browser tab.Click it to open your wallet.You will be prompted to create a secure password for your Metamask account. Make sure that the Ethereum Main Net network is selected (on the top left corner).Step 3: Importing an AccountIf you have a private key or JSON file for a wallet already, you can import that wallet in to Metamask. Simply click \u201c\u2263\u201d at the top right, choose \u201cImport Account\u201d.You will need to input your raw private key into the \u201cprivate\u201d key field, or the typical JSON keystore file. Otherwise, you can select Create Account to generate a new one.Step 4: Getting EtherTo be able to participate in the ICO, you will need to have some ether (ETH) in an account that you control. You can buy ETH from different cryptocurrency exchanges.Important Security RemindersDO NOT send ETH directly from an exchange, otherwise your tokens might never be recovered.There is no need to increase default gas price (or the value you are used to). Unless there is an unusual traffic in the Ethereum network, 30 GWEI should be enough to get the transaction confirmed in a few minutes.Step 5: Buying AppCoin TokensThe pre-sale is open until November 20th, or whenever the supply of tokens reaches zero.Please ensure you are on our official and secure website. Our website address is: https://appcoins.io/presale .This is the main page of https://appcoins.io. You\u2019ll see the \u201cGet AppCoins Now\u201d button. Click it, and you\u2019ll be taken to our onboarding page.This is the beginning of the pre-sale contribution process. You can find if you\u2019re eligible here. We require all contributors a small KYC composed by name, last name, date of birth, nationality, country of residence and passport/National ID number. Please noticed that this is only for registration purposes. Once you have done so, hit \u201cNext\u201d.This screen presents you with a dropdown list of compatible ERC20 token wallets. Please select the wallet you would like to use from the dropdown \u2014 for the purposes of this tutorial, we will stick with MetaMask. Click \u201cContinue\u201d when you have selected your compatible wallet.MetaMask has made it easy for all of us, by filling in the information automaically. This means that after you log in on the MetaMask chrome extension, you won\u2019t need to fill in any of the information, as it will be automatically added based on the information you provided on previous steps.To purchase AppCoin tokens, all you will need to do is to send a transaction to the address listed on the page, with the amount of ETH you want to contribute. In order to do so, just open Metamask and click \u201cSend\u201d, and paste in the address copied from our contribution page.

You can use your Metamask seeds words, or an address private key.Let\u2019s get started using seed words.Install the Nifty Wallet chrome extension from the chrome store here.2. Click the extension in the top right of your browser and accept the T&Cs.3. Choose Import Existing Den and paste your Metamask seeds words into the Nifty Wallet.4. Choose a password, and that\u2019s it! You can now use your same addresses on both networks.Nifty Wallet is a fork of MetaMask that can also use POA NetworkImporting a private key from Metamask is even easier.Log into Metamask and from the menu beside your account, choose: Export Private Key.2. Enter your password and click the button to copy your key to the clipboard.3. Open Nifty Wallet, choose Import Account from the user menu (top right).4. You can then paste the key into the wallet and you are all set!Your key imported account will have red tag.You are now ready to start also using the POA Network for fast, cheap transactions and of course to play great games like DopeRaider here.To find out more and meet us come to:Website: https://doperaider.com/Discord: https://discord.gg/trEA8AY Telegram: https://t.me/DopeRaiderEmail: team@doperaider.comTwitter: https://twitter.com/doperaiderReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/doperaider/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DopeRaider/Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/playdoperaider/?hl=enMedium: https://medium.com/@DopeRaider", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Dapps", "Cryptocurrency", "Games"]}, {"title": "Getting started with CryptoKitties Part One: MetaMask!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/cryptokitties/getting-started-with-cryptokitties-part-one-metamask-540beb54ed44?source=search_post", "author_name": "CryptoKitties", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@CryptoKitties", "publish_date": "2018-04-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-17", "readtime": "2.98", "claps": 219, "voters": 15, "content": "Getting started with CryptoKitties Part One: MetaMask!CryptoKittiesFollowApr 13, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readIf you\u2019ve already been to our FAQ page, you know by now that to play CryptoKitties, you need a desktop or laptop computer, some ether (Ethereum cryptocurrency), and a Metamask account. Hopefully, you didn\u2019t have too much trouble buying ether, and we recommend using Coinbase as the easiest cryptocurrency wallet (for US players). Metamask, however, needs some further instruction, and the CryptoKitties team wants to help you get started, because we know you\u2019re dying to collect and breed your own adorable litter of Kitties!Installing MetaMaskGo to https://www.cryptokitties.co/sign-in and click on \u201cInstall MetaMask\u201d. MetaMask is a digital wallet, and you need it to play CryptoKitties. A digital wallet acts like a bank account \u2014 treat it with care and respect, and make sure you don\u2019t forget your password or lose your seed words \u2014 we can\u2019t stress this enough. Without your seed words, there is no way of getting access back to your wallet.Once you\u2019ve installed MetaMask, go back to our website and click on \u201cI have installed MetaMask\u201d.Click on the MetaMask extension button in your browser (usually located in your toolbar at the top) and \u201cAgree\u201d to the conditions. After accepting the conditions, a window will pop up and prompt you to create a new wallet.Choose a password and click on \u201cCreate\u201d. As easy as that, you\u2019ve created your vault. Congrats! But you\u2019re not done yet.Make a backup of the seed words. If you don\u2019t have a backup of your seed words, no one can get you back in if anything goes wrong. Once you\u2019ve made a backup (or multiples, why not!), click on \u201cI\u2019ve copied them somewhere safe\u201d. You can now fill in your email address and username on the website to sign up. After clicking on \u201cSave account info\u201d and accepting the conditions, MetaMask will prompt you with a message to sign. Simply hit \u201cSign\u201d and you\u2019re set.If you already have a MetaMask wallet and you want to use that instead of making a new one, you can click on \u201cImport existing DEN\u201d and bring it over using your twelve seed words. Whenever you import your wallet, you can choose to use a new password or use the same one as before. After setting your password for your pre-existing wallet, you need to fill in your email and username on the website again.Getting etherNow that you\u2019ve successfully installed MetaMask and created your wallet, you\u2019ll need some ether to make transactions and buy your first CryptoKitty.For U.S. citizens only: you can buy ether (ETH) directly in MetaMask. ETH is the digital currency that our game uses. You need ETH to buy, sell, and breed Kitties.For everyone else: you will need to purchase ETH from an exchange, and then transfer the ETH from your exchange wallet to your MetaMask wallet. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t play CryptoKitties with only an exchange account.Currently, you can\u2019t use USD/CAD to directly buy a CryptoKitty \u2014 currencies need to be converted into ETH first.How to send ETH to MetaMaskFor U.S. citizens only: purchase ETH directly from the MetaMask wallet using the Coinbase widget. It\u2019s super convenient, and means you don\u2019t have to create two accounts.For everyone else: you need to buy ETH from an exchange using normal \u201cfiat\u201d currency. Copy your MetaMask address by clicking on the large \u201c\u2026\u201d next to your account, then select \u201cCopy Address to clipboard\u201d. Go to your exchange, click \u201cAccounts\u201d, and select your ETH Wallet and click \u201csend\u201d. Paste the MetaMask address in the box with the amount you\u2019d like to transfer.You\u2019re all set!Now that you have Metamask and ETH, you can begin buying Kitties.

Although it doesn\u2019t deploy into the Ethereum Testnet (Ropsten) yet, you can check out how it is going to work, graphics and also its functionalities.In this blog article we\u2019re going to walk you through on how to use and understand everything that will be possible as soon as this first Alpha version is completely deployed.First of all, since we\u2019re talking about a dApp (Decentralized Application) you\u2019ll need to have MetaMask extension installed on your browser. In order to do that, you might go to MetaMask.io and follow the page instructions on how to do it.Secondly, for now you really don\u2019t need to do anything on the Ethereum Mainnet, which means you also don\u2019t have to spend any amount of Ether with this. So, once your MetaMask is installed properly, click on its Icon, type in your password, and change your connection to \u201cRopsten Test Network\u201d.Once this is done, now it\u2019s time to get some testnet Ether, so you can broadcast transactions properly. To do so, click \u201cBUY\u201d and then select \u201cROPSTEN TEST FAUCET\u201d.This will take you to the Ropsten Test Faucet, a dApp that will send you testnet ETH for free, but only one at a time. For that, click \u201crequest 1 ether from faucet\u201d and then scroll down if you want to check the txHash for this transaction. Once the ETH is already on your MetaMask, we can proceed to exploring the work we\u2019ve already done with the Custom DAY Token Tool.The Chronos PlatformOnce your MetaMask has testnet Ether from the faucet and is also unlocked, you can direct yourself to https://alpha.chronologic.network/. Firstly the dApp will notify that you\u2019re connected to Testnet. Don\u2019t worry about it at this point, just click \u201cOK\u201d and keep going forward.Now, click \u201cSTART\u201d and let\u2019s see what the Platform has in store for us. The first customization you may choose is the Token Name and Token Symbol, which can basically be whatever you want. For this tutorial, we\u2019ll fill in the form as if we were making the same version of the day token as the one already deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. Once you have filled these fields properly, click \u201cCONTINUE\u201d.After that we\u2019ll get to a page where you\u2019ll be able to introduce the minting parameters for your customized version of the DAY token.Now, filling the fields, the MINIMUM and MAX MINTING POWER are basically the ChronoPower your customized DAY token version will have. You can create a self-minting token that will be extremely inflationary or not, it\u2019s really up to you. Here you can also customize how long is your HALVING CYCLE, which is dependent of the MINTING PERIOD IN SEC. For example, if you set the minting period in sec for a whole day, then the halving cycle will count each day as a cycle. Same is true if you set it up for an hour or even an year. Once you\u2019ve placed there all your data, click \u201cCONTINUE\u201d.Next step is the \u201cCONTRACT SETUP\u201d. Here you are able to setup vital settings to your own customized DAY token smart contract. Now, let\u2019s breakdown each one of them.MAX ADDRESSES: The number of self-minting addresses your contract will have, for ChronoLogic this number is 3333.STARTING ID FOR TEAM\u2019S MINTING ADDRESS: Here you can setup how far from the top your team will have their Time Mints assigned. For ChronoLogic this value is 3227.TOTAL TEAM\u2019S MINTING ID: The total of self-minting addresses that will be ever assigned as a team minter. In ChronoLogic this value is 18.TEAM LOCK PERIOD IN SECONDS: The main advantage of setting up team minting ids is also being able to lock it up for as long as you see fit. In ChronoLogic the team minting IDs are locked up for 31536000 seconds, which converts to 1 year lock up.POST DEPLOYMENT MAX IDS: Basically, after you deploy your contract, this model allows you to assign more TimeMints, as long as you set things up during this process. For ChronoLogic the number for this is 88.MINIMUM BALANCE TO TRANSFER A MINTER: As the TimeMint has value it self since it can generate new tokens, there\u2019s might also be a restrictive amount to transfer it using the TimeTx process. For ChronoLogic this value is 8888.Once you filled all these fields, click \u201cCONTINUE\u201d.On step #4, \u201cPUBLISH\u201d, you are able to revise all the data you input to the dApp and check if that\u2019s really what you want to deploy. Once the Custom DAY Token Tool is 100% live, after clicking \u201cDEPLOY\u201d you won\u2019t be able to change anything unless you start everything over again, having to pay more DAY tokens for it + ETH for Gas. If you are satisfied with your parameters, click \u201cDEPLOY\u201d.After that you\u2019ll be taken to a page that says \u201cDeploying\u2026\u201d and MetaMask will prompt you to submit a transaction, which will basically create your customized DAY token smart contract, one with all the parameters you just inserted on the dApp.Once you click \u201cSUBMIT\u201d on MetaMask, the dApp will give you a Transaction Hash (txHash), which might take some time to be actually confirmed by the network. Clicking on the link provided you\u2019ll be able to check its progress.As soon as the transaction is mined, the dApp will take you to the \u201cWATCH PAGE\u201d automatically. There you\u2019ll be able to allocate tokens and also Self-minting addresses at will. But first, you need to take ownership of the smart-contract you just created.Once the dApp prompts you for that, simply click \u201cOK\u201d and submit the transaction requested from MetaMask.Now you are able to allocate tokens and TimeMints to whatever ETH address you want. Please note that since we\u2019re talking about the Ethereum Ropsten Testnet Network, whenever you need more ETH to keep this going, just refer to the steps above and get more testnet ETH.Allocating Tokens and TimeMintsOnce you have ownership of your smart-contract, you can now allocate as many tokens you want to whichever ETH address you wish. In order to do that, scroll down a bit and fill the required fields.In a nutshell, these fields mean:RECEIVER\u2019S ADDRESS: ETH address you wish to send the tokens to and also wants to become a self-minting address for your new smart-contract.TIMEMINT TOKENS: Amount of tokens initially sent to such ETH address.ETH VALUE: Accepts only numbers greater than 0 and is designed to keep track if you had ETH in exchange for those tokens/self-minting address.TIMEMINT ID: ID number of the TimeMint you\u2019re assigning. For our ChronoLogic mock contract, this number can be from 1 to 3227.IS THIS A TEAM MEMBER?: If you check this box, it will automatically give out a TimeMint with the lock down period and the specific IDs you\u2019ve reserved for the \u201cTeam TimeMints\u201d while filling up the dApp. For example, if you place \u201c1\u201d on \u201cTIMEMINT ID\u201d and check this box, the real TimeMint ID for this assignment would be TimeMint #3228, which is the first one for the Team, and so on.Once you\u2019ve filled up all fields accordingly, press \u201cALLOCATE\u201d and MetaMask you prompt you with a transaction which will send out the tokens and mark such address as a new TimeMint on your smart-contract.Now, scrolling down you\u2019ll see that the txHash is being accounted for in the dApp, and it will keep logging all assignments you shall make.After you have assigned all TimeMints you want assigned initially and also ALL THE INITIAL TOKENS YOU WILL ASSIGN, now it\u2019s time to release the tokens, which will make them tradeable and also kickstart the minting process.Please note that once you do that, there\u2019s will be no way of creating more tokens for this smart-contract, except for those minted inside self-minting addresses.To do that, scroll back up, and click \u201cRELEASE TOKENS\u201d.Once the tokens are released, you will only be able to assigning \u201cPOST-DEPLOYMENT TIMEMINTS\u201d, which bears no tokens and are available only up to the amount of those you\u2019ve selected before.That\u2019s it for now folks!

The 36-hour event, from October 13 to 15, was organized by a volunteer group of enthusiasts of Ethereum, the blockchain-based technology invented by Vitalik Buterin.Our team, comprised of Aubrey Keus, Sergey Zhukovsky, Anthony Tseng, and Kamil Jozwiak, had been selected to participate from a pool of over 1000 developers. This was the largest gathering of developers in the Ethereum community to date, and was meant to encourage the community to learn about and build decentralized applications on Ethereum.Our CTO, Brian Bondy, had also been invited to be one of the judges (full disclosure: he did not judge our team\u2019s submission, as they were evaluated by different judges). Our team was selected as one of the eight final winners by integrating MetaMask into the Brave browser and adding detection for DApps, making the Brave browser a first-class citizen of the blockchain ecosystem.Having MetaMask as an extension in Brave enables users to simplify Ethereum testing and development, and allows the Brave browser to natively handle a wide range of previously deployed \u00d0Apps. To activate MetaMask, the team implemented several missing Google Chrome extension APIs into the Brave browser in C++ and JavaScript. The team also added independent detection for \u00d0Apps when the extension is not installed, and a one-click install prompt display when visiting \u00d0Apps.\u201cWe\u2019re proud of asking the user to install MetaMask when a \u00d0App is detected because it will mean a lot more users of MetaMask,\u201d said Aubrey. \u201cShipping this feature to our user base will open up a wide set of applications previously not available to our users on the Brave browser,\u201d added Serg.Final submissions were evaluated by twenty-two judges, including Vitalik Buterin, Founder of Ethereum, Joey Krug, Founder of Augur, Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, Founder of Gnosis, and Jeff Coleman, Founder of Ledger Labs. Judges evaluated hacks based on creativity, technical difficulty, design, and usefulness.Judges were split into four rooms and each room evaluated over twenty submissions. Judges picked two winning teams from each room. The Brave team was selected by Vitalik\u2019s room and Brian Bondy was judging in a different room.\u201cThere were so many great submissions, it was challenging to pick just two winners. Several of the projects had usefulness in the real world beyond the hackathon itself, which speaks to the reach that Ethereum now has,\u201d said Brian.The team showed a demo of the MetaMask integration to all ETHWaterloo attendees during the closing ceremony. They then added support for the extension in the Brave browser for the desktop (0.19.53), which was shipped to the entire Brave userbase the following day. In the future, the team will work on building mobile \u00d0App support for our Android and iOS browsers.We\u2019re grateful to the organizers of ETHWaterloo for bringing together our global community of Ethereum developers and for this opportunity to develop applications for the blockchain that are immediately applicable to users.

We are not responsible for any loss and cannot guarantee that the services listed below will work as intended.Prerequisites:To follow this guide, you will need:A web browser.A certain amount of ether in the account that you control. ONLY ETHER WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR THE ICO. Do not send any other cryptocurrency to the addresses mentioned in this article.Getting StartedIf you don\u2019t have a ERC20-compatible address to send from, or ether (ETH) to contribute, start from Step 1. Otherwise, go to Step 5.Step 1: Creating an accountFirst type \u201cmetamask chrome extension\u201d in to Google, and click the link that begins with https://chrome.google.com. You will be taken to the install page, where you can click \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d.Now you will see the Metamask fox in your browser tab.Click it to open your wallet.You will be prompted to create a secure password for your Metamask account. Do so. Make sure that the Ethereum Main Net network is selected (on the top left corner).Step 3: Importing an AccountIf you have a private key or JSON file for a wallet already, you can import that wallet in to Metamask. Simply click \u201c\u2263\u201d at the top right, choose \u201cImport Account\u201d.You will need to input your raw private key into the \u201cprivate\u201d key field, or the typical JSON keystore file. Otherwise, you can select Create Account to generate a new one.Step 4: Getting EtherTo be able to participate in the ICO, you will need to have some ether (ETH) in an account that you control.You can buy ETH from different exchanges using a plethora of currencies. Note: just like purchasing Bitcoins, there are fees associated with every transaction. So sending 1 ether will not exactly give you back the amount of tokens that you expect, it will be slightly less.WARNING: Do not send ether directly from an exchange to our contribution address. It is possible that you will lose those tokens. We suggest buying ether on exchanges, and sending that ether over to your own privately controlled account in MyEtherWallet. Then, you can safely contribute directly to our crowdfunding address from there.Step 5: Buying FUEL TokensThe ICO will be active from October 1, 9 AM. PDT, and will close on October 29, 9 AM. PDT, or whenever the supply of tokens reaches zero. Before doing anything, please verify that you are in the crowdfund period.Please ensure you are on our Secure website.

Click it.This is the beginning of the contribution process. We require all contributors to read and agree to the terms and conditions and white paper. Once you have done so, click the checkbox and hit \u201cContinue\u201d.This screen presents you with a dropdown list of compatible and incompatible wallets. Please select the wallet you want to use from the dropdown \u2014 for the purposes of this tutorial, we will stick with MyEtherWallet. If the wallet you plan to use is listed in \u201cIncompatible Wallets\u201d, you will not be able to proceed. Click \u201cContinue\u201d when you have selected your compatible wallet.Now you can see the contribution address!To buy FUEL tokens, all you will need to do is to send a transaction to the address listed on the page, with the amount of ETH you want to contribute.Open Metamask and click \u201cSend\u201d, and paste in the address copied from our contribution page. Set the value equal to the amount of ETH you want to send.One last step is to add the token to your Metamask, so you can see your balance. Click \u201cAdd Token\u201d, and paste in the Token address: 0xEA38eAa3C86c8F9B751533Ba2E562deb9acDED40.

The Bithereum oracle triggers the issuance of BTH from the ETH holder BTH allocation generated from the Bithereum genesis block.Without further ado, here are the steps for redeeming BTH using MetaMask.Step 1: Open MetaMaskLog into the MetaMask Chrome Extension and choose the send option.Step 2: Add the hex version of your BTH address to your transactionNote: If you don\u2019t have a hex version of your BTH address or have not created a BTH address, go here before proceeding with this step: https://medium.com/bithereum-network/btc-eth-holder-redemption-guide-for-bth-72d6632b04afPaste the HEX output BTH address you generated earlier into the field under \u201cTransaction Data (Optional)\u201d.Step 3: Provide redemption contract addressNext, input the following Bithereum redemption contract address into the \u201cTo Address\u201d field:0x3C2C10e5Ecd073D9ee238493D338Ec6e3d7281C6Enter 0.0 ETH into the \u201camount\u201d field, then click \u201cNext\u201d.Step 4: Generate and send your 0 ETH transactionConfirm that everything was entered in accurately, and proceed with the transaction by clicking \u201cSubmit\u201d.Step 5: Confirm redemptionYou can now verify that your redemption process was successful by looking for your successful transaction directly on the BTH Redemption smart contract using Etherscan.Congratulations, you have successfully redeemed your BTH!

Bitski announced their SDK this week and NIFTYgateway has enabled anyone to buy a NFT with just a credit card inside of their own marketplace.I\u2019ve also been thinking about the intersection of staking-as-a-service/consumer mining companies in the context of cryptogames \u2014 I try to answer the question: why would anyone pay more money to make less money?This week\u2019s releases \ud83c\udf8aBitski releases their SDKGreat to see this product finally come out behind the woodworks. Bitski has known from the start that usability will be one of the biggest issues with decentralized applications. Bitski is providing an alternative to MetaMask with a single sign-on.With Bitski, as a user, you don\u2019t need to worry about private keys. As a developer, you can deploy your contracts straight to the wallet and take in-app payments. Donnie Dinch the CEO describes Bitski as a lockbock for digital goods, as opposed to a bank (Coinbase).Buy (any) NFT with a credit card with NIFTYgateway.NIFTYgateway has launched their NFT marketplace, and now even your grandma can make money selling & trading NFTs. Now, anyone can buy and sell an NFT with just a credit card. Cash out in USDC \u2014 avoids the hassle of payment gateways. A minimum selling fee is in place (payment processing fee + t/x fee) to ensure selling price is not higher than processing costs.I\u2019m super fascinated where this ones goes \u2014 I\u2019m a big proponent of onboarding users into the world of consumer crypto, and by enabling users to trade cryptogoods without ever touching Ethereum or downloading MetaMask is a huge step forward.Thoughts this week \ud83d\udcadStaking-as-a-service & consumer mining companies as brandsIf staking as-a-service and consumer at-home-mining becomes consumerized, will companies eventually compete on brand, user experiences, or highest potential profit for the consumer? Take Coinmine for example. Coinmine takes an exorbitant amount of fees compared to other at-home mining/staking-as-a-service companies.But these fees are warranted. Coinmine is a gamified product \u2014 the ultimate work-play station. Users are drawn to a beautiful interface, the experience akin to Robinhood or other applications. Users can make a ROI and bet on cryptocurrencies with no skin-in-the-game besides opportunity cost by choosing what they want to mine.But there\u2019s an opportunity looming in the horizon \u2014Mining & staking services can be bundled with cryptogaming products to create gamified experiences to earn money within games without the need to create a new token. Consumer mining and staking-as-as-service companies have an opportunity to embrace games as a marketing medium for consumers. Future profit earnings for providing work to a network can be hidden as prizes in games for consumers, encouraging them to do more work in the network.For example, if rent-seekers like consumer-mining companies take 10% ETH as a fee for mining ETH, users will be able to \u201cearn\u201d back 5% by completing certain levels within a game. Hardware mining/staking devices will be able to power games and distribute various cryptocurrencies using state channels/LN throughout games and provide an additional incentive to keep mining or staking.With this model, entertainment will slowly blend with work. But are we willing to sacrifice some additional earnings for our own entertainment? Or will we want to maximize on revenues? My gut is the former in the long run.If you are working on creative use cases, or working on trying to get more people into crypto and reaching end users using non-fungible tokens, I would love to talk about how I can help.

Here\u2019s HowBigbomFollowSep 12, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readHow to easily use MetaMaskMetaMask is a plugin on browsers that facilitate the adoption of Ethereum. For average users, who are using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera or Brave as their browser, MetaMask lets you run dApps without being part of the Ethereum networking as an Ethereum node.With this add-on, your websites can restore user data on the Blockchain, letting them securely manage identities and sign transactions. Basically, MetaMask helps you manage your Ethereum wallet and allows you to send and receive Ethers through a dApp of interest (One of them is Bigbom Marketplace, a transparent economy). Thanks to Metamask, the technology has become more user-friendly as a growing number of people can easily get access to the Ethereum ecosystem through popular Web browsers.So, how can I install and use Metamask?If that question appears in your mind right now, you are in the right place then! In this article, we will go through the step-by-step guidelines on how to master this browser plugin.First thing first, follow this link and install MetaMask as an extension on Google Chrome:Metamask installation for ChromeOnce installed, it will ask you to agree to the terms of use and create your password.Next, you need to save your 12-word mnemonic phrase (seed phrase) carefully. This computer-generated string of words is used to restore your Metamask accounts.Important: The best way to save this crucial phrase is to write it down on paper and keep them somewhere safe.Then you are asked to manually arrange the order of that seed phrase, once for all.Illustration for Meta Mask seed phraseAfter that, you\u2019re fully ready to explore all the features MetaMask provides.To practice using Meta Mask, we should have access to the testnet instead of the mainnet to perform our free transactions (test ones).

In the meantime, our current help desk system has been patched and is no longer susceptible to this vulnerabilityIf you think you may have been affected by the breach, you should immediately follow the instructions in the \u201dRecommendations\u201d section belowA note on account access and security:If during the ticket resolution process you shared either your MetaMask 12 word seed phrase or your account\u2019s private key, we strongly urge that you both migrate to a new seed phrase and transfer your assets to a known secure address. We have provided resources below in the \u201cRecommendations\u201d section to assist you through this process. As a reminder: Please do not share your private key or seed words with anyone. The MetaMask team will never ask for or encourage you to share this information.What Happened?On December 8th, 2017, HappyFox notified the MetaMask team that their software had been the subject of a data security incident, where tickets were accessed and viewable by an external party. MetaMask software and infrastructure was in no way compromised. Only MetaMask users who consented to use this third party help desk service when submitting tickets are affected by the breach. The general population of MetaMask users remain unaffected.After discussing the incident with HappyFox as well as conducting an internal security review, we must conclude that the following information from MetaMask user support tickets between the dates of June 27th, 2017 and December 7th, 2017 was leaked to an unknown external third party:Support user contact namesEmail addressesPhone numbers (if voluntarily shared by the end-user)Ticket body contentContact messages/repliesStaff messages/repliesWe never ask for nor encourage users to share sensitive data in any circumstance. As MetaMask stores and encrypts all data associated with accounts locally on the browser, we never ask for users to send their seed phrases or private keys. However, we feel we must alert the community to the potential threat to users\u2019 security and privacy.If during the ticket resolution process you shared either your MetaMask 12 word seed phrase or your account\u2019s private key, we strongly urge that you both migrate to a new seed phrase and transfer your assets to a known secure address. We have provided resources below in the \u201cRecommendations\u201d section to assist you through this process.Who Was Affected?The security incident resulted in 94% of all MetaMask tickets between the dates of June 27th, 2017 and December 7th, 2017 were exposed to an unknown individual through use of HappyFox\u2019s software print ticket function.When Did This Occur?The incident occurred on December 7th, 2017, when at 21:08:34 (UTC) HappyFox, our external help desk solution, began observing an uncommonly large number of requests from a set of IPs on their end. By 21:20:05 (UTC) that same day, HappyFox had identified and applied a patch to mitigate the issue. Shortly thereafter, at 22:08:25 (UTC), the individual exploiting the data leak made contact with HappyFox. MetaMask staff were alerted of the data leak the following day on December 8th, 2017. MetaMask\u2019s account was one of several vendor accounts that were subject to the leak.Where Did This Happen?The data leak occurred on the third party\u2019s ticketing software, a service that they have hosted on Amazon Web Services. HappyFox does not know the legal identity or the geographic location of the individual responsible for the data leak.Why Did This Happen?The reason for the data leak and its subsequent exploitation is unknown at this time. The proof of concept used by the individual responsible for the data leak was used directly on HappyFox\u2019s live environment without their explicit permission or knowledge. Only after conducting and validating the proof of concept on HappyFox\u2019s live environment did the individual make first contact with HappyFox in attempts to secure compensation in the form of a bug bounty. As of December 15th, 2017, the individual had not yet received compensation from HappyFox for identifying and acting on the data leak exploit, and it must also be noted that HappyFox is in the process of establishing their bug bounty program. We are continuing to investigate the extent of the data leak.How Did This Happen?Based on discussions with HappyFox, It seems the individual created a script to loop through URLs and pull data from their software\u2019s print ticket function through the exploitation of broken authentication business logic. The print ticket function has since been disabled and the attack vector is no longer valid. To reiterate, this security incident occurred only on HappyFox\u2019s end. MetaMask\u2019s software and infrastructure remain untouched and intact.RecommendationsWe advise that you use this incident as an opportunity to revisit your security practices by migrating to a new 12 word seed phrase and moving all assets to known secure addresses.

Using what we have learned from this incident and through researching the ever evolving threat landscape, we have identified Help Scout as our new ticket management system. MetaMask will begin the process of transitioning to our new help desk system on December 27th, 2017.In the meantime, our current help desk system has been patched and is no longer susceptible to the print ticket vulnerability.

Most users will not be affected, but may be interested to know about how MetaMask accounts are managed.MetaMask has been growing a lot lately, and one of our latest efforts has been to begin adjusting to support multiple account types.  One of the changes we made in this transition was to finally fix a small outstanding bug in the way accounts were generated. This means that after we release MetaMask version 3.0.0, a small number of users will have seed phrases that now generate different accounts.Fortunately for these users, we\u2019ve gone to some lengths to ensure a smooth transition.You Still Have Your Old Accounts!It took some work, but for a limited time, we are still migrating old vaults into the new format as well as recovering the affected accounts.

With it, you can always re-generate all your accounts on any machine you like, in the same order, every time. This is cool technique called HD Trees, or Hierarchical Derivation Trees, and has some history in Bitcoin.While we were able to recover the old accounts, your seed phrase will no longer recover those accounts, and so if you have accounts like this, you should immediately export them and back them up, or maybe just transfer their balances to accounts that are part of your HD Tree.You can export a MetaMask account using the key button on the main account panel:Sorry if you hit this issue, but rest assured that we made this change so that we would be more compatible with the wider ecosystem, so it should be a good change in the long term.

By the nature of how blockchain transactions work there are many things that can make it difficult to determine whether a transaction was successful:Did I send to the right address?Did I send enough?Was my gas limit high enough?Was my gas rate high enough?Was it confirmed within a reasonable time period?As a merchant, did I get enough crypto at the current exchange rate to cover my costs?All of these questions are things that the end user shouldn\u2019t have to care about. Paying for things and sending crypto from one address to another should JustWork\u2122. End users shouldn\u2019t need to necessarily know about the underlying mechanics of how the protocol works and what could go wrong, just like we don\u2019t all need to know how credit card readers take payments from this plastic disk we hold in our wallets.At best, blockchain UX issues create confusion for the end user. At worst you end up with lost money, transactions that never complete, angry customers, loss of trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and reduced adoption.No bueno.Coming back to our mission at Bidali \u2014 we\u2019re building tools that power a more open global financial system. So we decided to start to address some of the issues that plague many of the current crypto-payment solutions.Underpaid TransactionsGiven how varied the level of quality of crypto wallets is, it\u2019s really easy to mess up a payment. Even pulling the amount from a QR code is inconsistent across many wallets. At the time of writing the published version of Trust Wallet doesn\u2019t do it. Jaxx is also pretty inconsistent. It\u2019s far too easy to fat finger an amount of 0.00143567 BTC.It\u2019s also a common problem that people send from exchange addresses. Even though it\u2019s not a good idea to use an exchange wallet as your regular wallet, the major issue with regards to payments is that exchanges typically deduct their withdrawal fees from the total withdrawn amount. Unless the customer calculated a new amount to compensate for this it results in an underpayment. Many payment platforms like Coinbase Commerce push an underpayment on to the end user or the merchant to sort out. However, doing that makes accepting crypto more onerous. If we want real adoption it needs to be at least as easy as current payment methods, ideally better.So, we decided to improve that and actually detect when the customer has underpaid or overpaid and we give the merchant and the customer the ability to resolve this easily themselves. Here is an example of underpaying from Bittrex and then topping up the payment to be the correct amount.Overpaid TransactionsOn the merchant side we\u2019re also showing the status of all these different transactions. Whether it was overpaid, underpaid, timed out, or still processing. This makes it easier for the merchant to determine the best course of action \u2014 whether they should refund the amount or complete the order.Another thing we decided to add was support for Metamask. Now if you have the browser plugin installed and unlocked you can pay directly from Metamask. \ud83d\ude4cMore AwesomeDuring the initial beta test of our gift card site we received some amazing feedback. Thank you! \ud83d\ude4fAs a result we also updated a bunch of other things:Handling underpaid transactions that are never topped up during the time limitSome UI style tweaks and bug fixes to make things more clearSupport for Internet Explorer and other less popular browsersUpdates to the gift card emails so that they display beautifully on all email clientsWhew!

This overview comes as Atlas Masternodes and Hermes Masternodes are undergoing final testing for public release, alongside a number of Demo Applications!Let\u2019s get started!MetaMask is a web browser extension that has been created as both a bridge and wallet for the Ethereum network, that also allows someone to access Ethereum dApps in their browser. Since Ambrosus is based on Ethereum, it is possible to use MetaMask to send and receive native Amber tokens.Note: while you can use metamask to transfer ERC20 AMBs, this tutorial is really is focused on native AMBs on the actual AMB-NET main-net. To get native AMBs, you\u2019ll need to convert ERC20 tokens to native using the bridge.Step 1: Setup the MetaMask BrowserTo get started, you will need to download the MetaMask Web Browser on either Chrome, Firefox, Opera or Brave. Once this has been completed, then it is a simple step to set up a new Ethereum address, or to import an existing address onto the MetaMask browser extension.Step 2: Connecting to the Ambrosus NetworkTo connect to the Ambrosus Network, you will need to enter the Ambrosus RPC URLs for the different networks that can be accessed:Main-Net: https://network.ambrosus.com (\u2190 the one you\u2019ll likely use)Test-Net: https://network.ambrosus-test.comMore concretely, you do this by selecting the \u2018Networks\u2019 tab in the top right corner and then clicking on \u201cCustom RPC\u201d the last option available.Once you have done this, you simply copy paste the network URL into the area entitled \u201cNew RPC URL\u201d, pick a name, set the token name to AMB, and set the chainID to \u201c0x414e\u201d \u2014 then press save. This connects your MetaMask wallet with the Ambrosus Network.Step 3: Sending and Monitoring TransactionsWhen you would like to send Amber to the Ambrosus Network, you must click the \u2018Send\u2019 Button and then input the relevant information concerning FROM, TO, Gas Fee, Hex Data (optional).Transferring 10 Native AMBs from a wallet to another (yes, it\u2019s fast!)Note that because MetaMask is made for Ethereum mainly, even though you\u2019re transferring native AMBs, it may somehow be labelled as ETH. Upon being sent, the Ambrosus Bridge will convert the ERC20 AMB into Native AMB.To monitor any transaction sent to the Ambrosus Network including the relevant addresses and transaction times, you can use Ambrosus\u2019 very own explorer, AmberEx: https://explorer.ambrosus.com/.As Atlas and Hermes Masternodes prepare for imminent launch on the public network in the coming weeks, we hope that this guide helps explain how to begin to interact with AMB-NET main-net to send tokens and much more!In the future, further guides and updates will be released in due course for other wallets as well!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Ambrosus", "Supply Chain", "Smart Contracts"]}, {"title": "How to setup a MetaMask wallet for JNB tokens", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@jinbitoken/how-to-setup-a-metamask-wallet-for-jnb-tokens-70ea9a5bba66?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jinbi Token", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jinbitoken", "publish_date": "2019-01-14", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-14", "readtime": "2.17", "claps": 14, "voters": 2, "content": "How to setup a MetaMask wallet for JNB tokensJinbi TokenFollowJan 14 \u00b7 3 min readMonday, 14th January 2019MetaMask is an application that allows users to access a secure Ethereum ERC20 compatible wallet directly from their browser.Jinbi Token recipients are required to input their wallet details from a non-exchange ERC20 compatible wallet \u2014 MetaMask is an example of one of these.Please note:1) MetaMask is not endorsed by Jinbi.

To demonstrate, here\u2019s a short demo of how you can tokenize your car or your house into a smart asset on the Ropsten Network.The smart assets that we create using this platform are backed one-to-one by real world assets. In the case of the Car Token it\u2019s a real car and in the case of the Real Estate Token it could be a house, an office or any other building in some part of the world.First go to: http://dev-web-prototype-bankex.azurewebsites.net/ and click on the \u201cMenu\u201d button.Then click on the \u201cHome page\u201d button.Click \u201cCreate Asset\u201d.Click \u201cCar Token\u201d or \u201cReal Estate Token\u201d. For this demo we choose to click \u201cCar Token\u201d, let\u2019s say we want to tokenize a Volvo XC90 we own.Once you have finalized your choice of asset, click \u201cCreate Asset\u201d.Enter all the data about your car in the General Information field:The user will be responsible for the information provided. It will then be checked by BankEx to ensure its legitimity.As a bonus the user can check that the car was used by a non-smoker.

Imagine a system where voting on the future state of the world can be done from the comfort of your home. Imagine a place where there are no illusions of what is going on, where the open community comes first.MetaMask is your gateway into this world of decentralized applications , or DApps , on the Ethereum blockchain!Why use MetaMask?MetaMask is an easily accessible way to access the blockchain network through a user friendly interface. No more setting up your own node on your local machine to interact with the blockchain , a Chrome extension is all you need!MetaMask also provides a wallet interface for users to view their LightWallet ether balances, as well as enable sending ether like a normal wallet client.MetaMask is available from the Chrome Web Store. With a couple of clicks, you can get MetaMask up and running on your browser!Getting started using MetaMaskMetaMask is a Google Chrome extension that is easily accessible from the Chrome Web Store.Let\u2019s Talk PermissionsBefore we dive in, let\u2019s address a few issues concerning the installation permissions. An extension that can \u201cread and change all your data on the websites you visit\u201d would make most reasonable people nervous! In order for MetaMask to enable DApps to access the blockchain, MetaMask injects a web3 Javascript object into each page. The extension is not changing the website, it is simply giving it access to the network in order to function properly.Getting StartedHere, we\u2019ll walk through a few of MetaMask\u2019s key features, specifically regarding transactions and confirmation of transactions requested by DApps.Setting Up Your AccountIf you already have a LightWallet, you can restore your vault with the vault\u2019s seed words. If not, have no fear, you can create a new vault to hold and generate your wallets easily!When you first create a vault, you will be prompted to save a certain number of seed words. These words can be used by MetaMask to regenerate your vault if need be, as well as enabling the creation of new wallets within your vault.Store these seed words somewhere safe! Although MetaMask gives you the option to see your seed words, we recommend storing your seed words physically in the event that the MetaMask software fails. MetaMask is still in its development stage, so we don\u2019t recommend storing large amounts of ETH in your MetamMask wallets just yet.The InterfaceMoving forward, you should be taken to your first wallet, which looks something like this:The arrows corresponds to the following:Pink: This is your editable wallet nickname. Underneath is a portion of the public key, or the hexadecimal address that uniquely identifies your wallet.Teal: These buttons copy your wallet address to the clipboard and allow you to export your private keys.Red: This indicates the current network. Clicking it will open a drop down menu to switch to the Main Ethereum Network, the Morden Test Network, or your own network of choice.Green: This button will take you to a page that will allow you to switch accounts.Below the current wallet information is a list of outgoing transactions from the current wallet with relevant information. Clicking the transaction itself will link you to an etherscan page with more detailed information.Sending ether to another address is simple. MetaMask will help guard you against sending to invalid addresses, as well as initiating transactions that send more ether than the current wallet contains. Before a transaction is actually executed, a notification pops up allowing you to confirm the transaction and examine relevant details.Don\u2019t worry if you close the notification , the extension popup will prompt you to approve or reject any pending transactions the next time it\u2019s opened.Here, the accounts page shows an overview of your current wallets, a convenient button to copy wallet addresses, as well as the option to generate more wallets as needed.Final NotesWhile we encourage users to test out and play around with our software, please keep in mind that MetaMask is still in active development. With that in mind, we encourage users to refrain from handling large amounts of ether on the main Ethereum network using MetaMask. We recommend executing all testing or experimentation on the Morden Test Network or a local network of your choosing to mitigate these risks.Similarly, if you do find any bugs, have any feature requests, or would like to leave a comment, please contact us at help@metamask.io or leave an issue in our MetaMask GitHub repository.We wish you the best in exploring the world of Ethereum and DApps using MetaMask. It\u2019s an exciting new frontier out there; we\u2019re happy to be the key that unlocks it for you!Further info:Download here: Chrome Web StoreContact us: help@metamask.io or hello@metamask.ioWebsite: metamask.ioGithub: https://github.com/MetaMask/hello", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Metamask", "Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Dapps", "Web Development"]}, {"title": "How to see your DAY tokens via MetaMask", "post_link": "https://blog.chronologic.network/how-to-see-your-day-tokens-via-metamask-17b3a1b066f3?source=search_post", "author_name": "ChronoLogic", "author_link": "https://blog.chronologic.network/@chronologicnetwork", "publish_date": "2017-09-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-05", "readtime": "2.55", "claps": 51, "voters": 2, "content": "How to see your DAY tokens via MetaMaskChronoLogicFollowSep 15, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readOne of the simplest and safer way of managing an Ethereum wallet is with Chrome\u2019s extension MetaMask. Using cryptography directly from your browser, MetaMask connects you directly to the Ethereum Network, allowing easy access to the Blockchain.However, sometimes there are doubts on how to visualize ERC-20 tokens balance within MetaMask, such as DAY tokens.Now, let\u2019s cover the details about how to visualize your DAY tokens balance via MetaMask and also discuss how you can transfer them whenever you want.Step #1: Open MetaMask extension and unlock your wallet using the password.Step #2: Select the tab \u201cTOKENS\u201d.Step #3: Now, click on \u201cADD TOKEN\u201d.Step #4: At this point we must have the contract\u2019s number that deployed the contract for such token, in this case, ChronoLogic\u2019s contract for DAY tokens. So, paste the address: 0xE814aeE960a85208C3dB542C53E7D4a6C8D5f60F ; replace the field \u201cToken Symbol\u201d with \u201cDAY\u201d and leave the \u201cDecimals of Precision\u201d in 18. After that, click \u201cADD\u201d.That\u2019s it, now you can visualize your DAY tokens balance safely and easily via MetaMask.Although, if you want to send them, for an exchange or another wallet, you\u2019ll need to use MyEtherWallet(MEW). But don\u2019t worry, for that MetaMask and MEW have a special integration allowing the use of MEW while you enjoy the safety of MetaMask.Whenever you want to move your tokens, DAY or any other ERC-20 tokens, follow these steps:Step #1: Unlock your MetaMask wallet.Step #2: Enter MyEtherWallet\u2019s website and select \u201cSend Ether & Tokens\u201d.Step #3: Mark the option \u201cMetaMask/Mist\u201d and click on \u201cConnect to MetaMask\u201d.Step #4: Scroll down the page and select \u201cAdd Custom Token\u201d.Step #5: Now, repeat \u201cStep #4\u201d from the tutorial above, inserting the address of the contract, token name and define \u201cDecimals\u201d to 18. After that, click \u201cSave\u201d.There you go! Now you can already visualize your available tokens via MyEtherWallet. In order to send them, fill as usual the fields shown below with the receiver address, amount and Gas Limit. The only thing \u201cnew\u201d to do here is select \u201cDAY\u201d or the token you wish where the arrow shows.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "Myetherwallet", "Token"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@danfinlay/hi-there-dan-from-the-metamask-team-here-the-metamask-column-has-a-few-deceptive-marks-a890b7727b08?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@danfinlay", "publish_date": "2016-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-26", "readtime": "0.53", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "(Might not be 100% accurate when you read this; please let me know when it becomes outdated!)Announcing Spectrum \u2014 Full Gamut Lightsuite for Ethereum Blockchains1696DigixDan FinlayFollowDec 19, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readHi there, Dan from the MetaMask team here.The MetaMask column has a few deceptive marks:Multi-Device Pairing (yes, how not?)DAO Withdraw (easily possible with a web dapp, although this feature is now meaningless since that contract is over)Dapp Store (there are actually a couple Dapp stores, but they\u2019re normal websites, not belonging to MetaMask proper).Chain Agnostic (It lets you point at any provider you want, and so is very chain agnostic).Custom Node (Why only a half moon here?

But one piece of software lets you not only store and manage your tokens, but also interact with Ethereum-powered DApps directly in your browser \u2014 that tool is called MetaMask.A Closer Look at MetaMaskMetaMask is a web browser extension that functions as an Ethereum wallet. It is compatible with the Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera browsers. Since it\u2019s an extension, you can install it like a typical Google or Firefox add-on.Aside from using MetaMask as a wallet, users can sign smart contracts and interface with distributed Ethereum-based applications or DApps with it. All of these functions work without users having to run a full Ethereum node. And like other types of Ethereum wallets, MetaMask can store other Ethereum-related data, such as private keys and public addresses. Most importantly, MetaMask enables websites that have Ethereum-based DApps to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.In a way, MetaMask transforms your ordinary browser into an Ethereum browser. The biggest advantage is that it saves time and effort: you do not have to run all your Ethereum software because MetaMask runs all the software on their servers.MetaMask and DAppsAs mentioned above, MetaMask interacts with Ethereum-based DApps. And what \u2014 you may be asking \u2014 are DApps? The name refers to \u201cdecentralized applications\u201d \u2014 meaning, they are apps, but there is no central entity that controls them.The term \u201cdecentralized\u201d implies that all the records of the applications\u2019 activities and operation are available to the public. In addition, DApps connect businesses and consumers directly, instead of relying on a middleman. This direct communication makes decision-making easier for both parties, and waiting times shorter.Two of the most popular DApps these days that interact with MetaMask are CryptoKitties and ETHLand.Let us take a look at these DApps and see where MetaMask comes in.CryptoKittiesCryptoKitties is an Ethereum-based game that allows users to buy, raise, breed, and trade their digital cats. Since it is Ethereum-based, all of these transactions happen using Ether instead of fiat money. From time to time, when the market is right, certain unique breeds can command a very high price. The game needs MetaMask to communicate with the blockchain.ETHLendETHLend is a smart-contract based platform on which users can easily borrow or lend Ethereum. Users on the platform place their Ether in a smart contract loan, offering several ERC-20 tokens as collateral. If the borrower successfully repays the loan, the lender earns interest along with the Ether that was lent. However, if the borrower fails to pay, the lender can claim all of the collateral put up for the loan.ETHLend currently works using an online DApp that is only accessible through MetaMask. If you try to open the DApp without MetaMask, you will get an error screen.Installing and Using MetaMaskInstalling MetaMask in your browser is pretty easy. First, go to their website to download the tool. Choose the Chrome browser, even if you are using Firefox or Opera. Once you have it, click the \u201cAdd extension\u201d link. A privacy notice \u201cAccept\u201d will pop up followed by the \u201cTerms of Use\u201d \u2014 click both of them.After you sign up, you will be given 12 seed words that you need to copy and store offline. These are the words you will need to use if you ever have to restore your MetaMask accounts. After doing that, click the \u201cI\u2019ve Copied It Somewhere Safe\u201d button, and you are all set.To find out what your MetaMask public wallet address is, click the MetaMask plugin located at the top right of your browser. A drop-down menu will appear; click the three dots beside your \u201cAccount Name,\u201d then click \u201cCopy Address to Clipboard.\u201dSending and receiving Ether on MetaMask is also fairly easy. To receive Ether, go to your account dashboard and click the three dots on the upper right side corner. Get the QR code and address \u2014 you can give this anyone who wants to send you some Ether.Meanwhile, if you want to send Ether, click the \u201cSend\u201d button. Then fill out the fields that ask for the recipient\u2019s public wallet address and the amount you want to send.What About ERC-20 Tokens?Although MetaMask is compatible with ERC-20 tokens, it does not support them by default. In other words, you have to add the types of ERC-20 tokens manually. Fortunately, this is an easy task.On your MetaMask dashboard, click \u201cAdd Token,\u201d after which you will have to add the token details, such as the token contract address and the token symbol. Then click \u201cSubmit\u201d and \u201cAdd.\u201d You will know if you successfully added the token because your wallet will show your balance for that particular token.ConclusionMetaMask has proven to be a secure and helpful tool for storing your Ethereum and ERC-20 assets. It has a clean record for security: there have been no security breaches that resulted in the loss of assets on the platform. MetaMask uses a type of security system that encrypts all local keys, preventing any exploits or malicious DApps from gaining access to the system. Despite this, you still have to be careful in giving out your private keys because there are a lot of cybercriminals waiting to prey on you.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "Crypto", "Software", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@merunasgrincalaitis/yes-other-users-have-to-get-metamask-or-equivalent-to-interact-with-the-dapp-63cb65bb6dfa?source=search_post", "author_name": "Merunas Grincalaitis", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@merunasgrincalaitis", "publish_date": "2018-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-14", "readtime": "0.34", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Hey I purchased Your book Very awesome!1Shaun PritchardMerunas GrincalaitisFollowSep 14, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readYes other users have to get metamask or equivalent to interact with the dapp. However if all you need is to get information from the blockchain, you can implement infura which allows you go the data from there without needing an account in the web app.So people could see content from the blockchain without having an account.

Dapps should update their code to support this feature, which will be enabled by default in the future.Paul BouchonFollowAug 7, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readThis post was updated on 11/5Since MetaMask\u2019s first release in 2016, we\u2019ve aimed to make using the decentralized web simple. When a user loads a webpage, MetaMask automatically injects an Ethereum provider and a Web3 instance for the webpage to use. This allows dapps to access the blockchain, propose transactions, and read their users\u2019 account addresses.But there\u2019s long been a serious privacy issue with the way this exposure works in the current generation of dapp browsers: malicious websites can use these injected objects to view a user\u2019s active Ethereum address, which in turn provides access to their balance, transaction history, and other potentially-sensitive information. Bad-acting sites can also initiate many unwanted Ethereum transactions on a user\u2019s behalf in the hopes that the user will accidentally approve one.To improve privacy across the decentralized web, MetaMask \u2014 along with other privacy-conscious dapp browsers like Status, Mist, and imToken \u2014 plans to adopt a new, safer strategy that will require updates to existing dapps. This article contains everything developers and their end-users need to know about this necessary breaking change, along with code to help future-proof dapps today.Breaking changeIn order to better protect user privacy, MetaMask and other dapp browsers will stop populating the injected Ethereum provider with user accounts by default. Instead, dapps must request access to user accounts, which will in turn ask the user to approve or deny access to the Ethereum blockchain. If the user approves access, the provider will be populated with accounts and the dapp can initiate account-requiring transactions as they normally would.While MetaMask generally avoids breaking APIs to protect the longevity of existing sites, we believe that a privacy flaw that exposes user accounts and allows unrestricted transaction submissions on a user\u2019s behalf to be sufficient justification.In order to provide the smoothest possible rollout, dapps must be allowed adequate time to make the necessary updates. We plan to release this breaking change on November 2nd, 2018, to commemorate the EIP proposing this change, EIP-1102.What this means for usersOver the next few months, users may begin to see more \u201cLogin\u201d or \u201cConnect\u201d buttons on dapps. These buttons will prompt a popup from MetaMask (or other dapp browser of choice) asking if the user wants to grant the site access to their public account information. The extension will remember which sites have been approved until the user clears their list.This UX pattern of requiring user approval before exposing user accounts is very similar to requesting access to a user\u2019s camera or microphone. Ethereum users can reject account access on websites they feel are untrustworthy, making it impossible for such sites to identify, track, and target them. By only populating the injected Ethereum provider with accounts after user approval, users have control over their own privacy.Draft UI for MetaMask\u2019s user-approved account access implementationPrivacy modeThe MetaMask settings menu will expose a new \u201cprivacy mode\u201d option that can be used to opt in to and out of this privacy-preserving behavior. If \u201cprivacy mode\u201d is enabled, MetaMask will not automatically expose users\u2019 account addresses to the sites they visit. Instead, sites must specifically request access to see users\u2019 accounts. If \u201cprivacy mode\u201d is disabled, legacy behavior will be maintained and MetaMask will automatically expose users\u2019 account addresses to websites. This means that legacy dapps that are not immediately updated to support this change can still be used by disabling privacy mode.On November 2nd, 2018, MetaMask plans to release these changes with \u201cprivacy mode\u201d disabled by default. This option will eventually be enabled by default in a future release.What this means for developersThe Ethereum provider injected by MetaMask and other dapp browsers will now be available at window.ethereum for convenience. Before reading user accounts or initiating RPC method calls that require user accounts, such as eth_sendTransaction, dapps must now request access to user accounts by calling a new method on the provider: ethereum.enable(). This method returns a Promise that\u2019s either resolved with user accounts after user approval, or rejected with an Error after user rejection.The following code shows a new way to start up a dapp that can be used today in both legacy and modern dapp browsers:Preparing your dappAs of MetaMask v4.14.0, the provider is already available at window.ethereum and it exposes the new enable method. Calling this method today won\u2019t trigger an approval popup and accounts will continue to be exposed to dapps until November 2nd; still, dapps can and should be updated as soon as possible to call the new enable method to ensure compatibility with the upcoming change.To fully test a dapp against a version of MetaMask that includes this breaking change:Download a custom build here.Install the build following these instructions.Enable \u201cprivacy mode\u201d in the MetaMask settings menu.Report any issues on Github.ConclusionMaking a breaking change has been a difficult decision for us, but we believe it is better than leaving our users prone to privacy violations. We hope this method of provider requesting will pave the way for a variety of more advanced login strategies, such as requesting a specific network, accounts of particular type, or even user-approved personal information.As dapps switch over to this new pattern, we believe we can begin paving way to a more secure, private, and user-centric web.", "responses": 36, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Privacy", "Crypto", "Blockchain", "Security"]}, {"title": "Ethereum Development Walkthrough (Part 1: Smart contracts)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/ethereum-development-walkthrough-part-1-smart-contracts-b3979e6e573e?source=search_post", "author_name": "dev_zl", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@dev_zl", "publish_date": "2018-01-14", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-29", "readtime": "7.06", "claps": 2059, "voters": 379, "content": "Ethereum Development Walkthrough (Part 1: Smart contracts)dev_zlFollowJan 14, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readSmart contracts, ICOs, Mist, Metamask, Remix, geth, web3..

And you are there, not knowing what exactly to do and how everything works together.If this is the first article that you read on Ethereum or the blockchain eco-system in general, you are going to love it! Experts calling each others names on twitter, unsafe standards and protocols, untested and buggy development tools. Not everything is figured out yet, everyone is going in different directions, and there still a lot to be done. The future of institutions, banks, and governments is being decided by mad developers! It\u2019s so great.Anyway, don\u2019t worry anymore, I\u2019ll try to connect all the dots for you in this tutorial series, and walk you through the universe of Smart contracts and dapps developement, and show you how everything fits together.While I will not get into every detail, I\u2019ll link some materials that will help you understand some concepts better, and it\u2019s up to you to research them and get into all the little details. The goal of this series is to help you understand better how things work together, in the simplest way possible, like a friend would explain it to you.I don\u2019t even know what Ethereum isThe official website of Ethereum tells us this:Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.In other words, it uses the capabilities that gives us the blockchain technology to certify the execution of the code that we run.If you don\u2019t know what the blockchain, Ethereum, Bitcoin, cryptocurrency or any of these words mean, I advise you to listen to this excellent podcast by Tim Ferriss, interviewing Nick Szabo and Naval Ravikant: The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency \u2014 Nick SzaboWhat are Smart Contracts?On Ethereum, Smart Contracts are scripts that can handle money. It\u2019s as simple as that.These contracts are enforced and certified by parties that we call miners. Miners are multiple computers who add a transaction (Execution of a smart contract, payment of a cryptocurrency etc.) to a public ledger that we call a block. Multiple blocks constitute a blockchain.We pay these miners with something called Gas, which is the cost to run a contract. When you publish a smart contract, or execute a function of a smart contract, or transfer money to another account, you pay some ether that gets converted into gas.If it\u2019s still unclear, or you want to know more details, here are some interesting links:A different introduction to Smart Contracts in video.Smart contracts page on Wikipedia.A more detailed explanation of Gas.Before diving into smart contracts developmentIn this tutorial, I\u2019ll assume that you already have some basis in software development, and have a basic knowledge of Javascript and Node.JS. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be quickly lost. Solidity, the programming language that we will use to develop, is close to Javascript\u2019s syntax, and since a lot of development tools around Ethereum are based on Javascript and NodeJS, it will be easier for you to get in if you are already comfortable with both. This is not a tutorial for beginners, and while I\u2019ll link some alternative tutorials for you if you didn\u2019t understand some concepts, it\u2019s up to you to research the rest.Smart contracts developmentNow, finally, we start the interesting part, as I said Solidity is close to Javascript, but they are not alike. On Solidity, and I\u2019m sorry to tell you that, frontend developer, you just can\u2019t slap JQuery on a piece of code and hope that it will work, you can\u2019t overlook security, and you just can\u2019t hack your way through. We will see why when we will discuss security, development patterns, and fail-proofing our code.Now, for our first example, I\u2019m thinking about a script inspired by the movie In Time, where, in a dystopian future, people trade their remaining time to live like money. In the movie, they have a variant of arm wrestling that involves playing with that time, and we will do just that! Wrestling money using a Smart Contract.And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make available for you all the scripts we will see on Github.Also, if it\u2019s the first time you deal with smart contracts, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t understand everything now, it takes practice, reading the docs, and a bit of research to get accustomed to Solidity.The codeNow, onto the coding, first of all, the base of a Solidity script is the following snippet, the pragma directive to tell the compiler which version of Solidity we are using, and the name of our contract, a similar structure to a class in Javascript. Here it\u2019s \u201cWrestling\u201d.We want two wrestlers, so we will add two variables that hold the address of their accounts (Public keys of their wallets).In our little game, in each round, the wrestlers will be able to put in a sum of money, and if one put in double the money of the other(in total), he will win.One important thing about the public/private keywords is, even though, a variable is private, it doesn\u2019t mean that someone couldn\u2019t read its content, it just means that it can be accessed only inside the contract, but in reality, since the whole blockchain is stored on a lot of computers, the information that is stored inside the variable could always be seen by others, and that represents the first security consideration that you should keep in mind.On the other hand, the compiler automatically creates getter functions for public variables. To make it possible for other contracts or users to change the value of the public variable, you need to create a setter function.Now we will add three events, for every step of our game. The beginning, when the wrestlers register, during the game, for each round, and at the end, when a wrestler wins. Events are simply logs, and they can be used to call JavaScript callbacks in the user interface of distributed applications, also known as dapps. Events can even be used for debugging purposes during development since there is no equivalent to the \u201cconsole.log()\u201d function of JavaScript on Solidity.Now we will add the constructor, in Solidity, it has the same name as our contract and it will be called only once, upon the creation of the contract.Here, the first wrestler will be the one who created the contract. \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is the address of the one who invoked the function.Next we let another wrestler register with the following function:The require function is a special error-handling function within Solidity that will revert changes if a condition is not met. In our example, if the variable wrestler2 equals the 0x0 address (the equivalent of 0 for addresses), we can proceed, if the address wrestler2 is different from the 0x0 address, it means that a player has already registered as an opponent, and therefore, we will refuse new registrations.Again, \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is the address of the account that called the function, and we emit an event that signals the start of the wrestling.Now, every wrestler will call a function, \u201cwrestle()\u201d, putting in money. And if both have played, we see if one of them has won (our rule was that one of them have to put in double the cash of the other one). The \u201cpayable\u201d keyword means that the function can receive money, if it isn\u2019t set, the function will not accept ether. The \u201cmsg.value\u201d is the amount of ether that was sent to the contract.We then add the endOfGame(), and endOfRound() functions. The \u201cinternal\u201d keyword is the same as private, the only difference is that internal functions could be inherited by other contracts(since Solidity is similar to other object-oriented languages), while private functions cannot be inherited.Notice that we don\u2019t deliver the money to the winner directly, while in this case it\u2019s not that important, since the winner will take all the money off this contract, in other cases, when multiple users can withdraw ether off a contract, it\u2019s more secure to use a withdraw pattern, to avoid re-entrancy.It simply means, that if for example multiple users can withdraw money off a contract, one can simply call the withdraw function multiple times at once and get payed multiple times. So we need to write our withdraw function in such a manner that it will nullify the amount he should receive before proceeding to pay him.It looks like this:And that\u2019s it.

I will do my best to explain everything to you through this tutorial. I will explain to you about Smart Contracts and development of dapps and how everything works together.However, I won\u2019t go into the minutest of details, instead I will link to some articles, so you can decide if you want to explore these links and do some further reading on your own, so that you can understand the principles that have been discussed here in a better way. The main aim of this tutorial is to show you how in a simple way how everything is interconnected.What is Ethereum?If you are unfamiliar with the terms blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum and cryptocurrency, then listen to this podcast by Tim Ferris interviewing Nick Sabo and Naval Ravikant talk about The Quite Master of Cryptocurrency.What Are Smart Contracts?Smart Contracts are scripts that have been set up in Ethereum to handle cash.The people who are responsible for setting up these contracts and certifying them are known as miners. Miners are many computers that add a contract to a public ledger that is known as a block. When many blocks are put together, this is referred to as blockchains.Miners are usually paid a Gas. This is payment for running the contract. Anytime you create a smart contract or you carry out any transaction or send money into a different account, you are required to make payment in the form of ether. This is what\u2019s converted into Gas.What to Know About the Smart Contracts DevelopmentYou should understand that this tutorial is not for newbies. You must have some basic understanding of software development and be familiar with JavaScript. If you don\u2019t know any of these languages, then you will struggle to follow along. In this tutorial we will use Solidity. This is a programming language that is almost similar to JavaScript. Keep in mind that most developments that are done on Ethereum use JavaScript and Node.JS. So, if you are familiar with both of these languages, then you will understand a lot of what is going to be discussed here. I am going to give some links for other tutorial, so that you can understand better various concepts that will be discussed here and you can do more research on your own.The Development of Smart ContractsEven though Solidity has some similarities with JavaScript, they are different. In Solidity, when it comes to Front End development, you can\u2019t simply put together a JQuery on a code and then expect it to function. You cannot just ignore security. We will go into more details later on when we are taking about security, development and patterns and how to fail-proof code.The first example that I am going to use is based on the Movie in Time. This is a dystopian movie where people trade in their remaining time for money. There\u2019s something that resembles arm wrestling in the film where you gamble your time. This is what we are going to discuss here, wrestling money for Smart Contract.I will also provide you the scripts that we will use on Github.Don\u2019t get too stressed out if you do not understand that we are talking about, especially if it is your first time to deal with them. It takes time and practice to familiarize yourself with everything that you need to know. It will take some research.CodingThe foundation of the Solidity script is the pragma directive that shows the compiler the particular Solidity version that\u2019s being used and the name of the contract. This looks like a JavaScript script. We will refer to it as \u2018Wrestling\u2019 here.pragma solidity ^0.4.18;contract Wrestling {// our code will go hereSince we will be using 2 wrestlers, we will put in two variablesaddress public wrestler1;address public wrestler2;In this game, the wrestlers can add money. Anyone who puts in money that doubles what the other wrestler has put in automatically wins.bool public wrestler1Played;bool public wrestler2Played;uint private wrestler1Deposit;uint private wrestler2Deposit;bool public gameFinished;address public theWinner;uint gains;Keep in mind that just because the private/public key is a private variable, it doesn\u2019t mean that no one can access it. Any information that\u2019s stored inside the variable can be found inside the contracts. Since in blockchains information is stored in multiple computers, other people can see it. This is one of the key security concerns that you must consider.The compiler comes up with getter functions for public variables. If you want users or contracts to edit the public variable value, you have to set up a setter function.In our game, we want to set up three events as steps in our game. The first stage is where the wrestlers register their names. The next step is during the game, where there are different rounds. The last step is the end, where one wrestler wins. These events are just logs and you can use them for JavaScript callbacks in the interface used by users. They can be referred to as dapps. During the development phase, you can use events to debug since you cannot find the equal of \u201cconsole.log()\u201d function in Solidity that is available in JavaScript.event WrestlingStartsEvent(address wrestler1, address wrestler2);event EndOfRoundEvent(uint wrestler1Deposit, uint wrestler2Deposit);event EndOfWrestlingEvent(address winner, uint gains);The next step is to put the Constructor. This will be given the name of the contract and it will only be called once when the contract has been created.In this case, it is the first wrestler who developed the contract. \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is the person who summoned the contract.function Wrestling() public {wrestler1 = msg.sender;}The next step is to allow another wrestler to register using the function belowfunction registerAsAnOpponent() public {require(wrestler2 == address(0));wrestler2 = msg.sender;WrestlingStartsEvent(wrestler1, wrestler2);}In case a condition isn\u2019t fulfilled, you can use the require function in Solidity to revert back to the initial position. For instance, in this example that we are using, if the variable wrestler2 is the same as the 0x0 address, the game can go on but if the address of wrestler2 differs from the 0x0 address, then it means that the wrestler has registered as an opponent so, you can refuse this registration.\u201cmsg.sender\u201d is the address that\u2019s used for the one that called the function. It will send out signals that the wrestling is starting.Each wrestler will then call in a function \u201cwrestle()\u201d and put in money. To see who has won, considering that the winner has to 2x the cash that has been put in by the opponent, we use the \u201cpayable\u201d keyword, so that the function can accept money. \u201cmsg.value\u201d refers to how much Ether was delivered to the contract.function wrestle() public payable {require(!gameFinished && (msg.sender == wrestler1 || msg.sender == wrestler2));if(msg.sender == wrestler1) {require(wrestler1Played == false);wrestler1Played = true;wrestler1Deposit = wrestler1Deposit + msg.value;} else {require(wrestler2Played == false);wrestler2Played = true;wrestler2Deposit = wrestler2Deposit + msg.value;}if(wrestler1Played && wrestler2Played) {if(wrestler1Deposit >= wrestler2Deposit * 2) {endOfGame(wrestler1);} else if (wrestler2Deposit >= wrestler1Deposit * 2) {endOfGame(wrestler2);} else {endOfRound();}}}You will then include endOfGame () and End of Round () functions. The \u2018internal\u2019 keyword will be similar to the private one. The only thing that will differ is that other contracts can inherit internal keywords.function endOfRound() internal {wrestler1Played = false;wrestler2Played = false;EndOfRoundEvent(wrestler1Deposit, wrestler2Deposit);}function endOfGame(address winner) internal {gameFinished = true;theWinner = winner;` gains = wrestler1Deposit + wrestler2Deposit;EndOfWrestlingEvent(winner, gains);}The money is not given directly to the winner. There are cases where there are many users who can withdraw money from the contract. In such cases, the best thing to do would be to have a withdraw pattern in order to avoid re-entry.To avoid a user withdrawing money multiple times, it is essential to use a nullify function any time a withdrawal is made.function withdraw() public {require(gameFinished && theWinner == msg.sender);uint amount = gains;gains = 0;msg.sender.transfer(amount);}To get the whole snippet, go here.IDE UsageOpen RemixIDE in a new browser, then click on the + button at the top, left part of the page and set up a new file called \u201cWrestling.sol\u201d then copy the snippet code above and then paste it here.Githu hub does not yet support the Solidity.sol extension.Check the page\u2019s right part, where you will notice that there are many interesting tabs, like the \u201cAnalysis\u201d tab. This tab shows recommendations and errors. You can explore more of this tool on your own, since we are not going to use it. The tools that we are going to use include:Truffle: This tool will help you to create Smart Contracts, publish them and test them. You can find more information here.Ganache: It was initially known as TestRPC. It was renamed Ganache after it was integrated with Truffle Suite. The work of tis tool is to set up a virtual blockchain and create accounts that will be utilized during development.Mist: This is the equivalent of a web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, except that it is used for dapps. Since it is not secure do not use it with dapps that you do not fully trust.Ethereum Wallet: This is like Mist, only that it can be used to open one dapp only: Ethereum Wallet.

For Ethereum and the entire blockchain ecosystem to grow, it falls on the community to build the infrastructure components that keep the network running. Across the Ethereum network, there is a need for utilities that lower the barrier of entry and simplify access to Ethereum data. Among the most essential of these are Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) products. Leading the way is Infura, which offers developers a suite of tools to connect their apps to the Ethereum network and other decentralized platforms.Many of the blockchain space\u2019s most remarkable projects \u2014 Metamask, CryptoKitties, UJO, Radar Relay, Cipher Browser, uPort \u2014 utilize Infura\u2019s APIs to connect their applications to the Ethereum network. In doing so, Infura provides the fundamental infrastructure required to handle both the short-term spikes that can often occur during token launches and essential, longer-term scaling solutions. An average of 6.5 billion JSON-RPC requests per day on the Ethereum network are channeled through Infura infrastructure, making the project an essential pillar of the ecosystem.\u201cOur mission is to facilitate access to Ethereum and the opportunities it provides,\u201d says Infura Lead Systems Engineer Nicola Cocchiaro. \u201cWe\u2019ve always believed that only through widespread adoption can the enormous potential of Ethereum be fully realized. One of the ways that we aim to help achieve that goal is by providing infrastructure as a service. Over the the last two years, this has put us in a privileged position to witness the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem firsthand, and the growth has been explosive both for it and us.\u201dSome numbers on the rise of Infura: \u201cWe now have more than 15,000 registered developers, we\u2019re serving over 6 billion API requests per day and transferring roughly 1.6 petabytes of data per month,\u201d says Cocchiaro. \u201cIn 2017 alone, we relayed transactions that moved more than 7 million ether, with almost 9 million more so far in 2018. And most of this growth happened over the second half of 2017.\u201dA view of transactions served by Infura from June 2017 to April 2018. The spike in December is the CryptoKitties launch.\u201cInfura essentially provides the necessary tools for any application to start developing on Ethereum immediately, without the need to run the complicated infrastructure themselves,\u201d says Mike Godsey, Product Manager. \u201cThis is equally necessary for developers with no traffic testing on networks such as Kovan, Rinkeby, or Ropsten, or ones with tons of traffic running on Mainnet. Infura provides a connection for all developers utilizing the Ethereum blockchain.\u201dThe most well-known portion of the Infura infrastructure is the network of hosted Ethereum clients that spans four Ethereum networks: Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Kovan. \u201cThese are load-balanced groups of nodes, that we can scale to meet demand fairly easily, and that we keep up-to-date and secure,\u201d says Cocchiaro. \u201cWe have TLS-enabled APIs including JSON-RPC, REST and websocket endpoints as ways to access our node network as if it was your local node. Infura also has additional features built on top of these endpoints for reliability and added value, like the feature we call Transaction Assurance.\u201dEthereum nodes are only one part of Infura stack: \u201cWe also host IPFS nodes and a public IPFS gateway. We\u2019re in the process of building additional decentralized storage products based on both IFPS and Swarm, that we will detail in the near future,\u201d says Cocchiaro.One of the central pieces of the Infura architecture is a middleware layer called Ferryman. Cocchiaro explains: \u201cFerryman is Infura\u2019s internal middleware layer that enables smart routing, which allows requests to be sent to different ends of the Infura infrastructure based on the RPC method and other factors. This provides the ability to scale and tune portions of the infrastructure independently depending on traffic needs; in addition to aggressive caching and indexing of blockchain data, smart routing can make it so that incoming requests don\u2019t need to hit a live node at all, and response times are greatly decreased.\u201dInfura\u2019s modular scaling solutions unlock essential network capacity for any project that is or expects to be pushing large amounts of traffic through the Ethereum Network. \u201cWith an ever-growing blockchain, keeping a local node synced and up to date has traditionally presented challenges that typically relate to a combination of storage, bandwidth and memory usage,\u201d says Cocchiaro. \u201cAdditionally, ICOs and other high-traffic dapps have concerns of scaling, sometimes transient, sometimes more permanent, that are not easily solved with local infrastructure.\u201dThe range of projects that utilize Infura\u2019s network is broad. For example, MetaMask uses Infura with a zero-client approach, connecting to Infura\u2019s remote infrastructure in order to serve over one million installed users. Some projects \u2014 like Mist and Status \u2014 are working towards utilizing a hybrid approach that relies on Infura\u2019s remote nodes in moments of network stress. In cases where scale is the main concern, like that of CryptoKitties, Infura worked together with developers across the ecosystem to keep the network running smoothly.Looking forward, Infura\u2019s growing platform of utilities will include a developer portal to give insight and monitoring to developers using the Infura network as well as more advanced scaling solutions. \u201cIn order to better serve developers using Infura, we are introducing a new version of our API key that will give apps better visibility into how they are using the network. We are also introducing an \u201cInfura for Business\u201d product that will help prepare developers for production traffic and provide them with the necessary support to keep their applications running smoothly,\u201d explains Mike Godsey.\u201cWe are actively involved in the expanding landscape of Ethereum and plan to incorporate many of the new developments directly into our infrastructure services,\u201d says Godsey. \u201cWe are very excited to see sharding, Plasma, Casper, and advanced state channels start to come online, and will continue to watch those very closely.\u201dDisclaimer: The views expressed by the author above do not necessarily represent the views of Consensys AG.

Only three tools will be used, so there\u2019ll be a minimum learning curve. The project will be broken down into five phases so it can be easily followed.Intended audience: Students / beginners / intermediate beginners, and anyone with curiosity.Prerequisites: Basic familiarity with JavaScript, React, npm, and the command line. Simple knowledge of ether and gas.Solidity will be used to write our smart contract, though familiarity with it is not needed. I\u2019ll do my best to explain what\u2019s happening, and I\u2019ll link relevant key words to the Solidity documentation for easy reference.Design note: I\u2019m designing this post to be a learning experience which aims to deliver a simple and detailed understanding of the toolset used and the Solidity programming language. Practicing, recalling from memory, and following processes are part of this experience.GitHub repository: If you\u2019d like, you can code along with my repository. I\u2019ve added comments as a guide.Personal process note: I would like to mention that even though these posts appear linear, my process of learning and coding this example was far from it. It was non-linear, a bit like a spiral or a helix. I applied a rapid-prototyping / rapid-iteration process that I learned while attending Stanford University, one where I tried something small, debugged it, tried again, debugged again, and repeated until I got to my goal. In moments of frustration, I took walking breaks, cleared my head, consulted Google search, and tried again. I feel this process is universal in the arena of writing code. I could definitely be wrong about that, though I\u2019ve seen it play out in many of my peers. I\u2019ve learned to love this process and have fun with it.ToolsetFor this project, we\u2019ll be using:Remix IDE: A Solidity development environment provide by the Ethereum development team. It\u2019s available online here. Please keep it open as we work through this learning experience.Metamask: A Chrome extension used to engage the Ethereum blockchain. Please install it and setup your account. We\u2019ll use this to connect with the Ethereum Ropsten Testnet.Text editor: Any text editor you chose will work great. We\u2019ll be using an editor starting in Phase 2 to wire up React with the Ropsten Testnet Etherium Blockchain using Metamask.Overview of PhasesEach phase aims to show specific nuggets of knowledge. They are self-contained and build on top of each other, as in, Phase 2 builds on the work in Phase 1.Phase 0: Get familiar with Remix, and create a smart contract scaffold.Phase 1: Create a public variable, deploy smart contract on JavaScript VM, and interact with it in Remix.Phase 2: Create a private variable, deploy smart contract to Ethereum Ropsten Testnet, and interact with private variable on a React frontend using Metamask as the intermediary.Phase 3: Manipulate the state of a smart contract from React.Phase 4: Engage a conditional on a smart contract, and explore its implications.Phase 0: Remix IDE & Smart Contract ScaffoldWe\u2019ll open up Remix IDE and begin by becoming familiar with its layout, specifically with the right column. We\u2019ll start there.Right column of Remix IDE with the Compile tab openThe Compile tab compiles the source code present in the editor when Remix is loaded. After compiling, Remix provides a Static Analysis, which offers warnings and errors that we can use to edit our code. We can safely ignore warnings for now.By default, the \u2018Auto Compile\u2019 box near the top is checked. I personally prefer to uncheck it, so the compiler doesn\u2019t trigger with each change I make in the editor. Then I manually click the \u2018Start to compile\u2019 button each time I need the source code compiled.Next, let\u2019s look at the Run tab.Right column of Remix IDE with the Run tab openWe deploy smart contracts from the Run tab. Please note the Environment dropdown menu and the light-red Create button. First we select the Environment to declare the context of our deployment, then we click Create to make the smart contract.Under the Environment menu, we\u2019ll use these options:JavaScript VM: To deploy and play with our smart contract right on our browser.Injected Web3: To deploy our smart contract through Metamask on the Ethereum Ropsten Test Network or the Ethereum Main Network.We\u2019ll use the Compile and Run tabs frequently in this project.The left column in Remix is a file explorer, and the center column contains the code editor and a console. I think these are reasonably self-explanatory.Smart Contract ScaffoldRemix usually comes shipped with some code. Please delete this code, and change the filename on the left tab to ReactExample.sol. Then we\u2019ll enter our code in the editor found in the center column.Initial scaffold for a Solidity Smart ContractNote: I offer an image so one can practice typing it, instead of copy / pasting it. This\u2019ll help build memory, as well as be a better learning experience.Since familiarity with Solidity is not assumed, I\u2019ll try to explain each section of code.Line 1: Tells the Solidity compiler that the source code is written in version 0.4.11. Newer versions will be supported up to, but not including, version 0.5.0. I picked version 0.4.11 arbitrarily \u2014 in a real-life project, picking a version will be a technical decision weighing pros, cons, and trade-offs.Line 4: Declares a state variable of type address, which is named owner. It is declared private so its value isn\u2019t visible outside our contract. An address type holds a 160-bit value, the size of an Ethereum address. State variables are stored in a smart contract\u2019s storage, which is a persistent memory area.Line 6: Provides a constructor function that\u2019ll run once, when the smart contract is created. It\u2019s visibility is set to public, which means it\u2019s visible to everyone. All functions in our contract are public, which is the default visibility modifier if none are specified. The constructor\u2019s name must be the same as the contract\u2019s name, which is ReactExample in our case.Line 7: Initializes the owner to be the address of who created the contract. The creator\u2019s address is contained in msg.sender. Note: In JavaScript and other programming languages, we\u2019d need the this keyword to refer to the smart contract instance. In Solidity, it\u2019s not required in this context, but required for external function calls.Line 10: Provides a function which the owner can call in case the smart contract is compromised. Invoking it will destroy the contract.Line 11: Ensures that only the owner can self-destruct the contract. require (condition) throws an exception if the condition inside its parentheses is false.Line 12: Destroys the contract. Recall: owner is an address, so selfdestruct (owner) is going to forward its balance to the owner.Line 15: Provides an anonymous function called a fallback function. The payable modifier ensures the function can receive ether. The revert () call gives back ether to whoever invokes this function.That\u2019s it for Phase 0. Now that we\u2019re a little more familiar with Remix and some basic workings of Solidity, let\u2019s move on to Phase 1 and play with a deployed smart contract.Phase 1: Remix\u2019s JavaScript VM & Interacting with Smart ContractNow that we have a basic smart contract, we\u2019ll add a public state variable, deploy the contract, and interact with it \u2014 all inside Remix IDE.First, let\u2019s add a two lines of code:Public state variable of type string, called you_awesomeLine 5: Declares a public string type variable called you_awesome. When a public state variable is declared, it\u2019s stored in the smart contract\u2019s storage, and Solidity automatically creates a public getter function for it. Recall: storage is a persistent memory area of smart contracts. This public getter function is what we\u2019ll be playing with in this section.Add line 9, which initializes the you_awesome variable to \u201cYou\u2019re awesome\u201dLine 9: Initializes the you_awesome variable with the value \u201cYou\u2019re awesome\u201d. Recall: The constructor function is called only once, when the contract is created. So far, we haven\u2019t deployed our contract yet.First Deployment of Smart Contract on JavaScript VMGeneral process note: Please remember this process. We\u2019ll refer to it in future phases. Any time we\u2019re deploying our smart contract, in any Environment context, we\u2019ll follow these steps:First click \u2018Start to compile\u2019 button on the Compile tab.Once our source code is compiled and the analysis is checked, we\u2019ll click the Run tab.Then we\u2019ll select either JavaScript VM or Injected Web3 in our Environment dropdown menu.Finally, click the \u2018Create\u2019 button.Debug note: If not signed into Metamask in future phases, Injected Web3 will display an error. Please ensure you are signed in while working on this project. This note does not apply yet, but will be relevant later.For our first deployment, we\u2019ll use the JavaScript VM environment.In general, while rapidly-iterating on our smart contract code, we\u2019ll always deploy on the JavaScript VM environment since it\u2019s fast and runs on our browsers. It\u2019s a great place to test our experiments, and it requires no additional setup, i.e, no Metamask or React.When we\u2019re ready for our smart contract to engage with a live Ethereum blockchain \u2014 either the Ropsten Testnet or the real Ethereum blockchain\u2014 we\u2019ll use the Injected Web3 environment. When deployed on a live network, clients can interact with the smart contract through an interface we\u2019ll discuss in the next phase. This process requires setup of Metamask and wiring up with React, at a bare minimum.Alright, let\u2019s deploy our first smart contract on the JavaScript VM environment and play with it!Our first deployed smart contract, which lives in our browser. Contract interface is at the bottom, after the \u20180 pending transactions\u2019 sectionThe colored buttons appearing at the bottom of the screenshot are part of our smart contract \u2014 they are the functions we wrote. Notice how the owner variable doesn\u2019t show up \u2014 this is because it\u2019s visibility is set to private, so the Solidity compiler doesn\u2019t create a public getter function for it.If you click the \u2018you_awesome\u2019 button, the getter function for our public state variable will retrieve the value and display it on the console below the code editor.That\u2019s it for Phase 1. We\u2019ve now written a simple smart contract on Remix, deployed it on the JavaScript VM environment, and interacted with it on our browser. Next, we\u2019ll add a private state variable to our smart contract, deploy to a live test network, setup Metamask as our intermediary, and spin up a React frontend to query that variable.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 Part 1 \u2022\u2022\u2022 Part 2 \u2022\u2022\u2022 Part 3 \u2022\u2022\u2022 Part 4 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022Learn Solidity \u2014 Best Solidity Tutorials (2019) | gitconnectedThe top 14 Solidity tutorials.

It\u2019s how dapps get your account balance, or what lets exchanges ask for your tokens.But when it comes to user privacy, this behavior is less than perfect. Dapp browsers like MetaMask show the Ethereum provider object to any site you visit, which means your Ethereum address is indiscriminately exposed. Since the blockchain is public, your account balance and entire transaction history are retrievable by anyone with your address. Malicious sites can use this data to fingerprint, phish, or track unsuspecting users.Putting you in controlOver the past couple months, MetaMask has led an effort to improve this privacy flaw across the entire Ethereum ecosystem (documented in EIP 1102). We\u2019re excited to introduce \u201cPrivacy Mode\u201d as the user-facing piece of this new privacy layer.As of version 4.18, MetaMask users will see a new option in their settings.Click the top-right icon, then click \u201cSettings,\u201d and find this option near the bottomEnabling Privacy Mode means websites have to ask to see your Ethereum accounts. When a dapp asks for permission to see your accounts, you\u2019ll see a MetaMask popup like this:By default, we\u2019ll remember which sites you\u2019ve allowed to access your addresses. A future version of this feature will let users un-check an option to \u201cKeep me connected to this site,\u201d requiring that site to request access each time you visit.Privacy Mode is simple for users, but it\u2019s a significant paradigm shift for how dapps are built. (If you\u2019re a dapp developer, read this overview for how to stay compatible.)At first, Privacy Mode will be opt-in (and turned \u201coff\u201d by default). Even if you haven\u2019t turned Privacy Mode \u201con\u201d yet, we want to make it clear what\u2019s happening under the hood, so you may start seeing the \u201cConnect to this site\u201d dialog as you use your favorite dapps.If you\u2019ve enabled Privacy Mode and are visiting a dapp that isn\u2019t yet EIP 1102-compliant, the site may not work as expected. In this case, head to your settings, turn Privacy Mode \u201coff,\u201d and try again.The MetaMask team firmly believes EIP 1102 is a crucial step towards a safe, user-friendly decentralized web.

The Token Trader is our implementation of that, and delivers the first step on The AirSwap Roadmap.Initially, trading will be 10:00AM to 4:00PM Eastern (ET) on weekdays. As schedules update we\u2019ll be sure to announce on Twitter and Telegram.A view of Token Trader on the Rinkeby test network. As of today we are now on mainnet.Connect your walletToken Trader supports both the MetaMask browser extension and Ledger hardware wallet devices. This offers true hardware-to-hardware trades, maximizing the control and security you\u2019re able to exercise while trading Ethereum tokens.Both MetaMask and Ledger support multiple accounts, so once you\u2019ve selected your wallet type, you\u2019ll need to confirm the account you\u2019d like to use. To confirm, you\u2019ll be \u201csigning\u201d a piece of data, which is a cryptographic guarantee that you control the account.As you become more involved in this ecosystem, it\u2019s a good idea to consider using a hardware wallet. These keep your private keys protected on-device, which puts it safely out of reach of hackers and other potential bad actors.Enable tradingTo transfer token balances between you and a counterparty, an Ethereum smart contract is required to perform an \u201catomic\u201d swap. By atomic we mean that if one transfer fails, the entire transaction will rollback. This protects both counterparties. Therefore, you must approve the smart contract to perform trades on your behalf to participate in the trading network. Performing these approvals is straightforward as you\u2019ll find them easily in the Token Trader.Wrap some ether (WETH)Ether is what fuels the Ethereum network and serves as its native currency. Because the AirSwap network supports tokens that are standards compliant through ERC20, your ether will need to be \u201cwrapped\u201d to make it compatible for trade.Wrapping and unwrapping Ether on the Token Trader is a quick process. You\u2019ll be able to find this feature on the top left of the screen where you can see your balances. When you wrap, you\u2019ll need to set the amount of \u201cgas\u201d you\u2019d like to spend to execute the transaction.Spending more on gas will generally have your transaction executed more quickly, so the balance you strike between gas and time estimate is up to you. You can experiment with different values by sliding the control left or right.You can choose how quickly you\u2019d like a transaction to complete.Make a tradeRequesting quotes and orders is a painless process. Once you\u2019ve enabled trading, you can dial in different amounts of AST or WETH you\u2019d like to buy. Upon selecting an amount you like to trade, you can request and inspect an order. When ready to fill the order, you\u2019ll be prompted to set gas for the transaction.With gas set, you\u2019ll be prompted to \u201csign\u201d the transaction on your wallet, either MetaMask or a Ledger device. This is the final step, which submits your transaction to the Ethereum blockchain for settlement. This will take some time, which depends on the amount of gas you\u2019ve set.Once it\u2019s completed, congratulations! You\u2019ve made your first DEX trade.What\u2019s nextWe developed the AirSwap Token Trader to bring market makers and retail traders together around peer-to-peer trades, and to build the best programmatic and user interfaces for this new world of decentralized marketplace.Our next step on the roadmap is to turn Token Trader into a wider trading marketplace, where many traders can meet and trade on a global network powered by the AirSwap Indexer. Stay tuned \u2014 we have some exciting things in store that we can\u2019t wait to share.Please join us on Twitter and Telegram for conversation about AirSwap, Token Trader, and decentralized global marketplace.", "responses": 9, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Fintech", "Token Economy"]}, {"title":

uPortSarah Baker MillsFollowNov 21, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readHow did you get involved in blockchain?I first learned about Ethereum from Kumavis (creator of MetaMask) when we worked together at Apple. Since then, I have been investing in cryptos and following the development of Ethereum. A couple of years ago, Kumavis asked me to design a logo for MetaMask, thus the fox you see today was born. Earlier this year, Dan Finlay (Lead Developer on MetaMask) approached me for some design work on MetaMask \u2014 I quickly jumped at the opportunity. Fast forward a few months and I was offered a full-time product design role at ConsenSys.What are you working on now?Lately I\u2019ve been hard at work redesigning the MetaMask experience and user interface. Currently, MetaMask is available as a browser extension, but soon we\u2019ll be releasing a shiny new full page web experience with revamped features and capabilities. In addition to being the lead designer on MetaMask, I\u2019ve also been contributing to the uPort identity project. This includes designing for branding and marketing efforts, mobile product design, demo website, and the developer web portal.What is MetaMask?MetaMask is an Ethereum wallet, identity tool (think wallet = identity) and a bridge to easily and quickly access decentralized applications.What is uPort?uPort is a mobile application and platform that empowers people to own their data. uPort\u2019s vision is to build the infrastructure and systems that will enable people to own their identity, collect attestations, and share those attestations with trusted entities in a private and secure way.What do you enjoy about designing in the blockchain space?Blockchain technology fundamentally changes the way we think about the systems around us \u2014 the way we transfer value, how we interact with applications, the way we manage our privacy online. The systems we currently use are vulnerable, hackable, and suffer from consistent breaches.The opportunity to help design new systems and experiences using blockchain technology excites me about this space. I\u2019ve always been drawn to disruptive ideas that challenge the status quo \u2014 and blockchain technology precisely does this. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity to tackle big problems and shape the future!What are some of the challenges you face when designing for users of decentralized apps?A challenge we\u2019re currently facing is that we need to design for two distinct users \u2014 both technical and non-technical. At this time users of decentralized apps are mainly technical users, though we\u2019re starting to see more and more non-technical users enter the space. Most advanced technical users want a lot of control and functionality that may be intimidating for the average user. Currently, the onramp for users to interact with decentralized apps is steep: they need to know where to buy cryptocurrency, which one to buy, how gas fees work, transferring crypto using public keys, managing their private keys, how to use it to interact with decentralized apps, and much more. This can put a lot of pressure on new users. As a designer, this is something I spend a lot of time thinking about.Another challenge is that this technology is evolving very fast, so conventions are hard to define. However, I am noticing patterns in how developers are using blockchain to leverage new methods for identity management. Data breaches are more and more prevalent these days, how might we use blockchain technology to create a safer internet?As we begin to look at these new experiences, we\u2019re starting to realize that there is so much more we can enable users to do with blockchain than buying and transferring cryptocurrencies online. We have yet to see a blockchain app reach mass adoption; however when we do, I\u2019m confident its success will largely be attributed to its user experience.What advice do you have for a designer new to blockchain?If you\u2019re interested in blockchain \u2014 do your research! Buy some Ether, get a MetaMask wallet, transfer Ether to your friends, and try to buy something with it. You\u2019ll quickly realize how many pain points there are and how much work we still have ahead of us.Like this piece?

Back then, it took a lot of our energy just to convince web developers to even try developing for a browser-provided web API, let alone to stop storing user keys in their own site storage.Back then, there were few tutorials, and very little developer expertise about how this platform operated, and so MetaMask did some things to make it easier for developers to make sites that wouldn\u2019t mess up. One of these features has been the way that MetaMask would reload any page that had touched the web3 API whenever the user changed the network.However, times have changed: Web3 apps have matured significantly, and have begun providing increasingly beautiful user experiences. This also caused extra network activity for inactive tabs, and also was incompatible with our eventual plans for allowing different tabs to connect to different networks. You can read more about our reasoning here. Forcing a reload on these carefully crafted websites is an insult to their competence, and so at MetaMask, we\u2019re finally removing those training wheels, and we will no longer be reloading apps when the user changes the current network.What This Means for DappsThis means that if your web3-enabled website requires a certain network, you should continuously monitor the user\u2019s network to ensure it\u2019s the network you require, or inform the user to change the network.CryptoKitties does a great job of warning users when they\u2019re on the wrong network.To monitor the user\u2019s current selected network, for now you\u2019ll have to poll, the way you do for selected accounts. We absolutely plan to support subscribing to these updates in the near future, please forgive us for the need to poll again. We do cache this value locally, so rest assured this is not making any network round trips:var desiredNetwork = \"1\"setInterval(function () {  web3.version.getNetwork(checkNetwork)}, 1000)function checkNetwork (err, currentNetwork) {  if (err) throw err // Please handle errors responsibly.  if (currentNetwork !== desiredNetwork) {    notifyUserToSwitchNetwork()  } else {    // Go about your business!  }}By including a snippet like this in your project, you\u2019ll be able to curate your user\u2019s experience much more seamlessly within your site.As always, if you have any feedback or questions, you can leave them on this article, open a Github issue, or contact our support team.Happy developing!", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "Development"]}, {"title": "20 Blockchain Projects with the Most Dev Activity on Github\u2014June, 2019", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/20-blockchain-projects-with-the-most-dev-activity-on-github-june-2019-f6f9aeea74ef?source=search_post", "author_name": "ConsenSys", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@ConsenSys", "publish_date": "2019-07-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-07", "readtime": "8.25", "claps": 258, "voters": 43, "content": "20 Blockchain Projects with the Most Dev Activity on Github\u2014June, 2019Congrats to Status, Storj, Metamask, MakerDAO, Gnosis, Augur, and Origin Protocol for all the hard work!ConsenSysFollowJul 3 \u00b7 9 min readYou can tell a whole lot about the state of a project or application by the amount of activity it has on Github. Projects with lots of action are more likely to be in the midst of BUIDLing and shipping, while a Github that\u2019s populated only by lonesome tumbleweeds is a sign of a project that\u2019s either not moving forward or is so perfect that it doesn\u2019t require any more work \u2014 and that is something of a rarity.State of the Dapps does a great job of harvesting data from Github, including commits, pushes, issues, and pull requests from open source projects representing the most notable platforms that support decentralized apps \u2014 including Ethereum, EOS, Steem, and xDai. The result is a bird\u2019s eye view of developer activity in the blockchain space.Although this information is by no means a definitive picture of the blockchain ecosystem for countless reasons, the Github data illustrates some interesting trends regarding developer activity in the blockchain space in regards to open source projects.The month of June showed significant changes in rankings for activity on Github, with projects like Streamr, Colony, and Truffle all slipping out of the Top 20 after a good showing in the previous month of May. June also saw big moves from perennial developmental leaders like Status and Storj.However, Ethereum still dominates the charts from top to bottom. Of the top 20 projects for developer activity, 16 are built on Ethereum, 1 is built on Tendermint, 1 is built on EOS, 1 is Aelf, and newcomer IoTex. This suggests what many already know: that the vast majority of blockchain developer activity is on the Ethereum network.Below are the top 20 projects on State of the Dapps by developer activity over the past 30 days as of July 3rd, 2019\u20261. StatusMobile Ethereum OS Status has long been a leader in the blockchain space, and recent activity on Github \u2014 with 6850 events in the past 30 days \u2014 indicates that the sizable Status team continues to outperform challengers while developing the iOS, Android, and desktop version of the Status app.2. StorjDecentralized cloud storage network Storj is working fast after the launch of its V3 Alpha \u2014 named Vanguard towards Pioneer, the Storj platform beta. The Storj team jumped up from 3rd to 2nd this month with a large increase in activity, totaling a big 6650 events\u2014a 66% increase!3.

You can watch the whole thing here (edited videos coming soon on the MetaMask YouTube channel):The GoalsThe goals of the hackathon were simple: to bring a number of decentralized-web teams together to share their work, put their heads together, and open an invitation to a wider audience to participate.The open hackathon was a call for working projects that used both Ethereum and IPFS. You can see the scoring rubric here.The prize was simple but honorable: a podcast interview with Sir Arthur Falls of The Ether Review Podcast.What We BuiltWhile the participants were hacking away, the hosts were too! The host projects were:EipSignal: A series of pieces that can be used to manage a decentralized standards body by Dan Finlay from MetaMask and Casey Detrio from the Ethereum Foundation. EipSignal could eventually light a path for evolving the web3 provider protocol in a democratic fashion. This project is still under development, but you can look forward to some exciting news soon!DappHub: A one-input-box \u201cWolfram Alpha for the Ethereum Blockchain\u201d by Ryan Casey and Andy Milenius of the DappHub team, with a working example. During the week, Dapple added support for ethpm-compatible ipfs links for browsing source code. Try entering the database contract for Eip-DAO into its search box:ipfs://QmNvkFwUn3UikUSXHUGpoJcrf4BQzozD459T2rt1AbZyqYMetaMaskMesh: Lastly, of the the projects that initiated the entire hackathon, Aaron Davis continued his exciting work writing a peer to peer gossip layer allowing JavaScript ethereum clients to share Ethereum blocks over the IPFS protocol. He also taught IPFS how to interpret Ethereum paths, allowing simple resolution of paths like {block_hash}/state/{address}/balance which will allow the writing of a JavaScript web3 provider that is not backed by a traditional RPC but can instead be backed by peer to peer communication, like a true Ethereum light client.The ContestantsAll entries were submitted as Github Issues on the Hackathon\u2019s Github repository.There were three final contestants. They all had good ideas and goals:MusicCoin: A fork of the Ethereum blockchain designed to help musicians earn royalties peer-to-peer.Carbon Harvest: A strategy to solve global warming using IOT and the Ethereum Blockchain (NBD!)Matriarch: A website for deploying and managing customized Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), based on the MiniMe DAO token.The WinnerWhile all of the entries were noble pursuits, one stood out for a few reasons:It had the most working functionality of all the submissions, including both MetaMask and IPFS integrations.It did not try to reinvent the wheel, but rather built on existing aspects of the ecosystem, which the judges felt best represented the virtues of the transparent, decentralized web.This winner was Matriarch, by ChicoBitcoinJoe. You can try a live demo here! It has a few rough edges, but for a hackathon entry, it represents a considerable achievement, and we\u2019re very proud of Joe\u2019s work!You can look forward to Joe being interviewed soon by Arthur Falls!Wrapping UpThis hackathon was great for the participants and hosts, and we made big steps forward for the Ethereum ecosystem by hyper-powering it on the IPFS protocol, and we\u2019re hoping to do it again. (And we\u2019ll publicize the hackathon better in the future!)It wouldn\u2019t have happened without a ton of community support, so a final thank you to the following people & organizations:Martin Bezce for coming up with the idea.Frankie BeeQueen for leading the organizational efforts and making it happen.Kenny Rowe for bringing together the Seattle Ethereum community, and pulling such a big crowd, even on the night of a historic Super Bowl!ConsenSys for sponsoring the location for the hacking to occur.IPFS and its team for creating a peer to peer platform for sharing merkle DAGs so flexible that it could carry Ethereum!The DappHub team for providing live tools and support for our participants!There are inevitably people we\u2019ve forgotten to list, but your contributions will live forever in the blockchain, not as transactions, but as enrichment, so thank you for all that you\u2019ve done!", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Hackathons", "Decentralized", "Awards"]}, {"title": "Instructions for participation in the SwissBorg Referendum I manually, without the interface.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@swissborg/instructions-for-participation-in-the-swissborg-referendum-manually-without-the-interface-2b9721c8e776?source=search_post", "author_name": "Cyborg @SwissBorg", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@swissborg", "publish_date": "2018-04-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-03", "readtime": "2.38", "claps": 572, "voters": 37, "content": "Instructions for participation in the SwissBorg Referendum I manually, without the interface.Cyborg @SwissBorgFollowApr 3, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readFor users who do not wish to or can\u2019t use the MetaMask extension, here is a guide on how to participate in the referendum manually, without using our voting interface.If you\u2019d like to participate using the voting interface, please follow this guide.If you\u2019d like to read more about the technical aspects of organising a referendum on the blockchain, here\u2019s an article we wrote.If at any point you encounter problems and need help, please consult our FAQs for the referendum, join our Telegram channel or email support@swissborg.comReceiving RSB tokensAs a CHSB token holder, you will have received RSB tokens automatically in the same wallet where you hold CHSB tokens, if tokens were in your own ERC-20 wallet (such as MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, ImToken, Eidoo, etc.) during the 31st of March 2018, but NOT if your tokens were in an exchange.RSB tokens will be used exclusively to vote in the referendum, and tokens not used by the end of this referendum will be burned, thus disappearing from your wallet.The easiest way to check if you have received RSB tokens is to enter your wallet address in the search field of etherscan.ioBefore votingYour vote will influence the development of the SwissBorg Platform so please read the documentation provided before voting.

Projects with lots of action are more likely to be in the midst of BUIDLing and shipping, while a Github that\u2019s populated only by lonesome tumbleweeds is a sign of a project that\u2019s either not moving forward or is so perfect that it doesn\u2019t require any more work \u2014 and that is something of a rarity.State of the Dapps does a great job of harvesting data from Github, including commits, pushes, issues, and pull requests from open source projects representing the most notable platforms that support decentralized apps \u2014 including Ethereum, EOS, Steem, and xDai. The result is a bird\u2019s eye view of developer activity in the blockchain space.Although this information is by no means a definitive picture of the blockchain ecosystem for countless reasons, the Github data illustrates some interesting trends regarding developer activity in the blockchain space in regards to open source projects. Don\u2019t see your favorite project listed below? Encourage them to make their activity public and published on State of the Dapps (We\u2019re looking at you, Cardano fans!)The month of July showed significant changes in rankings for activity on Github, with projects like Neufund slipping out of the Top 20 after a good showing in the previous month of June and upwards moves from the likes of eSteem and Polymath. July also saw big moves from perennial developmental leaders like Status and Storj. However, Ethereum still dominates the charts from top to bottom, with projects representing EOS, Steem, and Tendermint also maintaining a strong presence.Below are the top 20 projects on State of the Dapps by developer activity over the past 30 days as of August 6, 2019\u20261.

Users should back up their seed phrases immediately, even if they think they already did, by following this guide.In response to user reports, we began internal diligence on the problem, ultimately deciding to issue a public bug bounty with a gradually increasing reward until a possible cause and fix for the issue were found. We were grateful to see extensive community participation in the bounty. In particular, an important observation by Chris Cassano led to a full reproduction example by Mike Seese.Although the unique issue that caused the seed phrase problem appears to be uncommon, we are offering a continuous bounty for similar bugs in the future. We want to always encourage community scrutiny of our code.The BugPrior to the bug fix, MetaMask\u2019s Create Vault function had the ability to create multiple vaults. Under normal processing conditions, creation occurred quickly and the seed phrase displayed was correlated to the most recently created vault. However, when abnormally slow processing power was present, if a user triggered Create Vault multiple times, then viewed the seed phrase, it was possible, though unlikely, that the user was shown a seed phrase from one of their prior Create Vault attempts. This apparently occurred because the old seed phrase was displayed before resolution of the more recent attempts to create a vault were resolved due to the processing power issue.To fix this bug, we\u2019re pushing an update to MetaMask to add a lock to the Create Vault process designed for better processing order even under abnormally low processing power conditions. The fix ensures at multiple layers that only a single seed phrase will be created for a first time user.The AwardSince the bounty was for reproduction steps leading to a fix, the full bounty award will be going to Mike Seese. Congratulations Mike, and thanks for your help!Because Chris Cassano made an important observation, we\u2019re also going to give him a smaller thank-you prize.ConclusionFor our users, if you haven\u2019t yet, please immediately back up your seed phrase again, even if you\u2019ve already done so. We are releasing a fix for this issue today, so new users should not be vulnerable to this particular problem.MetaMask is a free open source software project under the MIT Sharealike License, but we care deeply about our users and our community and are never pleased to see bugs like this arise. We hope that you have found our response to these issues appropriate, but as always, please be cautious with your assets and do not use MetaMask, which remains experimental open source software, to store or transfer more assets than you are willing to lose.We wish you all the best luck in the decentralized web.

All transactions are performed on-chain on the Ethereum Network and users retain full custody of their assets at all times.

These types of processes can often take days or longer on centralized exchanges and users are also sometimes requested to provide customer information that is not available in certain parts of the world.Until now, the use of decentralized exchanges has so far been largely difficult for users, who face clunky user interfaces and an awkward process to be able to make deposits, perform trades and to withdraw their funds.MetaMorph CIO Mark says\u201cWe have listened and we have improved.

In this article, we\u2019ll review why this happened, what we did about it, and what we\u2019ll do differently next time to make this type of thing less likely to occur in the future.TLDR; We had a process oversight, cached less than we could, and had a request timeout set too slow. We recommend Dapp developers register their app\u2019s method names on the on-chain method registry.Context of the ChangeAt MetaMask, we\u2019ve long known that one of our most important duties is to make transactions safe and coherent for users to approve, and over our history, we\u2019ve come a long way to making it safer and easier to understand what you\u2019re doing with MetaMask, but we have a long way to go still!An early, non-interactive confirmation alert from June 2016. I don\u2019t have earlier examples on-hand, but they were even more sparse.Earlier this year we introduced integration with the Parity on-chain method registry, allowing developers to verify their function names, so we could render them on the confirmation screen.We chose this approach because it relied on the same trust infrastructure the user already has configured (Infura by default, or any other provider they chose), to ask a smart contract registry that could trustlessly verify the method signatures submitted to it on-chain, allowing us to render a method name with a high degree of certainty this was the method name the developer used when writing the contract (hash collisions aside).This approach is far from perfect: It lacks translation, or really any rich interpretation of the transaction at all, but it is a nice and easy thing we knew we could add that gives context to an otherwise hard-to-decipher screen when interacting with contracts you\u2019re not familiar with.Despite publishing that integration, many developers have not registered their method names on that on-chain registry, and our MetaMetrics program further emphasized to us just how important the confirmation screen is to our user experience.This led us to pursue a fallback centralized method registry lookup, leveraging 4byte.directory by the wonderful Piper Merriam. Our confirmation view would check the on-chain registry first, and if it was unavailable, it would try 4byte.The Nature of the ProblemDespite this reasonable plan, we had a few issues with the way it was ultimately carried out.First of all, the directory lookups blocked the loading of the confirmation screen, which we already know is slower than ideal to load. This means if those lookups are slow, the confirmation window would also appear slowly.Second, while we had good error handling for this endpoint, the timeout period for the 4byte lookup was not customized, and so it defaulted to one minute, and so if 4byte.directory was very slow to respond or throw errors, users would encounter up to a one minute wait before seeing a generic \u201cContract Interaction\u201d confirmation window.Third, we also added method name rendering to our transaction list, and these lookups were not locally cached, and so every user who loaded their transaction list essentially contributed to a DDoS of 4byte.directory during that time.Fourthly, the change was reviewed and merged without coordinating with 4byte itself, and so 4byte was unprepared for the coming onslaught of user requests.Combine the DDoS of the transaction list with the long timeout of the confirmation\u2019s lookup, and you have some users, who are using unregistered method names getting one-minute confirmation windows.Through this process, some people have asked us about the nature of our QA process, and we have a pretty thorough and documented process for a release, and we also rolled this release out gradually, starting with 3% of Chrome users on Tuesday, and didn\u2019t roll out entirely until Thursday, but because the issue would only really manifest when 4byte went down, the issue didn\u2019t really become visible until we had fully rolled out to production, Friday morning activity began, and the DDoS was in full effect.Many users tweeted at us, and our support team regrets not having noticed the correlation of these reports, but taken individually, the issue was similar to a variety of other issues, like users with slow internet connections, and so they were helped in a more generic way.We also received a number of reports on our GitHub, which allowed users to pile on to common issues, making it much more obvious that the reports were a new and widespread issue, and this ultimately is what got our team\u2019s attention first.Our ResponseOnce we were alerted to the issue, we identified the cause very quickly, and had a revert fix PR ready within an hour, which we then promptly published to the Firefox and Chrome stores.We had team members communicating with users on GitHub and via email and social media about the nature of the issue, and how they could work around it by installing the new fix manually if needed, instead of waiting for the update to auto-install.Unfortunately, the Google Chrome store also automatically flagged this particular release (the fix) for a manual review, which was a new procedure to us. We had no idea how long that process was going to take, and so we began working on alternative workarounds for scenarios where Google might take unacceptably long to accept our change.We were prepared to heavily update the on-chain registry, in turn avoiding our 4byte.directory lookups, around the time that Google accepted our version update and it should since be live for all users.Learnings and Next StepsIt has been a while since we had a severe usability issue like this, and so we\u2019re taking the opportunity to learn as much about our process from this event as possible.First of all, we\u2019re enhancing our code review policy to include requirements about pull requests that involve third party APIs, including coordinating with them, appropriately caching those requests, and ensuring timeouts are considered with good user experience in mind.It was suggested that we invite the community to facilitate in our QA process, and so we\u2019re currently considering a community QA program where we would publish \u201cnightly\u201d builds for a period before going to production, with bug bounties on each one.We plan to make our confirmation windows faster to load with several strategies, including allowing non-critical data to load in-line (and not block the rest of the interface from loading). We\u2019re also planning to add much more thorough caching for these method signatures, to reduce the number of outbound requests, and we\u2019re looking at hosting a CDN cache of method signatures as well, so we do not overly strain community infrastructure.Finally, we\u2019re also drafting a crisis response guide that includes a few tricks we came up with during this event to help us more effectively coordinate with the affected users on the many communication channels they reach out to us on.If you\u2019re a dapp developer, you can also improve your user\u2019s experience by registering your function names on the on-chain registry as described in our docs here.ConclusionAt MetaMask it\u2019s our solemn privilege to facilitate you using the decentralized web, and as our user base has grown, so has our responsibility to bring you a solid experience. We\u2019re proud of how long it\u2019s been since we had a usability issue that affected this many people, but we\u2019ve only gotten as stable as we are through rigorous discipline, and commitment to quality at all levels, and so we\u2019re happy to take this opportunity to learn and grow, and we hope by showing you how we\u2019re dealing with the issues we face that we maintain your trust that we\u2019re here, taking your experience and safety seriously.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "PostMortem"]}, {"title": "Guide to trade, lend, transfer and release", "post_link": "https://medium.com/etheremon/guide-to-trade-lend-transfer-and-release-39b5d2fb3632?source=search_post", "author_name": "Etheremon", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@myetheremon", "publish_date": "2018-01-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-09", "readtime": "2.57", "claps": 311, "voters": 12, "content": "Guide to trade, lend, transfer and releaseEtheremonFollowJan 21, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readBefore performing any actions below, please get your Metamask or Mist ready.Place a sell order:Go to My Mons>MonsFind the Etheremon that you wish to sellClick \u201csell\u201d button on your Etheremon\u2019s cardEnter price, click \u201cplace an order\u201dFollow instructions on Metamask/MistAfter the transaction is mined, go to Market>For Sale to see it listedOnce the Etheremon is sold, you can see it under My Mons>Sold2.

But don\u2019t worry! Interacting with Ethereum, which is the blockchain we use to power Gods Unchained, is probably a lot easier to use than you might think.Before we begin, it\u2019s helpful to have a basic understanding of what Ethereum is.\u201cEthereum is a giant network consisting of a huge number of computers connected together. This large, interconnected web of computers is called the Ethereum Virtual Network (EVN) essentially a global, \u201csupercomputer\u201d where all transactions occurring in the Ethereum network are updated and recorded into each computer. Ether (ETH) is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain and is used as the \u201cfuel\u201d for the network.\u201d \u2014 MasterTheCrypto.orgIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about Ethereum & the blockchain, we will have links at the bottom of this article where you can learn more.Let\u2019s get started!Step 1: Download MetaMaskTo get started we first need to download MetaMask, a browser extension that allows you to easily store, send and receive digital assets (like cryptocurrencies) on Ethereum. MetaMask is available as a browser extension in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and the new Brave browser.In this example we will be using the Chrome, but installation steps are virtually the same for other browsers. To download MetaMask, visit metamask.io and download the extension for the browser you\u2019d like to use.Once installed, you can click on the icon in your browser to open the application. If it\u2019s your first time using MetaMask, you will have to set a password and save a key file which can be used to recover your wallet if you ever get locked out.Click the fox icon in the upper-right corner of your browser to open MetaMaskStep 2: Get some ether (ETH)Next, we will need to load MetaMask with some ether (ETH) \u2014 a fuel that powers the Ethereum network. ETH is just like any other currency and will be required to pay for things on Gods Unchained. You will need to convert your currency (e.g. USD, CAD, GBP, etc.) into ETH and load it into your MetaMask wallet.How to buy ETHIf you are a U.S. resident, you can purchase ETH from within MetaMask using the integrated third-party exchange, Coinbase. Simply open MetaMask, click \u201cBUY\u201d, and follow the given instructions. After you purchase your ETH it will automatically show up in your MetaMask wallet.Full disclosure: Coinbase Ventures is an investor in Fuel Games (we just think Coinbase is the easiest to use).If you live outside the U.S., you will need to purchase ETH from an online exchange available in your country. You can find a list of popular exchanges with the highest volume here. Once you purchase your ETH, you will need to send it from your exchange account to your MetaMask Address. You can find your Address by clicking the (\u201c\u2026\u201d) within MetaMask and clicking \u201cCopy Address to clipboard\u201d.Locating your Public Key Address in MetaMaskOnce you transfer ETH funds into your MetaMask address, we are able to move on to making purchases.Step 3: Buy a pack!Now that we have installed MetaMask and funded it with some ETH, we\u2018re almost ready to purchase a pack!But first\u2026 let\u2019s talk about gas.What\u2019s \u201cgas\u201d?\u201cGas\u201d is the name for a special unit in Ethereum, which is used to pay computers on the network for processing your transactions. You pay gas fees in ether (ETH). We will only cover the basics right now, but if you\u2019d like, you can learn more about gas here.There are two components to gas that we need to understand before making transactions, the Gas Limit and Gas Price.The Gas Limit is the maximum amount of gas you are willing to spend on a particular transaction. The gas limit increases in relation to the amount of work that needs to be done to execute a contract on the Ethereum network. When making transactions through MetaMask, the gas limit will be calculated automatically, NEVER CHANGE THE GAS LIMIT.The Gas Price refers to the amount of ETH you\u2019re willing to pay for every unit of gas, and is measured in \u201cGwei\u201d (1 billion Gwei = 1 Ether). The gas price fluctuates based on how busy the Ethereum network is. The network processes higher priority transactions first, where priority is primarily measured by the gas price. This means in order our transaction to process quickly, we need to supply it with a high enough gas price for the network to pick it up otherwise risk waiting hours or days for it to confirm!Before we make our purchase, let\u2019s first check what the current gas prices are so we know how much to pay the network.We\u2019ll need to check what the current Gas Prices are, so navigate over to EthGasStation.info in a new browser tab or window. On the right hand side of the screen you will see \u201cRecommended Gas Prices\u201d.Each price corresponds to a different speed. The speed is how long the initial transaction will take to process. If you don\u2019t want to wait, look for the Fast (<2m) price.Making a purchaseNavigate to the \u201cGet Packs\u201d section of our site and select the pack rarity and quantity you would like to purchase.Click \u201cBUY\u201d and MetaMask should open automatically prompting you to confirm the transaction. You\u2019ll then need to set the gas price to what we just looked up. Do not change the Gas Limit.If MetaMask doesn\u2019t automatically open: click the MetaMask icon to open the confirmation page and the transaction will be in your cart. If you clicked \u201cBUY\u201d multiple times before clicking on the MetaMask icon, you will have multiple items added to your cart. Click \u201cREJECT ALL\u201d and restart the process so you don\u2019t end up accidentally purchasing more packs than you originally intended.Set the Gas Price: Now remember the gas price we just looked up on EthGasStation.info? You need to change the gas price on the confirmation page to match it. MetaMask typically does a pretty good job at calculating this, but it\u2019s not always perfect. Remember, do not change the Gas Limit.Now just hit submit, and MetaMask will initiate the transaction!You\u2019ll now need to wait for your transaction to confirm in the network. There are two transactions that need to occur before you receive your packs, one on your end, and one on ours.You will be notified as soon as your packs arrive, at which point you can navigate over to the Temple to open them up!

Users will be able to increase their voting weights + receive daily rewards in return for freezing their tokens.Vote?All HYPE Token holders who have frozen their HYPE tokens are eligible to vote. Voting event is held monthly to determine the next month\u2019s burning % and daily freezing rewards %. More information can be found on the Whitepaper.Voting Weights?The more voting weight your address has, the more power your votes will be. Usually, the longer & the more you freeze = more voting weight.Freezing Rewards?When you freeze HYPE tokens, frozen amounts will not be available in your wallet. This simply means that you won\u2019t be able to spend your frozen tokens until you unfreeze & release them back to your wallet. In return for freezing, you receive daily freezing rewards based on the amounts you have frozen.Current Daily Freezing Rewards Rate: 1% dailyThis means, if you have frozen 100 HYPE tokens, you will be receiving 1 HYPE token every day. NOTE: Rewards DO NOT compound.Where does the rewards go?Daily Rewards are accumulated on the token contract until you unfreeze any amount of tokens. Whenever you unfreeze any amount of your tokens, your accumulate rewards will automatically start melting.Freezing rewards are kept on the token contract as \u2018accumulated rewards\u2019 until you melt them & \u2018RELEASE\u2019 them to your wallet.What happens if I don\u2019t melt my accumulated rewards?They will keep accumulating BUT if the daily freezing rewards % changes, they will also be actively applied to your accumulated rewards. This means whenever we change the daily freezing rewards % every month, your accumulated rewards may also decrease/increase with the changed rewards %.Remember, users vote for the freezing rewards % and burning % every month. It is therefore, best advised that you always melt & release your accumulated rewards at the end of the month, before the daily freezing rewards % changes.For example (assuming that current daily freezing rewards % is 1% daily):John has 100 HYPE tokens as accumulated rewards.John decides not to claim his accumulated rewards at the end of the month.On the next month, daily freezing rewards % is changed from 1% -> 2%.Now, John has 200 HYPE tokens as accumulated rewards.However, if the daily freezing rewards % is changed from 1% -> 0.5%, John\u2019s accumulated rewards will change to 50 HYPE tokens.If you do not melt & release your accumulated rewards, your accumulated rewards will change every month, according to the changing daily freezing rewards %.If the daily freezing rewards % decreases, your accumulated rewards will decrease. If the daily freezing rewards % increase, your accumulated rewards will increase accordingly.Remember to claim your accumulated rewards before the end of the month if you do not wish to risk anything!How to Freeze HYPE Tokens (Trust Wallet)Open Trust Wallet on your mobile devicesClick on \u2018Browser\u2019Go to dapp.hypetoken.ioGo to the \u2018MY HYPE ZONE\u2019 sectionBelow the \u2018UNFROZEN BALANCE\u2019 tab, click on the \u2018FREEZE\u2019 button6.

I had used MetaMask before and felt good about my ability to complete the project, so I registered my interest and got to work.What is MetaMask?MetaMask is a multi-browser plugin which I\u2019d describe as an Ethereum caddy \u2014 it holds an Ether cryptocurrency wallet, makes that wallet available on web pages, and helps you sign and interact with other \u2018smart contracts\u2019 and tokens online using the web3 library.I first downloaded MetaMask to create an account and interact with CryptoKitties, but it\u2019s used many places around the web.How is a bounty created?Owocki created the bounty with 0.4 Ether (then worth $393, now closer to $320) on GitCoin. This automatically added a notification to the relevant GitHub Issue, which had been open since July 2016. Maintainer Kumavis quickly made a comment which warned bounty hunters to focus on the newest UI branch.How did I start working on the bounty?I found out about the bounty when I saw this Tweet:The first step was to claim this task, so we don\u2019t have multiple people creating duplicate solutions or potentially copying each other\u2019s work. A claim lasts for two weeks.On the GitCoin website, I needed to associate myself with an Ethereum address, which is best accomplished with MetaMask (!!). I used the plugin to create an address and receive a small amount of Ether. Then I was able to sign the contract and pay a fee (typical in Ethereum transactions). According to this transaction record in the blockchain, I spent about 12 cents on the transaction and \u2018gas\u2019 fees.I asked Kumavis for some clarification to make sure that I would be working on the right branch.Is it difficult to add internationalization to a browser extension?I was concerned at first, then I found the guide for Chrome apps, then I discovered that this is now a web standard which works in all the MetaMask browsers.I was pleased to see the views use React / Hyperscript syntax, so all of the view code had a consistent appearance and was all in one ui directory.Unraveling the project, there were four main tasks:make a translation function which calls browser.i18n.getMessage or a fallback functionreplace all UI text, such as <button>Confirm</button>, with the translation function <button>t(\u2018confirm\u2019)</button>enter shortcut codes in the manifest.json file so that the name and description in the App Store can be translatedbuild an organized list of all translations for the default language locale (en for English) which can be copied for other languagesSome internationalization issues were:inconsistent UI text (e.g. buttons on different forms reading \u2018Confirm\u2019 and \u2018CONFIRM\u2019). I decided to replace the latter with \u2018Confirm\u2019 and a text-transform: uppercase; \u2014 this is also better for accessibility reasons.a shorthand for longer phrases (\u2018Confirm this Transaction\u2019 with \u2018confirmThisTransaction\u2019 or \u2018confirmButton\u2019 or \u2018transactionConfirmButton\u2019?)organizing the English translations (I decided on alphabetical order, so that similar phrases might be bundled together)a few menus looked at the text of your choice and not a unique ID.Building and TestingI found it difficult to consistently build the new UI branch on my machine. Maybe I have an old version of gulp? I got a full build working one day, tested it out, and forgot how to do it by the next day.Tests on my machine and CircleCI were partially successful then returned with different errors, which I don\u2019t fully understand. I think it may be related to old UI vs. new UI.I suspect that these problems are common for bounty developers who move from project to project. If I were a full-time \u2018bounty hunter\u2019, I would either create a new development environment for each project, or I would insist on projects facilitating that. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good Dockerfile out there for Chrome and Firefox testing.I wasn\u2019t sure how to write new tests around internationalization. JavaScript tests don\u2019t have a browser.i18n API, so they always run my fallback function. I created a Japanese locale, but to make it appear, it wasn\u2019t enough to add Japanese to my browser preferences\u2026 I needed to change my OS language. This was a little scary (what if I couldn\u2019t figure out how to go back?) and I\u2019m not sure how to implement that in a testing environment.Circling backOnce I had seen the project working on my machine, I posted a Work-In-Progress pull request on the MetaMask repo. I explained some of my design decisions and asked for feedback (particularly on how to name and organize the almost 190 translatable phrases).Five days later, still having no major response, I finished up coding and posted another comment, ending with \u201cWelcoming your feedback on this\u201d.Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t hear any feedback in the past 10 days, and my hold on the project expired. Around the same time I started a new job, where I\u2019m not allowed to do bounty work on the side :-PUpdated March 12th, 2018It took a month and a half, but after another user asked about translations, two developers at Consensys started on the final work to merge and approve my code for addition to MetaMask! That means the project was a success!I couldn\u2019t contribute much to this final step, so I asked the bounty-poster and the other contributors about splitting the reward. The other guys said it was their full-time work, so I\u2019ve now claimed and received the full amount (about $280 at today\u2019s prices). Another big plus is that I\u2019ll be seeing translations soon (I know people have already volunteered for Chinese and Russian).ConclusionsI would love to do more bounty work in the future. With cryptocurrency payments, it would be possible for someone to work on this anywhere in the world, without worrying about bank accounts or revealing their identity.Before this type of coding goes mainstream, project builds and tests need to be designed carefully for a coder to drop into a project and help, without first learning the ongoing development branches or personalities on the project.Also, if a bounty is offered by a project user, and the code is not a priority for the maintainers, then how will the bounty be claimed? It\u2019s not unusual for a freelancer to wait a long time to get paid, but having a 3rd party makes it more complex. If I were relying on this bounty for my livelihood, I might check for more buy-in from the maintainers before and after starting work.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Coding", "Internationalization"]}, {"title": "TRON Developer Guide\u2014TronLink Integration", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@Tronfoundation/tron-developer-guide-tronlink-integration-194cf2de2c9a?source=search_post", "author_name": "TRON Foundation", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Tronfoundation", "publish_date": "2019-06-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-10", "readtime": "1.33", "claps": 11, "voters": 2, "content": "TRON Developer Guide\u2014TronLink IntegrationTRON FoundationFollowJun 9 \u00b7 2 min readTronLink, similar to MetaMask, is a bridge for allowing TRON DApps to run in the browser without having to deploy a TRON Full Node.

My first pass has been to declare a generic Keyring protocol, which is just the code-side of managing a number of key pairs, but haven\u2019t gotten to the UI plugin part yet.Right now we manage those keyrings with a keyring controller, which is a little over-coupled to our code right now, but we are working towards making it a totally independent way of managing multiple signing strategies.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "HOW TO ADD RDC TOKEN TO ETH WALLET", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@roomdao/how-to-add-rdc-token-to-eth-wallet-41b5af0ccbbd?source=search_post", "author_name": "Andro_newman", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@roomdao", "publish_date": "2018-05-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-15", "readtime": "0.40", "claps": 4, "voters": 2, "content": "HOW TO ADD RDC TOKEN TO ETH WALLETAndro_newmanFollowMay 15, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readOPEN YOUR METAMASK OR MEWCHOOSE: ADD TOKENUSE SMART CONTRACT ADRESS TO ADD RDC TOKEN AT YOUR WALLET0x840086881Facb1E8C222Fa5DEB2f93F238B0bA95RDC TOKEN WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR WALLETFOR CONTRIBUTE PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINKhttps://roomdao.io/buy.htmlAND WE WILL SEND YOU AN ADRESS FOR CONTRIBUTIONBest regards, ROOMDAO.io", "responses": 1, "tags": ["ICO", "Bounty Program", "Airdrop", "Startup", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "About Cobo", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@iotex/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%98%A4%ED%85%8D%EC%8A%A4-iotex-%EB%8C%80%ED%91%9C-%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8%EC%9D%84-%EC%9C%84%ED%95%9C-%EB%AA%A8%EB%B0%94%EC%9D%BC-%ED%88%AC%ED%91%9C-dapp%EA%B0%80-%EC%B6%9C%EC%8B%9C-e340ee6cee48?source=search_post", "author_name": "IoTeX", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@iotex", "publish_date": "2019-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-11", "readtime": "2.88", "claps": 51, "voters": 2, "content": "IoTeXFollowApr 11 \u00b7 3 min read\uc544\uc774\uc624\ud14d\uc2a4(IoTeX) \ub300\ud45c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud22c\ud45c DApp\uac00 \ucd9c\uc2dcCobo\uc9c0\uac11 \u2014 IoTeX \ub300\ud45c \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\uac00 IoTeX \ub300\ud45c\uc790 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud22c\ud45c DApp\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd \ucd9c\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4\ub294 \uc18c\uc2dd\uc744 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc5d0\uac8c \uc54c\ub824\ub4dc\ub9ac\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4 \ub108\ubb34 \uae30\uc069\ub2c8\ub2e4! \uc774 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud22c\ud45c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, MetaMask \ud234\uc774 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub41c Cobo\uc9c0\uac11\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud22c\ud45c \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.Cobo \uc571\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \u201c Explore \u201c \uc139\uc158 \uc544\ub798\uc758 IoTeX \ud22c\ud45c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud45c\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ud22c\ud45c\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5b4\ud50c\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc800\ud76c\uc758 \uc6f9 \ud22c\ud45c \ud3ec\ud138\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc81c MetaMask\ub97c \ubcc4\ub3c4\ub85c \uc124\uce58\ud560 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uae30\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 Cobo \uc571\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud22c\ud45c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4!

We talked about cryptocurrency and discovered we both use the MetaMask wallet.Back in 2018, I\u2019d answered a bounty challenge, added translation features, and within 6 months MetaMask had 23 language options. Unfortunately none of the languages commonly spoken in Kurdistan (including Arabic, Kurdish, and Persian) were on the list yet. Also discouraging: if someone did translate them, everything would be in an unfriendly left-to-right layout. I offered to get right-to-left CSS working, if only a native speaker would submit a translation to make it worthwhile.As I continued my trip, Ehsan sent a translation over. This was a breakthrough as I could check if everything was rendering correctly! Then on a long bus ride, I found and flipped every CSS left and right that I could find, wrapping the new CSS in [dir=\u2018rtl\u2019] & { \u2026 }.I\u2019m going to mention and show bugs, but they are now fixed!The next day, I built the extension and imported it into my browser. Here we see only minor issues on the home screen:Colorful circle / Identicon menu was made invisibleETH0 needs spacing between value and suffixHeading on transaction list needs whitespace to its rightAfter researching Identicon, which is full of SVG circle slices, I decided to apply direction: ltr to keep it consistent.Token search had only minor issues: fixing positioning of the search icon, and setting direction: ltr on token names so the parentheses will enclose correctly.In the future it\u2019s possible that some tokens will be named in RTL languages... It\u2019s not possible to set direction: auto in CSS, but another option may be to make the top-level element of the transaction list dir=\u201cauto\u201d and text-align: right.To receive cryptocurrency, you can show someone a QR code or send them your address. The address is rather long so clicking here just copies it to your clipboard.The abbreviation which typically shows the start of the address (0x38c1b\u2026) was flipped to show the end. This had to be fixed (imagine if you\u2019re sending between two UIs\u2026 \u201cis it the account starting with 0x38c1b?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know, is it the one ending with 7Ede66?\u201d)I also reviewed the recovery words screens (not sharing my private key here, so no screenshot). The words are in English, and display in LTR order. But then when you create the account there\u2019s a step to select and re-order them, and recovery requires re-typing them; both steps needed to be restored to left-aligned text and layout.I made transactions to make sure that the main interface was working.first pass at RTL UIThe arrow from sender to receiver still pointed left-to-right, even though the layout changes had moved sender to the right and receiver to the left. I applied transform: rotate(180deg) to arrows in transactions, confirmations, and regular menu items.Negative numbers and number inputs are a little tricky to get spacing and formatting correct. I found a lesson plan which confirmed that the minus sign should appear between ETH and the number.The copy icon needed some !important CSS to overwrite its padding.The address abbreviation problem reared up again, but in a weirder form (the label meaning \u201cfrom: ___\u201d is part of the same text node, so I can\u2019t apply CSS to the address alone, and if I flip the direction of the text, the abbreviation will cut off \u201cfrom\u201d or \u201cto\u201d). I ended up splitting the From/To label into a different <span>, and putting it on its own line with display: block in RTL, so it can appear correctly on the right edge, while the address is visible from the left and cut off on the right\u2026 here\u2019s what it looks like in context.Awesome!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Internationalization", "I18n"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@davecraige/hi-sunk818-a1db3c345147?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dave Craige", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@davecraige", "publish_date": "2018-09-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-11", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Says we have to use metamask?1sunk818Dave CraigeFollowSep 11, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readHi @Sunk818,Yes, you can use Metamask to test out messaging.

Naturally a wealthy person can potentially exert far more influence on the rankings than a poor person, so I would consider this system to be inherently anti-democratic. In a democratic system every participant would have equal influence on the rankings.Voting and spending are fundamentally different things, so they really can\u2019t be equally effective at prioritizing things. Do you think that democracy would do a better job than the market at ranking the convention themes?From my perspective there\u2019s plenty of concrete evidence that democracy elevates trash rather than treasure.Compare the top-ranked content on Youtube (equal influence) to the top-ranked content on Honest Cash (unequal influence).The highest ranked story on HC is about crypto, the second story is about a guy who donates his programming skills to worthy crypto projects, and the third story is about censorship (the author cites J.S. Mill).What are the top-ranked Youtube videos about? Pewdiepie playing video games? Rap music videos?Technorati, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with it, is one of those services that watches activity on the web, and then puts up metrics and ranks and scores, and tries to distill the flux into something simpler and more comprehensible, which often reduces to telling you how many people are trying to find pictures of a naked Paris Hilton. When the mob votes, it always seems to lead to the lowest common denominator. \u2014 PZ Myers, WAAGNFNP declares war on TechnoratiMyers hates libertarians, yet in this case he was channeling Hayek\u2026In the first instance, it is probably true that in general the higher the education and intelligence of individuals becomes, the more their views and tastes are differentiated and the less likely they are to agree on a particular hierarchy of values. It is a corollary of this that if we wish to find a high degree of uniformity and similarity of outlook, we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primitive and \u201ccommon\u201d instincts and tastes prevail. This does not mean that the majority of people have low moral standards; it merely means that the largest group of people whose values are very similar are the people with low standards. It is, as it were, the lowest common denominator which unites the largest number of people. If a numerous group is needed, strong enough to impose their views on the values of life on all the rest, it will never be those with highly differentiated and developed tastes it will be those who form the \u201cmass\u201d in the derogatory sense of the term, the least original and independent, who will be able to put the weight of their numbers behind their particular ideals. \u2014 Friedrich Hayek, Why the Worst Get on TopMarkets and democracies really aren\u2019t going to elevate the same people and ideas.It\u2019s a self-evident truth, or at least it should be, that democracies elevate the really wrong people/ideas.We need to strike the root\u2026", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Economics", "Democracy", "Cent", "Honestcash", "Market"]}, {"title": "We have released MGO official GitHub", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@mobilegoofficial/we-have-released-mgo-official-github-210ae8218874?source=search_post", "author_name": "MobileGO", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mobilegoofficial", "publish_date": "2019-02-08", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-08", "readtime": "0.70", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "We have released MGO official GitHubMobileGOFollowFeb 8 \u00b7 1 min readExcellent news everyone!

Bitcoin wallet doesn\u2019t support the storage of ETH. Therefore, ETH wallet is recommended if the users want to trade, send, and receive ETH. Here, we use MetaMask, a browser wallet, as an example and introduce how to create a wallet through simple steps.Before creating a wallet, there\u2019re several concepts users need to know\uff1aAddress\uff1aThe wallet address is similar to a bank account. When trading, the wallet address will be used to send or receive the ETH with other traders. Through wallet address, anyone can look up the account information such as trading records or token amount. However, the wallet address doesn\u2019t need to be bind with users\u2019 identity, so there are no concerns for the leakage of personal information.2. Private key\uff1aThe private key is similar to the personal signature but encrypted. The private key is the basis for signing transactions in Ethereum. When trading, it\u2019s the only way to access an Ethereum account and used to confirm the trade is authorized. As the result, anyone knows your private key can access your assets so it needs to be kept carefully.MetaMask creates your wallet on the local terminals and communicates with other blockchain networks, therefore the private key of your wallet is only stored on your local PC. Your wallet is 100% secure and you don\u2019t need to worry about assets loss due to any hacker attack to MetaMask servers. Currently MetaMask is supported on Chrome\u3001Opera, and Firefox.\u3010Install MetaMask\u3011Click HERE to visit the MetaMask download page on Chrome Web Store. Create a new wallet.2.Click on the \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d on the upper right corner and confirm your  installation.3.After installation completes, you will see MetaMask website, and fox head  icon will appear next to your brewer\u2019s URL box, indicating that the installation has completed.4.Click on NEXT to create your wallet.\u3010How to use MetaMask\u30111.Click on the MetaMask logo on the upper right corner of your browser.2.Read and Accept the MetaMask terms and Conditions.3.MetaMask requires a group of passwords for your wallet, for which purpose you must confirm your password.4.A 12-word seed phrase will be generated, and you must keep a record of these words. From now on, the seed phrase will be only stored on your PC and is the synonym of your account. Both MetaMask and Star Bit\u00ae exchange will not attempt to access your seed phrase, and you must keep it in good custody. The seed words will be required, if you lost your password or try to log in on a new PC.5.Now your MetaMask wallet is ready!\u203bhttps://www.starbitex.com/", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Metamask", "Learning", "Star Bit Ex"]}, {"title": "New Phishing Strategy Becoming Common", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metamask/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@danfinlay", "publish_date": "2018-06-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "2.58", "claps": 5203, "voters": 418, "content": "New Phishing Strategy Becoming CommonDan FinlayFollowJun 13, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readEdited June 18, 2018 to reflect our latest understanding of Cloudflare\u2019s security, and mitigation strategies. Apologies if we misrepresented any security issues.MetaMask allows users to interact with Ethereum-compatible sites by putting users in control of their own account secrets, in the form of the 12 secret words the user is shown when first setting up.This is very powerful, but also potentially dangerous, because each user is responsible for the secrecy of their own seed words. If a hacker can trick you into sharing those words, they can steal everything in your accounts.Recently, a number of websites have shown this screen to users out of nowhere. The screen impersonates the MetaMask user interface in the top right of the window, asking the user to enter their wallet seed words.This form then sends the seed words up to a private server, and presumably the funds are drained from all of that user\u2019s accounts.If you have seen this screen, and entered your seed words into it, it may already be too late, your accounts may already be drained. Please contact MetaMask Support immediately.Affected SitesSites we know have been affected so far include:BTC ManagerGames WorkshopTrakt TV (unresolved at the time of this writing)If you\u2019re a user of any of those sites and MetaMask, and have noticed you recently lost some funds, please contact MetaMask Support immediately.The affected sites appear to all use Cloudflare to configure their DNS settings, and this appears to be where the attacker is redirecting the sites to their own imposter sites. Since this has affected multiple sites, if you are using Cloudflare, you should be extra vigilant. Some of the sites had 2FA for all of their users, but the settings were updated by API using their API keys.From what we can tell, Cloudflare has dangerously coarse API access permissions, and at least three common roles have permission to edit DNS settings. These permissions are often shared with plugins you add to your Cloudflare account. That would mean installing a plugin on Cloudflare can be like giving that plugin\u2019s author permission to redirect your site to whatever they\u2019d like.As a security conscious team, this is very concerning, and we would advise any web masters using cloudflare to rotate their API keys regularly, review who has DNS editing permissions (Admin, SuperAdmin, DNS), and minimize those permissions.What We\u2019re DoingMetaMask is taking a multi-pronged approach to this attack. The first prong is user education, via this post. MetaMask will never spontaneously ask you for your seed words, and is actually totally incapable of popping up in the top right without the user clicking the fox (as are all WebExtensions)! If you ever see this kind of popup on a site, contact us immediately!MetaMask is currently working with the affected groups to find other common factors, to help us narrow down on the attack vector that is allowing so many sites to become compromised, to help prevent this attack in the future.We are also working on improving our early-detection strategies, to narrow the window during which users can be affected by this attack.Since this attack relies on detecting MetaMask users by the web3 API, we will be making MetaMask users undetectable on unauthorized websites. You can read more on EIP 1102.We also have a couple of other efforts that we will report on if they are effective.If you have ideas for other strategies you\u2019d like to make sure we\u2019re pursuing, please get in touch, we\u2019d be happy to collaborate.

That looks like this:window.addEventListener('load', function() {  // Check if Web3 has been injected by the browser:  if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {    // You have a web3 browser! Continue below!    startApp(web3);  } else {     // Warn the user that they need to get a web3 browser     // Or install MetaMask, maybe with a nice graphic.  }})Copied loosely from the MetaMask Developer Guide.Here\u2019s a nice graphic you can use if they don\u2019t have web3 available.In this example, I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re using a JavaScript bundler like Browserify or Webpack, and know how to install modules off NPM.In your app setup, you\u2019re going to use a few different ethjs modules, and you\u2019ll initialize them with the global web3 object\u2019s currentProvider property, which is how it talks to the blockchain anyway.const Eth = require('ethjs-query')const EthContract = require('ethjs-contract')function startApp(web3) {  const eth = new Eth(web3.currentProvider)  const contract = new EthContract(eth)  initContract(contract)}Once you\u2019ve instantiated a contract instance, you can use it to create references to live contracts on the network. To do this, you need two things:The contract address.The contract ABI.The ABI is the Application Binary Interface, and it tells your JavaScript contract how to talk to the smart contract. It\u2019s just JSON data that describes the contract methods.Usually if you published a contract, you know how to get the ABI, and if you\u2019re connecting to someone else\u2019s contract, they should make the ABI available, although sometimes you can find ABIs matched to contracts on block explorers like Etherscan.Let\u2019s assume you have your ABI and address available, and see how we\u2019ll create a contract object now. In this example I\u2019ll use an ABI that includes only the transfer(to, value) method from the Token standard:const abi = [{    \"constant\": false,    \"inputs\": [      {        \"name\": \"_to\",        \"type\": \"address\"      },      {        \"name\": \"_value\",        \"type\": \"uint256\"      }    ],    \"name\": \"transfer\",    \"outputs\": [      {        \"name\": \"success\",        \"type\": \"bool\"      }    ],    \"payable\": false,    \"type\": \"function\"  }]const address = '0xdeadbeef123456789000000000000'function initContract (contract) {  const MiniToken = contract(abi)  const miniToken = MiniToken.at(address)  listenForClicks(miniToken)}Now we\u2019ve initialized a JavaScript interface for a smart contract, so we just need to create a little HTML<button class=\"transferFunds\">Send Money!</button>And a little JavaScript to respond to the click, and send those funds:function listenForClicks (miniToken) {  var button = document.querySelector('button.transferFunds')  button.addEventListener('click', function() {    miniToken.transfer(toAddress, value, { from: addr })    .then(function (txHash) {      console.log('Transaction sent')      console.dir(txHash)      waitForTxToBeMined(txHash)    })    .catch(console.error)  })}Note if this transaction were to send ether also, you\u2019d add value: '10000' to the options hash that includes the from field. The value is in the unit of wei, which is 1x10^-18 Ether. An easy way to convert is like this:var inWei = web3.toWei('10', 'ether')A strange part of this for a normal web developer is that the transaction response does not mean the transaction is now complete, it just means it\u2019s been transmitted to the network. It still needs to be mined, and in Ethereum, that takes around 14 seconds on average (block time, view stats on EthStats.net).Right now there aren\u2019t great subscription methods for waiting for a transaction to be mined, so you\u2019ll need to poll for it with that txHash you got back. Yes, it\u2019s tedious, so I\u2019ll show you how it can be a little less painful using the new JavaScript async/await pattern:async function waitForTxToBeMined (txHash) {  let txReceipt  while (!txReceipt) {    try {      txReceipt = await eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash)    } catch (err) {      return indicateFailure(err)    }  }  indicateSuccess()}That\u2019s it! (I know, it was a lot) I hope this was enough to show you how to interact with a smart contract over the Ethereum block chain. Once you\u2019re used to it, it\u2019s pretty great, because it\u2019s a sort of global API that has permissions baked in, so while you have to do a couple funny things like wait for transactions to be mined, you don\u2019t have to do obnoxious things like manage user accounts and passwords, or manage a backend server yourself!Please add any questions you have here, we made MetaMask to enable the easy creation of web interfaces for smart contracts, so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re here for.

For information on the latest, greatest, see Scaling Web3 with SignTypedData!Developer note: This article discusses a new method available to websites viewed with MetaMask and Mist browsers, called personal_sign. This is replacing eth_sign, and that old method now has a big red warning for your users because it was deprecated for security reasons. It\u2019s left in place only to keep sites running that rely on it.When people get excited about MetaMask, it\u2019s usually because it allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, which usually involves owning some network fuel called Ether, to run programs on a global shared virtual computer, and we think this is great.However, even without any Ether, MetaMask makes some new things possible for websites, because to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, MetaMask had to add private key management to the browser.When the modern browser was first created, it was seen as a linked document browser, and so identity and payments weren\u2019t baked in. This led to the world of password management that we have today, where each website holds a database that includes your account, and maybe credit card, and when you connect with them, you prove who you are with a password.MetaMask lets us reverse this relationship, and explore a web where the browser can secure your identity for you, in the form of a cryptographic key pair.Called a signature because like a pen signature, it can be used to identify who wrote it.One of the basic functions of a cryptographic key pair is signing data. When you sign some data, anyone can see that your signature could only be produced by the person who holds your private key. This is powerful, because it means you can compose a message and prove that you authored it (or at least had it at some point).One example use of this that normal sites could use today, would be for signing a terms of service agreement. The site could submit their terms of service using eth.personal_sign(fromAddress, hexEncodedUtf8Message), and the user will get a MetaMask message like this:MetaMask can now render plain text for signing, so sites can make their signature challenges human readable. We\u2019d like to offer more rich rendering options in the future, and this is discussed in EIP 185.Once the user signs it, the site could store that signature, and later on they could use it to prove that the user signed the message.This means a user doesn\u2019t need to hold any ether to perform a meaningful act with their MetaMask accounts. In the past, when a website would check the current accounts via web3.eth.accounts, the site only really knew that the user intended to appear as that account, but with a simple signature challenge, you can prove they really do control that account. From there, you could give them a browser cookie to stay logged in. That\u2019s account management without any external, third-party services like Facebook Connect or Google tracking your every move.We\u2019re excited to see what\u2019s possible in a web with accounts baked into the browser, and hope that someday account management like this is baked into every operating system, to enable a seamless, personal, distributed web.For DevelopersI\u2019ve created a sample repository for showing how to submit a message & verify it using MetaMask\u2019s injected APIs, mostly using our own utility lib eth-sig-utils. These methods are not yet supported by web3.js (pending this pull request), but that repo has examples for either using the raw provider object directly, or using a new web3 alternative, EthJS.Security NoticeThese methods, personal_sign and its partner, personal_ecRecover have replaced the previous signature methods, eth_sign and eth_recover. That\u2019s because the previous methods signed raw data unmodified, making it vulnerable to chosen ciphertext attacks, as well as potentially signing transactions you didn\u2019t intend to.

Since we had to choose one, we went with the original implementation, so our sign & recovery methods are currently bit-compatible with Geth, but not Parity.We\u2019re as frustrated as you about the lack of unified standards in the application layer of Ethereum, which is why we\u2019re also working towards building an EIP Standards Signaling DAO.

This is really the only way to do it right now if you are learning on your own. It will help to identify the easiest tools and tips in order to get your first dApp deployed on the testnet using Heroku.To start coding a new language, you want the easiest development environment that will help you through bugs so you can learn from your mistakes quickly as you go. Start by using the Remix Solidity IDE https://remix.ethereum.org.It is great for debugging, and gives you an option to step through the contract which is extremely helpful. I found it very useful to use the debugger throughout the whole development of my dApp, but at the start it was 100% necessary to help me write code that would actually compile.You should use remix until you get your dApp to compile with no bugs.There are three options with remix for injecting a blockchain instance into the browser, you can use the Javascript Virtual Machine (JVM), an injected web3 instance (like the chrome extension Metamask), or connecting to a web3 provider (like Infura). The JVM is the way to go when you are a beginner. It is much more forgiving, it ignores gas limits, it gives you an unlimited amount of ether to play with between 5 accounts, and it is much faster to debug with.Make sure the environment is JavaScript VM when starting with your first dApp.Start using Event Logs as much as possible to debug your code. They are the closest thing to console.log() from Javascript, as they can notify you of any changes to the state variables of your contract. In Remix they automatically show up in the user interface on the right side. When you want to see them from the front end of your dApp you will have to watch for the event with web3.js (explained later on in this post).Events are shown in the right side user interface of remix.Note that Remix is glitchy sometimes. If it isn\u2019t doing what you think it should be doing, open and close a new chrome window and it often helps. This is new software that is in active development, so bugs are expected.Note that sometimes the numbers in local or state storage while debugging will be extremely large. This might be due to accidental overflow for an integer calculation. However I have noticed that there is a bug in Remix . Sometimes while debugging it will show overflow, but in reality the contract still works and you get the correct results when executing functions in your dApp. So really pay attention when debugging to local and state storage, and if it is showing overflow and your contract still works perfectly, you are probably okay.Using the Solidity Locals and Solidity State variable viewer in the debugger of remix is extremely helpful to see if your functions are working properly.Keep in mind the first dApp you build will be slow when you are calling functions because you have to wait for blocks to be mined to get a response. This won\u2019t rear its ugly head while using the JVM, as everything happens instantaneously. As you move away from the JVM it will be more frustrating to debug, so do as much debugging as you can here.Moving onto a Better Development Environment with Truffle and testRPCIt is tempting to keep using Remix, but you should move on once you get to a point where your dApp compiles properly. Next you should use tools such as Truffle and testRPC that help simulate a real blockchain, so you can test your dApp in a more realistic situation.Truffle is a framework for developing and deploying Ethereum dApps. It is the best framework out there right now, and they are constantly upgrading and improving their product.testRPC is a simulated Ethereum blockchain you can run on your local machine that has been tweaked specifically for fast testing. You don\u2019t have to wait anytime between blocks to see how your dApp is responding, which is super helpful for testing and debugging. However it still gives you a real blockchain environment for testing that will fail for things like an out of gas limitation.Truffle lets you write tests for your dApp with Javascript (based on mocha\u2019s framework) and Solidity. Overall I have found that Javascript is better for integration tests, while Solidity is better for unit testing. However, I was unable to find good examples of Solidity testing online, and the documentation on it is not very in depth. Because of this I ended up doing the majority of my testing with Javascript because there is excellent documentation for mocha.It is sometimes tricky to test smart contracts, because there are situations where you want your contract to fail, like if only the owner is supposed to call a function, and if someone else tries to it should fail. The basic framework of truffle isn\u2019t fully adapted to easily test for this at the moment, but there is a good blog post on a workaround that helps with testing for failures.Sometimes testRPC can act weird in the terminal. If you don\u2019t end testRPC properly and you close your terminal window, it could still be running. Then the next time you try to run testRPC it won\u2019t allow you to start a new instance. This happened most frequently to me when I used MetaMask. For some reason you can\u2019t crtl+C out of testRPC when it is connect to MetaMask, so I started doing crtl+Z, and then I ran into these problems. I found resetting my computer cleans this up, and any other issues I came across with testRPC.Turning it into a Real Front End dApp with Truffle BoxesTruffle Boxes is a combination of the Truffle Framework and the React Framework. In order to use truffle boxes, you\u2019ll need a basic understanding of react to go forward.Build out the most basic version of your front end dApp to interact with your contract. It will end up being almost exactly like a normal React app, but you use web3 js (which comes included in Truffle) to interact with the blockchain. You will then have to inject a blockchain instance into your chrome browser so that you can interact with your testRPC on the testnet.MetaMask is the easiest way to interact with a blockchain in the browser. It is a chrome extension that allows you to inject the mainnet, the testnet, or a local instance (like testRPC) of a blockchain. It also allows you to use multiple accounts and send ether or testnet ether between them. Then the web3 code in your front end will interact with the blockchain injected from MetaMask, and you have connected your dApp to a real blockchain!Metamask Chrome Extension interface \u2014 unfortunately that is testnet ether, which is worthless :(.Note that in a developement environemnt with metamask, you should never store real ether alongside your testnet ether, just in case you make a mistake, and send real ether while testing.You can get test net ether for the rinkeby test net here: https://faucet.rinkeby.io/.Always send transactions with a high gas cost in GWEI on the testnet. You might be inclined to keep it low because you are used to doing so for mainnet transactions. I\u2019ve have long waiting times and bugs that have cost me an hour or two of time because I simply set way too small of a gas price on a large contract deployment, and then it failed on the test net, but MetaMask thought it succeeded. Then I couldn\u2019t do anything because MetaMasks nonce count was incorrect. Testnet ether is worthless so you might as well send a lot to beat everyone else in the line!Use the mnemonic flag in testRPC to repeatedly get the same accounts generated whenever you start a new testRPC instance. I use the following command in my terminal:The mnemonic flag generates ethereum accounts based on a string you pass it upon starting testRPC. If I always provide \u201chello\u201d, I will always get the same accounts. This makes it easier to hardcode in accounts while running tests. The accounts flag is used to generate 50 addresses, also good for testing.Accounts[0] (from truffle and web3) will be the account that MetaMask had opened up when the dApp is loaded in the browser. Sometimes MetaMask is finicky, and if you switch back and forth between accounts the dApp\u2019s web3 and Metamasks accounts won\u2019t be talking to each other correctly. Just refresh the page.MetaMask will sometimes let you know a call from your front end dApp to the blockchain is going to fail by maxing out the gas you are sending with the transaction, and sending 0 ether instead of the amount the dApp is asking for. It doesn\u2019t explicitly say why it will fail, but it will, and it will use up all the testnet gas. This happens most often when an account tries to call a function that it does not have access to, and it will just revert and burn the gas.Deployment with HerokuHeroku is perfect for deploying your dApp because it is super easy to do, and your dApp doesn\u2019t have a backend which makes Heroku\u2019s simple setup very attractive. This article will help with deploying a dApp on Heroku (you will have to let chrome translate the page to English) https://medium.com/taipei-ethereum-meetup/ethereum-dapp-tutorial-push-button-cae3810086a4.My first version of my first dApp deployed to Heroku was very basic, but it doesn\u2019t have to be pretty as long as the smart contract does what it is supposed to do! You can see it here: https://heroku-patreon.herokuapp.com/ (code is located here).The first version of the first dApp I deployed with heroku.When you deploy the front end to Heroku, you will have to deploy your contract to the testnet as well. Deploy the contract first, then once it is deployed you can get the address of the contract from etherscan, and hardcode it into your front end so that your dApp is interacting with the correct contract on the testnet. There are a few ways to deploy a contract to the testnet:You can deploy the contract using remix by injecting a web3 instance with MetaMask (make sure you change the environment from JavaScript VM to web3 instance, and that you pick the correct testnet to deploy to).You can deploy with myetherwallet here: https://www.myetherwallet.com/#contractsYou can deploy with truffle as well, and there are good instructions to do so in their documentation.I found using remix to be the easiest way to deploy a simple dApp.General TipsKeep your first few contracts simple.Always update your dev tools (Truffle, testRPC, MetaMask) as much as possible. This is a new field and new versions of the software come out weekly.Be weary of looking at old Solidity code and copying it directly into yours. Solidity is updated often and some of their functions have been deprecated.Read the Solidity documentation.Learn to deal with ether in wei from the beginning, because all numbers should be passed around in wei on the EVM and the front end. Otherwise you will have to retroactively go back and fix your code, which is frustrating.The first time you come across a Big Number while coding go read the documentation here. It will help immensely when you start passing numbers between your front end and the blockchain.Consistenly check back with the web3 documentation and the truffle documenation. They both have a lot of helpful functions that make building dApps easier. There were multiple times when I tried to do something on my own, only to realize that truffle or web3 already has a function that does what I needed.Things to look into for your second dAppOnce you get the hang of actually creating a dApp that works, start to look more into the security of writing good smart contract code. Learn about common pitfalls and bugs and how to prevent them. A great place to start is ConSensys\u2019s smart contract best practices.You can watch for Event Logs from the blockchain with the front end by using using web3 (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#contract-events). Watching for Event Logs from the front end allows you to automatically update the front end when something is changed on the blockchain.Once you get the hang of smart contracts you can start to look at ways to reduce the gas cost of the deployment of your contract, and lowering gas cost for storage of state variables. When you are working on your first dApp there is no need to worry about this as it will just confuse you more.ConclusionGood luck deploying your first dApp!

Do not use this method for production applications that you\u2019re not able to update should the API change in the future!There are a wide array of ways that Ethereum plans to scale, and it\u2019s a favorite topic of blockchain fans, because the scalability of the blockchain is a hard technical limit on how useful it can become.One of the easiest ways you can start scaling your application on Ethereum today, without waiting for any other technology to be available, is to construct mechanisms that allow users to sign state changes that aren\u2019t always submitted to the blockchain, but can be if needed, like a state channel. To make a working state channel today, there\u2019s no easier option than to take advantage of MetaMask\u2019s new signTypedData method.Originally proposed in EIP 712 by Leonid Logvinov of 0x, and then implemented for MetaMask by Sergey Ukustov of Machimony. This new method makes it easier than ever to create applications involving user signatures that:Represent structured data.Are human readable.Cannot impersonate Ethereum transactions.Are cheap to compute on-chain.In this article, you\u2019ll learn to show the MetaMask user something like this:Structured data user prompts that are cheap to compute on-chain? No way!The API is simple, and will be even simpler once it has been deployed in new versions of EthJS and Web3.js. In the meanwhile, using it exposes you to the lowest-level API that MetaMask gives you: The Ethereum Provider.You can find this code live online on github here.// A JS library for recovering signatures:const sigUtil = require('eth-sig-util')const msgParams = [  {    type: 'string',      // Any valid solidity type    name: 'Message',     // Any string label you want    value: 'Hi, Alice!'  // The value to sign }, {      type: 'uint32',      name: 'A number',      value: '1337'  }]   // Get the current account:web3.eth.getAccounts(function (err, accounts) {  if (!accounts) return  signMsg(msgParams, accounts[0])})function signMsg(msgParams, from) {  web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({    method: 'eth_signTypedData',    params: [msgParams, from],    from: from,  }, function (err, result) {    if (err) return console.error(err)    if (result.error) {      return console.error(result.error.message)    }    const recovered = sigUtil.recoverTypedSignature({      data: msgParams,      sig: result.result     })    if (recovered === from ) {      alert('Recovered signer: ' + from)    } else {      alert('Failed to verify signer, got: ' + result)    }  })}As you can see, in this we:Imported the signature recovery library eth-sig-util.Assembled parameters for the method.Retrieved the current user\u2019s address from the web3 API.Asked the user to sign those parameters.Using the parameters and the signature, we were able to verify this signature came from their address (and only their address!).Not only can you verify this data with JavaScript, you can also verify it in Solidity. Here is an example of verifying one of these signatures in Solidity. This can be useful for writing code for closing a state channel.I hope this has been useful to you, let us know if you have any questions, and if you create any sample examples you\u2019d like to share!", "responses": 7, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "Cryptography"]}, {"title": "How to create a cryptocurrency token for free in under 10 minutes", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@business.wmacintosh/how-to-create-a-cryptocurrency-token-for-free-in-under-10-minutes-e8a05d7e31dd?source=search_post", "author_name": "William Macintosh", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@business.wmacintosh", "publish_date": "2019-03-18", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-19", "readtime": "7.31", "claps": 481, "voters": 111, "content": "How to create a cryptocurrency token for free in under 10 minutesWilliam MacintoshFollowMar 18 \u00b7 8 min readExample token that I madeThis is a guide for creating your own cryptocurrency token on any OS.

First of all, make sure you are on the Ropsten test network. Below shows how to switch from Ethereum to Ropsten.Make sure all your settings match up with this under the RUN tab:Switch to the COMPILER tab and then switch to the 0.4.24 commit version of the complier. DO NOT USE THE NIGHTLY VERSION. Also make sure Auto compile is on and Enable Optimization is off.Now, switch back to the RUN tab and select TOKEN.Then press Deploy and you should be almost done! A pop-up will come up asking if you want to confirm the action, press confirm. Don\u2019t worry if it says 0 ethereum being transferred, that is intentional.Next you will need to press on the MetaMask icon in your extensions tab and press on Contract Deployment. Then press on View On Etherscan.Then copy the contract ID highlighted below.Press the COPY TO CLIPBOARD button.Go back to MetaMask and press menu, then Add Token.Add all the data for your token. The contract address is the ID that you just copied.And you\u2019re done! You now have the full amount of token accredited to your account. It is now able to be sent to anyone else using MetaMask and some other wallets.Step 4 (Optional)As a final step, you can put the token on the main Ethereum network, making it an official token. The downside to this is that you have to pay around 30 USD to do it. All you need to do is repeat step 3 but be on the Main Ethereum Network instead of the Ropsten Network.ConclusionThis was a tutorial on how to make a cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum Network. If you have any errors, comment them and I will try to help debug. Just to be clear, this is not a Cryptocurrency. To actually make a crypto, you have to have a blockchain and that is a lot harder to make.

Recently, we noticed several privacy and security issues for in-browser wallets which can expose personal information and trick users into sending false transactions.This weekend, I posted a tweet about this which gained some momentum on Twitter and Reddit. Dan Finlay, a Metamask core developer, agreed with my analysis and security precautions.Bloom is committed to working alongside the various open-source projects we build upon, and boosting the overall knowledge and security of the Ethereum ecosystem is good for everyone. I\u2019ve converted my thoughts around this topic into the post below.In-browser Ethereum Wallets Reveal More Than You May ThinkIf you are using an in-browser Ethereum wallet (Metamask or Parity) then any website can detect if you are an Ethereum user.I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some advertisers are already collecting this information. The information is rather easy to collect and has significant use in terms of targeting cryptocurrency holders.How does this happen? Metamask and Parity inject a global web3 object into the page. For example, the screenshots below show Metamask and Parity both injecting web3 into Twitter:Parity even exposes the current account address by defaultPractically Speaking, What is the Risk?Don\u2019t worry, these websites can\u2019t send transactions on your behalf of course (not without popping up a confirmation window) but do you really want any website owner or advertiser to know that you hold crypto?Do you want them to know how much ETH you own?This fact, in the wrong hands, could be a risk. It could increase the volume of ads you see or make your device a target to malicious actors.Does MetaMask Expose your Wallet?Even though Metamask is locked by default (meaning public addresses aren\u2019t exposed) it is trivial to listen for a wallet unlock.When you unlock your Metamask wallet, it unlocks it across all tabs. The gif below is an example app that alerts when it detects a wallet unlock.Detecting an unlock from an unfocused tab is especially sketchy in my opinion. This means any app can detect when you are in the middle of using your Ethereum wallet.If the user just unlocked their wallet for another tab then they are probably about to send a transaction. The attacker can detect the unlock, wait 30 seconds, then pop up their own transaction.The gif below is an example attack where the user is in the middle of using an exchange:In my opinion, a lot of other small attack opportunities exist as long as web3 is injected into every page. You can tell if someone is specifically a Metamask user by checking web3.currentProvider.isMetamask.Why not pop up your own Metamask lookalike in the top right?Regardless of whether the wallet is currently locked, you can use the current network id on web3 to see if the user was last using the testnet or mainnet. If they\u2019re on anything besides mainnet, they are probably a developer and likely have higher than average crypto holdings.To give Metamask credit: They do have several issues on Github open discussing issues around globally available web3 instance:Security audit and team discussion (issue #799)Configuration should be per-domain (issue #12)Inject Metamask on a per-page basis (issue #537)Be signed out per domain until signing in (issue #714)So What is The Solution?In my opinion, the best immediate stopgap these extensions should add is something similar to other browser permissions like how we grant access to location information.I think the Metamask team is looking into doing this long term: https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/813 \u2026Potential short term solution:Hardcode that only http://metamask.io/whitelist can call invoke some whitelist functionality in the Metamask extensiondApps should open a popup to http://metamask.io/whitelist?url=example.com. This would be similar to some oAuth user flows.Extension asks if you want to give http://example.com access to your wallet.From then on, web3 is injected automatically on that domainRestricting this functionality to their domain means that nothing has to be injected into every page. The popup means any page can really easily initiate the whitelist process without having to write browser vendor specific extension interactions.Short term solution would then be to add whitelisting as an opt-in feature (so you don\u2019t break existing integrations and make people regret writing their app to depend on Metamask).Security conscious users can opt-in right away and app developers can plan for deprecation.Can you protect yourself?In the meantime, I\u2019d recommend users disable Metamask by default in their browser and then enable it when they want to use it.Unlike unlocking a wallet, I wasn\u2019t able to detect (from an already open and unfocused tab) when a disabled extension was enabled.Some UI improvements would also help the transaction spoofing example I gave. The browser should switch to the tab that created the transaction. The confirmation window should probably have a brightly colored banner that says \u201chttp://example.com created this transaction.\u201dMetamask and other browser wallets are in a tough position though with these transaction popups. If a legitimate dApp could put a custom message in the confirmation window then an attacker could mimic it.Some Final Thoughts:I also want to clarify that I\u2019m not saying that people should never use these in-browser wallets. Security is especially tough and nuanced when you are a platform for handling money and user identity. Even harder when you are on the development side of early adoption.In addition, I\u2019d love to see is the ability to use an ENS address as the recipient field in a transaction. For @BloomToken, users are currently interacting with one of two contracts. If our end users saw our ENS address for every transaction then they\u2019d be less likely to fall for a spoof.In-browser wallets should be unlocked per domain. An advertiser shouldn\u2019t be able to log my ETH address in an unfocused tab just because I want to check on my crypto kitties.I\u2019d also love to see at least an opt-in setting that locks my wallet again after sending a transaction. If a dApp wants to send multiple transactions without unlocking between each, they can use `web3.createBatch`. Metamask handles this well already.An attack that sent ERC20 tokens would be effective. Unlike moving ETH (where Metamask would say how much ETH you are sending), a token transaction would just display the gas price. This might be more likely to trick people if they can\u2019t tell what is being sent.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Security", "Metamask", "Developers"]}, {"title": "What to Expect When Participating in a Token Launch", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/what-to-expect-when-participating-in-a-token-launch-649e35343e85?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@danfinlay", "publish_date": "2017-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-28", "readtime": "7.29", "claps": 453, "voters": 75, "content": "What to Expect When Participating in a Token LaunchDan FinlayFollowNov 10, 2017 \u00b7 8 min readThe Metamask team\u2019s official guide to best practices when contributing \u2014 for experts and novices alike!If you\u2019re participating in a token launch for the first time, or even if you\u2019ve done it all before, the process of safely and securely taking part in such an event requires research, preparation, and vigilance.Token sales have proven to be a powerful new way of raising funds, but the current infrastructure and climate surrounding the phenomenon presents many risks. As a contributor, you want to purchase tokens for a project you believe in, but you also want to make sure you don\u2019t get phished, scammed, send your currency into the abyss, or any of the unfortunate situations that people sometimes face in the process of contributing to token sales.At MetaMask, we work with users every day who are struggling when trying to participate in token launches. Token sale contributors should always approach their engagement with caution. We\u2019ve created this guide to participating in token launches to empower our community with best practices, and answer some of the most common questions that come up in the token launch process.First Things First: Inform YourselfWhen you initially learn about a token launch you\u2019d like to participate in, gather all the information you can. Not every token launch is structured in the same way. Some are not available in all countries. Some require registration beforehand. And some spread their token sales over several days, or even weeks.Make sure you do a few things before the token launch begins:Research, research, researchEvery single person who engages with the decentralized web should consider themselves responsible for educating themselves on the technology and doing due diligence research on any project before considering contributing. Read the whitepaper, the source code, check out the track record of the team, and understand what your contribution entitles you to. There are a lot of dubious projects in the Ethersphere, and security and safety should remain at the forefront of every participant\u2019s mind.Understand the value proposition of the projectAvoiding getting phished or hacked is one thing; but you also need to make sure you don\u2019t willingly put money into a project that is not built on solid business or tech fundamentals. Beyond total dud or scam projects, you want to make sure you aren\u2019t just buying tokens for the sake of buying tokens; is this a project that you believe has a real future? Do you have a reason to purchase these tokens? Will you participate in this ecosystem? Will they be valuable to you? The answer to all of these should be a resounding \u201cYes.\u201dKnow the prerequisites you need in order to be a valid investorMake sure you can actually participate in this token launch. Do you need to live in a certain country? Register ahead of time? Many token launches will restrict U.S. buyers from participating, and now the Chinese government has banned token launches entirely. It\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re operating within the law and within the rules of the token sale.Find out how you will pay for the token, and how tokens will be distributedWhat is the mechanism of the token launch? Some are straight sales, some are more exotic, like reverse dutch auctions, and some take other forms. On the day of the sale, what needs to happen for the token to change hands?Watch out for Red FlagsThe Ethereum space is exciting and full of opportunities, but there are scammers and phishers of all sorts looking to take advantage of people\u2019s trust. It\u2019s essential that you protect yourself while participating in token launches.When trying to give your money to someone, make sure it\u2019s who you intend.A few best practices to staying safe:Never share your private keyNever paste your private key anywhere beyond your primary wallet application like Metamask or MyEtherWallet. If you\u2019re using a web-based wallet, keep it bookmarked, and only ever manage it through your bookmark. Phishers can look just like legitimate support staff, but commonly direct people to fake sites to steal their secrets.Treat your private key like your confidential identity information (like your SSN). It gives total control over your account and its funds \u2014 if someone is asking for it, there is likely something phishy happening. If someone claims they will give you benefits in exchange for your private key \u2014 it\u2019s a scam! Keep an extra eye out for websites that have similar URLs to your trusted platforms, but have a minor difference that may lead you to a scam site built to imitate the site you\u2019re expecting.Always do a deep read of the whitepaper, check out the source codeA legitimate Ethereum project will have a complete, detailed white paper explaining the value proposition of the project and the utility of their token in its ecosystem. You should read this when you\u2019re doing your due diligence. If there isn\u2019t a white paper, it\u2019s likely that the token is a scam. Even if there is a white paper, it doesn\u2019t mean the project is legitimate; make sure you read the white paper and evaluate if it provides details that back up the claims in the website and marketing. Keep an eye out for the project\u2019s tech development on Github, to make sure it\u2019s more than just a catchy name and a shiny website. Even if you can\u2019t read code, a healthy developer presence on Github and elsewhere is a sign of a more legitimate project.Listen to the communityThe Ethereum community usually forms a solid opinion of a token launch before it happens. Check on r/ethereum, r/ethtrader, r/cryptocurrency, and the Ethereum Gitter Channel to see what people are saying about the launch. Find some informed voices from the community whose integrity and knowledge you trust, and follow them on social media.Before the Launch: Be PreparedParticipating in a popular token launch is sort of like buying concert tickets that you think might sell out fast: you don\u2019t want to forget your Ticketmaster login or have to update your credit card info at the last second. But with token launches, there is the added threat of phishing, so it\u2019s even more important to make sure you know the details ahead of time.Before the launch:Set up your accounts ahead of time.Find out what you need to use to interact with the token sale, whether it\u2019s MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, or another kind of wallet or browser. Set up your account before the token sale so that you\u2019re ready to go.Back up your accountMake sure you back up your seed phrase for MetaMask or any other account backups for other types of wallets. Double check that it\u2019s going to the right address for your account. Write it down; your hard drive could always crash. You can\u2019t be too safe when you\u2019re backing up your account!Get the addressProjects will usually release the address of the token sale ahead of time; make sure you get it beforehand from a reliable source, and compare that to the address on the day of the sale. Sometimes, phishers will give you the wrong address, so read and re-read it! In one case phishers were even able to gain control of a project\u2019s website and post the wrong address there. Another way to check that the address is correct is to use a block explorer like EtherScan to review the contract\u2019s source code and make sure it does what you expect.What to Expect on Launch DayThere are some precautions you should take to stay safe and increase your chances of obtaining your tokens when the launch commences and you begin your participation.When submitting your transaction:Triple-check the addressIt\u2019s easy to input the wrong address when you\u2019re sending your ETH; and as we\u2019ve mentioned, there are phishers out there who will try to bamboozle you with the wrong address. Check the address you\u2019ve input against the address you got from the project before the token launch, and again against their website. Make sure you\u2019re on the correct, legitimate site when you do so. Be careful with projects that only release the address when the sale opens, because you have no way to verify that it is correct.Up the gas price by a few GWeiWhen you\u2019re submitting a transaction on Ethereum, the suggested gas price is usually sufficient; but during a high-traffic period during which there is a backlog of transactions, you can skip to the front of the line if you offer a higher gas price. This may increase your chances of processing a time-sensitive transaction. You can see if the blockchain has a backlog on the Etherscan pending transaction page, and you can see a lot of stats about current gas prices on EthGasStation. You can read more about gas and how it works in this article.Be patientYour transactions could take a few seconds to a few hours, and in some cases even a few days to process. This just depends on the current transaction backlog. A big token launch with a limited time opportunity can create a huge backlog, that has sometimes lasted days. You can always check on EtherScan to see how your transaction is doing. If it\u2019s been more than 24 hours, it\u2019s likely the transaction has failed, but you should definitely check to see.Know that you may not get any tokensWhen you\u2019re participating in a token sale, especially a popular one, you aren\u2019t guaranteed to get a token. Even if you\u2019re one of the first people to submit, and you\u2019ve done everything right, sometimes the transactions are simply processed in an order unfavorable to you. This isn\u2019t something that MetaMask or any other wallet provider can control. Only miners have control over the order that transactions are processed. Don\u2019t worry, if that is the case, your ETH will be returned to your wallet, minus the transaction fee (presuming the sale itself was secure and valid).After the SaleYou now have some tokens, whatever that means!Congratulations, you\u2019ve purchased some tokens! After the sale takes place, and assuming you\u2019ve successfully purchased a token in a legitimate sale:You can view your token balances in MetaMask in the Token tab (see this guide for details).You can send tokens from your MetaMask accounts using the token send page from MyEtherWallet.com following this guide.How We Can HelpAt MetaMask, we do everything we can to ensure our users safety and security Unfortunately, if your Ether is depleted from your wallet, we can\u2019t reverse those transactions.However, there are many things we can help you with.

Once you\u2019ve participated in a token sale, you will get tokens (allocate tokens) to your ethereum wallet with which you participate. Here in this article, I will explain with 0xProject token as an example. This can be any other ICO as far as the tokens issued are ERC20 standard like ZRX or KickICO or any other token.So if you have participated in token sale of 0xproject, you would have got your ZRX tokens to Metamask, which can also be checked on MyEtherWallet aka MEW. So the question could also be \u201chow to transfer these ERC20 tokens from MEW to Poloniex\u201d (Taking Poloniex as example as it\u2019s one of prominent exchanges listing ZRX at the time of writing).Step by Step guideLogin to PoloniexGo to Balances -> Deposits & WithdrawalsInterestingly, finding ZRX is easy here too when you sort it by name as it starts with 0. Once you see ZRX as shown below, you need to get the Deposit Address.Click on Deposit button in the last column of table against ZRX token (row). You should be able to see an Ethereum like address, which you need to copy to clipboard (Ctrl+C or Command+C).Now go to https://www.myetherwallet.com and unlock your account using private key stored. This opens up the wallet through which you\u2019ve purchased ZRX tokens. Once it is unlocked, go to the bottom right corner of the screen, where you will see buttons \u201cLoad Token Balances\u201d, \u201cShow Tokens\u201d.Click on Load Token Balancesand once it is done, click on Show Tokens which will list all possible ERC20 tokens compatible with MyEtherWallet. Fortunately, ZRX starts with Z and will be easily available at the end when you scroll all the way down.You can now see the Balance of your ZRX here.Once you have your address, come back to MEW(MyEtherWallet). Since you have got the Token Balances, now you will have a dropdown beside Amount to Send which shows all possible Tokens you have balance for. Eg: ETH and ZRX as shown below. Select ZRX and continue to next stepYou can either enter the amount of ZRX tokens to be sent to exchange or use Send Entire Balance quick link to populate with your ZRX balance.Then, paste(Ctrl+V or Command+V) the deposit address which you\u2019ve copied from Poloniex. Be very careful and double, triple check the address matches with your poloniex address \u2014 If you copy a wrong one or miss something, your tokens will be lost forever.Once address is pasted, amount to send is populated and ZRX is selected from dropdown. Gas value will automatically change to around 52000 and then click on Generate Transaction and then click on Send Transaction and that\u2019s it \u2014 it gives you \u201cVerify Transaction\u201d button at the bottom or you can search etherscan.io using your poloniex address.PANIC MOMENTAt least for me, being the very first time of transferring ERC tokens from MEW to Poloniex/Exchange, it was a panic moment to see them being shifted across multiple addressesMy tokens were transferred from my MEW address to Address shown on PoloniexThen after 6 minutes, they were transferred from there to some other address (possibly poloniex\u2019s pool) Check this link https://etherscan.io/token/ZRX?a=0xead6be34ce315940264519f250d8160f369fa5cdFrom there, they were transferred to another address in another few minutes, which is when you will see a pending transaction on Poloniex in Mainmenu->Balances->HistoryFortunately, folks at 0xproject slack were helpful and Amir Bandeali suggested that above address could be of Poloniex pool and it turned out to be that, which helped me keep my calm as I wait to see it pending on Poloniex.This 15 minute process of panic made me write this article to help others.Follow me on Twitter for updates regarding Cryptocurrency & Blockchain.If you found this article useful, feel free to leave at a tip of any amount at these addresses:BTC:

We have released a Demo-version of our product, the Proof-of-Asset Protocol, which provides new sources of capital for real assets on a crypto-centric FinTech platform. We have created a demo-version, and it signifies a solution for business.Here is an explanatory video:The best example is a simple example. So imagine that you own two cars. Your biggest wish today is to earn an income off them, but just the thought of all procedures associated with it sends shivers down your spine. So our Proof-of-Asset protocol allows you to tokenize your two cars this evening, and by tomorrow morning you\u2019ll have your money. You protect your token investments with secured assets.Imagine the limitless possibilities that the Proof-of-Asset Protocol can open for your business: access to capital made faster and easier. Take a look at instructions for our app.It is an important step as we managed to implement all the steps of our Proof-of-asset protocol there. This BANKEX demo allows you to create a smart asset using Ropsten test blockchain.In order to use the demo you will have to install the MetaMask plugin first.You can use this guide for it: https://blog.bankex.org/how-to-buy-ethereum-using-metamask-ccea0703daecAfter you log in using MetaMask, you can choose the type of smart asset that you would like to create. Currently there are 3 types available: car token, real estate token and Apple device token.A detailed instruction on how to create a smart asset can be found here: https://blog.bankex.org/creating-a-smart-asset-using-metamask-plugin-30a06bc75ea2After you choose a smart asset type, you are redirected to the form where you will need to include the initial info. Say you selected car token, and are taken to the form as the first step of asset creation. Here you will need to include all information on the car you intend to tokenize, as well as your contact information. For the purpose of this demo, you don\u2019t have to input actual authentic data. The smart asset can be created even leaving the form blank. In which case you will have created a smart asset with blank data. This demo\u2019s primary value is to serve as a demonstration of the asset creation scenario, so we included no strict restrictions for data input. The form includes the option of including a KYC-provider, followed by information on the car (color, mileage, release year, VIN number).After you fill in all the information, it is recorded in blockchain. At this stage you will need MetaMask to pay for the transaction. Ropsten Ether can be obtained if you have a GitHub account. As this is a challenging limitations to some, we have an alternative solution. Users will be able to receive small amounts of Ropsten test Ether from us (the transaction requires a fairly small amount).Having created a smart asset of a certain type, you will then move on to a page with its detailed description. You will see several QR-codes here, containing the smart contract address, the address of the asset itself and the address of the transaction. The QR-code of the asset will be required if you would like to attach additional data to the asset using our mobile app. In this version, the mobile app imitates Internet of Things sensors.The mobile app is completely optional \u2014 the smart asset is created regardless of whether or not IoT data is included. However, IoT data is used to obtain more accurate information on the asset and, as a result, to increase the accuracy of the asset\u2019s evaluation. Scanning the QR-code of the asset using the mobile app, you give it the asset number \u2014 this allows the app to identify the asset that it needs to attach the IoT data to.Imagine you sent in data via the app. Returning to the smart asset page, you will be able to press the button reading \u201cCollect Sensor Data\u201d.This will allow you to pull the data sent by the app from the server into your asset. All IoT data is recorded on the blockchain.The value of the asset increases together with its validation. IoT helps us prove the authenticity of the information provided. The data from IoT includes geolocation data, photos and other sensor data. The next step would be the evaluation of the asset, and release of the corresponding token to the market. Also included is the option to share your smart asset via social media.NB!

We\u2019re a chrome extension crypto wallet and account manager with about a million active installs.I\u2019m writing to raise a concern with Chromium Issue 896897, Implement Manifest v3 for Chromium extensions. I commented there, but I am re-publishing here for the sake of more easily linking to our specific concerns (especially since there are so many concerns being expressed regarding those changes).We would like the v3 manifest format to not be pushed to production in its current form until support for the FrozenRealms specification has been included, or at least iFrame API support is kept in the background script context, allowing extensions to run foreign scripts in an isolated environment.Most of the WebExtensions representing this perspective are plugin systems like GreaseMonkey, which increase security by limiting its extensions\u2019 access to the DOM. In addition to plugin systems, I\u2019d like to share another security concern related to these changes.We have been working on using Agoric\u2019s SES (Secure EcmaScript) to better isolate our dependencies, to reduce the risk of dependency-based thefts like the CoPay Dash event-stream hack, as suggested by Zooko Wilcox. SES was derived from Google\u2019s own Caja project.Currently Agoric\u2019s SES relies on a polyfill of the Realms API that relies on the iFrame API, which is not available in ServiceWorkers at this time, which the proposed manifest v3 currently requires all background scripts to be.All we really need is the FrozenRealms API, since it\u2019s the simplest way to truly isolate foreign code in a secure way, but keeping iFrame support would at least let us continue using the SES Realms polyfill.Our background script must handle user keys which manage cryptocurrency accounts, often the most security sensitive bits of data on the user\u2019s entire computer, so it should be understandable that we care very much about the security available to the background script in particular.Thanks for your time,\u2014Dan Finlay and Aaron Davis,MetaMask", "responses": 2, "tags": ["JavaScript", "Metamask", "Chrome Extension", "Chrome", "Security"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/aave/breaking-news-over-300-eth-borrowed-on-ethlend-decentralized-lending-application-under-two-weeks-a13de3db1c67?source=search_post", "author_name": "Aavesome", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Aave", "publish_date": "2017-12-28", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-15", "readtime": "1.63", "claps": 99, "voters": 26, "content": "AavesomeFollowDec 28, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readBREAKING NEWS: Over 300 ETH Borrowed on ETHLend Decentralized Lending Application under two Weeks!Since the Alpha 0.2 release on 15 December 2017, ETHLend is proud and humble to announce that over 300 worth of Ethereum has been borrowed through our decentralized application!Borrowers have used variety of different collaterals ranging from the pre-defined list the DAPP provides. There have been currently over 120 loans and the most popular collateral is ETHLend\u2019s native LEND token.The USD-pegged Ethereum loans consists of around 12% of the total loan book, and rest of the loans being pure Ethereum. Most loans are up to 30 days and fewer loans are above 30 days. The biggest loan is around 20 000 USD worth of Ethereum and other bigger loans have varied from 10\u201317 ETH. Due to gas costs on Ethereum, under 0.5 ETH loans are less efficient and we consider loans below 0.5 ETH more or less as testing purposes.Lending volume provides cash flow. Upon each loan request, ETHLend collects 0.01 ETH fee from the borrower and 0.01 ETH fee from the lender when funding a loan. Therefore, even such early stage as Alpha, ETHLend is creating turnover for the project. Despite the fact that the volumes are recently accumulated and the fee structure will be change to more efficient by lowering the threshold for borrowing and making more return on bigger loans, such fee collecting is a proof-of-concept that ETHLend could grow into a fully established FinTech house soon.The unexpected success is a great milestone not solely for ETHLend team, moreover for the whole community of decentralized applications. Developing decentralized applications is surely not the easiest path, however in the long run provides a market that is determined by the lenders and borrowers instead of banks and financial institutions.Do you have a token portfolio and need to unlock some of that liquidity you have lying around in your tokens?Place a loan request by installing metamask (from https://metamask.io) and browsing to the decentralized application at https://app.ethlend.io.

We reported the issue to npm, and were told it had been recorded, but were not offered any estimate on timeframe for a fix.Our team members used these audit results to begin isolating the dependencies that were racking up the audit flags the most.@whymarrh, @danjm, and @dryajov all contributed to this analysis.This resulted in a pull request that was able to once again get the project passing an npm audit, with very few detected npm audit vulnerabilities remaining, discussed below.We have also created a new bug bounty for anyone who can find a malicious dependency in the MetaMask codebase.How this audit went un-noticedIn the past, we had required this automated npm audit to complete for our test suite to pass, which is required for every pull request to be merged.This enforced requirement was highly non-deterministic, and had gradually failed more and more often, until it was blocking an urgent bug fix. At that point, we disabled the requirement for npm audit in our test suite.In retrospect, that would have been the time to open an issue and begin implementing an alternative automated audit process that would be more fit to our needs, but this need was not done.Analysis of those numbersA majority of the counted vulnerabilities (3079) were a single module being repeatedly counted by npm audit: lodash prior to 4.17.5, which was vulnerable to a prototype pollution attack, which is itself only vulnerable to other malicious dependencies. (Many of the counted vulnerabilities and dependencies were also repeatedly counting the same modules)Many of these dependencies were part of our build system or local development environment, as the npm audit command also counts \u201cdeveloper dependencies\u201d, which are never shipped to production, and also often not used in our build system. (For example, our testing tools)There also appeared to be some kind of dependency-counting loop triggered where we incorrectly listed one dependency, gaba (a module we maintain ourselves) as a devDependency.Analysis of remaining detected vulnerabilitiesAfter we upgraded the modules we could to eliminate these warnings, The remaining detected vulnerable modules are:=== npm audit security

11 vulnerabilities (8 low, 3 high) in 255418 scanned packages  run `npm audit fix` to fix 3 of them.  8 vulnerabilities require manual review. See the full report for details.Their context in MetaMask:ganache-core: Used in our test suite (vulnerability can only affect a machine running our tests).fstream: Used inside web3.js, is only vulnerable when used in a node.js environment, which MetaMask never is.tar: Used inside ganache-core, is only vulnerable when decompressing a file, which MetaMask never does. Also only used in our test suite.web3: Insecure when used to store credentials, which we do not do.braces: Is prone to a Denial of Service when fed untrusted input, but is only used in our build system.A couple other notable flagged modules that are in our devDependencies but do not compromise the core product are:Arbitrary File Overwrite (https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/803 and https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/886) for some of our development dependenciesGABA has Code Injection (https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/813), DoS (https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/788), Prototype Pollution (https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/755) and Regular Expression Denial of Service (https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/786) all in dev depsThe Bigger ProblemUltimately, supply chain attacks are an constant and fundamental threat to any project\u2019s security, and we know that as a wallet, we are a target of constantly increasing value, so we can\u2019t take security seriously enough.We saw a JavaScript bitcoin wallet get hacked last year by a single vulnerable dependency, and it happened again just last week. We have been thinking about these kinds of attacks seriously, because we\u2019re absolutely a prime target for the same thing.There were many answers thrown around in the wake of the event-stream hack, and lots of people (even in the twitter thread that inspired this incident) are quick to simply blame JavaScript, and the node ecosystem for encouraging easy or excessive use of dependencies.While it\u2019s true that we need to be incredibly careful with our dependencies, and be responsible for as much of our code as possible, we believe there is a better answer to this long term, and it is better dependency isolation. If we are able to tightly regulate the access that any given dependency has to application permissions, we can limit its possible damage.Fortunately, the work at Agoric has demonstrated that JavaScript is nearly an object-capability language, which means (in part) it is very close to enabling the isolation of dependencies from each other, except for the authority needed. The Realms API proposal would make this kind of security native in JavaScript, but in the meanwhile, the Secure EcmaScript (SES) polyfill makes it already attainable, and is in production at Salesforce today for their plugin system.To explore this possibility for MetaMask, we have been experimenting with a build tool we call SESify, which extends our browserify build process to also isolate every dependency in its own SES Realm, with permissions tightly confined with a declarative access file, which we could automatically update in response to dependency permissions changes, triggering manual review.Effectively, this would allow us to automatically never allow a module that doesn\u2019t need network access to spontaneously access the network, and to be alerted the moment an update to that module introduced code that would attempt to access the network.We believe that code isolation is the best tool we have to combat dependency attacks, as even npm audit only detects known vulnerabilities. (If you're interested in helping contribute to that project, please reach out!)Even without perfect dependency isolation, there may also be an opportunity to use tooling like Trusted on First Use (TOFU) to automatically detect dependency upgrades that introduce the use of new system APIs, which could help to automatically detect rogue dependency upgrades.ConclusionMetaMask suffered a process failure where we disabled an automated audit and did not open an issue to track the re-enabling or replacing of it.We have reviewed this protocol failure with the team, and have updated the concerning dependencies and re-enabled the automated audit in our test suite that is required before each change to the project. We\u2019re also looking at other automated audit solutions, like github and greenkeeper.Because this means we updated many dependencies in our development branch at once, we are also announcing a fresh 3000 DAI (~$3000) bug bounty program for finding any dependency upgrade that introduces code designed to illegitimately access user keys. To aid reviewers in their effectiveness in this bug hunt, we are also introducing a new twitter account where we will post about pending release candidates.Automated audits are not the final say in security, which is why we hired Cure53 to review our extension\u2019s security, and have continued to pursue strategies of dependency isolation.This improvement in our project has been thanks in part to the open source community, and we thank everyone for encouraging us to be the most secure project we can be.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["JavaScript", "Metamask", "Security", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "LikeCoin Store beta released", "post_link": "https://medium.com/likecoin/likecoin-store-beta-1a4740aa8ee5?source=search_post", "author_name": "\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa | kin ko", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ckxpress", "publish_date": "2018-01-31", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-08", "readtime": "2.52", "claps": 203, "voters": 22, "content": "LikeCoin Store beta releasedSend and receive LikeCoin on web\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa | kin koFollowJan 31, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readWhile sending money instantly without border is amazing, the user experience of blockchain can sometimes be scary for some people.

hijackingTeam NimiqFollowApr 13 \u00b7 6 min readOn the 8th of February 2019, Lukas Stefanko announced that WeLiveSecurity.com had identified the first case of clipper malware on the Google Play store. It is no surprise that this newly discovered malware was designed to steal cryptocurrency. Nimiq is protected from clipboard hijacking by design, thanks to the Nimiq Identicons.Metamask clone exploits copy & pasteThe malware was found impersonating Metamask on the Google Store and was built to steal a users crypto in two ways:To get the users private keys and gain control of the victim\u2019s wallet.By replacing a BTC or ETH wallet address copied to a clipboard with one being controlled by the hacker.Metamask browser extension, used by more than 1.3 million usersThe scary thing about stealing crypto through clipboard hijacking is that it exploits user behavior. With any cryptocurrency, receiver wallet addresses are a very long and difficult to memorize string of numbers and letters. To keep things straight forward, most crypto users are copy and pasting the receiver address when processing transactions.Clipboard hijacking: how does it work?Clipboard hijacking malware works by monitoring the clipboards of infected computers for cryptocurrency addresses. Essentially, if the malware detects a cryptocurrency address on the user\u2019s clipboard, it will swap it out for an address owned by the thieves.In most cases, crypto clipboard hijackers are limited to a few hundred thousand addresses. However, in mid-2018 BleepingComputer discovered malware monitoring 2.3 million crypto wallet addresses.The truth is that most users do not know that they have been infected with clipboard hijacking malware until it\u2019s too late. The malware simply runs in the background and there is no indication that it\u2019s even there.How can Nimiq Identicons combat clipboard hijackingFor those that don\u2019t know, an identicon is \u201ca visual representation of a hash value . . . that serves to identify a user of a computer system as a form of avatar while protecting the users\u2019 privacy\u201d. With Nimiq, virtually-unique identicons are assigned to every account address (Nimiqs terminology in place of \u201cwallet address\u201d) and aim to make each address identifiable at just a glance. Based on Robohash, the challenge Nimiq had to overcome when developing its identicons, was to ensure they are exceptionally recognizable whilst also offering a high level of variability to enable the generation of a different identicon for each Nimiq account address.Indeed, identicons are used to help visualize Ethereum addresses in popular wallets like MyEtherWallet. However, these types of identicons are more geared to tech-savvy audiences and typical internet users often don\u2019t find them recognizable, distinguishable or memorable.Identicons of Ethereum addressesNow, that\u2019s a big problem when you consider the intended function of identicons, as the creator of the concept put it:\u201cIMHO, too much of the web what we read are textual or numeric information which are not easy to distinguish at a glance when they are jumbled up together. So I think adding visual identifiers will make the user experience much more enjoyable.\u201d- Don Park, creator of the identicon conceptIdenticons of Nimiq addressesThe key success factor here is that Nimiq Identicons are highly distinguishable and memorable so that users can identify different account addresses easily. So, when you are trying to confirm to your friends that they are indeed sending to the intended account address:Instead of repeating your Nimiq account address NQ57 KNAL 9PG2 ATVG EBDD 6SMG HUHD M959 SG1B you can say\u2026It\u2019s the orange unicorn with green eyes and antennas.This makes checking account addresses significantly easier, humans are simply better at describing visualizations, rather than a long string of letters and numbers. We also think this way of verifying account addresses is more fun too.If a Nimiq user is subject to a clipboard hijacking attack and the malware replaces the Nimiq address on the clipboard with an account address controlled by the attacker, then the user will paste this fraudulent address into the send field and the receiving addresses identicon will be shown instantly. If you are sending NIM to a friend and you see an identicon different from their usual one, then you instantly know that someone has launched a clipboard hijacking attack against you (or you made a typo or copy-paste error yourself). If you are sending to someone you don\u2019t know, you can just ask them like \u201care you the orange guy, with the soccer ball, blue lobster claws, and the blue background?\u201d.Want to check out some of Nimiq\u2019s Identicons for yourself? Take a look here.There is also an ongoing effort to improve the usability in the check-at-a-glance user interaction, by adding a suggested name to each identicon. Many thanks and credit to community developer Terorie for contributing the naming scheme.Yes, it\u2019s true that clipboard hijacking attacks can be protected against by double or triple checking recipient account addresses before sending. However, that does make things more complicated and time-consuming, also most people trust that their computer will paste what they copied. That\u2019s why the instant recognizability and huge variation of Nimiq Identicons can help protect NIM users and foil clipboard hijacking attempts in both a simple and straight forward way.The huge variety of Nimiq IdenticonsEach Nimiq Identicon has five different elements, bottoms, faces, sides, tops body, and background color. Each element has a distinctive color. In total, identicons are made up of a combination of:21 bottoms21 faces21 sides21 tops8 colors for parts9 body colors10 background colorsThat means there are 10 * 9 * 8 * 21\u2074 = 140,026,320 different identicons that can be generated. This means that Nimiq is capable of generating more than 100 million highly differentiated and instantly recognizable identicons.Final wordThe fake MetaMask app in the Google Play store just goes to show how bad actors are evolving and changing their methods to steal crypto by trying to exploit common user behavior. We hope this example helps you to better understand the value of Nimiq Identicons and why it\u2019s useful to have a method for users to easily recognize addresses. In extension of the ease-of-use of the Nimiq Identicons, we look forward to soon rolling out the new Nimiq Identicon naming scheme and sharing it with the community. If you don\u2019t have a Nimiq Identicon yet and want to choose your own right now, you can do so in 30 seconds by creating a Nimiq account here.Pura VidaTeam NimiqDISCLAIMER: None of the statements must be viewed as an endorsement or recommendation for Nimiq, any cryptocurrency, or investment product.

It\u2019s just a set of methods that describe what a basic currency does. Here is a header file for the interface, which is so concise, I believe many non-programmers should be able to make sense of it:contract ERC20 {     function totalSupply() constant returns (uint totalSupply);     function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance);     function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);     function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);     function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool success);     function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint remaining);     event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);     event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value);}The nice thing about having a common protocol is that different wallets know how to talk to those smart contracts very reliably. By having a consistent interface, tokens become easy to represent in a variety of contexts.That said, there is nothing about this particular token standard that is special or absolute. It\u2019s just a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. What a token actually does can be a very open ended thing! While you might expect that sending a token deducts from yourself and adds to someone else, a token like BeerCoin might behave differently!Even \u201cthe standard\u201d itself might change over time, and so wallets all have to do what they can to keep up. Right now ERC-223 is a draft for one token alternative, for example.Does my Wallet Support This Token?In Ethereum, the wallet does not actually hold your tokens. Your wallet holds your keys, which is used to send transactions from your account. Transactions can include sending Ether, publishing, or interacting with smart contracts. This includes tokens.When a wallet \u201cSupports tokens\u201d, it just means it has an easy way of *showing* those tokens. Some wallets only allow showing a certain list of tokens. Other wallets let you add custom tokens. Some wallets let you add any contract at all, token or not!For this reason, any wallet that allows \u201cviewing any ERC-20 token\u201d will be able to view any contract that exposes the ERC-20 token methods listed above, so you don\u2019t need to worry whether your token will work with MetaMask, or MEW, or Parity, or Mist.ConclusionIssuing a token just means writing a smart contract that includes some certain functions.

In this third part of the guide, we will look at how we can make this service publicly available through a web application.Prerequisites and learning outcomesIn order to follow this tutorial, you should have also followed part 1 and part 2, or at least have the source code from these tutorials and understand it:stbeyer/docCertTutorialdocCertTutorial \u2014 Blockchain based document certification tutorialgithub.comAs in the previous tutorial, we will use Javascript and Node.js, so some working knowledge of this is required.After completing this tutorial you will know how to:Use the web3.js library in a web environment to connect to an Ethereum smart contractHow to use MetaMask to allow users to sign for transactions with their own keysBuild a web application that connects to a smart contract, executing transactions and callsDesigning the web interfaceFirst, let us define a web interface which will eventually connect to our contract. As this is not a web design tutorial, we will use some very basic html, although I use the bootstrap framework to make the front-end look acceptable.The following is what we want the application to look like:Let\u2019s create a directory webapp and create a file index.html inside the directory with the following content:As you can see we are importing some bootstrap related stylesheet and javascript files from content delivery networks. This also includes the JQuery library which is used by bootstrap and we will also use to simplify our own Javascript.The other two libraries we need are web3 and jsSHA, which we already know from part 2 of this guide. For jsSHA we just copy the sha256.js file into our webapp directory. You can copy this file from the npm imported modules we used in part 2 or from the libraries git repository.In the case of web3, getting the correct file is slightly more complicated. The required file for the browser version of this library should be in the dist folder of the git repository or npm module. However, at the time of writing, even the 1.0 branch of the web3 git repository does not include the correct 1.0 version of the library in the dist folder. I use version 1.0 in this tutorial, as it makes more sense to learn the updated interface of this new version. The required file can be build from source, but as this may fail because of missing dependencies on some installations, it may be easiest to copy it from my repository.The other two Javascript files are the ones in which we will develop our application code. We will get to these soon, but first of all, make sure you have a local web server installed, to serve our web application (web3 does not work correctly, if served from the file system). If you do not have a local web server application you may use http-server. This can be installed globally with:npm install http-server -gNow we can serve our web application on http://localhost:8080 by executing the following command in our webapp directory:http-server .We can now navigate to the page.Designing the contract connectionIf we connect to our contract through our Ethereum node, as in part 2 of this guide, we hit two problems:The node does not run on the end-users computer, so we would have to make it publicly accessible, which is a security risk.Each time a user uploads a document hash, a transaction fee occurs, which is charged to our account. In order to offer our document certification service publicly, we thus cover the bill for our end-users.We could of course ask our users to run their own Ethereum nodes, but then we would provide a service that is difficult to use. A better solution would be to ask users to pay a fee for submitting a file hash to cover our cost, and hide our node behind a REST API (i.e. requests to the contract are sent form the front-end to our back-end server and passed to the Ethereum node there).There is however a third solution, which is the one we will explore here: We can ask our user to sign transactions with their own keys, without running a full node, and by using a user-friendly light wallet.To this end, we will use the MetaMask browser plugin, which is available for Chrome and Firefox. MetaMask is an Ethereum wallet for the browser. The extension actually injects a web3 provider into the browser, which allows us to connect to the blockchain via a MetaMask provided node. We can use web3 as usual and MetaMask will automatically pop up and ask users to confirm transactions and, importantly, spend their own Ether. In our web application we can tell users to install MetaMask, for example by linking the following image to the MetaMask website:Go ahead and install MetaMask in your browser and create an account. MetaMask will appear in your toolbar displaying an image of a fox. In this tutorial we will use our contract deployed on the Rinkeby test network in part 2 of this guide, so make sure you select Rinkeby as the network to connect to in your MetaMask installation. The network can be selected in a drop down menu at the top of the MetaMask extension\u2019s user interface.As in part 2, we require some Rinkeby test Ether in our account. You can transfer some test Ether you may still have from the previous tutorial to your MetaMask account, or use the Rinkeby Ether faucet again to request additional Ether.Connecting to our contractOnce we have MetaMask set up to the Rinkeby network, with some test Ether in our account, we can write the missing Javascript code to connect our web interface. Fist of all, let\u2019s define a contract wrapper module again, this time in a file called notaryWebApp.js with the following content:As your can see the code is similar to the contract wrapper module we defined for our command line tool in part 2 of this guide. The functions to send a hash value to the contract and to verify a hash value are unchanged, so we will not discuss them again.What has changed however is the initialisation code that created the link to our web3 provider:if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {    window.web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);} else {    alert(\"No Ethereum interface injected into browser. Read-only access\");}MetaMask injects a web3 object, which used to be a full version of the library. However, in order to deal with different library versions, only a small subset to get the provider is guaranteed to be supported in the foreseeable future, which is why we have included our own copy of the web3 code in our Javascript imports in the html code. The above code checks if we have an injected web3 objects, i.e. it checks wether MetaMask or a compatible extension is installed (the official Ethereum Mist browser also injects web3). If this is found to be the case, we create a new web3 object with our library pointing to the existing existing provider. If no web3 object is found, we display an alert.The contract address and ABI declarations and the contract object definition are unchanged (Remember to replace the contract address, if you want to use your own instance).We can now create our application code in an app.js file in the webapp directory:We call the contracts wrapper init() function when the document is fully loaded. The two functions send() and find() are executed when the buttons in our html are clicked. As you can see, the hash values are calculated as previously, and we make sure that all HEX strings start with a leading \u201c0x\u201d, so that the contract bindings will translate to the Solidity byte32 data type correctly. We use JQuery to inject html into the web page to show the blockchain response.If we use the upload dialogue and click on the \u201cFingerprint to Blockchain\u201d button, MetaMask we pop up and request transaction confirmation:MetaMask confirmation dialogIf we confirm the transaction, MetaMask sends it via its Ethereum node, signed with the end-users key. We are presented with a result similar to this:We now have to wait for a short time for the transaction to be mined (you can confirm this by searching for the transaction ID on https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/.Once the transaction is mined verifying the file by clicking \u201cFind on Blockchain\u201d returns output similar to the following:ConclusionIn this three part guide we have shown the process of developing an Ethereum smart contract based application, using document certification as a simple but useful example. We have developed and tested the contract locally, before deploying it to a real Ethereum blockchain. We have connected to the contract through our own Ethereum node and through MetaMask. Furthermore, we have used the web3 library to create a command-line interface and a web application.The source code for this tutorial can be found on GitHub:stbeyer/docCertTutorialdocCertTutorial \u2014 Blockchain based document certification tutorialgithub.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "Web3", "Blockchain", "Development"]}, {"title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum seed phrases explained for non-technical people", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/bitcoin-and-ethereum-seed-phrases-explained-for-non-technical-people-a9f2a49c388d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Justin Goro", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@justingoro", "publish_date": "2019-07-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-09", "readtime": "4.49", "claps": 40, "voters": 6, "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum seed phrases explained for non-technical peopleFree of scary cryptographyJustin GoroFollowJul 9 \u00b7 5 min readIts redundant to say that the blockchain industry is changing at a breathtaking pace which means I tend to have a just-in-time (Justin time?) learning philosophy for most things technical. My main passion at the moment is Ethereum development and so I only know as much as I need to about the nitty-gritty of cryptography. Once I\u2019m ready to publish something real on the main net, I\u2019ll properly wrap my brain around cryptographic security. However, until then, some things have become so commonplace that they can\u2019t be avoided or put off anymore. For those of you who use metamask and other HD wallets, you\u2019ve probably become familiar with the seed phrase/seed mnemonic/pass phrase/ backup phrase structure of private key generation. In the early days, generating a new wallet meant writing down a long list of numbers and letters. Then almost suddenly, that all changed and the world moved over to using a phrase of 12 common English words that looks something like:dove lumber quote board young robust kit invite plastic regular skull historySo where did private and public keys go and is it possible to get a broad understanding of why things are like this without descending into terrifying maths and computer science? The answer is yes. I\u2019ve taken a brief pause from my furious buidling to quickly spit this article out because it seems unfair to have something so broadly used only be intellectually accessible to the likes of Alan Turin and Vitalik Buterin.TL;DR This article is already a tl;dr of BIP39. Sorry.Terms you should be familiar with: algorithm (see here for a lengthy example of what algorithms are), Ethereum, Bitcoin and public-private key cryptography.Disclaimer: This isn\u2019t complete and perfect. Just enough to give you an intuitive grasp. Also there are details I\u2019m not 100% sure of and I say as much. Corrections are welcome but please submit them as private comments, otherwise they won\u2019t make sense to future readers if they no long apply.Quick Pre-CapIf you\u2019re still hazy on what private-public key pairs are, use this analogy: a private key is your gmail password. A public key is your email address. Everyone can see your email address and they require it to send you mail. When you send mail, they will see it has been delivered from your email address. However, only you know your gmail password. This gives you power to send emails and read emails sent to you. Email addresses and passwords exist in pairs like this (justin@fakeland.com;123456) where each email address can only have one corresponding password and vice versa. Why refer to it as a pair? I\u2019ve noticed that the more mathematically inclined people are, the more excited they get at ordering things into groups, sets, pairs, rings etc. I\u2019m not sure why but it seems to make them happy. So whenever you hear a technical person use the jargon \u201cpublic-private key pair\u201d, think \u201cemail address and its corresponding password.\u201dBIP39Bitcoin has Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) which are submitted by anyone from the public for review before undergoing a lengthy acceptance or rejection process. In Ethereum, the equivalent is commonly known as an Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC). A well known example, ERC20, is the suggested standard for token exchange and is of course the 20th ERC. Most BIPs and ERCs fail to get anywhere but BIP39 did succeed and explains how the seed phrase mnemonic works. The Ethereum community has a history of borrowing good ideas from Bitcoin and as such the standard now applies in both.So let\u2019s dive into how BIP39 works:You start with a dictionary of 2048 words. The first 4 letters of each word must be unique. That is, no other word in the dictionary can start with those same 4 letters. This allows you to store a seed phrase that looks likesexy doge manbearpig houseassexy doge manb housThe dictionary is ordered and indexed like1 | Abacus2 | Alabaster3 | Albania\u20262048 | ZoologyBy convention the world uses the same dictionary. This just makes compatibility between wallets easier to maintain but if you want to be all Satoshi about your security, you can make your own unique list and write wallets that cater to that list if you like.The next step is to have a random number generator which spits out numbers between 1 and 2048. This is fairly trivial in computer science and the geniuses that be chose a reliably random and well known algorithm for the job.So now you generate 12 numbers which correspond to your 12 words using the dictionary.BIP32Prior to BIP39, BIP32 established a new standard of private-public key generation known as hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. The concept behind it is far less intimidating than the word choice. The magic of HD is that you generate a master private key which you can put through an algorithm that generates another unique private key. You can then use this second private key to generate yet more private keys. Each private key can be put through (yet another) algorithm to produce its corresponding public key. I\u2019m not sure how many of these successive key-pairs you can generate from one master key but I think each master key can spawn about 2 billion.Putting it all togetherThe mnemonic phrase you have written down can be backward converted to a list of numbers between 1 and 2048 using the dictionary. The words are simply there to make it easier for humans to understand and convey over the phone (for those who don\u2019t believe the NSA exists). So our list ofdove lumber quote board young robust kit invite plastic regular skull historywill be converted to something like101 900 1781 62 568 123 88 1322 1099 1544 666 finally you just bunch that all together as one long string to form a unique string of numbers:10190017816256812388132210991544666Using a special algorithm, you can convert that final string into a master private key used in the HD wallets. You can then spawn a huge new list of private-public key pairs as desired. You probably only need 1 but Satoshi suggested using a new key pair for every transaction. This standard makes that way easier than ever before. All you need is 12 words, your master key to (almost) endless key pairs.Personally I use a single key phrase to generate 10 unique addresses which I load with fake ether and use to test my smart contracts locally but I imagine merchants and exchanges take full advantage of the flexibility and ease of use of this system of key storage and generation.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Cryptography", "Ethereum", "Metamask"]}, {"title": "How to Transfer Tokens from Gnosis LightWallet to Another Wallet", "post_link": "https://blog.gnosis.pm/how-to-transfer-tokens-from-gnosis-lightwallet-to-metamask-57c3dcf2d049?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gnosis", "author_link": "https://blog.gnosis.pm/@gnosisPM", "publish_date": "2019-04-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-08", "readtime": "2.29", "claps": 56, "voters": 4, "content": "How to Transfer Tokens from Gnosis LightWallet to Another WalletGnosisFollowApr 3 \u00b7 3 min readDisclaimer: The blog post is for informational purposes only.

This was revolutionary at the time. Today this is standard practice and a powerful means of communication of ideas and information. Their dynasty provides us with a modern day example of how innovation provides a future outlook that all organizations can follow to generate success.The reason our project exists is due to the combination of leveraging the power of new blockchain technology, with existing financial problems in developing countries. This industry is fairly new and there are still varied opinions regarding the future of blockchain, and what can be achieved by integrating this technology into different sectors. 30 years ago, noone correctly anticipated the degree of integration of the internet and how it would occur into everyday life, creating widespread benefits to every sector of society. With this in mind, looking forward, we believe the same is possible regarding blockchain technology. Analysis of the world\u2019s population shows that 40% are still unbanked, this amounts to approximately 2 billion people. The interesting statistic here is that this same demographic uses social media extensively such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. We aim to release our platform in the Philippines as it is a prime example of a country whose population has more Facebook users than they have bank account holders. Providing credit to regions such as this, creates opportunities and builds a strong solid future for generations that will, in turn, receive an education, start a business and have access to better healthcare. Economic improvements in regions such as South East Asia would be made possible by the platform we are building. For us as a team, success in our project is measured by the millions of people whose lives we will be able to change.In our office in Barcelona, we have built a solid, collaborative technology team who are passionate about delivering a powerful blockchain-based platform that will successfully enable our vision from our whitepaper to come to life. If you were to visit our office and watch our weekly sprints, you would see that the team really cares about what they are doing and they are passionate about delivering the highest quality solution. As HeroToken holders, every single team member is invested into the future success of the project.After the wonderful response we gained from releasing the first set of screenshots of the new platform last month, we are very happy to be able to show you the next set of interfaces completed in the platform. This time we share some screenshots of our Metamask integration to our Ethereum smart contracts.MetaMask has been integrated into our platform and is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the smart contract without users needing to create new accounts into our system. Users will therefore be able to use their own accounts and balances with the highest level of security. Data security is a top priority for HeroToken and implementing MetaMask is a tried and tested way to ensure that their management of private keys and contracts safe.We have built our Loan Token smart contracts on Ethereum and MetaMask allows the user a seamless and user-friendly process of accessing our loan tokens and processing payments on the Ethereum network. As you can see from our first screenshot, the embedded MetaMask extension is ready to be used on our test platform. Our MetaMask implementation will guide our users through a simple process of logging in securely to their wallet, connecting to our smart contract, then processing the payment of the exact required amount in order to take possession of their loan tokens. This step-by-step process can be seen in the screenshots provided.Our smart contract will use the extension to link up with your existing MetaMask account and integrate completely in the background without you needing to do anything further.This particular process illustrated here is of the lending process of our platform, where the lenders are guided through this process of paying the originators and hence taking possession of their Loan Token to represent the loan.We have integrated using Rinkeby Test Network. This allows us to use a set of \u2018test\u2019 Ethers so that we can fully comprehend all the different aspects of how they will be implemented within our platform when it is live. This level of testing at this stage is imperative to our future success and ensures that we know all contingencies for when our system is live on the Ethereum main network.We hope that by sharing these screenshots, you have a clearer idea of what our technology team are undertaking and the solution that is taking shape. We are excited with this progress and we look forward to sharing more with you in the very near future.Away from technology, our team has also been immersing themselves into the events that Barcelona has to offer. Our business executive team have spent the latter part of the week attending an EU \u2018startup\u2019 event that allows them to learn, network and perspective about the strides that we are making.There is a lot of excitement about our project currently and we appreciate all the positive support and feedback shared by our community.We want to offer you exceptional, consistent service and therefore we encourage you to contact us with any questions you may have about this update (including the technical information) or anything else that we are doing.

The following is the voting guidance we prepared for you.Some important notes:1. We will take a snapshot of the QKC holding addresses and the balances when ETH Block height reaches 7,910,000 (about 10 am to 2 pm UTC+8, Jun 7th ) before the start of the vote. The number of QKCs held in a wallet address will be the total number of votes the address has. If the token does not withdraw from the exchange at the time of the snapshot, this wallet address won\u2019t be counted, and thus, the holders cannot participate in the poll.2. All the users who participated in the guardian plan can vote directly on the page without taking back the staked QKC. The number of votes equals the actual QKC balance of the snapshot.3. The vote won\u2019t consume or need to lock extra QKC. Voters only need to sign on the voting page.4. In order to ensure fairness and openness of the voting results, we will store the voting results on the chain. All voters need to prepare a small amount of ETH to pay the gas fee.5. Due to the regulation concern, all voters should finish KYC form as instructed after voting.6. Web users please use Metamask to vote, and mobile users please use qPocket to vote.Vote Guidance:A.

The entrance for users into the crypto and blockchain world is open, to be more precise it\u2019s about the easy way to trade Ethereum. (I get commissions for purchases made through links in this post.)But besides Chrome there is also the add-on for Firefox, Opera and the Brave Browser. The user interface of this super wallet allows the user to simultaneously log in at several locations for transactions on the blockchain. Everything is managed via the MetaMask security identity vault. The Dapp, i.e. the decentralized app, is easy to use and can also be used by newcomers to the cryptographic market. Just download once, register and the Super-Wallet spits out a 12-digit code with which the user can access his account at any time from anywhere on any computer.Malware threatened the Dapp \u2014 Update 6.0 has arrivedAfter almost 12 months the MetaMask team proudly announced in February 2019 that the new and even better user interface is available in version 6.0. A number of new features have been introduced, including trading and management of ERC 20 tokens and hardware wallet support. New security levels are also included in the update, because many Ethereum users will have noticed that \u201cClipper\u201d was malware, the wallet had played along quite well in the past year. Suddenly a seemingly real looking App Logo appeared in the Google Store, behind which attackers are hiding. The aim of the attack on the practical wallet was to steal the private key and thus gain control over the Ethereum funds of those affected.The Super Wallet for fast Ethereum tradingThe MetaMask extension is an Ethereum-enabled application that integrates Ethereum\u2019s web3 API into the JavaScript context of any web page. This allows the dApp to read from the blockchain (What is blockchain?) and execute a transaction. Before writing to the blockchain, MetaMask sends the user a secure interface to verify the transaction before approving it.MetaMask\u2019s developers work with Secure ECMAScripts (SES) to provide even better protection against attacks and malware in the future. This isolates each module in its own SES container. The web application firewall it creates is a powerful authentication layer that controls user access to a wide variety of applications. A further improvement, which will be expanded even further in the future, is the upload of data via Infura. The company provides the infrastructure for the decentralized application, makes it possible to read Ethereum data and makes the request for the transactions on the blockchain. The currently more than 100,000 requests per second are to be transferred to Infura even more efficiently in the future, in order to increase the performance of the practical application.

Please consult our Twitter and future Medium posts for any new major incidents.tl;dr : yesterday MetaMask was taken off of the Chrome Web Store for about 6 hours. It ended up being a removal in error on Chrome\u2019s side. Below: our thought processes and lessons learned. Plus: kudos to our supporters.Sometime during the morning of July 25th, 2018, one of our team members noticed that MetaMask was missing from the Chrome Web Store.This proved to be an interesting wake-up call for a majority of our team.What was left when one searched the term \u2018MetaMask\u2019 on the store was a few re-branded MetaMask forks and one ambiguously branded lookalike. No email from Google at the time alerted us as to why it was taken down (though later, we were notified that the email supposedly bounced, something we plan to investigate and fix tomorrow). All of our other versions \u2014 on Firefox, Opera, and Brave \u2014 were working normally.This presented the product with a few immediate concerns:Phishing \u2014 although the majority of new users will visit our landing page first or be directly linked to the extension listing (both of which would eventually lead to a dead link), the existence of lookalikes on the storefront page meant that people searching for the extension could be mislead. Additionally, we were alerted of several other phishing vectors on Telegram and on the Google Play Store that were active at that time.Updates \u2014 the team was anticipating to deploy a new update \u2014 with features such as Trezor support and other various Quality of Life improvements \u2014 but the situation effectively blocked us from deploying an update to over one million installs, which accounts for the majority of our total user count.New installs \u2014 although we had a few knowledge base articles detailing how to install MetaMask from source, this still isn\u2019t an ideal user flow for common users, and explaining to them that they would have to install our extension differently would impact our accessibility.Without an express line of contact to arbitrate the decision nor any knowledge at the time why the removal happened (though rumors did spread quickly), we prepared for the worst possible scenario. Twitter blasts, reaching out to connections, rewriting knowledge base articles, and watching our communications channels took up a large chunk of work from the day.Thankfully, by approximately 12:40 PST the same day, we were back on the store. The reason given: the removal was done in error.The community was 100% behind us the entire time, something we wholeheartedly appreciate. Big shout-outs to Brave & BAT, Augur, MyCrypto, IDEX, and the several other people and organizations who helped propagate the initial announcement and inform our community. You all represent a community worth developing for.So, now that everything is said and done, what does this mean at a basic level?All operations are back to normal within MetaMask. Expect us to push a new update soon in relief.Chrome users should now be able to accept said update, and all links should work fine \u2014 no listings have changed.The most egregious lookalike on the Chrome Web Store has been removed.The team will have ongoing discussions on future red-alert scenarios and have careful protocols to handle each one. In the most optimistic case, we will share the majority of these red-alert scenarios publicly to increase transparency.As the mango on top, this incident has allowed us to ask meaningful questions about security and continuing to earn trust and acceptance from our community.Given that browser\u2019s app stores have the ability to arbitrarily remove extensions from their listings, how does the product deal with this as an important layer in this ecosystem? What solutions allow us to be resilient to this kind of incident, intentional or not? Although several users used the opportunity to urge their fellow MetaMaskers to jump ship to another browser, this problem persists so long as the browser has the power to curate extensions at-will.How do we continue to combat phishing and in turn, increase confidence that the installed product is the correct one? We recognize that this is an ongoing battle in which phishers will always find ways to circumvent, but given the window of time in which we lacked a formal presence on both Chrome, Telegram, and Android, how do we alert users that these are not legitimate products?For a product that enables decentralized technology, it has centralized points of failure. Our distribution models are some of them, placing our trust in browsers, GitHub, and the people deploying in order to keep the system working. Although we at MetaMask continue to explore solutions to minimize these single points of failure, such as through multi-signature deployment and IPFS, we welcome the community to help us find answers.Again, we thank everyone for your support through this ordeal, though short it was.", "responses": 7, "tags": ["Chrome", "Metamask"]}, {"title": "MetaMask Metrics: a first look", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-metrics-fbec0e2ceaa7?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bobby Dresser", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bobbydresser", "publish_date": "2019-05-23", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-23", "readtime": "5.46", "claps": 1091, "voters": 98, "content": "MetaMask Metrics: a first lookBobby DresserFollowMay 23 \u00b7 6 min readMetaMask attracts users from all over the blockchain space \u2014 developers, token traders, first-time dapp users who don\u2019t even know what Ethereum is, and everything in between.It\u2019s a wide range for a single product, and we\u2019re amazed at the many use cases and insights that come from these different user personas.We\u2019ve long relied on qualitative feedback from support, Github and around the community to inform product development. But in early March, we rolled out an opt-in metrics system to provide some quantitative insight on how people are really using MetaMask.Two months later, we can see trends and high-level volume that highlight the incredible amount of dapp activity and development happening across the ecosystem. We\u2019re excited to share.OverviewAt the beginning of March, we asked all users if they were willing to allow their extension to report basic UI metrics. New users saw an additional screen during their onboarding flow, and existing users saw the same screen the next time they opened the extension.From the time this metrics system launched in March, we\u2019ve had 275k users opt-in and 104k users decide to opt-out. That means that the data shown here only reflect 72.6% of our user base.The data reported below are either shown \u201cAs measured\u201d or \u201cEstimated actual.\u201d\u201cAs measured\u201d is the raw number we recorded for the users who opted in.\u201cEstimated actual\u201d is the projected total if all behavior were consistent across those users who opted out.As a reminder, we\u2019ll never collect keys, addresses, transaction details, account balances, full IP addresses, account nicknames, or any data from outside the extension. Users are free to opt-out from metrics with the click of a button (Settings \u2013> Security & Privacy). And we\u2019ll never sell your data for profit!MAU, Growth, and OnboardingIn the past two months, we\u2019ve seen 89k new wallets and 53k imported wallets.Week-over-week new user growth for this time period is 1.1%, but doesn\u2019t track a straight line: we\u2019ve found that new user growth is often tied to ecosystem-wide events like the price of ETH, a good press cycle, or a trending game. Still, the overall trend continues to bend upwards.Users complete the new wallet onboarding flow 79% of the time, which reflects what we know about the challenges of putting new users in control of their own keys. We\u2019ll continue to iterate on onboarding UX without compromising the core tenets of security & privacy that we hold paramount.April measured 192k MAU and 65k WAU, which we can adjust proportionally for the chunk of our userbase who did not opt-in to metrics:We\u2019re defining an \u201cactive\u201d user as someone who interacts with MetaMask in any way \u2014 by opening the extension to check their balance, by sharing their address with a dapp, by switching their active account, etc.We find that active users are often *quite* active: we\u2019re measuring roughly 320k visits per week, which means the average weekly active user visits MetaMask 4.9 times per week.That said, not every active user is interacting directly with the blockchain. On any given day, about 30% of active users confirm an on-chain transaction. This suggests there\u2019s still a portion of users who see MetaMask as a wallet, or who are interacting with dapps (via the \u201cConnect\u201d screen, or by signing data) but stop short of confirming a transaction.TransactionsMetaMask recorded 1.1 million transactions in the month of April, which projects out to a whopping 1.51 million transactions last month across the entire user base.There\u2019s a sizeable chunk of activity spread across the Ethereum testnets, and development traffic on users\u2019 local Ganache network is represented notably, but the bulk of this activity (63%) is happening on the Ethereum Mainnet.We also recorded 71k transactions on \u201cother\u201d networks, which goes to show MetaMask\u2019s reach beyond just Ethereum chains. There were 25 unique networks with more than 1k transactions in the month of April.Transactions on MainnetLet\u2019s take a closer look at activity on Mainnet. The previous graph shows the transactions we measured across all networks. Since this only represents about 3/4 of our users, we project that the total transaction volume on Mainnet in April was closer to 1 million transactions overall:What immediately jumps out from the transaction metrics we measured is that the majority of all transactions are prompted from outside of MetaMask.The graph below shows the breakdown between transactions that are initiated by users (by opening MetaMask, clicking the \u201cSend\u201d button, choosing to send ETH or tokens, then completing the transaction) compared to transactions initiated by dapps or exchanges (transactions prompted to the user via the free-standing popup window).We intend for MetaMask to be so much more than a wallet, and our usage data show this is already the case: it\u2019s not just for storing, sending and managing assets on Ethereum \u2014 it\u2019s connecting users to functional applications in the emerging decentralized web.When we look at Mainnet transactions by function, the data are even clearer:ETH Sends, token transfers, and approve calls are quite common, but the vast majority of transactions are interactions with non-ERC20 smart contracts.We do our best to look up function names for these contract interactions, but most still go unmatched and show simply as \u201cContract Interaction.\u201d (For dapp developers reading this: we recommend you add your functions to this on-chain registry!)In the coming months, we\u2019ll be investing in making Confirm screens clearer and more informative, especially for function calls.Dapp UsageThere are thousands of individual applications that contribute to the transaction volume above. The top five on mainnet and top five overall are:This represents a good mix of collectibles, games, exchanges & developer tools. Remix\u2019s place as the most-used application reflects our substantial developer user base, especially on testnets.These applications are only the tip of the iceberg: on Mainnet alone, there are over 25 different dapps with over 5k transactions in April, and we see new applications appear in our weekly charts all the time.TakeawaysThe goal of this system is to help us improve the product where users need it most. We\u2019ll continue to be transparent about what we learn and how it shapes our roadmap.We\u2019re excited to watch our metrics system mature so we can track growth over time, and see how feature development affects key numbers.On the product side, we\u2019re taking some time to invest design effort into refreshing the Confirm screens to make them more functional. At the same time, we\u2019re exploring a framework that will help the user extend permissions to different applications and reduce the need to confirm individual actions.We\u2019re stoked to see such widespread dapp usage, and we\u2019ll continue to build features that make devs\u2019 & users\u2019 lives easier!If you have data you\u2019d like to see, or have questions about how MetaMetrics works, comment below or drop me a line! bobby@metamask.io", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Data"]}, {"title": "How to add PMO tokens to your MetaMask wallet.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/pmotion/how-to-add-pmo-tokens-to-your-metamask-wallet-ac612722b117?source=search_post", "author_name": "PMOTION", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@pmotion", "publish_date": "2018-02-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-01", "readtime": "1.16", "claps": 1072, "voters": 59, "content": "How to add PMO tokens to your MetaMask wallet.PMOTIONFollowFeb 16, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readThis is a short guide on how to add it to your PMO tokens to your MetaMask wallet.MetaMask allows you to manage your Ethereum and ERC20 tokens within your browser.You can wait on Metamask to load your PMO tokens or you can add it to MetaMask manually.First you will need to go to the \u201cTokens\u201d tab of MetaMaskMetaMask Tokens Tab2.

You need to wait for those extra transactions to be confirmed and also pay the extra network fees.At MetaMask we care a LOT about our users\u2019 security, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been working hard the past few months to be able to finally ship Hardware Wallet support for TREZOR in version 4.9.0 of the MetaMask extension, which also comes with a few other cool features like automatic token detection, ENS+IPFS support and more! (full changelog here)This new feature took us some time because we wanted to get this right from scratch. This required a really big code refactor so that we could easily integrate different key signing strategies which our very own Dan Finlay handled like a pro!It\u2019s official: MetaMask now supports TREZORFrom now on, you can link your TREZOR device to MetaMask and you will be able to:Check your account balance (ETH or Tokens).Sign transactions \u2014 For ex. Send ETH and ERC20 tokens and collectibles, deploy contracts, etc.Signing transactions with your TREZOR via MetaMask- Sign messages \u2014 This will allow you to login / sign up to certain \u00d0Apps like CryptoKittiesSigning messages with your TREZOR via MetaMask\u2026 and basically everything that you were allowed to do before with MetaMask with one huge difference:Your private keys ALWAYS stay in your TREZOR Hardware wallet.Last but not least, there\u2019s another point that\u2019s worth mentioning\u2026 you might have seen that some \u00d0Apps let you to use your hardware wallets directly, (and that\u2019s great!) but that only works if the \u00d0App developer spent the extra time implementing the integration.By adding hardware wallet support inside MetaMask, we are allowing every single \u00d0App that works with MetaMask to be used securely with a Hardware Wallet.We hope that this kind of feature will increase the confidence and security in the entire Ethereum \u00d0App ecosystem.How does it work?Once you connect any Ethereum account from your TREZOR device, MetaMask will treat that account just like any other account, with the only difference being that every time you need to sign a transaction, you\u2019ll need to connect your TREZOR device and MetaMask will send a request to it to sign that specific transaction. Signing happens 100% inside your TREZOR device and your private keys are never exposed.Another cool thing is that you don\u2019t need to keep your TREZOR device connected all the time in order to see your different accounts and balances, but of course you can also opt to disconnect your device from MetaMask and link it again the next time you need to use it.How to try itFirst of all, you need to have the latest version of MetaMask installed in Google Chrome (other browsers will be supported in the future) and make sure you\u2019re using the NEW UI, which is still in beta (but not for too long!). Then follow these steps:Click on your account icon at the top right and you will see a new item \u201cConnect Hardware Wallet\u201d.Plug in your TREZOR device to your computer and click \u201cConnect To TREZOR\u201d.You will get a popup from TREZOR asking you for permission to export the public key, and once you confirm, you will see the list of Ethereum accounts from your TREZOR device in the MetaMask extension.4. Finally, select the account you want to use, and click \u201cUNLOCK\u201d. That\u2019s it!This is how you access the Ethereum accounts from your TREZOR deviceWe\u2019ve also added the ability to remove imported accounts, so if you want to stop seeing any that you imported into MetaMask, you can remove it like this.What\u2019s next?We\u2019re looking forward to adding Ledger hardware wallet support and we\u2019re currently exploring the different approaches we could take since both Ledger and TREZOR offer different ways to integrate with third-party applications like MetaMask.We hope you enjoy this feature, and if you have any feedback please leave us a comment!PS: If you don\u2019t have a TREZOR wallet, you should order one \ud83d\ude09", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Trezor", "Hardware", "Cold Storage", "Crypto"]}, {"title": "Trezor support", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-monthly-august-8b409c3fa18?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bobby Dresser", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bobbydresser", "publish_date": "2018-08-06", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-08", "readtime": "5.05", "claps": 696, "voters": 80, "content": "Bobby DresserFollowAug 6, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readJuly flew by, and we\u2019re back with another update!

Read more here.Breaking Change: No longer injecting web3 automaticallyFor anyone who cares about privacy on the web, this is big news. For a long time, MetaMask (and most other dapp browsers) have automatically injected an Ethereum provider and web3 instance into every page you visit. This has made it easy for dapps to get up and running as the ecosystem evolved. On the downside, this is a huge privacy issue: exposing the web3 object and a user\u2019s Ethereum addresses could give malicious sites enough info to fingerprint, track, and phish in a seriously dangerous way.MetaMask (along with Status, Mist, and imToken) plan to stop injecting an Ethereum provider and web3 instance by default. Instead, dapps can use the `postMessage` API to request access from the user. To the user, this will look a bit like a traditional log in flow.Since this change has implications for every dapp out there, we\u2019re taking it slow. We aim to make this change on November 2, and we\u2019ll be releasing example code and UI components along the way to keep things simple for dapp developers.To learn more, check out our blog post or the original EIP 1102. This change also leads neatly into an updated version of the Ethereum provider API, described in EIP 1193.Draft UI for MetaMask\u2019s EIP 1102 implementation (log-in per site)ENS is hereThis new version of MetaMask adds support for resolving ENS domains! When you type a `.eth` URL in your web browser, MetaMask will resolve the ENS Public Resolver `getContent` hash to the corresponding IPFS hash, and redirect your browser to content served from Infura. [Head to metamask.eth to try it out!] or read this tutorial to posting your own sites on ENS & IPFS! Loading sites over ENS allows sites to be updated by smart contracts instead of the traditional DNS system, potentially reducing the risk of DNS related hacking and phishing that we\u2019ve seen so much of lately. Big shout-out to Phyrex Tsai of portal.network for making this contribution (#4405). Check him out at phyrextsai.eth with MetaMask installed!The ENS/IPFS integration is currently reliant on Infura for its distribution and security, but we\u2019re working towards including more and more of the security client-side over time.The disappearing foxOn Wednesday 7/26, the MetaMask extension was mistakenly removed from the Chrome store for several hours. As most of our users are on Chrome, this caused trouble for our release process and our users\u2019 security. We\u2019re back up and running smoothly, and you can read our informal post-mortem here.MetaMask is hiring!Our family is growing. If you\u2019re a product designer, security expert, or Javascript whiz \u2014 we\u2019d love to chat. If you know someone, send them our way!What else is new?Version 4.9.0 is out and looking better than ever. Most of our UI improvements happen on the Beta UI, and you haven\u2019t switched over yet, you\u2019ll see a screen on startup suggesting you give it a try.The fresh version includes a new Confirmation Screen (below), with a simpler visual hierarchy, displays for contract method names (from the Parity method signature registry) a hex data input, a clearer summary of value for token transfers, and even warnings for nuanced interactions like \u201capprove\u201d token function calls.New confirmation screens with function names and transaction dataMetaMask is lucky to attract a lot of first-time blockchain users. For many, it\u2019s not obvious that token balances are tracked on contracts, unlike the Ether balance intrinsic to an account. Now, known tokens will appear automagically. We\u2019ll scan our list of known popular tokens and check your address against each, hopefully reducing some clicks & headaches. (#4683)For our power users out there, MetaMask can get cluttered with loose accounts. You\u2019re now able to remove loose or imported accounts in the Beta UI from the drop-down menu in the top right. (#2638)You can now remove loose accounts from the top-right menuThe \u201cSend\u201d screen in our Beta UI has a few new tweaks, including an input for optional hex data, more specific error messaging, and a better display of your account address. (#4814, #4694, #4822)The \u201cHome\u201d screen in the Beta UI has a couple upgrades as well: we\u2019re no longer showing rejected transactions on the activity log, and we\u2019ve added small tooltips to make navigation a little smoother. (#4667, #4779)The UI component we use for displaying signature requests now handles newlines and booleans (#4167, #4640). And if you\u2019re a developer out there using `eth_signTypedData`, heads up! The next version of MetaMask will update to the recently-merged EIP 712 spec, and you may need to update your application accordingly. Check our open PR here.Sometimes the Ethereum blockchain is slow. Rather than stay glued to the extension to wait for your transactions to land, we\u2019ll now show you a browser notification when your transactions confirm or fail. (#4080)That\u2019s not all \u2014 we\u2019ve patched up some odds and ends around the extension. Bug fixes include:Preventing multiple password submission (#4769)Don\u2019t persist seed phrase during Old UI restore flow (#4735)Stop closing other pop-ups accidentally (#4592)Handle token amount overflow (#4575)Updates to our contract metadata list (#4709)Heads up: New PermissionsOur ENS support and browser notifications require new permissions for interacting with your browser. If you\u2019re using Chrome and you see a new permissions request, it\u2019s legit. We\u2019re asking to change data on .eth and .test sites, as well as permission to display browser notifications.By the numbersAs always, huge thanks to our wonderful community for their feedback, support, and contributions to help MetaMask continually improve.In the past month, we saw:\u2705 68 PRs merged\ud83d\udee0 439 commits\ud83d\udcab 117 Github issues closed, 77 opened\ud83d\udca5 43k lines of code added, 36k deleted", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Crypto", "Blockchain", "Security", "Privacy"]}, {"title": "How to install Metamask for buy KOI Token", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@koitechstudio/how-to-install-metamask-for-buy-koi-token-ceee4399abda?source=search_post", "author_name": "Koitechtudios", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@koitechstudio", "publish_date": "2019-03-01", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-01", "readtime": "4.85", "claps": 1661, "voters": 73, "content": "How to install Metamask for buy KOI TokenAn easy way to interact with ERC20 token.KoitechtudiosFollowMar 1 \u00b7 5 min readWhat is Metamask?This plugin, in its most basic form, is a traditional portfolio where we can store our cryptoactives; We can send them, receive them, among others, without neglecting security.Metamask is mostly used as DApps where, due to the architecture of these applications, it is about fulfilling the requirements to perform different activities. In this tutorial we will learn how to use Metamask for the purchase of the Token KOI.Metamask is a plugin, this means that it is an extension that we will install in our browser. This plugin works for Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Brave; in the latter comes installed by defaultDownload and Install MetamaskTo begin we must go to https://metamask.io/To download our extension or add-on, just select the corresponding option. For the purposes of this tutorial we will click on Get Firefox ADDOM.This brings us to the Firefox Add-ons. To continue, we just have to select Add to Firefox and wait for the installation to complete.Will appear the window to grant permissions to Metamask, you must add permissions.Once finished, we will find the Metamask icon in the top menu of our Firefox browser.From this icon we will access our Metamask portfolio whenever we want. So, to start, we\u2019re going to click on it..To continue, we select Accept or Continue.In this step we will create a password to access Metamask and that our funds are not compromised by third parties. This password is stored locally, that is; Metamask does not save passwords on its servers.Metamask generated a unique account image.We will find a warning that, once we start, every website we visit may find that we use Metamask. Be careful here: this does not compromise the security of our funds. It only implies that the web is synchronized with your wallet automatically.Save secret Backup Phrase. Here we will place the 12 recovery words as well.Once created, we will see our recovery phrase, this generated phrase is not stored anywhere, so it is our crucial duty to protect it.We have finished creating our portfolio and are ready to receive funds.You can personalize your portfolio by clicking on the account and the word edit.Buying Koi TokenMetamask, as we mentioned at the beginning, is an Ethereum wallet, where we will store either ether or tokens created in the Ethereum network.To begin with, we need to receive funds, so we will need the address of our portfolio. To obtain this address, we will click on the 3 points that are next to the name of our account.Located the Metamask icon to obtain the address of our portfolio, we will click on the name of the account and voila, the address of our portfolio is copied to the clipboard. In this way we can share our address to receive funds.Once copied to your clipboard the address of your Metamask wallet, you can go to your EHT account and recharge it.In case of not having funds in Metamask a message of insufficient funds will appear at the time of purchase.We go to www.koitechstudios.com and place the button \u201cKOI purchase\u201d. The KOI token network will be recognized by the use of Metamask.Having already accepted the conditions, it will automatically open our Metamask portfolio. Here we will be told that we must sign a transaction where our account will be created within the platform. We only need to select Conect to sign our transactionThis section is where the purchase is selected and, obviously, we will need funds in ETH to be able to pay the cost of the KOI currency.Enter the amount of KOI coins we want to buy and press the Contribute button.By selecting, we will automatically open Metamask.In this step you will confirm the purchase of our KOI. As you can see, Metamask works as a bridge between the DApps and our ETH portfolio.In this way we have already used our Metamask portfolio to buy KOI.Finally we just have to Confirm our purchase.

We presented it at Devcon4 in Prague Czech Republic, as well as at Hi-Ether Con in Tokyo Japan!The Metamask Labs team with the organizers of Hi-EtherThe Metamask Labs team presenting At DevconIVLight Client vs Full NodeA node is a device that connects to a blockchain network. Any computer connected to the Ethereum network can be referred to as a node. A Full Node is a device that verifies and enforces all of the rules of the blockchain, while a Light Client is referencing a trusted Full Node\u2019s copy of the blockchain. This is important because you can interact on the blockchain without downloading an entire copy of the blockchain.Running a Full Node is hardInteracting with the Ethereum blockchain requires access to a node to retrieve the latest data. The blockchain is huge, and running a Full Node is very resource intensive. Already requiring a lot of memory and storage, the blockchain only continues to expand by the minute. An average user does not have the gigabytes of memory and storage space to spare.A Light Client allows for as little verification as possible while remaining secure and fully capable of interacting with DApps and using the Ethereum network. Light clients do not store the entire copy of the blockchain, only specific elements of the blockchain that they need to operate. They store these elements to execute tasks and functions, such as sending and receiving funds. Consequently, they are required to connect to and query Full Nodes.VerificationWhen you sync your full node to the blockchain you are verifying the proof of work consensus. This is the solution to difficult puzzles, one for each block, which get more or less difficult in order to keep the block time consistent. Syncing takes a lot of time because you have to start all the way at the genesis block down to the next, verifying it down the line millions of times. Each subsequent block carries the accumulation of state changes and transitions over time. In our experience, it can take anywhere from a couple hours to a few days to sync a Full Node. It uses a significant amount of IOs and needs a solid state drive at the very least. Even if you are using an implementation that starts from a checkpoint block then it\u2019s still difficult to discover useful p2p nodes you\u2019re able to fetch data from. Syncing state takes a long time due to network issues and having to process every block to reconstruct the state. As a result among other factors, users are forced to rely on centralized infrastructures.Full nodes and Light Clients both sync blocks. However, Full Nodes hold the whole recent state (everyone\u2019s account balance and storage info) whereas Light Clients hold specific portions of the state for those accounts and transactions that they care about. Full nodes validate state transitions by using the state it currently holds and when a new block arrives, new transactions are factored in the block and generates a new state.Simply put, a Full Node makes sure everything matches up and is validated. Conversely, a Light Client is unable to undergo the same validation process as it lacks the recent state. However, assuming it has a reliable source for the latest block header, it can ask for elements of the state \u2014 like account balance or a smart contract \u2014 from Full Nodes.We need options for accessMost applications access blockchain data through a small handful of providers, creating silos of information where data is redundant but not highly available. Unchecked, this trend will continue towards centralization. Not only does it require a great deal of trust but it isn\u2019t the peer to peer experience that Ethereum embraces. Not to mention the cost of these providers to maintain this information distribution.Light clients sound great \u2014 what\u2019s the problem?There are too many Light Clients per Full Nodes. Let\u2019s say there are 10,000 discoverable online/active Full Ethereum Nodes. If we were to turn all Metamask users (About 1.5 million) into Light Clients it would overwhelm them very quickly. The merkle tree that holds all accounts and token balances of Ethereum has over 200 million tree nodes at a given block. Every new block adds thousands of new ones that have to be reconstructed and shared. The volume would be like half time at a world cup concession stand. The Full Nodes being the people serving and the light nodes being the sea of people so eager to request and get what they want. It would be madness and the Full Nodes would not be able to keep up with the demand.Enter Mustekala \u2014 the Light Client that seeds data!As it stands today Light Clients are leechers of data and information. But what if Light Clients could share the data it has also? They don\u2019t have all the data that a Full Nodes has but what if they could share the data that they do have to other Light Clients? This would distribute the load on Full Nodes while also making information readily available to everyone.MetaMask\u2019s solution is to take and share slices of the merkle tree. These are essentially neighborhoods around your account which include other accounts. The same slicing principle applies to smart contract data as well. It\u2019s understandable that token holders will be concerned about their key-value inside the storage data, which could be referenced and hence shared using the same slice taxonomy. This would bring down the amount of tree nodes shared from 200 million to about 65 thousand instead. Each slice is about the size of a picture (128KB) which is manageable to deal with in comparison to the multiple GBs of storage required from the Full Node experience.So now we have the idea that Light Clients are going to be serving information to each other. What does that look like? Each dot represents a computer and the lines represent connections to other computers. Eventually you will have a large well connected graph. In a p2p network a great way of distributing information is gossiping which is taking information that is shared with you and then passing it along to your neighbors. This works especially well when everyone is interested in the data that you are sharing. For instance, there is high demand for information on the latest block.A p2p networkSo what would it look like if we are gossiping slices of the blockchain instead? If you are looking up an account or token balance you have to get the slice associated with it. You would have to find others in the network who are looking for that also. You can form p2p neighborhoods, and the latest version of the slice can be passed between that network as well.Gossiping slicesHow do we plan to do this?Mustekala offers an alternative approach to a light client solution by using the libp2p network stack. This is the same technology that powers IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to make Ethereum data available as ultra-light elements that can be retrieved based on its content, not its location. This is made possible by a p2p overlay network that we created called \u201cKitsunet\u201d. Your MetaMask client can be one of many participants in a massive mesh that helps make blockchain data available to all types of devices, from phones to browsers, IoT hardware, and even miners. The possibilities have expanded in exciting ways!ConclusionUsers depend on MetaMask to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. From DApps, to tokens, to transferring ETH directly, but Metamask and other tools currently rely on centralized infrastructures. This was instrumental for bootstrapping the Ethereum ecosystem, but this breaks the premise of decentralization and we can now do better.The goal of the Mustekala Light Client is toHave native browser support for ease of use.Be fast: Ready to be used in seconds.Seed its data to other users for better distributed networks.Learn more about Mustekala on GithubStay up to date on TwitterThanks for reading and stay tuned! @JSONLEE3", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Technology", "Distributed Ledgers"]}, {"title": "Adding Tokens to Metamask", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hellogold/adding-tokens-to-metamask-60b2fedd5bd9?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dave Appleton", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Dave_Appleton", "publish_date": "2017-08-31", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-30", "readtime": "2.08", "claps": 686, "voters": 77, "content": "Adding Tokens to MetamaskWe have a PR in but it could take a whileDave AppletonFollowAug 31, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readMetamask is a really cool wallet built as a chrome extension.Metamask \u201csent ether\u201d tabYou will notice when you see your balance that there is also a tab for tokens.MetaMask try to keep up with the incessant release of new tokens.

It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.\u2026 is what they say in their official website https://metamask.io/. However, to understand what this statement really means, you need to first understand what each of these words mean. I mean what is \u201cdistributed web\u201d and what really is \u201cdistributed web of tomorrow\u201d?. What is Ethereum dApp and a Ethereum node? This article will try to briefly demystify each of this word and introduce a tool called MetaMask, which will let you really explore the distributed web of tomorrow.Distributed Web (left) vs Centralized Web (right)First of all, lets start with identifying what distributed web is. Most of the things you see on your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox or Opera.), including this article, comes from a computer that sits in a chilled room within a large data center somewhere. Many little computers and phones, which we often call clients, connect to the large central server to download bits of information that they need. This is how the modern web works. We call this the Centralized Web, because, you guessed it, all the data sits somewhere in a central location. However, some groups of people thought that having one large entity that stores, manages and even owns data is not very comfortable and often not safe. Instead, people decided to build a network where everyone can own and share a bit of data with everyone else in the network. So, instead of computers and phones connecting to a single server to download bits of information they need, they connect to many people who own smaller bits of information they need. And once they receive the information, they also begin to share it with others who need the same information. We call this the Distributed Web.Napster: Distributed web built for sharing songs.There have been many famous applications of distributed web. The two most well-known examples are Napster and Torrent. Napster is a distributed web specifically built to share songs between its users. It has no central server that stores the songs, and users download and upload songs that they want and that they own. Similarly, Torrent is a distributed web specifically built to share all types of files between its users.Blockchain essentially is a distributed web, similar to Napster or Torrent, built to serve a different purpose. Blockchain is not a coin or some currency. It actually is a distributed web to log, store and share secure, verified and unmodifiable transactions. These transactions can include any type of actions between two entities. For example, in the case of bitcoin, transferring bitcoin between user A and user B can be stored in a blockchain. As you can see blockchain can store and share any type of data that needs security. Bitcoin is basically one application of blockchain technology.Ethereum Project: https://www.ethereum.org/Ethereum is a type of blockchain that is built for applications that need to store data or run programs in the distributed web. It is the \u201cdistributed web of tomorrow\u201d. Unlike bitcoin, Napster or Torrent, it can actually store data in the form of a computer program called smart contract. Computer owners can be part of the Ethereum network, obtain and share the smart contract and receive reward (Ethers) for running the smart contract. Once your computer is part of the Ethereum network, running smart contracts and sharing it with others, it is now a Ethereum Node.Ethereum allows programmers to write apps that can run on many people\u2019s computers. Such type of apps are called dApps, which stands for distributed applications. dApps are being built as we speak and it is slowly gaining more traction. So, we will soon find out what type of applications are a perfect fit as dApps and I will cover more examples of dApps on a separate article.Metamask Logo.Now, let\u2019s get back to MetaMask.MetaMask (https://metamask.io/) is a browser extensions that lets you run dApps without being part of the Ethereum network as a Ethereum Node. Instead, it lets you connect to another Ethereum Node called INFURA (https://infura.io/) and run smart contracts on that Node. MetaMask manages your Ethereum wallet, which contains your Ethers (or money), and allows you to send and receive Ethers through a dApp of interest. It is a pretty neat tool.How to install MetaMask.MetaMaskEthereum Browser Extensionchrome.google.comMetaMask is a simple browser extension that can run on many browsers. To install, you first visit the following link above and install the browser extension with the cute 3D fox image. Once installed, you see a fox on the right top of your browser. Once you click on it, you can now accept their terms of use as seen below.MetaMask. Terms of use.Now you can create a new Ethereum account to send and receive Ether and also to run dApps. After creating an account, you get a list of 12 words that can be used to retrieve your account when you forget your password.

You can use the main network, which will use real Ethers that cost REAL money, or try some dApps out on test networks such as Ropsten Test Network.Let\u2019s select Ropsten Test Network and visit https://faucet.metamask.io/. This site will give you free Ether to use on the Ropsten Test Network. After clicking on request 1 free ether, you will find that your account now has 1 ether to use for any dApps! (Again, this is not real ether, think of it as monopoly money.)Obtain free Ether.Now you can use this to run dApps that exist online. You can search for Ropsten dApps for the latest list of dApps to test. Once you feel pretty comfortable with dApps, you can then start running dApps on the main Ethereum network. You should be VERY VERY careful that you are now spending real Ether. I will try to cover in a separate article some cool dApps that run on both types of network.I hope you now have a brief understanding of what distributed web, blockchain, Ethereum, and dApps are and how you can play around with them using MetaMask.

This is why the MetaMask team welcomes contributions and input from the broader community.Recently, we have received a number of suggestions from the community regarding support for new blockchains. Currently, MetaMask users are able to access the Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Kovan, and Rinkeby test networks through an easy network drop-down UI. While users are able to connect to other networks by specifying an RPC URL, it does require manual input and doesn\u2019t persist if a user connects to a different custom RPC.Because MetaMask is able to support some custom networks, various teams working on Ethereum RPC compatible chains have requested that MetaMask add menu options to gain easy and automatic access to their own networks in the network selection drop-down. This would be an easy UI implementation, but the politics of maintaining a comprehensive list of blockchains would quickly distract us from iterating on the core product for our users. Rather than maintaining a list of networks, we are more interested in pursuing a generalized solution that allows users to opt into the networks that they prefer, without involving the MetaMask team! Fortunately, the path for this generalized solution is already being paved:In the pursuit of improved privacy and security, the MetaMask team has suggested EIP 1102 as a way to make web3 browser users undetectable while browsing the web, until a user deliberately reveals themselves. This initial sign-in API lays the groundwork for other sign-in options, including different accounts on different sites, and eventually even specific networks per application.Once these features are implemented, MetaMask will be able to work on maintaining simultaneous network connections, a feature that must exist if MetaMask is to enable cross-chain applications. Right now, a site that requests access to one network through MetaMask changes the network for all other sites, but we are already planning to change this behavior. Ideally, MetaMask should allow different sites to connect to their own sets of networks simultaneously.In the meanwhile, any contributor could quickly add support for more networks via our \u201cCustom RPC\u201d option by adding support for EIP 155, as documented in this issue (#1820). This feature should be straightforward to add without adding new providers to our menu, making it a simple and uncontroversial change to make.As we move forward into a multiple-network world, our team will continue iterating on these features. We want to facilitate the growth of the ecosystem, but we want to do it in a general way that keeps MetaMask useful for any user, without having to become arbiters of what networks receive a listing. Because our current vision is reliant on this ongoing series of features, it is difficult to estimate a concrete timeline, but as always, the best way to push the conversation forward is to collaborate with us on our github by commenting and proposing your ideas on the various issues that were linked throughout the article.Thanks to Dan Finlay, Bobby Dresser, and Jenny Pollack.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Metamask"]}, {"title": "HOW TO ADD-ON METAMASK TO MY GOOGLE CHROME AND IMPORT MY MEW ACCOUNT INTO METAMASK", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@winco/how-to-add-on-metamask-to-my-google-chrome-and-import-my-mew-account-into-metamask-f2ab71ba8332?source=search_post", "author_name": "Winco", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@winco", "publish_date": "2018-05-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-30", "readtime": "2.40", "claps": 2407, "voters": 49, "content": "HOW TO ADD-ON METAMASK TO MY GOOGLE CHROME AND IMPORT MY MEW ACCOUNT INTO METAMASKWincoFollowMay 23, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readFirst, you need to download the METAMASK add-on by going onto their website and following their instructions for \u201cGET CHROME EXTENTION\u201dOnce you click on GET CHROME EXTENTION this is what you should be seeing:(Click on the blue button) + Use it on Google Chrome.Then \u2018Add Extension\u2019 and you should see on the image below.

Frontend developers can think of it like a public, distributed database they can access using an API.You can build fully functional frontend web applications with integrated signon, lambda functions, and storage, just by using the Ethereum blockchain as your backend! It\u2019s like a public, distributed version of AWS or Google Cloud. The most popular API for working with Ethereum today is provided by Metamask, a browser extension.At Crowdbotics, we help people build blockchain software, Dapps, and Smart Contracts \u2014 among other things \u2014 and we get to see firsthand all the interesting ways people are applying blockchain technology to real-world problems.Our goal at Crowdbotics is to help all sorts of people build complex software applications better and faster. That\u2019s why we\u2019re providing this complete guide on building Ethereum DApps with MetaMask.We will be covering the following topics:What is MetaMask?How to get MetaMaskFunding MetaMask with EtherWhat is Blockchain?What is the Ethereum blockchain?Decentralized Applications (DApps)Ethereum EcosystemWeb3 \u2014 Ethereum Javascript APIDetecting MetaMask and handling possible error statesAvoiding Race Conditions with onLoad()Event listeners vs polling the interfaceWhat is MetaMask?MetaMask is a browser extension that allows web applications to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. For users, it works as an Ethereum wallet, allowing them to store and send any standard Ethereum-compatible tokens (so-called ERC-20 tokens).For developers, it allows you to design and run Ethereum DApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node (which is what developers had to do before Metamask was available). MetaMask talks to the Ethereum blockchain for your web application.Metamask includes a secure sign-on process, providing a user interface to manage your identities on different sites and sign blockchain transactions. It is easy to use on almost every browser.Figure 1. MetaMask on Chrome.Getting MetaMaskTo use MetaMask, you will need to install it in your browser. You can choose between Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera or Brave. In our case, we will be using Google Chrome browser. As a first step we need to go to the Chrome extension web store, and download the MetaMask extension. Once you are at the Chrome web store, just click on \u201cAdd to Chrome \u201d to add the MetaMask extension into your browser. Then click on \u201cAdd Extension\u201d and immediately you will see the icon of MetaMask on the right part of the navbar navigation of your Chrome browser.Figure 2. MetaMask is added to Chrome.When MetaMask is installed in your browser, you will see an icon at the same level of the address bar on your browser. You should select the icon and proceed with login:Figure 3. MetaMask icon will appear on the right side of the address bar.Before Logging in you should accept Terms of use, Privacy notice and Phishing Warning. Scroll inside the panel in order to have the accept button available. When you accept each one, MetaMask login will appear.Figure 4. Accept Terms of use, Privacy notice and Phishing Warning.Figure 5. Insert a password and save the 12 words in a safe place.Funding MetaMask with EtherNow, we will learn how we can get some test Ether for our MetaMask. Real Ether cost money and have to be purchased on a site like Coinbase, but test Ether are available for free. First, you need to log in to your MetaMask account and then you should change your Network by clicking on \u201cMain Network\u201d that is located on the left side of the panel, and finally select \u201cRopsten Test Network\u201d.Figure 6. On the top-left side of panel you will see a dropdown to change Network.Be sure to Verify that you are on the correct Network. Next click on the \u201cBUY\u201d button. A panel will appear called \u201cBUY ETH\u201d, finally click on the \u201cRopsten Test Faucet\u201d button.Figure 7. Buying 1ETH. Click on \u201cBuy\u201d button, then you click on \u201cRopsten test Faucet\u201d button.When you click on \u201cRopsten Test Faucet\u201d, you will be redirected to https://faucet.metamask.io/. There, you can click on the green button to \u201crequest 1 ether from faucet\u201d, wait for a few seconds and you will receive an address transaction, which is actually a confirmation. Now click on the MetaMask icon and verify your 1ETH for testing purposes.Figure 8. MetaMask Ether Faucet view (https://faucet.metamask.io/).Figure 9. Click on MetaMask icon to see your balance.What is Blockchain?There are several definitions regarding \u201cBlockchain\u201d. We\u2019ll share just one:\u201cBlockchain technology\u2019 means distributed ledger technology that uses a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless. The data on the ledger is protected with cryptography, is immutable and auditable and provides an uncensored truth\u201dOn a blockchain, the data is decentralized; it\u2019s distributed across every device connected to the blockchain. It\u2019s a peer for which anyone can set up a node that replicates the necessary data for all nodes to reach an agreement and be compensated by users and app developers. This allows for user data to remain private and apps to be decentralized.Figure 10. Blockchains are implemented on a peer-to-peer network of nodes, from https://www.ethereum.org/What are Decentralized Applications (DApps)?Decentralized applications are similar to conventional web applications, but that run on blockchain. While frontend web applications use APIs to interact with servers and databases, Dapps use Smart Contract interfaces to interact with the blockchain.The code of a Dapp is client-side code (usually Javascript), running in a browser.The backend of a Dapp is one or more Smart Contracts deployed on a blockchain.Typically, to use a Smart Contract , you pay with cryptographic tokens like ETH rather than (for example) AWS or Google Cloud Credits.Ethereum EcosystemDecentralized platform that runs smart contracts.Provides developers with a foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language.Works on peer-to-peer network protocols where each blockchain database is maintained and managed by multiple nodes.Web3 \u2014 Ethereum Javascript APIA collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node, using a HTTP or IPC connection.Use it to communicate with an Ethereum node or transact with a smart contract deployed on the blockchain from inside a JavaScript or web application.The MetaMask extension exposes the web3 API by an injected web3 object which you can access via JavaScript and does not support most synchronous web3 API methods.MetaMask and error state handlingWe will use web3 JS library and conditionals to manage error states. We have four cases:Figure 11. Error state handling diagramIf MetaMask is not installedIf MetaMask is installed but it is lockedIf MetaMask is installed and unlocked and it doesn\u2019t have sufficient balance to carry out a transactionIf you have a MetaMask transaction, but reject the transaction.CASE 1: To verify if MetaMask is installed or not.function isInstalled() {   if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined'){      console.log('MetaMask is installed')   }    else{      console.log('MetaMask is not installed')   }}CASE 2: To verify if MetaMask is locked or not.function isLocked() {   web3.eth.getAccounts(function(err, accounts){      if (err != null) {         console.log(err)      }      else if (accounts.length === 0) {         console.log('MetaMask is locked')      }      else {         console.log('MetaMask is unlocked')      }   });}CASE 3: To verify if MetaMask has balance or notfunction checkBalance() {   tokenInst.balanceOf(      web3.eth.accounts[0],       function (error, result) {      if (!error && result) {         var balance = result.c[0];         if (balance < balanceNeeded * (100000000)) {            console.log('MetaMask shows insufficient balance')            return false;         }         console.log('MetaMask shows sufficient balance')         // Include here your transaction function here      }      else {         console.error(error);      }      return false;   });}CASE 4: If you have a MetaMask transaction, but reject the transaction.Figure 12.

See an example:Polling the Interface using an interval to check for account changes. This is the way that the Metamask provider recommends for avoiding the refreshing of page to see UI changes. Click here to see more.var account = web3.eth.accounts[0];var accountInterval = setInterval(function() {  if (web3.eth.accounts[0] !== account) {    account = web3.eth.accounts[0];    updateInterface();  }}, 100);Using web3 version 1.0.0, the MetaMask provider exposes an \u201cupdate\u201d event listener.web3.currentProvider.publicConfigStore.on('update', callback);Your callback will be passed an object which contains {selectedAddress, networkVersion}. You can modify the interface according to those attributes change or update.To select event listeners is a better option than polling because you will improve performance, \u201c.on('update')\u201d is triggered without needing to loop.ConclusionAs more people are becoming familiar with the technology, the creative potential for DApps continues to snowball.MetaMask is one tool making development of this technology more accessible, and they are updating with new features all the time.MetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.Among other things, MetaMask is developing new ways to prevent possible attacks.

But building for such a broad audience is hard! That\u2019s why we plan to introduce *opt-in* metrics to help understand what our users find challenging and what needs to improve. We\u2019ll NEVER collect addresses, keys, transactions, balances, personal information, or IP addresses, and allowing these metrics to run in your extension will be 100% opt-in.Layer 2 Scaling ResearchThere are some exciting projects out there to make the Ethereum blockchain cheaper and faster to use. We\u2019re exploring how to best integrate Layer 2 solutions into MetaMask to encourage this important work across the ecosystem and help get it in the hands of users quickly.Thank You!We couldn\u2019t have done any of this without the incredible support of our community.If you have a couple minutes, we\u2019d love your feedback on MetaMask! Fill out this user survey and you may win some free MetaMask swag \ud83e\udd8aIf you have any questions or suggestions, you can always reach out to us directly or file an issue on our Github.Keep an eye out for our mobile browser \u2014 you can keep up on our Medium for regular updates, or follow us on Twitter!Disclaimer: The views expressed by the author above do not necessarily represent the views of Consensys AG.

Network with a Metamask (any web3 browser) and PARETO license.Eric Lamison-WhiteFollowMar 28, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readTo access the Pareto Network you need three things:An Ethereum WalletPARETO tokens in the Ethereum WalletMetamask or any web3 enabled browser.Fortunately, this can be reduced to two prerequisites as all web3-enabled browsers have Ethereum wallets in them. Wallets contain at least one Ethereum address.PARETO tokens can be purchased and transferred to your Ethereum wallet on any of the following exchanges:KucoinIdexForkDeltaEtherDeltaweb3 in this context refers to a series of protocols that allow access and interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is a shared database and computational resource which lowers the cost of doing business. We do not use or store usernames, passwords, access tokens or any of your cryptoassets.The Pareto Network uses web3 protocols to distinguish users, based on their unique Ethereum address, and it only follows the Ethereum addresses which contain PARETO tokens in them.Therefore, all owners of PARETO are users of the Pareto Network. In that vein, accessing the Pareto Network is more akin to claiming your already existing user account. User accounts are merely Ethereum addresses which at one point held any PARETO tokens, and to access the network a user must prove they own the address by signing it.We use web3-enabled browsers to streamline the signing process with one click. The following web3-enabled browsers are a subset of ones available:DesktopGoogle Chrome with Metamask extensionFirefox with Metamask extensionBrave with Metamask extensionMistMobileiOS : TrustAndroid: TrustAlthough this method may seem esoteric, this is the same functionality that idex.market, EtherDelta and other decentralized exchanges use to enable access, as well as games like Cryptokitties.Now that you have a web3-enabled browser, you need your PARETO balance in the wallet. Consider IMPORTING your prior wallet, instead of transferring your tokens. As transferring will have a negative impact on your PARETO Score and ranking.Afterwards, make sure your wallet is unlocked and continue to https://www.pareto.network and click the ACCESS button.This will prompt you to sign a message, and our server will verify the signature.One click signing prompt.For users with rigorous cold storage techniques, we will be implementing manual signing in the future. (Cold storage refers to offline, physically difficulty storage of cryptoassets, as an extra layer of security.) Signing addresses does not require an internet connection, but the signed result will need to be transmitted to the Pareto Network server initially.If you would like to authenticate a different address, then click the RESET button on the web page to de-authenticate the current Ethereum address, switch your web3 browser to the desired Ethereum address and the ACCESS button should have re-appeared in the Pareto Network web application.User Interfaces for Pareto access will become simpler and easier to usePareto Network and its partners will be implementing a variety of user friendly improvements to mask more of the Wallet/Address/Token technology and streamline access to the Pareto Network. This will make the platform accessible for an increasingly broader audience.In the mean time, consumers that are willing to dive in to the technology have an advantage.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Pareto Network", "Web3", "Ethereum Wallet", "Pareto Token"]}, {"title": "Connecting your MetaMask account to IDEX", "post_link": "https://medium.com/idex/connecting-your-metamask-account-to-idex-a929d6215334?source=search_post", "author_name": "Philip Wearn", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@philipwearn", "publish_date": "2017-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "1.72", "claps": 290, "voters": 39, "content": "Connecting your MetaMask account to IDEXPhilip WearnFollowNov 10, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readHere\u2019s how to connect your wallet through MetaMask on IDEX.Step 1 \u2014 Install MetaMaskInstall MetaMask in your browser and set it up.Step 2 \u2014 Visit IDEXGo to https://idex.market.

We\u2019ve wanted to do this for a long time, and have finally scaled up our team up to the point where we can more comfortably communicate while continuing to deliver the product that you know and love.In this monthly newsletter we\u2019re going to try to keep you abreast of our latest features, side projects, and even a few bonus things we\u2019re excited to share. We hope this will help our community gain better insight into our continual efforts to improve the ecosystem, and maybe even get a better sense of how to participate. Enjoy!General AnnouncementsIn the past couple weeks we\u2019ve received several reports of a common new phishing strategy: compromised sites, most hosted on Cloudflare, are imitating the MetaMask UI to ask for a seed phrase. To help keep our users safe, we\u2019re pushing a one-time notice that describes what to look out for. Remember, MetaMask will never spontaneously ask for your seed phrase. (#4566)We\u2019re preparing to make a breaking change that has implications for all dapp integrations. Right now, when a user switches networks, MetaMask forces a page reload for any app that has interacted with the web3 API. Dapps have come a long way, and this hand-holding is no longer necessary. We\u2019ll soon suggest all dapps poll to monitor their users\u2019 network status and update as they see fit. You can read more about this change here.Development \u2014 What\u2019s New?Extension v4.8.0 is out, with some awesome fixes to improve usability and more steady progress towards our new UI.Some users have reported issues with their extension storage, where account nicknames are forgotten or transaction history clears spontaneously. This was traced to an issue in a background persistence process that stopped writing successfully after prolonged use. 4.8.0 contains a patch and we hope to see storage issues decrease significantly. (#4570)To fix an issue where some transactions get stuck in an \u201capproved\u201d state without being submitted to the blockchain, we\u2019ve updated our nonce error handling. (#4557)Our internationalization implementation was incompatible with Brave\u2019s i18n support, throwing errors that could prevent the extension from loading. These errors are now handled more gracefully, so Brave users who were seeing a blank MetaMask should have that fixed soon. (#4524)We\u2019re still hard at work on the Beta UI! To give it a try, click the menu in the top-right and select \u201cTry Beta.\u201dIn the past couple weeks, we\u2019ve shipped several patches that bring it closer to full feature parity with the standard UI in a much smoother interface:Updates to unlock screen, account UI & custom token views (#4190, #4507, #4445, #4591)Cosmetic fixes, including account import, handling extra long token names, updating alert modals. (#4418, #4423, #4428)Other bug fixes include:Fix account reset for custom RPC providers (#4523)Prevent sending to Ganache default accounts on Mainnet (#4288)Prevent memory leak on importing empty private key (#4513)Fix gas adjustment (#4513)Inside the Den \u2014 What\u2019s next?GABAWe\u2019ve begun a re-implementation of our controller layer as a standalone package. This modular approach will separate UI development from backend changes and allow each to iterate quickly and independently. The new controller engine, codenamed \u201cGABA\u201d, can also serve as a MetaMask-agnostic resource for developers to compose their own data models & signing interfaces. Read more here. (#4991)Labs / MustekalaMetaMask Labs is hard at work laying the foundation for a browser-based Ethereum light client, which aims to help reduce the ecosystem\u2019s reliance on JSON/RPC and make on-chain data available to a peer network. This month our team is developing a block explorer proof of concept. Try it out by running a simple block explorer in your localhost, connect to kitsunet (the network of the fox), and obtain a synchronized part of the ethereum data from nodes all over the mesh.To learn more about this project take a peek at the architecture description and stay tuned for more updates next month!Meet our new teammates!MetaMask has been experiencing exciting growth this year to date. In the past month we\u2019ve added five new team members who are taking MetaMask to new heights!Paul Bouchon is a self described JavaScript nerd who\u2019s been taking care of the Dojo web framework for the past decade. He loves contributing to open source software, and has already gotten EIP 1102 finalized, and begun converting portions of MetaMask to TypeScript, to add higher guarantees that we don\u2019t break functionality!Jenny Pollack formerly worked on the OAuth2.0 implementation with the Exchange Core Auth team at Microsoft. She\u2019s bringing that experience to MetaMask, combined with a passion for UBI, to help us make the decentralized dream as easy as the old web.William Morriss joins us from Snap, Inc. where he worked on Memories and messaging. He\u2019ll be focusing on mobile development at MetaMask and happens to be a master boardgame player.Bobby Dresser previously helped the uPort team refine their development process, and is now helping MetaMask do the same. With his help, we\u2019ve cut our number of high-priority issues in half, doubling our focus on the things that matter most to our users.Bruno Barbieri first caught our attention by submitting a pull request to MetaMask! The speed he did it with, along with the test-driven development he used, let us know he had some skills. Before his first day on the job, he had a working proof of concept that completely blew us away, and we\u2019ll hopefully share it soon\u2026Dmitry Ryajov has spent the past year and a half working on the IPFS project.

Imagine a system where voting on the future state of the world can be done from the comfort of your home. Imagine a place where there are no illusions of what is going on, where the open community comes first.MetaMask is your gateway into this world of decentralized applications , or DApps , on the Ethereum blockchain!Why use MetaMask? MetaMask is an easily accessible way to access the blockchain network through a user friendly interface. No more setting up your own node on your local machine to interact with the blockchain , a Chrome extension is all you need!MetaMask is available from the Chrome Web Store. With a couple of clicks, you can get MetaMask up and running on your browser!Getting started using MetaMaskMetaMask is a Google Chrome extension that is easily accessible from the Chrome Web Store.LET\u2019S TALK PERMISSIONSBefore we dive in, let\u2019s address a few issues concerning the installation permissions. An extension that can \u201cread and change all your data on the websites you visit\u201d would make most reasonable people nervous! In order for MetaMask to enable DApps to access the blockchain, MetaMask injects a web3 Javascript object into each page. The extension is not changing the website, it is simply giving it access to the network in order to function properly. Some users have found that making an extra Chrome profile allows them to Sandbox extensions, so if you want maximum security, that\u2019s always an option.Getting StartedHere, we\u2019ll walk through a few of MetaMask\u2019s key features, specifically regarding transactions and confirmation of transactions requested by DApps.SETTING UP YOUR ACCOUNTWhen you first create a vault, you will be prompted to save a certain number of seed words. These words can be used by MetaMask to regenerate your vault if need be, as well as enabling the creation of new wallets within your vault.Store these seed words somewhere safe! Although MetaMask gives you the option to see your seed words, we recommend storing your seed words physically in the event that the MetaMask software fails. MetaMask is still in its development stage, so we don\u2019t recommend storing large amounts of ETH in your MetamMask wallets just yet.THE INTERFACEMoving forward, you should be taken to your first wallet, which looks something like this:The arrows corresponds to the following:Pink: This is your editable wallet nickname. Underneath is a portion of the public key, or the hexadecimal address that uniquely identifies your wallet.Teal: These buttons copy your wallet address to the clipboard and allow you to export your private keys.Red: This indicates the current network. Clicking it will open a drop down menu to switch to the Main Ethereum Network, the Morden Test Network, or your own network of choice.Green: This button will take you to a page that will allow you to switch accounts.Below the current wallet information is a list of outgoing transactions from the current wallet with relevant information. Clicking the transaction itself will link you to an etherscan page with more detailed information.Sending ether to another address is simple. MetaMask will help guard you against sending to invalid addresses, as well as initiating transactions that send more ether than the current wallet contains. Before a transaction is actually executed, a notification pops up allowing you to confirm the transaction and examine relevant details.Don\u2019t worry if you close the notification , the extension popup will prompt you to approve or reject any pending transactions the next time it\u2019s opened.Here, the accounts page shows an overview of your current wallets, a convenient button to copy wallet addresses, as well as the option to generate more wallets as needed.Final NotesWhile we encourage users to test out and play around with our software, please keep in mind that MetaMask is still in active development. With that in mind, we encourage users to refrain from handling large amounts of ether on the main Ethereum network using MetaMask. We recommend executing all testing or experimentation on the Morden Test Network or a local network of your choosing to mitigate these risks.Similarly, if you do find any bugs, have any feature requests, or would like to leave a comment, please contact us athelp@metamask.io or leave an issue in our MetaMask GitHub repository.We wish you the best in exploring the world of Ethereum and DApps using MetaMask. It\u2019s an exciting new frontier out there; we\u2019re happy to be the key that unlocks it for you!Further info:Download here: Chrome Web StoreContact us: help@metamask.io or hello@metamask.ioWebsite: metamask.ioGithub: https://github.com/MetaMask/hello", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Metamask"]}, {"title": "Why MetaMask and the new MetaMorph.pro exchange are a match made in heaven!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metamorphpro/why-metamask-and-the-new-metamorph-pro-exchange-are-a-match-made-in-heaven-fb1b384ba03e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Daniel Lew", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@metamorphpro", "publish_date": "2018-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-28", "readtime": "1.30", "claps": 1615, "voters": 33, "content": "Why MetaMask and the new MetaMorph.pro exchange are a match made in heaven!Daniel LewFollowNov 28, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readThe fear of losing digital assets is one of the main reasons why decentralized exchanges are becoming more popular. Leaving assets on a centralized exchange is convenient but comes with a dangerous trade-off \u2014 the exchange assumes all control of the assets. Exchanges being hacked are unfortunately something that have been a re-occurrence ever since cryptocurrencies started to become valuable.It is also not uncommon to see wallets being unavailable or down for maintenance on centralized exchanges when the price of certain assets spike, seemingly to retain control of the exchanges liquidity.MetaMask allows users to easily interact with the blockchain and decentralized exchanges such as MetaMorph.pro while staying in full control of their assets. MetaMorph.pro is a decentralized all-in-one platform to trade, exchange and manage cryptocurrencies.Once logged in, the transactions are processed by the platform and shown to the user with then/now price and other details. Using the platform is very easy and trading is done using the 0x protocol which means lower fees and less congestion on the blockchain while offering shared liquidity by using relayers. For every transaction made using MetaMorph.pro, a MetaMask window will simply pop up and ask for permission to execute the transaction on behalf of the user.There are currently NO fees during the beta version of MetaMorph.pro and it is very easy to import a MyEtherWallet with MetaMask and to start trading in moments using the platform with plug-n-play functionality \u2014 it doesn\u2019t get much easier than that. Oh yeah, the platform also has no withdrawal limits or require KYC.Click here to see why MetaMask and the new MetaMorph.pro exchange go hand-in-hand", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "Consensus", "0xproject", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Getting Started With Ethereum and Building Basic Dapp using Truffle, Metamask & Ganache-CLI", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@itsromiljain/getting-started-with-ethereum-and-building-basic-dapp-ebb681fb3748?source=search_post", "author_name": "Romil Jain", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@itsromiljain", "publish_date": "2018-02-04", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-17", "readtime": "8.13", "claps": 170, "voters": 31, "content": "Getting Started With Ethereum and Building Basic Dapp using Truffle, Metamask & Ganache-CLIRomil JainFollowFeb 4, 2018 \u00b7 9 min readNote \u2014 This article is updated with the latest version of Truffle, Solidity, Metamask, web3js, and Ganache-CLIEthereumWhat is EthereumEthereum is a decentralized network of computers/node; each node in the network executes some bytecode (i.e. Smart Contracts) and stores the resulting state in a blockchain. Due to the properties of the blockchain representing application state, this results in \u201capplications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference\u201d.Is Ethereum similar to Bitcoin?Well. sort of, but not really. The similarity is there in the sense that both use the blockchain, but that\u2019s where it ends. As Ethereum is not just a digital currency But It provides a platform to develop blockchain-based applications which features smart contracts, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and uses its currency called ether for peer-to-peer contracts.What is a smart contractA smart contract is a computer code running on top of a blockchain containing a set of rules under which the parties to that smart contract agree to interact with each other. If and when the pre-defined rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced. The platform on which it\u2019s executed gives this piece of code some properties such as immutability, deterministic operation, distributed & verifiable state, etc. The state managed by this code is stored, immutable, on a blockchain and anyone can double check that the current state is correct by replaying all of the transactions from the beginning of the chain.EVM \u2014 The Ethereum Virtual MachineEVM (or Ethereum virtual machine) is the Ethereum smart contracts byte-code execution environment. Every node in the network runs EVM. All the nodes execute all the transactions that point to smart contracts using EVM, so every node does the same calculations and stores the same values. Moreover, the EVM ensures programs do not have access to each other\u2019s state, ensuring communication can be established without any potential interference.Web3 & Technology StackAs we all know in the early \u201990s the World Wide Web (WWW) revolutionized the information. Since then, the Internet became only more mature & programmable and we saw the rise of the so-called Web2, which brought us social media and e-commerce platforms, revolutionizing social interactions, bringing producers and consumers of information, goods, and services closer together, and allowed us to enjoy P2P interactions on a global scale. But there was always a middleman: a platform acting as a trusted intermediary between A and B who did not know or trust each other. While these platforms have done an amazing job at creating a P2P economy, with an ever more sophisticated content discovery layer, they also dictate all rules of the transactions, and these platforms own all of our data.In this context, Blockchain seems to be a driving force of the next generation Internet, the Decentralized Web, or Web3 and gives rise to Decentralized Web Stack.Similar to building a normal web or mobile applications, creating a dApp (Decentralized Application) commonly requires a few things: computation, file storage, external data, monetization, and payments as depicted below.Web 3.0 Abstracted StackAs we would be progressing towards decentralized systems, this does not mean that we will get rid of centralized systems altogether. It seems to transition from client-server internet to the decentralized web will be gradual rather than radical. As the decentralized web stack is still maturing, the transition seems to be shifting from centralized to partially decentralized to fully decentralized.The shift from Centralized to Fully Decentralized AppsDeveloping a DApp. How to access Ethereum.An attempt to explain Ethereum from a developer\u2019s point of view.Current client-server webapp architecture at a very high levelCurrent Client Server Application ArchitectureThe web application is hosted on a hosting provider like AWS, Heroku or any other VPS. The client interacts with this one central application. Clients can be a browser, widget, curl command or other API consuming services. When a client makes a request via a web browser to the server, the server code implemented interacts with the database and/or cache for CRUD operation and serves the client.This is how an Ethereum Dapp looks like at a high level:Futuristic Decentralized Application ArchitectureIf one observes every client (browser) communicates with its own instance of the application. There is no central server to which all clients connect to. This means every person who wants to interact with a dapp (Decentralized Application) will need a full copy of the blockchain running on their computer/phone etc. That means, before you can use an application, you have to download the entire blockchain and then start using the application. This might sound ridiculous at first but it has the advantage of not relying on a single central server which might disappear tomorrow.Getting StartedBasic Dapp using Metamask, Truffle & GanacheBasic tools we need -Node Package Manager (npm) \u2014 NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages or modules.Ganache \u2014 Ganache (earlier TestRPC) is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development that developers can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests. It runs 100% locally and simulates a full Ethereum client but is much much faster making it ideal for testing and development. It comes in two flavor \u2014 Ganache (GUI) & Ganache-CLI.Truffle \u2014 Truffle is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Basically, it helps you deploy your contracts to the blockchain, swap old contracts for new ones (called a migration), and hook your front-end up to your deployed contractsMetaMask \u2014 MetaMask is an Ethereum light client and Chrome extension that lets users interact with the blockchain without downloading the whole blockchain. In other words, it allows you to interact with dApps in an ordinary Chrome browserFirst, we need to install our tools. Lets first install npm if you don\u2019t have one. Here are instructions on how to install it.Once npm is installed, we can use it to install ganache-cli, a Node.js Ethereum client that mimics a real Ethereum node.$ npm install -g ganache-cliNext, we need to install truffle$ npm install -g truffleand the last one, MetaMask Chrome plugin which you can find here.Start Ganache-CLI$ ganache-cliThis will start up the client and generate 10 accounts for you to use, each with 100 ETH.

Open MetaMask and follow the initial setup steps.Once MetaMask is set up, select the network menu in the upper-left. Then select \u201cLocalhost 8545\u201d as your network as shown below.Metamask connected to GanacheNext, add a couple of accounts to MetaMask by going to the colored circle at the right top -> Import Account, and then copying in a private key from the list printed out in your terminal when you started Ganache-CLI. In my case it is \u2014 0xc8763205e691a0e9f75c70a33c6f03d74a3eb4f5eabb3cc2df2e1418f5ae009a.Account 2 is from Ganache-CLIAs shown above, we can see the account 2 which is nothing but the first account displayed in the terminal after running ganache-cli.Our environment is now set up, and we are ready to create and deploy our dApp. Let\u2019s start by creating a new project directory and unbox the Truffle dApp with Webpack integrated. I\u2019m going to call my project ethereumdapp, but you can call yours whatever you\u2019d like.Initialize Truffle$ mkdir ethereumdapp$ cd ethereumdapp$ truffle unbox webpackDeploying Contracts and Running dAppTo deploy your contracts to ganache-cli run the following command:$ truffle compile$ truffle migrateOnce the migration is complete we can run our dApp. To run the dApp$ cd app$ npm run devOpen http://localhost:8080/ in the browserWe should see our dApp running and ready to use! If we switch the current MetaMask account to the first account generated by Ganache-CLI and refresh the page we should see balance is 10,000 META. Now we can send META to other accounts using the dApp interface.To check the transactions locally, we may install etherparty explorerInstall etherpartyAs we have already installed node and npm, the only thing to install is git. Here are the steps to install it. Once git is installed, Open a terminal and type the following$ git clone https://github.com/etherparty/explorerThis will clone the etherparty explorer to local directory explorer. Change to this directory$ cd explorernow let's start the explorer$ npm start> EthereumExplorer@0.1.0 start /Users/XXXX/explorer> http-server ./app -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1Starting up http-server, serving ./app on port: 8000Hit CTRL-C to stop the serverNavigate to http://localhost:8000/. You will see something like below.Now let's transfer some Metacoin (10 Metacoin) from ganache-cli account(Account 2) to metamask account(Account 1).Once the transaction is initiated, Metamask will show a notification like belowOn confirming the transaction, We can see Metacoin debited from account 2 and credited to account 1.Account 2Account 1We can validate the transaction in explorer also as shown below. Block#6 is the block created for this transaction.The complete code can be found here. In Part-2, we will create a simple notarized smart contract and showed both the ways to deploy it using the web3js library with Ganache-CLI and Truffle with Ganache-CLI.Please share your thoughts, feedback, comments, and clarifications.

It is mandatory to register for the whitelist and submit KYC info before you can invest.If this is all new to you, and you don\u2019t know what ETH is, click here to learn more.Once your MetaMask wallet is funded with ETH, investing in the tokenized real estate asset is a very easy process:1. InvestBuy digital shares of the property using ETH from MetaMask.2. Receive PoA-TokensProof-of-Asset (PoA) tokens represent all the economic benefits of ownership. You will receive the tokens after sending ETH from MetaMask. If the property is not completely funded, you will be able to reclaim the ETH you contributed. Read a full breakdown of Brickblock\u2019s token structure here.3. Earn passive incomeYour PoA tokens generate passive monthly income from the profits generated by the real estate asset. Your share of the profits will be sent to your Ethereum (MetaMask) address.Before you investThere are a few necessary requirements before you can participate in the tokenized real estate sale:First, you need to set up a MetaMask (ERC-20 compatible) wallet. This is where you will invest your ETH from and where you will receive your Proof-of-Asset (PoA) tokens.Important: MetaMask is both an ETH wallet and Ethereum blockchain browser. You must have MetaMask to connect to Brickblock\u2019s smart contract platform. We therefore highly recommend using MetaMask as your ETH wallet. We have created a tutorial for how to do this here.Register for the tokenized real estate asset sale whitelist. Have your passport and camera ready. Register here.Get ETH (Ether). Choose an exchange where you will purchase ETH. We provide some of the most popular options in the next section.The final step is transferring your ETH from the exchange to your MetaMask wallet.Read our tutorial for setting up a MetaMask wallet here.We break down steps 3 and 4 in more details below. Once you\u2019ve completed all four steps, you\u2019re ready to participate in the sale!Choosing an exchange to buy ETHAs mentioned above, at the moment, the only way to invest through Brickblock\u2019s smart contract platform is with ETH. The most common way to obtain ETH is to buy it on an exchange with FIAT currency (US dollars, Euro, GBP, Yen, etc). There are dozens of exchanges to choose from \u2014 doing some research will help you pick one that\u2019s best for you.Depending on the exchange you are using, you may be putting your capital at risk. Please be careful of phishing attempts and scammers.Before you purchase, you have a chance to look over your order. It\u2019s crucial that you inform yourself about what is a fair price for Ether, which may depend on the exchange you are using.Depending on where you live, we have provided the names of some of the most popular exchanges you can use.North America:Coinbase (the easiest and fastest way to buy ETH)GeminiBitstampKrakenEurope:CoinbaseKrakenBitcoin.deLunoExmo (Russia)Africa:LunoThe best exchange will depend on the country you live in.South America:BitsoCryptomarketCex.ioThe best exchange will depend on the country you live in.Asia:LunoZebpayUpbitBithumbCoinoneBitbankThe best exchange will depend on the country you live in.Australia:BTC markets(Australia)Registering on the exchangeThe remaining steps in this tutorial will be the same no matter which exchange you choose. For the purpose of this guide, we will register and buy ETH on Kraken.Register for the exchange. Keep your login and password safe. It\u2019s recommended that you use multi-factor authentication for your account.Keep your login and password safe2. Verify your identity. Make sure you have your passport and proof of address (such as a utility bill). Depending on how much ETH you want to buy, you need to pay attention to how much you can withdraw. You might have to verify yourself to a higher level (level 3/4 on Kraken, for example) by completing some extra steps.Note: Verification can take days or weeks depending on the exchange. Please verify yourself in advance so you don\u2019t miss out on participating in this milestone.Tier 3 verified account has a monthly withdrawal limit of $200 000 on KrakenNow, you wait. Once your exchange account is verified, you can proceed to the next step: buying ETH.Buying ETHTransfer money from your bank account to your newly created account at a cryptocurrency exchange. Please note that transfers may take a few days before you see your balance on the exchange.Note: If you don\u2019t have a bank account or don\u2019t want to give up your privacy by sending your ID to a third party like Kraken, there are other options like buying ETH from an ATM or locally from other people. These are usually riskier and more expensive ways of acquiring ETH.In our tutorial, we are going to continue with Kraken. On Kraken, you have to click on \u2018Funding\u2019, then on \u2018choose your fiat currency to fund your exchange account\u2019. In our tutorial we are going to choose Euro (EUR).Choose your preferred way of transferring the money and follow the instructions precisely. You will need to send money from your bank account to the exchange\u2019s bank account. These steps are not shown in this tutorial because they are very dependent on your bank, country of residence, and local currency. Once you have been credited the money you transferred to your exchange, you can continue.Now it\u2019s time to purchase your ETH. Click on \u2018Trading\u2019 and choose your desired method of purchasing ETH from the currency list. Since we funded our account with Euros (EUR), we have to choose ETH/EUR to buy ETH.Once you\u2019ve selected ETH/EUR, you fill in how much Ether you want to purchase. Notice that Kraken will immediately show you how much your purchase will cost in EUR. In our example, we are buying 1 Ether, which is 559.52 EUR at the time of writing.Note: Depending on the exchange you are using, your capital may be at risk at this step. The simplest way to purchase Ether is to make a market order. A market order is the quickest and easiest way to buy or sell. However, this does not guarantee you the best price. If you want to know the exact price you\u2019re paying, it\u2019s best to do a limit order. That means if a trader agrees with the price you\u2019re offering, they will execute your limit order. But it\u2019s up to you to figure out what you want to pay the ETH you\u2019re buying. More info on the different type of orders can be found here.Before you purchase, you have a chance to look over your order. It\u2019s crucial that you inform yourself about what is a fair price for Ether, which may depend on the exchange you are using.Once you\u2019re satisfied with your order, click \u2018Submit Order\u2019 and wait for the transaction to be executed.If your order is executed (closed), you have successfully purchased your ETH.Final step: Transferring your ETH to MetaMaskNow that you have purchased ETH on the exchange, it\u2019s time to send it to your MetaMask wallet. Remember: MetaMask is essential for investing through Brickblock.

I have been studying at Fullstack Academy since July, focusing on JavaScript, Node.js, Sequelize, React, and React-Redux. In the recent Stackathon, I pushed past the curriculum: over the course of approximately 48 hours, I raced to teach myself Solidity, and figured out how to make a complete blockchain application.The World Bank projects that 10% of the world\u2019s GDP will be stored on the blockchain by 2025. The blockchain, a public ledger of transactions, presents the possibility for increased accountability, transparency, immutability, and efficiency in business. A key feature of the blockchain is its use of smart contracts, which are governed by a computer, thus increasing users\u2019 confidence in the network. In my app, I provide a means for foster care workers to store foster children records in smart contracts. The contracts provide a better-organized, permanent bookkeeping system, and I hope that the app leads to increased protections for the hundreds of thousands of children in our foster care system.In this article, I review three key tools for developing and testing a smart contract \u2014 Remix IDE, Ganache, and Metamask. My aim is to teach other developers how to use the three in conjunction, to ensure the effectiveness of their contract prior to integrating into a full stack application.Remix IDE is an open source tool that allows you to compile, test, and debug your smart contract, directly from your browser. In order to effectively test your contract, I recommend connecting Remix to a virtual private Etherium blockchain, such as Ganache.Ganache is available both as a desktop application and as a CLI; I recommend the desktop application, which allows you to clearly visualize the process of deploying transactions. Upon setting up Ganache, you will see the following screen:When running Ganache, you have access to ten Etherium addresses that each are preloaded with 100 test ether, roughly equivalent to $23,254. Ganache immediately confirms when a contract has been deployed or a transaction has been posted to the blockchain, increasing the transaction log and deducting ether upon confirmation of a transaction. In addition, Ganache\u2019s list of transactions will detail transaction types (funds transfer, contract call, contract creation, etc.) along with the transaction hash and the address from which the transaction was sent.Finally, Metamask is a Chrome extension that connects the browser to an Etherium node, allowing you to send and receive ether:Once you download and set up Metamask, connect it to one of your Ganache addresses. In Metamask, the dropdown menu for Networks lists several options; select custom RPC. In the settings menu, for \u2018New RPC URL\u2019, add the RPC server from your Ganache GUI, usually HTTP://127.0.0.1:9545 or HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545.Next, connect to a specific Ganache test wallet in order to load test ether into Metamask. In Metamask, click the colorful avatar on the top right, then click \u2018Import Account\u2019. The select menu will default to \u201cPrivate Key Import\u201d. In Ganache, click on the key icon to the right of the first wallet. Copy and paste the private key into Metamask. Voila! Your account is now loaded with 100 ether.Lastly, connect Remix to Metamask. In the \u201crun\u201d menu, under environments, select \u201cInjected Web3\u201d. Now, when transactions are confirmed in Remix, you will receive a confirmation request from Metamask, ether will be deducted from your Ganache wallet, and the wallet\u2019s transaction count will increment.With this as a starting point, you can now begin writing, compiling, and deploying smart contracts to a private blockchain, using Remix. I hope that this guide was helpful \u2014 please let me know your thoughts on this.

It interacts with Ethereum Dapps and Smart Contracts without running a full Ethereum node. MetaMask add-on can be installed on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and the new Brave browser.First, let\u2019s setup a MetaMask on Chrome browser. Open up a new Chrome browser window and navigate to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn and then click on \u2018ADD TO CHROME\u2019 to install MetaMask plugin.After installing, click on the MetaMask icon on the top right corner of the chrome browser. It will open up MediMask UI, scroll all the way down and click Accept to agree MetaMask\u2019s terms of use.Then enter password, confirm password, and then click Create for a new Ethereum account. This account allows to send and receive Ether and also allows to deploy Smart Contracts.MetaMask will show up 12 words recovery key (Seed) as below.These 12 words are the only way to restore MetaMask accounts if you forget the password. It should be stored in a safe location. Then click on \u2018I\u2019VE COPIED IT SOMEWHERE SAFE\u2019.

Cryptocurrencies are no exception. In fact, it may be truer for crypto than any other asset class. But let\u2019s face it \u2014 the whole process of crypto diversification is just a pain. Let\u2019s examine all the steps involved:Buy your BTC/ETH from Coinbase/GDAX with fiatSend your BTC/ETH to your MetaMask wallet, since you\u2019re smart and don\u2019t want to keep your hard-earned money on a centralized exchangeDiscover a cool new altcoinResearch which exchanges list that altcoinCreate an account on this new exchange, a process which could take several days to get approved, and may involve sending photos of yourself and your passport to comply with AML/KYC regulationsSend your BTC/ETH to this exchange (paying transaction fees along the way)Sell the BTC/ETH for the altcoin you want (more transaction fees)Withdraw that new altcoin to your MetaMask wallet (even MORE fees!)That\u2019s EIGHT steps just to get the altcoin you wanted. Plus, with centralized exchanges, if you already have some altcoins you want to swap for a different one, you\u2019ll need to exchange them BACK to BTC, ETH or USDT first. (Oh, and we almost forgot \u2014 each of those trades is taxable, depending on the country you live in.)Given how tedious and complicated this whole process is, it\u2019s no wonder that so many people just throw their hands up in frustration and decide this crypto stuff isn\u2019t for them.I mean, it\u2019s 2018. Everything else is user-friendly and intuitive, so why, nearly 10 years after the launch of Bitcoin, is dealing with cryptocurrencies still such a ridiculous hassle?We decided that just wasn\u2019t acceptable, and that\u2019s why we developed Faast, the simplest, most effortless way to build a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio.If you have a MetaMask wallet (any other supported wallet), you can simply visit the Faast website, connect your wallet, and begin trading your holdings for the coins you want right away \u2014 including one altcoin for another, without having to exchange it for BTC/ETH/USDT first. No memberships, verifications or any other steps required.Now if you\u2019re thinking \u201cwait a minute, can\u2019t you already do this with ShapeShift?\u201d, the answer is yes, you can. We\u2019re not the first mover in this regard. But MySpace was a first mover too, wasn\u2019t it?While ShapeShift does what it is designed to do, its selection of supported altcoins is limited. With Faast, you can choose from over 130 supported tokens (with many more on the way). You just choose the coins you want, and use the simple click-and-drag interface to diversify your portfolio as you desire.In just a few minutes, you\u2019ll have a well-diversified portfolio without having to sign up for accounts on all those exchanges! Your Faast portfolio piechart updates in real time to provide you with an easy to understand visual representation of your holdings in that wallet.How it worksLet\u2019s break down the process you saw in the GIF above step by step. For example, let\u2019s say you want to acquire some PowerLedger (PWR), a renewable energy-focused token which ShapeShift does not support. In the past, if you wanted to grab some PWR tokens without going through the laborious 8-step process described above, you were out of luck\u2026until now.With Faast, things are so much easier. To connect your MetaMask wallet to Faast, just visit faa.st and click the \u201cGet Started\u201d button. You\u2019ll be brought to a page where you can add your wallet. Click the MetaMask image under \u201cSoftware Wallets\u201d. Once your wallet is connected with the Faast website, simply click the \u201cswap\u201d link at the top of the page.On the Swap page, you\u2019ll see the list of assets in your wallet, along with the current price, total value in USD, the percentage (weight) it holds in your portfolio, and the number of units you hold for each coin. To add a new coin, just click \u201cadd asset\u201d in the upper right corner:From there, you\u2019ll see a menu of all the coins supported by Faast. In this example, we\u2019ll select PWR.Now you\u2019re back at the swap screen. Below each coin\u2019s information, you\u2019ll see a bar where you can manually click and drag right or left to the specific quantity you wish to trade.We\u2019re going to free up about $20 USD of ETH so we can swap it for the same amount in PWR. We simply drag the bar for ETH left until we\u2019ve deducted $20, then we scroll down the PWR box, and drag the bar right until we reach +$20 for that asset.Click and drag interface seen above. $20.35 USD worth of PWR has been added.Once you\u2019ve adjusted the bars as you wish, just click \u201csave changes\u201d at the top of the screen. You\u2019ll get a confirmation window asking you to confirm once more (MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction as well).And just like that, you now have PWR added to your portfolio! How painless was that?We\u2019re so thrilled to be making life easier for crypto investors and traders with Faast, and this is just the beginning. Over the next few months, we\u2019ll be adding many more altcoins to our platform.Come visit us and try it out for yourself, and you\u2019ll quickly understand why Faast is the simplest, easiest way for beginners and advanced users alike to diversify their crypto portfolios.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Diversified Investments", "Ethereum", "Metamask"]}, {"title": "Support for the final signTypedData spec", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-monthly-september-a2993bc2fa0f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bobby Dresser", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bobbydresser", "publish_date": "2018-09-28", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-18", "readtime": "4.15", "claps": 266, "voters": 25, "content": "Bobby DresserFollowSep 28, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readHave you ever wished you could help your users add a token to their wallet? Have you ever been confused or frustrated by Ethereum\u2019s numerous signing methods? Have you ever wished we had a privacy layer that didn\u2019t expose users\u2019 accounts to every site they ever visited?If you answered \u201cyes\u201d to any of the above, this newsletter is for you! Read on to learn about support for the new signTypedData spec, progress on our privacy proposal EIP 1102, a new EIP for adding tokens to users\u2019 wallets, and more new features in the extension.MetaMask v4.12 is rolling out slowly over the next week, so if you don\u2019t see these updates yet, hang tight! And if you\u2019re super keen to upgrade, you can head to our releases page and load the new version manually.Support for the final signTypedData specSigning data is a crucial part of interacting with dapps. By using your private key to sign something, you can prove ownership of your key without revealing it \u2014 and without sending ETH or paying gas. Ethereum has gone through a range of different signing methods, many with security or usability tradeoffs. With EIP 712 and the finalized signTypedData spec, developers have a method that is simple to implement and efficient to parse and validate on-chain. Rather than asking users to sign illegible hexidecimal or UTF-8 strings, the signTypedData method lets dapps present data in a well-structured, human-readable format.MetaMask 4.12 includes support for this method as specified in EIP 712 under the function name signTypedData_v3. We will continue to support the legacy implementation under signTypedData for the next several months. Users get to know what they\u2019re signing, dapp developers can settle on one implementation, everybody wins. For more detail, read this blog post by ConsenSys\u2019 Koh Wei Jie.Test your dapp with EIP 1102MetaMask has been spearheading an ecosystem-wide effort to improve the privacy layer for dapp browsers & wallets. On November 2, MetaMask will stop exposing users\u2019 accounts by default, and instead require that dapps ask the user\u2019s permission.Since proposing this change, we received some helpful feedback from the community and have incorporated it in the EIP. Rather than removing Ethereum surface area entirely, preventing dapps from even knowing a visitor has a dapp browser installed, the proposal now continues to expose a read-only provider. When a dapp detects the read-only provider, it can request access to the full provider by calling ethereum.enable(). This maintains a narrow fingerprinting surface while still allowing dapps to craft smooth onboarding flows.Mock support for EIP 1102 is now available in 4.12. We encourage dapp developers to test their sites against these changes before they go live! You can reach out to us on Github with any questions.EIP 747: Watch AssetMetaMask now supports EIP 747, which defines a way for sites to suggest an asset to their users\u2019 wallet to track. A dapp can simply call wallet_watchAsset() and pass a token\u2019s details \u2014 if the user\u2019s wallet also supports EIP 747, the wallet will add the token to the user\u2019s list!One API call, and a user gets an easy-to-read confirmation screen. No complicated instructions. No pull requests to centralized repositories.Once your extension has updated to 4.12, you can try the feature using this sample dapp, then check the code to implement for your own token!This is the second step in a larger effort to make token management via MetaMask simpler than ever. Version 4.9 added token auto-detection, which works for tokens tracked in our eth-contract-metadata repo. For other tokens, or for dapp developers who don\u2019t know what wallet their user has, this EIP is great news. We could even use the same pattern in the future to suggest alternate networks to the user, as discussed in this post.Ledger Hardware SupportMetaMask 4.12 now supports Ledger hardware wallets! If you have a Ledger, you can now connect it to MetaMask and use it to sign transactions across the web. From the top-right menu, click \u201cConnect Hardware Wallet,\u201d follow a couple easy steps, and you\u2019re ready to go.Once your Ledger is connected, you\u2019ll be able to sign transactions, sign messages, and check your Ledger accounts\u2019 ETH or token balance \u2014 all without your private keys ever leaving your Ledger.

This means that if the servers are down, e.g. maintenance or a DDoS attack, the users won\u2019t be able to use the application. Other than that, with a desktop version, it\u2019s much easier for the user to verify its integrity against the source code increasing, even more, the trust in the network. At the same time, we realized that the app being available on the web is a very easy way for the users to use it, making it more accessible.So, our idea was to be flexible, making Swapy Exchange available on the web through the cloud but also releasing desktop versions compatible with the most used Operational Systems.With decentralization in mind, we decided to focus on the desktop version first and we released Swapy Exchange Alpha v0.0.1 \u2014 a desktop app built on top of Electron. To make it work we built a wallet manager to create, encrypt and store private keys using Electron Store.The problem began when we tried to deploy this version in the browser. Since we don\u2019t have access to OS capabilities through the browser, we weren\u2019t able to use our previous wallet manager. This means that we\u2019d have to implement 2 different ways to manage wallets: one for the browser and other for the desktop. Not only this could become a mess in our code, but also, it could be very confusing for the users to use the application in one way through the browser and have a totally different experience using the desktop app.So we decided to go to the other way around and release a browser version integrated with MetaMask, which is the most used wallet manager nowadays, because of its easy-to-use approach to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain. Then, again, we bumped in some issues regarding the implementation: it was not possible to easily integrate MetaMask in our desktop app because Electron doesn\u2019t fully support the Chrome Extensions\u2019 API. So we released Swapy Exchange Alpha v0.0.2 only in the browser.At this point we had a big challenge in front of us:1. We didn\u2019t want to have 2 different codebases: one for the web and the other for Electron.2. We needed to provide wallet management for the desktop in the most secure & easy-to-use way, preferably using MetaMask itself within our Electron App.3. Security! We didn\u2019t want anyone to steal user\u2019s private keys or take control of the user\u2019s OS.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Aragon\u2019s solutionAragon Desktop integration with MetamaskWe then discovered that Aragon\u2019s team was struggling with the same issue to create their desktop version. They wanted to integrate MetaMask into their Electron application and we came across their solution.Basically, they had to implement what was missing in Electron to support extensions + some specific requirements of MetaMask. According to their post, some of the things they had to were:- Implement a lot of dummy APIs faking Chrome\u2019s.- Replace MetaMask\u2019s default communication method between the extension and the webapp (using Ports) with an isolated, inter-origin communication using postMessage.Also, since they removed nodeIntegration from Electron, they had to implement their own way to communicate between the browser renderer and the main app, so they created Intertron.They did a great job on that and in the beginning, we thought in going to the same path, using their open source code as a reference. But we realized that it was not that simple. They were not using the actual codebase of MetaMask, instead, they created their own fork, thus making it too hard to keep MetaMask up-to-date. Also, MetaMask UI is built with React, so as Aragon, but Swapy Exchange uses Angular, nonetheless injecting the UI in our frontend was not so straightforward as for them.Therefore we wanted a way that we could inject MetaMask\u2019s actual code straightforward in our app and don\u2019t worry with integrating any React code and don\u2019t have to worry at all to modify the way MetaMask works thus making a desktop app compatible with MetaMask latest versions of course, without sacrificing any security.Sounds impossible, but we did it!Our solutionSwapy Exchange Desktop (Alpha version) with MetamaskThat\u2019s when we bumped into Muon: an Electron fork maintained by Brave. According to Muon\u2019s documentation, some of the goals of the framework are:add support for Chrome extensionsadd security-focused features for the renderer: \u2014 remove node completely (from the renderer process) \u2014 full sandboxMuon seemed perfect for us: because not only we would have full support for extensions but also we would have increased security and a framework supported by a great company also in the Ethereum ecosystem.The biggest difference between Electron and Muon is that Muon fully support Chromium\u2019s features and at the same time implements a secure way to do IPC communication, without Node (similar as Aragon\u2019s Intertron, mentioned above). The problem is that it\u2019s still in a very early stage, so they don\u2019t have a good documentation yet, other than the browser-laptop code.But the result couldn\u2019t be better. After we figure out how Muon works and integrates with extensions, we were able to wrap our frontend code within Muon and inject MetaMask with minimum effort, downloading it directly from Chrome Store.How we did it1. We created a wrapper for the frontend code where the Muon code resides2. We downloaded MetaMask from the Chrome Store using chrome-ext-downloader3. We injected the extension using [Muon\u2019s extension API]4. We implemented the functions to open and close the MetaMask\u2019s popups5. We created in our frontend the isElectron variable to decide whether to open the extension through Electron/Muon or use MetaMask\u2019s default communication with the browser6. We packed our code with Electron Builder and generated installers for Windows, Mac and Linux.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Now, we\u2019re releasing Swapy Exchange Alpha v0.0.3 with both browser and desktop versions using the same codebase integrated with MetaMask in a simple but secure way!We want more!We think that this solution can be useful for other companies/developers willing to release desktop versions of their dApps, that\u2019s why we created electron-metamask-boilerplate, which can be used to easily wrap a d\u2019App and generate a desktop version using MetaMask, just like we did!Electron + Metamask BoilerplateConclusionIt was a big challenge to come up with this solution, but we learned a lot in the process. We\u2019re willing to keep evolving our code always looking for decentralization, transparency and creating value for our users.It wouldn\u2019t be possible to develop anything without the great open source community around the world, so we\u2019d like to thank all developers behind the software that makes Swapy Network possible. In this post we\u2019d like to specifically thank:- The MetaMask team and contributors on the great solution for the Web 3.0- The Electron team and contributors on the simplest solution to create desktop apps (we love that)- The Brave/Muon team and contributors on the great work on Muon- The Aragon team and contributors on the awesome work to integrate with MetaMask + the transparency on sharing all the process- The Electron Builder team and contributors on such a great documentation and solution to package and distribute desktop appsLearn more about Swapy Network:Website Twitter Telegram (Announcements only) Telegram (Open chat)", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Metamask", "Electron", "Dapps", "Ethereum", "Development"]}, {"title": "How to setup your DAPPs to not use \u201cMetaMask\u201d plugin but sign the transaction backend.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-setup-your-dapps-to-not-use-metamask-plugin-but-sign-the-transaction-backend-b8cb8808c9ae?source=search_post", "author_name": "Logeswaran Audhikesavan", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lokeshwaran.a82", "publish_date": "2018-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-22", "readtime": "3.49", "claps": 131, "voters": 24, "content": "How to setup your DAPPs to not use \u201cMetaMask\u201d plugin but sign the transaction backend.Logeswaran AudhikesavanFollowAug 21, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readSource: GoogleI have recently launched Decentralised Applications(DAPPS) in production. Though it was fun but challenging ride, the knowledge accumulated was very good. Since developing the reactjs application from scratch and getting it ready for production is something I felt very cumbersome process.We are in the Web 3.0 era, yes everything is getting decentralised, we are going back to basics but with wonderful technology (BLOCKCHAIN) to have immutability, transparency in transactions. Having said that, adopting to DAPPS is not that easy since it requires few plugin\u2019s to enable to perform the transactions. So many DAPPs are out there with an extension(plugin) to enable in order to use it for day to day operations. But why ?Why end users must worry about those plugin\u2019s?, all they want is to use the services & get / make the payment isn\u2019t it?When we are developing DAPPs, most important thing as a developers to keep in mind is \u201cend user\u201d, at the end of the day without users traction even if you build super great applications it will be just a scrap!In this article, I will explain how to build your DAPPs to use the content provider & sign the transactions under the hood. So from user standpoint, it would be like normal application but they actually dealing with decentralised apps.Credit goes to this developer : Click herePre-requisitesNode(peer) that is running ethereum blockchain.

I recommend using Ganache, which you install by running npm install -g ganache-cli.Next let\u2019s make sure we have our ganache running in the background. Open your terminal and run the command ganache-cli. That's all! It runs on port 8545by default, just like most Ethereum RPCs, and so does Truffle.Also note that when ganachefirst starts, it prints out a list of accounts that will be pre-funded with ether, along with a twelve-word seed phrase for re-generating those accounts. You can use this seed phrase to initialize your MetaMask client with the same accounts, and you\u2019ll have lots of Ether when you start! (Ether is used to pay for network usage, or gas, on the Ethereum network)If you wanted to start up ganachewith the accounts you already have in MetaMask, you can tell ganachewhat seed phrase to use with the -m flag. For example:$ ganache-cli -m \"concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic\"Setting up a simple Truffle DappNext, let\u2019s generate a basic Truffle dapp. The default result of truffle initis a simple example currency.To get it up and running, run these commands:mkdir metacoin# Create a folder for your new dappcd metacoin# Move into that foldertruffle init # Initialize a default truffle project in that foldertruffle compilertruffle migrate # Build, compile, & deploy the dapptruffle test test/metacoin.jsSetting up MetamaskIf you visit it, you\u2019ll see that by default this new Dapp template signs you in with the first account on your ganache-cli account list, which happens to be the same account that got pre-populated with 10k shiny new Metacoins! That's because when you ran truffle migrate, Truffle used your first account as the contract publisher, and the contract says to fund the creator's account with 10k coins.You can now send those coins to any account you want, for example, the second account in your ganache-cli list! If you enter an address and a value, and hit send, you'll see your balance go down!If that seems a little too easy, I\u2019d agree with you! That\u2019s why Metamask gives the user an opportunity to approve every transaction that a Dapp attempts, and that\u2019s more secure!Let\u2019s try connecting to the same account through Metamask, and see how easy it is!Setting up MetamaskNow you\u2019ll want to install Metamask from the Chrome store.Please see how to install MetamaskOpen MetamaskClick the current network name in the top right.Select Custom RPCSet the current RPCLocalhost:8545address.5. fill in the second account (0x035b9094158fc6af051242b6c04444c017b7e17c) and amount of 36. You will see the the result of transaction.This has been a simple example, but hopefully shows how Truffle and Metamask work together. They are able to pretty much work out of the box! That\u2019s because Truffle helps you write web3-compliant dapps.

This will make some code from this paper to break. I will publish updated version with web3 1.0 and new MetaMask interface.Metamask is the de facto standard for dApps on the web. It injects a Web3 instance into a window object making it available for JavaScript code.We are going to use Web3 0.20 version, not Web3 1.0. The code for Web3 1.0 would be different.Every dApp has its mission, but the way they interact with Metamask is similar. In this article, we\u2019ll cover the ten most common practices to handle Web3/Metamask interactions.#1. Detect Metamask and instantiate Web3According to docs, here\u2019s the best way to do it.What is going on here? First, we check if Web3 was injected. If it is injected we create a new instance using the injected provider. Why is that? Because we want to use our library version, not the one injected by Metamask.If Web3 is not present, we try to connect to a localhost provider, like ganache.#2. Check if Metamask is lockedMetamask can be installed but locked. In order to interact with a user account and send transactions, the user has to unlock Metamask.#3. Check the current networkThere are many test networks beyond the main network. Typically your contract is deployed to a certain network. You want to be sure that the user runs Metamask on the same network.#4. Get the current accountA user may have multiple accounts at Metamask, but they expect the dApp to interact with the current one.You should always grab the account from the Web3 instance. Do not keep and reuse it, because the user may change their account at any time.#5. Get the balance on the current accountHere we use the function getAccount from #4 and call getBalance. Easy.#6. Detect that the current account has changedA user may change their account at any time. You dApp should be ready for that and react properly.#7. Detect whether Metamask is locked/unlockedSimilar to #6. A user may lock/unlock anytime. Your dApp should handle it correctly.#8. Handle cancel/confirmOnce a user interacts with your dApp, you have to send a transaction using the Web3 API. A user may press the cancel or confirm button on the Metamask popup. This may lead to UI inconsistency if not handled correctly.In order to return instantly with the transaction hash, call contract.methodName.sendTransaction.#9. Get the transaction receiptOnce your dApp transaction is mined, a transaction receipt becomes available. Yet there is no event/notification, so we have to implement a poll mechanism.#10. Listen for Web3 eventsSolidity events are great. They allow switching from ugly polling to just a push mechanism, assuming your contract implements all necessary events. You can completely avoid polling and just react to events. Event callback returns a lot of data, but we are mostly interested in args.SummaryWhatever your dApp is about, it still has to perform common tasks, such as detecting Web3, getting the account state and balance, recognizing the current network, and handling transactions and events. We\u2019ve gone over how it can be done using ten code snippets.P.S.A lot of examples here use methods which might throw an error because of Metamask\u2019s state or some variables being undefined at the moment of a call. You should wrap them in try/catch in a production environment. Async/await has been used here for simplicity. It can be replaced with Promise then/catch.SocialConnect with me on LinkedIn.Follow me on twitter.Want More?How to Create and Deploy Your Own EOS TokenWe are going to figure out what is EOS token and how you can create and deploy one yourself.hackernoon.comHow Much Does It Cost to Run DApp in 2018You think your AWS or Digital Ocean bill for your website is killing you?hackernoon.comDifference Between Ethereum and EOS TokensEthereum has ERC-20 token and EOS has EOSIO.Token.

Read on for more details.MetaMask for MobileMetaMask is finally coming to mobile! Rather than just another dapp browser, MetaMask Mobile is a bridge to the decentralized web, with a dapp-centric browsing experience, intuitive on-boarding, and features to sync and stay compatible with your desktop MetaMask accounts.Check out the demo below for a sneak peek of MetaMask Mobile\u2019s desktop-to-mobile sync in action. The public beta will be available in early 2019 on iPhone and Android.A demo of the desktop-mobile sync feature in the upcoming MetaMask mobile appPrivacy by default (EIP 1102)Over the past couple months, MetaMask has led an effort to improve privacy across the Ethereum ecosystem (documented in EIP 1102). We\u2019re excited to introduce \u201cPrivacy Mode\u201d as the user-facing piece of this new privacy layer.DevCon IVLast week, we took the stage at DevCon to talk about MetaMask\u2019s development over the past year and our plans for the future. If you missed the speech in Prague here\u2019s a recap of MetaMask\u2019s past, present, and future.MetaMask team on the Main Stage.What did we present?All those pull requests & releases throughout the year added up to a lot of tangible changes to MetaMask, so we\u2019ve compiled a list of some updates you may have missed and some categories we have been focusing on throughout this year.Hardware wallet integrationsPrivacy by Default (EIP 1102)Easy token tracking (EIP 747)Simplified data signing (EIP 712)Some of MetaMask\u2019s user-facing improvements we discussed at Devcon.From the DevCon stage, we also discussed some of our goals for the year ahead:Contract Account SupportGnosis SAFE is an ecosystem of smart contracts that allows for features like social recovery, key allowances, state channels, multi-factor auth, and batch transactions. MetaMask is building support for these contract accounts, allowing users to form a logical on-chain identity.Light Client Development (Mustekala)MetaMask Labs is working on Mustekala, a native browser p2p light client to decrease MetaMask\u2019s reliance on centralized infrastructure. Follow the project as it evolves!Multi-Network SupportMetaMask will soon support any ETH-compatible blockchain, opening MetaMask up to new communities across the world. This is just the start: eventually, we aim to support simultaneous connections to a wide variety of different networks, and even allow sites to suggest networks to their users.MetaMetricsMetaMask\u2019s users span a huge range of technical to non-technical backgrounds, and we aim to make our product work for people across the world. But building for such a broad audience is hard! That\u2019s why we plan to introduce *opt-in* metrics to help understand what our users find challenging and what needs to improve. We\u2019ll NEVER collect addresses, keys, transactions, balances, personal information, or IP addresses, and allowing these metrics to run in your extension will be 100% Voluntary.Layer 2 Scaling ResearchThere are some exciting projects out there to make the Ethereum blockchain cheaper and faster to use. We\u2019re exploring how to best integrate Layer 2 solutions into MetaMask to encourage this important work across the ecosystem and help get it in the hands of users quickly.

Now we will install the custom Metamask build found here, and turn on Privacy Mode:Turning Privacy Mode on.And it fails to get the address now!Now that we see Privacy Mode does indeed prevent us from accessing Metamask directly, let us add in the codes required to enable the provider:Creating an async function to ask for permission.Detect web3 provider and calling for permission.Refresh our test, and we should see a prompt:Prompting for permission \u2014 Click Reject/Approve to your fancy.After we click Approve \u2014 Refresh the page and it works!The setting selected will be remembered by Metamask, and could be cleared by clicking on \u201cClear Privacy Data\u201d found right above the option to enable \u201cPrivacy Mode\u201dAnd that\u2019s it!

Making transactions on the Main network may result in lose of ETH!Join us at: SELECT Solidity development channelGoal of the Web ApplicationWe want to enable user to easily interact with our contracts. User has to be able to create pools, send ETH to the pool, transfer reward points, see who\u2019s the Shark and other token holders.We also want to detect account from MetaMask extension and present just user specific data.Blockchain is slow compared to the user interactions and we don\u2019t want user to sit and wait for the confirmations. That means it\u2019s critical to implement transactions queue and enable user to see transaction status within Web Application or using tool like Etherscan.Required toolsThere is quite a lot of technologies we need to make this work:React and Redux \u2014 popular Javascript libraries to build Web ApplicationsWebpack \u2014 to take care of modules, dependencies and build processMetaMask \u2014 web3 provider and extension for transaction signingShout out to some of the repositories helping me to build this Dapp:React, Redux and Webpack starter repository. Great starting pack, don\u2019t need a lot of changes in the configuration to build upon it.Web3 detection and nice svg images repository. I have put state manipulation into the Redux, but it\u2019s a nice starting point (and I really like the graphics).Web3 LibraryWhat you want to do is rely on the user to provide an external web3 provider. There is no web3 dependency in the package.json. In my case, I force user to install MetaMask, which takes care of web3 injection, signing transactions and connecting to the right node. What I have to do is monitor if it\u2019s connected to the right network and parse users public address for user management.Check web3 statusWe need web3 status, connected blockchain network and user\u2019s address pretty much everywhere across the application. I have created component which fetches account and network periodically. And Redux makes it easy to map state to the components that needs to check it.const ONE_SECOND = 1000;const ONE_MINUTE = ONE_SECOND * 60;class Web3Provider extends Component {  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this.props.fetchAccounts();    this.props.fetchNetwork();    this.interval = null;    this.networkInterval = null;  }  /**   * Start polling accounts, & network. We poll indefinitely so that we can   * react to the user changing accounts or networks.   */  componentDidMount() {    this.props.fetchAccounts();    this.props.fetchNetwork();    this.initPoll();    this.initNetworkPoll();  }  /**   * Init Web3/account polling, and prevent duplicate interval.   * @return {void}   */  initPoll() {    if (!this.interval) {      this.interval = setInterval(this.props.fetchAccounts, ONE_SECOND);    }  }  /**   * Init network polling, and prevent duplicate intervals.   * @return {void}   */  initNetworkPoll() {    if (!this.networkInterval) {      this.networkInterval = setInterval(this.props.fetchNetwork, ONE_MINUTE);    }  }  render() {    return null;  }}const mapStateToProps = state => {  const { accounts_fetched, account_exists, account_selected, accounts } = state.accounts;  const { network_fetched, network_id } = state.network;  return { accounts_fetched, account_exists, accounts, account_selected, network_fetched, network_id };};const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => (  bindActionCreators({ fetchAccounts, fetchNetwork }, dispatch));const hoc = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Web3Provider);// EXPORT COMPONENTexport { hoc as Web3Provider };We are calling 2 functions, fetchAccounts() and fetchNetwork(). They update global state through Redux, and it\u2019s easy to use it in the components that need address and network informations. All you need is to add state.accounts and state.network in the mapStateToProps() function function in other components.Implementation of the fetchAccounts() and fetchNetwork().import isEmpty from 'lodash/isEmpty';export const fetchNetwork = () => {  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    const { web3 } = window;    web3 && web3.version && web3.version.getNetwork((err, netId) => {      if (err) {        reject(err);      } else {        resolve(netId);      }    });  });};export const fetchAccounts = () => {  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    const { web3 } = window;    const ethAccounts = getAccounts();    if (isEmpty(ethAccounts)) {      web3 && web3.eth && web3.eth.getAccounts((err, accounts) => {        if (err) {          reject(err);        } else {          resolve(accounts);        }      });    } else {      resolve(ethAccounts);    }  });};function getAccounts() {  try {    const { web3 } = window;    // throws if no account selected    return web3.eth.accounts;  } catch (e) {    return [];  }Web3 dependency is injected from MetaMask, and you can access it through window.web3. You can actually check if provider is indeed MetaMask, using web3.currentProvider.isMetaMask. I currently check that when creating transactions. However there are other providers like Parity, and in the future should support them too. Other than that code is pretty straight forward, same as using your own web3 provider.To make it work with Redux you need to create Redux store and reducer, but that is standard for the Redux store manipulation.Checking Web3 state in another component is super easy now.if (isEmpty(this.props.accounts)) {  failed = true;  error = <AccountUnavailable/>;}return (  <div>      {        failed && error      }  </div>)This will render AccountUnavailable component, if there is no accounts mapped to the props of component. I also check if connected network is incorrect, web3 provider is not supported or there is no web3 provider.Public key address parsingPublic key from wallet that user is using, is available as the first element in the accounts array in the injected web3, or in the account_selected variable. You can use it thorough the application to identify the user and show him user related content.Public key provided is always in lower case. I feel like this is important to mention, since addresses parsed from events data aren\u2019t, and may be a reason your requests to the backend are failing. I solved this issue by adding Collation index on the columns in the Mongo Db, where needed.When making transactions to the blockchain, addresses aren\u2019t case sensitive. That means you could get away by just storing and matching everything with lower or upper case. But I think it looks better and more professional if displayed addresses on the UI remain unchanged.Sending transaction using MetaMaskSending transactions using MetaMask is similar as using your own web3 dependency. Here you can see depositToPool() function implementationexport const depositToPool = (pool, ethAmount) => {  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    const web3 = window.web3;    const poolAddress = pool;    const amountWei = web3.toWei(ethAmount, 'ether');    if (!web3 || !web3.isConnected() || !web3.currentProvider.isMetaMask) {      reject('No web3!');    }    const account = web3.eth.accounts[0];    if (!account) {      reject('No account!');    }    web3.eth.getTransactionCount(account, (error, txCount) => {      if (error) {        reject(error);      }      web3.eth.sendTransaction({        nonce: txCount,        from: account,        to: poolAddress,        value: amountWei      }, (err, transactionId) => {        if (err) {          reject(error);        } else {          axios.post(api_service_url + '/transaction/create', {            address: account,            transaction_id: transactionId,            transaction_type: 'Deposit'          }).then(() => {            resolve(transactionId);          }).catch((err) => {            reject(err);          });        }      });    });  });};I only allow MetaMask provider for now. MetaMask only allows asynchronous calls to the blockchain. What that means is, it won\u2019t work if you don\u2019t provide callback method at the end of the called function. You can\u2019t use .then() either, which is a bit weird to me, but I guess that is how they can enforce that. More on the in their developer guide.And a call that creates the poolexport const createPool = (pool) => {  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    const web3 = window.web3;    if(!web3 || !web3.isConnected() || !web3.currentProvider.isMetaMask) {      reject('No web3!');    }    const appContract = web3.eth.contract(appContractAbi).at(app_contract_address);    const account = web3.eth.accounts[0];    if(!account) {      reject('No account!');    }    web3.eth.getTransactionCount(account, (error, txCount) => {      if(error) {        reject(error);      }      appContract.createPool(pool.name, Number(pool.rate), Number(pool.deadline), {        nonce: txCount,        from: account      }, (err, transactionId) => {        if(err) {          reject(error);        } else {          axios.post(api_service_url + '/transaction/create', {            address: account,            transaction_id: transactionId,            transaction_type: 'CreatePool'          }).then(response => {            resolve(transactionId);          }).catch((err) => {            reject(err);          });        }      });    });  });};Transaction queue managementIf you check code carefully, you will notice a little hack. I send transaction data to the backend server, where I store it and wait for the information about it being placed into the block. By doing so I create sort of a queue for blockchain transactions.You could implement the same queue on the frontend, in fact there are already libraries that do that for you. I recommend taking a look at Drizzle. But to use Drizzle you need Web socket, which I think is a pain to set up and maintain on your own. And RPC provider Infura, which I\u2019m using for this Dapp, doesn\u2019t officially support web sockets.There are obvious drawbacks to my solution. If user creates transaction outside of our Web Application, I don\u2019t track it\u2019s status. However I still process Events on the contract, so this is not such a major issue.ConclusionWe created a fully functional Decentralized Web application. Transactions are processed directly on the blockchain, by using MetaMask Web3 provider. To present data we are using custom backend service, which makes UI way more fluid and development a lot easier.It took me quite a while to set up Web Application and provide all the needed API calls on the backend. I deployed it to the AWS instance here, and I encourage you to check it out. You have to use Ropsten network!Source code can be found in this Github repository.Parts of the series:Part 1 \u2014 Solidity smart contractsPart 2 \u2014 Testing Solidity DappPart 3 \u2014 Node.JS backend service for Solidity DappPart 4 \u2014 React Web App with MetaMask Web3", "responses": 3, "tags": ["React", "Web3", "Dapps", "Tutorial", "Redux"]}, {"title": "Using light geth node with Metamask", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@libertylocked/using-light-geth-node-with-metamask-714f537bd696?source=search_post", "author_name": "libertylocked", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@libertylocked", "publish_date": "2017-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-19", "readtime": "3.14", "claps": 95, "voters": 18, "content": "Using light geth node with MetamaskDitch INFURA as the middleman and go full decentralizedlibertylockedFollowNov 12, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readThe web3 middleman problemBy default Metamask uses INFURA as it\u2019s RPC provider. Don\u2019t get me wrong. INFURA is great (although it lacks some features). It\u2019s damn fast, and makes it infinitely easier for web3 beginners. The way it\u2019s set up in Metamask looks kind of like this:const Web3 = require('web3');const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/metamask'));// then try some requestsweb3.eth.getBlockNumber(console.log);You can try the above code yourself in Node.js. It basically tells web3 to use INFURA\u2019s geth node to JSON-RPC on.But now we have a trusted third party problem. Web3 JSON-RPCs INFURA\u2019s nodes, and just trust whatever they reply to us. AFAIK there is no SPV built into web3.js, and the provider is the absolute source of truth.You don\u2019t want that in a decentralized world, do you?Running a light geth nodeWe all know that you should run a full node if you want to go full decentralized. But not everyone can run a full node because it takes a really long time to sync, and it requires a lot of disk space.Since geth 1.5.2, you can run geth in light client mode. Instead of reconstructing the entire chain state, light sync mode only gets the block headers. It takes minutes to sync, and only uses a few hundred MBs of disk. When you request information, your light geth node queries its peers.The very important difference between RPC\u2019ing a trusted node and RPC\u2019ing a light node you run is this: even you\u2019re still getting blockchain data from someone else, your light node does not trust the peers and will do all the verifications.To start geth in light sync mode with 2048 MB cache, and with HTTP-RPC enabled on port 8545, simply run this command:geth --syncmode light --cache 2048 --rpc --rpccorsdomain moz-extension://e582a415-cf54-468e-9b4b-f32b576f7bf7,chrome-extension://nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknnThe extension ID above may not be up to date \u2014 you can find it by popping out Metamask popup into a tab, or right click View Source and copy the extension ID from address bar.The above command enables CORS for Metamask extension on Firefox and Chrome. If you only need one of them, feel free to remove the other.It may take a few minutes to sync. Meanwhile you can run geth attach to attach to the IPC and check the sync progress.$ geth attach ~/.ethereum/geth.ipcWelcome to the Geth JavaScript console!instance: Geth/v1.7.3-unstable-3ee86a57/linux-amd64/go1.9.2 modules: admin:1.0 debug:1.0 eth:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0 web3:1.0> eth.syncing{  currentBlock: 1026432,  highestBlock: 4537745,  knownStates: 0,  pulledStates: 0,  startingBlock: 966336}> net.peerCount8> eth.blockNumber1032576Verify your HTTP-RPC works in Node.jsconst Web3 = require('web3');const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545'));// then try some requestsweb3.eth.getBlockNumber(console.log);I\u2019ve encountered a weird bug where my Geth node doesn\u2019t open HTTP-RPC when running in light syncmode, even with --rpc flag on. If that happens to you, simply geth attach and type admin.startRPC() in your Geth JavaScript console.Setting up Metamask to use your local gethVery conveniently there\u2019s an option to use localhost 8545 in MetamaskSetting Metamask to use local geth node running in light sync modeIf HTTP-RPC works in your Node.js environment but not Metamask, then your CORS domain setting is wrong. Restart geth with the correct --rpccorsdomain. See aboveIf HTTP-RPC does not work in Node.js or Metamask, and only IPC-RPC works, then your HTTP-RPC is probably not even turned on.That\u2019s it! Now enjoy the decentralized world where you rely on nobody but yourself.Bonus: filtersWeb3 comes with a very handy feature: filters. You can read the documentation on web3.eth.filter if you care. It basically lets you set up filters and watch for certain events. Very useful if you don\u2019t want to constantly poll the state.Unfortunately, INFURA does not support such call to create and watch filters.Fun side node: Metamask by default constantly calls getBlockNumber on the geth node, INFURA or otherwise, when it could have used a filter to watch the latest block, which is far more performant. The reasoning is that, INFURA does not support filters, and Metamask by default uses INFURA as provider.I\u2019ve had the opportunity to talk to Michael Wuehler about INFURA at one of the meetups. He said filter is one of the most requested features. It\u2019s not currently supported because it does not scale very well (or by his words, it\u2019s linearly scaled).It\u2019s certainly a headache for DApp developers, because your filters won\u2019t work in Firefox/Chrome with default Metamask settings. It works if user is using Metamask with a local geth node though.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask"]}, {"title": "\u0418\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f

Last October at Devcon we announced that we were building a Mobile Application. After months of heads down work from our mobile team we are looking forward to releasing the Public Beta to Android & iOS on July 22!Sign up Here!!!Rather than just another wallet, MetaMask Mobile is a bridge to the decentralized web, with a dapp-centric browsing experience, intuitive on-boarding, and features that sync with your desktop MetaMask accounts.Since MetaMask mobile is now compatible with open protocols like WalletConnect you can connect to Dapps on devices where you don\u2019t have the extension installed on.With MetaMask Mobile you can now:Use DApps on any browserEnjoy End-to-End EncryptionSign Transactions & Messages on your phoneReceive notifications on your phoneDependency Audit RecapThis month, a tweet raised some public concerns of the security of our codebase.The tweet showed an automated summary of our npm dependencies, which had some big numbers, making it a concerning image for the security-minded to rally around.The ResultRead about our full retrospective written by Dan Finlay Here.We have taken the opportunity to clean up these dependencies for the sake of improving the results of this type of automated audit.We developed an audit tool called npm-audit-plz that would bypass the errors that we were receiving from a normal npm audit, which we determined was due to a bug in npm. We reported the issue to npm, and were told it had been recorded, but were not offered any estimate on timeframe for a fix.This resulted in a pull request that was able to once again get the project passing an npm audit, with very few detected npm audit vulnerabilities remaining, discussed below.We have also created a new bug bounty for anyone who can find a malicious dependency in the MetaMask codebase.MetaMask founder Aaron Davis applied some of the tools he developed through this process to the Tendermint codebase, and it was a winner at the Cosmos Berlin hackathon:Shoutout of the Month!LiqualityThis months shoutout goes to Liquality! The Liquality Atomic Swap Interface alpha is live on mainnet. The interface offers a secure way to swap BTC, DAI, and ETH directly from your Ledger or Metamask wallets. Users not only save on unnecessary fees but also significantly reduce counterparty, settlement, and custodial risks.

These changes are new as of this month.#6659: Enables Ledger hardware wallet support on Firefox browsers#6625: Transactions have an intrinsic minimum gas requirement (2100 + data fee). This update ensures that transactions cannot be confirmed if gas limit is below 21000.#6718: Added the abilty to delete custom RPCs#6690: Update dependencies, re-enable npm audit CI job blog post. (Fixes a bunch of npm audit errors)#6623: Improve contract method data fetching minimizing the number of network requests made when loading the send screen and transaction list. Also stops blocking the loading of the send screen on contract method fetch requests#6551: Adds 4byte registry fallback to getMethodData() makes significantly fewer requests than the previous implementation#6700: Fix styles on \u2018import account\u2019 page and updated help link#6714: Wrap smaller custom block explorer url text#6671: bugfix: rejects enable promise on user rejectionMetaMask by the numbersIn the past month\u2026\u2705 42 PRs merged\ud83d\udee0 127 commits\ud83d\udcab 34 Github issues closed, (35)opened\ud83d\udd27 1,027 support tickets solved last month\ud83d\udca5 35,613 lines of code added and 21,624 deleted.If you have any questions or suggestions, you can always reach out to us directly or file an issue on our Github.Builders, help us make useful tools for you!Are you a developer using MetaMask to build your business, DApp, side project, main project, or anything in between?

This newsletter has some updates on projects past and future, as well as several exciting shoutouts across the MetaMask family!An update on 1102 & Privacy ModeLast month we launched a feature called Privacy Mode in MetaMask v5.0.0, which requires that dapps ask users\u2019 permission to view their public Ethereum address. Over the past couple weeks, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of applications across the ecosystem update to support this crucial privacy layer. We\u2019re proud of the ecosystem for stepping up to protect user privacy and excited to keep working to improve the decentralized web.Dependency SecurityLast week a popular Bitcoin wallet was hacked, which has concerning ramifications for all cryptocurrency wallet developers and users. For a full description of the hack, you can read this blog post.Like all software projects, MetaMask has many dependencies in the open source world that help us bring you the ever-evolving experience you\u2019ve grown to expect.In addition to continuing along our roadmap, MetaMask is spending some time improving security around our key management. We\u2019ll first lock down the dependencies related to your keys. We\u2019re also exploring the possibility of sandboxing sensitive portions of code to add the absolute highest certainty that keys are only accessed in the intended ways.Of course, if you\u2019re taking advantage of our Trezor and Ledger hardware wallet support, you\u2019d be immune to this kind of attack, provided you carefully review proposed transactions on the screen of your hardware device.Growing the Design TeamMetaMask is stoked to announce our design team has grown by two! We\u2019re welcoming Omna Toshniwal and Juwon Bahn to the team. Omna will focus on UX Research and Juwon joins as our second product designer. Design and usability are core to MetaMask\u2019s mission, and our product serves a variety of audiences, so we\u2019re thrilled to have more talented hands on board.MetaMask is still hiring for a variety of other positions \u2013 check out our open roles and get in touch!\u2019Tis the Season of GivingThis holiday season we\u2019re reminding ourselves to give back to those less fortunate.We\u2019re particularly proud of Randy Brito, a member of the MetaMask support team. He and his family fled Venezuela when he was 14, and since then he\u2019s been running an online forum called Bitcoin Venezuela. The forum teaches people how to mine bitcoin, and donations to the organization help fund soup kitchens, schools, farms, and continuous education. They\u2019ve also partnered with GiveCrypto to identify ways crypto can help people in need. Visit Bitcoin Venezuela \u26a1\ufe0f to learn more.He operates this all remotely, part time, in addition to his daily work here at MetaMask. We are very proud to have Randy on our team, and deeply hope Ethereum and other decentralized technology will improve the lives of many in need.You can help too!Some of you may remember last year we encouraged donations to Merry Merkle, a collaboration across the blockchain community to raise money for a youth shelter in Toronto.This year, they\u2019re partnering with African Angels, an organization that helps fund primary school education for poor and disadvantaged children in South Africa.You can donate at https://merrymerkle.africa/ or `0xf7050c2908b6c1ccdfb2a44b87853bcc3345e3b3`What\u2019s new in MetaMaskIn the past couple weeks, a few new things from around the extension:Trezor hardware wallets now work with Firefox and Brave browsers.(#5797)The send screen now includes byte count. (#5798)The home screen previously marked any transaction that was mined as Confirmed, but this didn\u2019t account for transactions that failed on-chain. The distinction confused users, so we now show on-chain failures as Failed in the extension. (#5581)The extension will now normalize contract addresses when fetching exchange rates, which fixes an issue that caused some users to see missing token conversion rates. (#5863)To make onboarding shorter and simpler, users will now see the extension as a full-page tab after initial install. (#5835)We\u2019ve fixed an issue that caused some users to see an infinite spinner. (#5860)The home screen now shows four decimal places, and when sending your \u201cmax\u201d balance, the extension will no longer round ETH or token values. (#5710, #5695)We\u2019ve updated the \u201cConnect\u201d screen to use sites\u2019 meta title, and pending Connect requests will now show a count on the extension badge. (#5832)We now trim whitespace from seed phrases during import.

(PART I)Daniel PittmanFollowJul 27, 2018 \u00b7 20 min readIntroductionToday I\u2019m going to make your life a little bit easier by explaining how to create an erc721 non-fungible token(nft) smart contract. We will use the example that I built on my GitHub. Document(DQMT) is a way for anyone to create an immutable record of ideas,items/belongs, poetry and whatever else your heart desires. We accomplish this by asking the user for three pieces of information. 1) Type, 2) Title and 3) Description.Type - When we were creating the concept of Document we wanted to insure we had a way to keep track of the type of token. In our case we chose type 1 and 2. Type 1 being and idea and type 2 being an item/belongings, but in theory you can use any number to identify the type.Title - This should be self-explanatory. Give your token a title. Name it whatever you want!Description - This is were you get to shine. Describe your Idea or Item in this section.Writing the ContractLets get right to it and create the contract. I have intentionally left out some of the security features I implemented within my completed solidity contract. If you would like to see the full contract please see Qwoyn Github. We will be using Remix as our IDE.Remix Solidity IDEOnce you have remix open please clear the sample ballot contract and enter:/** * @title SafeMath * @dev Math operations with safety checks that throw on error */library SafeMath {/**  * @dev Multiplies two numbers, throws on overflow.  */  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256 c) {    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than asserting 'a' not being zero, but the    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522    if (a == 0) {      return 0;    }c = a * b;    assert(c / a == b);    return c;  }/**  * @dev Integer division of two numbers, truncating the quotient.  */  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {    // assert(b > 0); // Solidity automatically throws when dividing by 0    // uint256 c = a / b;    // assert(a == b * c + a % b); // There is no case in which this doesn't hold    return a / b;  }/**  * @dev Subtracts two numbers, throws on overflow (i.e. if subtrahend is greater than minuend).  */  function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {    assert(b <= a);    return a - b;  }/**  * @dev Adds two numbers, throws on overflow.  */  function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256 c) {    c = a + b;    assert(c >= a);    return c;  }}Add the ERC165 interface:pragma solidity ^0.4.24;/** * @title ERC165 * @dev https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-165.md */interface ERC165 {   /**   * @notice Query if a contract implements an interface   * @param _interfaceId The interface identifier, as specified in ERC-165   * @dev Interface identification is specified in ERC-165.

This equips MetaMask to handle user authentication over usernames and passwords. Additionally, creating a user account with MetaMask requires no personal identifying information. It is the same level of security as your Ethereum wallet \u2014 because it is an Ethereum wallet.It works like this. The server generate a challenge message. Your browser requests the challenge message. MetaMask signs the message using your Ethereum private key. The server recreates the Ethereum address from the signed message.This is the same security provided to an Ethereum transaction. Instead of Ethereum transaction data, MetaMask signs text data. The same way your private key signs to spend your coins, it signs the server message it receives. The text could be random, Terms of Service or something else entirely.Using your cryptographic signature, the server is able to verify you are the same, unique, user each time you visit without a username or password.You can find the source code for meta-auth on it\u2019s Github Repo. Or find out more information on npm.Here\u2019s how it works,The Back EndFirst, install express and meta-auth$ npm install express meta-authInit both modulesconst express = require('express');const MetaAuth = require('meta-auth');const app = express();const metaAuth = MetaAuth();By default, meta-authwill watch for three route parametersMetaAddress \u2014 Used to issue a challenge message for an address.MetaMessage \u2014 Challenge message returned by the client.MetaSignature \u2014 Signed Challenge returned with MetaMessage.These parameter names are configurable when initializing meta-authconst metaAuth = require('meta-auth')({  message: 'msg',  signature: 'sig',  address: 'address'});Include the metaAuth middleware. The first function issues a challenge for an Ethereum address. If the :MetaAddress route parameter is specified the middleware will create the req.metaAuthobject with a challenge property.The second verifies the message signature and provides req.metaAuth with a recovered property. If the address is recovered the server has cryptographic proof the address belongs to the user. It is safe to log them in.app.get('/auth/:MetaAddress', metaAuth, (req, res) => {  // Request a message from the server  res.send(req.metaAuth.challenge)});app.get('/auth/:MetaMessage/:MetaSignature', metaAuth, (req, res) => {  if (req.metaAuth.recovered) {    // Signature matches the cache address/challenge    // Authentication is valid, assign JWT, etc.    res.send(req.metaAuth.recovered);  } else {    // Sig did not match, invalid authentication    res.status(500).send();  };});Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening under the hoodfunction createChallenge (address) {  const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)    .update(address + uuidv4())    .digest('hex');  cache.set(address, hash);  return hash;}First, The client sends it\u2019s address to the server. It creates a salted hash of the address and uuidv4. It caches the address/challenge pair for lookup later.function checkChallenge(challenge, sig) {  const data = [{    type: 'string',    name: 'challenge',    value: challenge  }]  const recovered = sigUtil.recoverTypedSignature({    data,    sig  });  const storedChallenge = cache.get(recovered);  if (storedChallenge === challenge) {    cache.del(recovered);    return recovered;  }  return false;}The challenge and signature return to the server. It recovers the address from the signature. Then ensures the challenge is for the address. Then removes the data from the cache and returns the recovered address.Returning to the verification express routeapp.get('/auth/:MetaMessage/:MetaSignature', metaAuth, (req, res) => {  if (req.metaAuth.recovered) {    // Signature matches the cache address/challenge    // Authentication is valid, assign JWT, etc.    res.send(req.metaAuth.recovered);  } else {    // Sig did not match, invalid authentication    res.status(400).send();  };});If the recovered property is found meta-auth successfully recovered the address from the message signature.From here, start the user\u2019s session, assign a JWT, give them access to their data, whatever you want to do.The Front EndBy now you know the client will make two requests to the serverReceive a challenge based on their Ethereum AddressReturn the challenge with a signature.That\u2019s for the server, but the client will need to make a third call in between to its web3 provider.(code can be found here)$.get('http://localhost:3000/auth/' + web3.eth.accounts[0], (res) =>   {  challenge = [{    type: 'string',    name: 'challenge',    value: res  }];  const from = web3.eth.accounts[0];  const params = [challenge, from];  const method = 'eth_signTypedData';  web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({    method,    params,    from  }, async (err, result) => {    signature = result.result;    if (err) {      return console.error(err);    }  if (result.error) {    return console.error(result.error);  }  $('.signature').text(signature);  });});The challenge is received from the server and MetaMask will handle sendAsync call to sign the provided challenge.$.get('http://localhost:3001/auth/' + challenge[0].value + '/' + signature, (res) => {  if (res === web3.eth.accounts[0]) {    $('.success').show();  } else {    $('.fail').show();   }});For verification the client returns the same challenge with their signature. If the server response matches the user\u2019s Ethereum address authentication was successful.You can find the source code for meta-auth on it\u2019s Github Repo.

Many companies that have their own token or decentralized app have reached out to us with the request to create an in-app wallet for them recently.Even more companies that we know \u2014 our partners/friends/people we drink beer with at conferences \u2014 complain that \u201cbuilding your own ETH wallet is a drag\u201d, especially when the services you provide are not related to wallets/payments at all. Of course, we could take is as a challenge \u2014 build a WL wallet for all needs. But, in fact, we can\u2019t: our precious human resources are naturally limited, and not every company can afford to/put their trust into a \u201cblack box\u201d solution/plead their inability to build a no-risk-of-screwing-up wallet, after all.Regardless of the possible reasons, many crypto companies \u2014 especially dapps \u2014 shun the idea of building their own app just because it would cost them some 1.5 months of development (full ios/android team load)? We do not know of any successful and ambitious crypto startup that has spare developers. Fitting an MVP of a wallet into your company\u2019s roadmap can be. . . well, if by any chance you work in the industry too, just imagine that and paste the best answer!If you do not, I\u2019ll tell you: impossible unless your survival depends on this (it usually doesn\u2019t).Even the smallest Dapp on Earth can easily go live by implementing Metamask payments, but when it comes to mobile, everything comes to a halt. So what can we do? After sleeping on those facts for several weeks, we came up with an idea.Why not create an ETH wallet SDK for everyone who needs it?\u201cHappiness for everyone, free, and no one will go away unsatisfied\u201dWell, that and make the wallet work with Lumi. Do we or do we not have the right to benefit from our own work?Lumi Blockchain WalletAnd that we did. An SDK (software development kit) \u2014 is literally a toolkit, a bunch of pieces of code, libraries, etc that you can use to create applications with. Implementing the Lumi SDK allows the app to sign Ethereum transactions.So we created the Lumi SDK \u2014 the only thing left was to find a guinea-pig\u2026 a pioneer, we mean.Some of you have probably heard of 0xUniverse \u2014 a colorful blockchain strategy game where players explore space, fly spaceships, and colonize planets. Each planet is a unique collectible usually purchased via Metamask (on desktops). The problem occurred when the 0x team decided to expand and develop a mobile version of their creation \u2014 there was simply no existing solution available for Dapps at that time. So it was the perfect opportunity to give our SDK a try and, as a result, Lumi wallet has been successfully integrated into the 0xUniverse mobile game.What does that mean for the 0x player?1) oh god, there\u2019s finally an 0x app! (so they are going to play the game more often and spend more time in it)2) they decide to purchase a new spaceship, and woo-hoo! They just click the purchase button, are redirected to Lumi Collect, confirm the payment details, and go right back to the app. It\u2019s as simple as it could be. Of course, the easiness of the interaction affects the frequency of the purchases too, if you know what we mean :)That\u2019s only one Lumi SDK implementation case: the possibilities for use are endless. Let\u2019s say, you\u2019re running a decentralized auction platform, and your client wants to purchase an item and send it as a gift to a friend. Instead of finding himself in a long process of signing several transactions he can finalize the whole deal in a single click.Do you think it\u2019s time for your Dapp to go mobile?

Here are a number of steps we are taking to ensure that MetaMask respects your privacy:MetaMetrics will be opt-in. After opt-in, you can opt-out anytime.MetaMetrics will not collect sensitive data from users: No seed words, no public addresses, no private keys, and no data outside of the extension (we aren\u2019t reading your tabs).MetaMetrics data will only be used for guiding development through an understanding of how people are using the product. We will not profit off of your data. Ever.Data collected will be anonymous. Individual data points will be deleted in compliance with GDPR regulations.Data will be occasionally aggregated and shared with the community-at-large.Our codebase continues to be open source and open to audits at our GitHub.We realize that in this current environment, data collection is rightly viewed with suspicion. However, as the ecosystem grows, it is important to make data-driven and evidence-based decisions. This data will complement qualitative data gathered from other forms of ongoing research such as user interviews and community awareness. In this space, where the possibilities of new features and improvements are endless, smart prioritization is a must.With that done, let\u2019s explain things in detail!What is MetaMetrics?MetaMetrics is an analytics platform, powered by the open source platform Matomo that aims to collect information on user events.When a user opts-in to MetaMetrics, their local MetaMask instance will send specific events of the application to the Matomo service. For example, when an individual clicks a certain button, receives an error message, or closes out of sending a transaction, that event is recorded and sent to Matomo. This data then appears on our dashboard on Matomo and allows us to view these metrics, both from an individual anonymized level and from an aggregated level.No data such as public accounts, private keys, seed words, or balances will ever reach us or Matomo\u2019s servers. That data continues to stay exclusively on your machine. IP addresses will be obfuscated before they are recorded by Matomo (e.g. 192.xxx.xxx.xxx). Data collected is also limited to the application, with exception of knowledge on your OS and browser brand/version.Why MetaMetrics?By opting-in, users will help us answer questions such as:What features do people use the most?What parts of the application do people run into the most trouble with?Where do people drop off when completing certain actions?Three years ago, when the ecosystem was still young and our development team was smaller, it was relatively easy to feel the heartbeat of what users needed. Our users were Dapp developers and crypto enthusiasts \u2014 two audiences that we understood well and already communicated with.However, the ecosystem has shifted towards a more dynamic and diverse group of users. Users who are not as crypto-savvy. Users who are more dapp-centric than investment-centric. Users from a growing number of international locations. As we continue to build a product that lowers the barrier of entry into blockchain technology, we must serve these users as well.When Will MetaMetrics Launch?We hope to begin rolling out MetaMetrics to production within the next few weeks.Between now and then, this is what will happen:Additional posts will go out, describing our rationale, our tooling, our security, and the goals that these metrics will help us advance.We will open our ears. We are still a team that hopes to continue serving the community. Do you have concerns or have a question? Ask us! If you are mad, tell us! We want to ensure a strong execution that meets our community\u2019s standards and needs.We will begin notifying people in-app of the upcoming changes at least a week before the rollout and link them to this blog post.What Happens If I Opt Out of MetaMetrics?We understand that this space contains plenty of privacy-minded users when it comes to data collection \u2014 we respect their stance fully. That is why we are committed to an opt-in model that has information readily available and easy to understand. If for any reason that you would like to opt-out, the option is immediate.There is no consequence for not opting-in or opting-out. Choose based on your conscience!In ClosingIn the next few articles, we\u2019ll dive deeper into interviews with our developers, designers, and project manager to hear straight from the source, as well as make posts emphasizing the importance of privacy and our responsibility within the product to enforce that.Finally, we hope to make this roll-out as transparent as possible. We are eager to hear our community speak and we hope to have a constructive period of input to make sure that concerns are addressed and acted on if needed.To a better product and to a better ecosystem!", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Metamask", "Analytics"]}, {"title": "Docs for the Buidlers", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-monthly-january-cd969e6e20f9?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bobby Dresser", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bobbydresser", "publish_date": "2019-01-31", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-01", "readtime": "2.73", "claps": 97, "voters": 18, "content": "Bobby DresserFollowJan 31 \u00b7 3 min readDocumentation, performance improvements, security with SESify and more.Docs for the BuidlersWe\u2019re happy to announce the launch of our new developer documentation site.

We\u2019ll be sharing more details about the SESify project soon as we improve its usability.Devs: we want to hear from youIf you\u2019re a developer using MetaMask to build your business, dapp, side project, main project, or anything in between \u2014 we\u2019d love to chat.

If you\u2019re willing to help MetaMask improve, please fill out this form!MetaMask, Infura, & performanceToday, MetaMask relies on a service called Infura to read Ethereum data and submit transactions to the blockchain. While we have ambitious long-term plans to decentralize this access layer, Infura makes dapp development simple in the meantime. The data show it: as of July 2018 Infura\u2019s Mainnet endpoint serviced about 100,000 requests per second.A substantial portion of this traffic comes from MetaMask users. In the past couple weeks, we\u2019ve worked to make MetaMask\u2019s requests to Infura more efficient by consolidating requests that fetch token balances (#6049), and by caching known method signatures (#6052). We\u2019ll continue to trim down where possible over the coming weeks. This work will improve the performance of our application and ease our load on Infura\u2019s infrastructure.MetaMask Mobile \u2014 coming soonWe\u2019ve been hard at work building MetaMask for iOS and Android. Mobile dapps are the future, and we want to take you there!MetaMask Mobile will be available in app stores this spring, but we\u2019ll be launching a Public Beta version for anyone who wants to get a sneak peek and provide feedback. Stay tuned for news on how to sign up!Release notesMetaMask 5.3.4 just hit browser stores near you \u2014 it includes features and fixes to improve the experience for devs, end-users, and everyone in between.Fixes for some common usability issues \ud83e\udd13We now provide a timeout and clear error message when the extension can\u2019t connect to a user-provided custom RPC network.

In the length of time it takes a human child to learn its first words, smart contracts have gone on to fuel a host of previously unimaginable applications. Over half a billion dollars are locked up on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms such as Maker, Compound and Bancor while consumer applications and games are mushrooming across various base-layer protocols. dApps have gone from 0 to 1, from an abstract idea to real products with thousands of users. Yet, in order for dApp usage to hit new heights (we are talking 1 million DAU), a drastic shift in tech and thinking has to occur. User experience must move to the forefront of the development process if dApps are to take off. Product designers should apply the same care when building user interfaces and crafting brand narratives as they do when developing the smart contracts underpinning their applications. Once blockchain applications enhance their aesthetic appeal will they grip the next wave of users and bring the much-anticipated tsunami of mass adoption.It\u2019s Time for Blockchain Technology to Enter the UX PhaseAt the moment, blockchain technology finds itself at the tail-end of the infrastructure phase. Most of its early adopters possess a deep technical understanding of the underlying protocols and found themselves attracted to decentralized products for various ideological reasons. However, as the blockchain ecosystem begins to mature, products must put the user at the forefront of the product development cycle. The road to mainstream usages must be paved with sleek user experiences. Just as the tech titans of today blend enjoyable, intuitive user-facing interfaces with complex backend technology, the winning dApps of tomorrow will be both provably decentralized and fun to use. Google, Tinder, Uber and other unicorns all have large R&D budgets dedicated to building new databases, data structures, and networking devices but we love them because we can use their applications without needing a PHD in Applied Cryptography. The day will come when users interact with applications without knowing that they are, in fact, using the blockchain.That will be mass adoption day 0.Don\u2019t do it. Just don\u2019tNo, I Don\u2019t Want To View The Transaction on EtherScanAs a passionate gamer, I use the blockchain primarily for fun stuff like racing cars and collecting kitties. Both I and those who use distributed ledgers for serious matters such as cheaper remittance and collateralized loans are dealing with financial assets which must be approached with a lot of caution. When users are exposed to block explorers, transaction hashes and other technical implementation details of the blockchain, that caution is amplified by confusion and misunderstanding. Designers and product managers must win the user\u2019s trust by making their experience smooth and comfortable. Providing a \u2018window into the blockchain\u2019, while serving the technology\u2019s initial purpose as a fully auditable ledger, goes against the interest of mainstream consumers who demand simplicity and comfort. Could you imagine your grandma having to navigate transaction hashes? I thought not.If Steve Jobs were alive, I would imagine that he would be thrilled with the challenge of enhancing blockchain UX. Before the i-revolution led by Jobs, computers were clunky and impersonal. Jobs realized that by focusing on the aesthetics of his creations and blending function with form, he could create products that commanded a devout cult following. Instead of obsessing over the smallest technical detail such as the underlying protocol\u2019s validation engine and transaction processing speed, blockchain builders should shift their focus to the consumers and their needs. As a first step, developers should hide the wires by abstracting away the technical implementation details behind gorgeous user interfaces that will have users begging for more.Get more cheekiness on Twitter", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Eos", "Cosmos", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Detecting Metamask account or network change in Javascript using Web3 1.0.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/detecting-metamask-account-or-network-change-in-javascript-using-web3-1-0-0-18433e99df5a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Brian Ethier", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@david.brian.ethier", "publish_date": "2018-05-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-25", "readtime": "0.84", "claps": 149, "voters": 17, "content": "Detecting Metamask account or network change in Javascript using Web3 1.0.0Brian EthierFollowMay 21, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readA common issue in developing dApps is detecting which account within Metamask a user plans on using.

On this page, we\u2019ll show you how to get started and trade on The Token Store in four easy steps:Step One: Create or Import an AccountSince the Token Store is fully decentralized, we never actually hold any of your funds. However, The Token Store needs to be able to access your ETH and tokens to be able to conduct trades.There\u2019s three ways to do this:Create a new, local account:What this does is generate a new ETH address. The private key to this address is stored in your browser cache and never leaves your browser. To reveal your private key, click the eye toggle on the left. Once the address is generated, you can transfer the ETH or ERC20 tokens you want to transact in to your new ETH address.2. Import account:By entering the private key to your ETH wallet (that looks something like this: 8d408fd8a4c0b2cc01b22637b79261a1752685e08dec2c8d9a46884afdbf039d) The Token Store will import your balances and you\u2019ll be able to trade on The Token Store from your existing ETH address. Your private key is never transmitted to The Token Store!3. Metamask, Brave and other Web3 services:By accessing The Token Store from a web3 service such as Metamask (a Chrome and Firefox plugin) or Brave (a standalone browser), the ETH account you have associated with your Web3 service is automatically attached to The Token Store and all available balances are imported.Note that we strongly recommend using option 3 as it is the most secure way of dealing with your private keys.To choose the option that works best for you, navigate to https://token.store/accountsYou can confirm you have successfully imported your account by noting, at the top right of the screen, the first several letters of your public ETH address in green, along with the wallet\u2019s ETH balance.Here\u2019s how it looks:Step Two: Deposit Funds to The Token Store\u2019s Smart ContractOnce your account is attached, you must deposit the funds you wish to trade to The Token Store\u2019s smart contract. To do this, you must have funds in your attached account. (If you chose to create a new account, this means you must transfer tokens from yourself to the new account first.) To deposit funds into The Token Store\u2019s smart contract, use the Deposit widget on the left of the page.Step Three: TradeOnce funds are deposited and confirmed (this may take some time), your funds are available for traders. Use the Buy/Sell widget to trade.Step Four: WithdrawAfter you\u2019re done trading, you should withdraw the funds currently locked in the smart contract to your ETH address.

Ensure it powers on and then input the pin you chose when setting up your ledger.Select the Ethereum Applicationnavigate to the ethereum app and open itNext you need to open the Ethereum application on your Nano S. You do this by switching through the applications installed on your Ledger by pressing down on either the left or right button to navigate through the applications.Once you have the Ethereum application selected, push down on both buttons to open the application.Make sure contract data is turned onscroll down to the settings optionOnce the Ethereum application is open, press the right side button until you locate the \u201cSettings\u201d option. Press down on both buttons to open the menu.press down both buttons on contract dataThe first item in the settings menu is \u201cContract Data\u201d. Push down both buttons to select it.press down both buttons to select yesNow navigate with the right side button to choose \u201cYes\u201d and then press down on both buttons to select it.Once you have set your ledger up like this the first time, you won\u2019t have to do it again each time you want to use it with MetaMask.Your Ledger is now ready!Open MetaMaskclick on the metamask foxSince you have already installed MetaMask, you need to open up your Chrome browser, and click on the MetaMask fox to interact with the application.click on the avatarNext, you need to click on your avatar in the top right corner of MetaMask. The avatar on your version of MetaMask will look different to the one in the image, but is always located in the same place.This will open up the menu in black and will give you access to many options for customizing your MetaMask such as adding additional accounts, importing accounts and connecting a hardware wallet such as your Ledger Nano S.Connect MetaMask to your Ledgerselect hardware walletClick on \u201cConnect Hardware Wallet\u201dselect Ledger and click on connectThe next screen that pops up is fairly self explanatory. Simply click on the \u201cLedger\u201d button to select it, and then click \u201cCONNECT\u201dselect ledger live if your ledger has been updated to the latest firmware and you use ledger live, or select legacy if it has not been updated in some timeOnce you have connected your Ledger, you need to tell MetaMask how to read it.If you have updated your Ledger to the latest firmware and have been using the Ledger Live application, you should select \u201cLedger Live\u201d and if you have not updated it, you should select Legacy.If you are unsure, start by selecting Ledger Live and looking at the grey box below it for your address, and Ethereum balance.MetaMask automatically sorts the addresses on your Ledger by balance, so if you have an Ethereum balance in the same address, this is the easiest way to identify your account.If you don\u2019t have an Ethereum balance on the address you want to connect, you need to identify the correct address by looking at the column with the 0x addresses to identify the correct one to choose.If the correct address isn\u2019t showing up, go back to the drop down menu, select \u201cLegacy\u201d and try the above steps again.Once you have found the correct address (in this case, in the pink box), click \u201cCONNECT\u201dYou are connected!your ledger is connected to metamaskYou\u2019ve now connected your Ledger to MetaMask.Now that you\u2019re connected we\u2019ll talk about a few important bits of information on this page by referencing the colored boxes.Blue: The blue boxes display your Ethereum balance that is in the address you selected. If you use multiple addresses on your Ledger, you will not see those balances, only the balance of the account you selected during setup.Green: Clicking on this box will copy your Ethereum address to your computers clipboard for pasting later.Orange: Any transactions you send or receive to or from your Ledger via MetaMask will show up here. Note that any transactions made previously wont show up in MetaMask.Pink: If you are using this address to manage Ethereum tokens, you will want to click here to add your tokens.This is a misleading button title. By clicking \u201cADD TOKEN\u201d you are not adding tokens to your address, but actually just telling MetaMask to display the balance of your tokens.Showing your token balancesclick on add tokenTo display the balance of a token, you first need to click on \u201cADD TOKEN\u201dchoose custom token if the token you are looking for is not yet searchableMetaMask has a library of tokens that are searchable, but in this case I am going to add a token which is not yet searchable.Click on \u201cCustom Token\u201dThe next thing you will need to do is to find the token\u2019s contract address. You can usually find it on the token issuers site, or by searching etherscan.io.In the case of this token, this is the Etherscan token page, and the contract address you are looking for is highlighted in the pink box.Copy this address. (be sure to copy the address only and not copy the link itself)paste the copied address into the token address fieldPaste the address you just copied into the \u201cToken Address\u201d field and the \u201cToken Symbol\u201d and \u201cDecimals of Precision\u201d boxes will automatically populate with the token from the address you pasted, in this case, ONE (0x4d807509aece24c0fa5a102b6a3b059ec6e14392).Click next.the token and any balance you have is displayedOn this final screen you will see a summary of the task you\u2019ve just performed. You will see the token you\u2019re adding, and any balance that you have in the address.If you should have a balance of tokens but it is displaying 0, you may need to check that either the address you chose during setup is the correct one, or that the contract address you used to add the token is correct.If all the information on this screen is correct, and your balance is showing, or if you don\u2019t yet have any of the particular tokens in that address yet, click on \u201cADD TOKENS\u201dDone!your tokens have been addedOn the left side of the screen below your Ethereum balance, you will now see the tokens that you just added displayed on the screen.Final thoughts\u2026A few final bits of information about this particular setup.Now that your Ledger has been connected once, you can open MetaMask and look at the balances of that address without having your Ledger connected, however if you need to send Ethereum or Tokens, you will need to connect your Ledger.You will not need to set up your Ledger each time you want to use it with MetaMask, unless you want to use a different address linked to your Ledger, in which case you follow the same steps as above.This setup makes interacting with dApps easy by making use of MetaMask, and keeps your tokens secure by storing them on your Ledger at the same time.You can add as many tokens as you like using the same method used above.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ledger Nano S", "Hardware Wallet", "Metamask", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "MetaMask\u7684\u512a\u52e2", "post_link":

MetaMaskSTAR BITFollowJul 5, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readSTAR BIT is the first decentralized exchange in Asia and based on 0x protocol, the most promising protocol for decentralized transactions. Our users can use their preferred wallet such as MetaMask and MyEtherWallet. Moreover, our designed mobile wallet, Star Wallet, will be launched shortly. It provides our users the most secured and easy-manipulated trading procedures.We will have an introduction to Star Wallet in the future. In here, we recommend our users a browser wallet \u2014 MetaMask. MetaMask is an ETH wallet developed by the former Apple team. It combines Ethereum and Google Chrome in which users can operate Ethereum Dapps and identity recognition on Chrome. It allows users to manage their own account. In the near future, MetaMask will support more token types on Ethereum.To have an easy-to-use and secure service, our platform can connect to users\u2019 MetaMask automatically. It can easily show users\u2019 assets on the upper left page of the website. By this mean, it doesn\u2019t require multiple windows, nor any complicated procedures.As a browser plugin, MetaMask creates the wallet in your local device and then connect to other knots on the blockchain. The private key is stored in the local computer but not inside the MetaMask database. For this reason, users don\u2019t have to worry about asset loss caused by the attack on MetaMask server.Furthermore, we will explain how to make a transaction through MetaMask at our exchange in the next article.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Metamask", "Learning", "Partnerships"]}, {"title": "My Etherwallet Kullan\u0131m\u0131", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@Rhua/my-etherwallet-metamask-kullan%C4%B1m%C4%B1-2588d037376?source=search_post", "author_name": "Rhua de Valec", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Rhua", "publish_date": "2018-03-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-06", "readtime": "3.08", "claps": 79, "voters": 14, "content": "My Etherwallet Kullan\u0131m\u0131MyEtherwallet\u2019ta C\u00fczdan Olu\u015fturmaRhua de ValecFollowMar 3, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readInternet taray\u0131c\u0131m\u0131zda https://www.myetherwallet.com/ adresine giderek, sol \u00fcstten \u201cNew Wallet\u201d se\u00e7ene\u011fini se\u00e7iyoruz.Kar\u015f\u0131m\u0131za a\u015fa\u011f\u0131daki ekran geldi\u011finde \u201cEnter a password\u201d yazan bo\u015flu\u011fa \u015fifremizi yaz\u0131p, ayn\u0131 \u015fifreyi bir ka\u011f\u0131da da not ald\u0131ktan sonra, alttaki \u201cCreate New Wallet\u201d butonuna t\u0131kl\u0131yoruz.\u015eifre olu\u015ftururken g\u00fcvenlik a\u00e7\u0131s\u0131ndan genel olarak; \u015fahsi bilgilerden ba\u011f\u0131ms\u0131z, tamamen rastgele, b\u00fcy\u00fck ve k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck karakterler, rakamlar, \u00f6zel karakterler kullanman\u0131z\u0131 ve en az 10 karakter kullanman\u0131z\u0131 tavsiye ederim.\u0130yi \u015eifre: dM&4PrNgC#7K\u00f6t\u00fc \u015eifre: ahmet1978\u201cCreate New Wallet\u201d a t\u0131klad\u0131ktan sonra kar\u015f\u0131m\u0131za gelen ekranda \u201cDownload Keystore File (UTC/JSON) butonuna t\u0131kl\u0131yoruz.

For those who haven\u2019t heard about this feel free to check out the intro to it here. In short, this will play a crucial role in helping improve the usability of the decentralized web.MetaMask respects your privacy and safety above all else so here is just a reminder of the number of steps we are taking:MetaMetrics will be opt-in. After opt-in, you can opt-out anytime.MetaMetrics will not collect sensitive data from users: No seed words, no public addresses, no private keys, and no data outside of the extension (we aren\u2019t reading your tabs).MetaMetrics data will only be used for guiding development through an understanding of how people are using the product. We will not profit off of your data. Ever.Data collected will be anonymous. Individual data points will be deleted in compliance with GDPR regulations.Data will be occasionally aggregated and shared with the community-at-large.Our codebase continues to be open source and open to audits at our GitHub.An important thing to reiterate on is that by opting into MetaMetrics you can help the us learn vital information. Info such as which feature do people use the most? What parts of the application do people run into the most trouble with? Where do people drop off when completing certain actions? All questions which we can find answers from valuable MetaMetrics information. This will lead to a better more intuitive MetaMask. Since launching MetaMetrics at the beginning of March, we have discovered we are averaging around 70,000 weekly active MetaMask users. A number we optimistically see growing and we continue to build out our feature set.Ethereum Object CapabilitiesLast Friday our own Dan Finlay visited the Gitcoin Livestream and talked a bit about how a concept called Object Capabilities could enhance security, composability, and scalability for accounts throughout the ecosystem. You can watch the live stream here or read his write-up here.Privacy Mode By DefaultStarting this month we started enabling Privacy mode by default for new account users. In addition we will be pushing an update to change existing users to Privacy mode by default as well. If some of you recall reading something like this before you are not mistaken. We announced this feature a few months ago here. The only difference is that now this privacy feature will be on by default! This essentially means that websites have to ask to see your Ethereum accounts. When a Dapp asks for permission to see your accounts, you\u2019ll see a MetaMask popup like this:It\u2019s important to know that when privacy mode is enabled, MetaMask will not automatically expose user accounts to webpages. If privacy mode is disabled MetaMask will automatically expose user accounts to websites as it did in the past.Why wasn\u2019t Privacy mode on by default from the beginning?This is an ecosystem-wide standard that requires dapps to update how they access user accounts. Since it was announced, we\u2019ve been diligently coordinating with other dapps and dapp browsers.We didn\u2019t want this privacy standard to disrupt users\u2019 workflows, so we provided a lengthy upgrade period that gave developers time to update their applications.After almost five months, we\u2019re happy to see that nearly all top dapps have updated to support the new standard, and we\u2019re ready to make this the default experience for all MetaMask users.Going ForwardIf you\u2019re visiting a Dapp that still isn\u2019t EIP 1102 compliant, the site may not work as expected. In this case you will have to head to your Settings menu, turn Privacy Mode \u201coff,\u201d and try reloading the Dapp again.The MetaMask team has always build its product with security and privacy in mind and we firmly believe EIP 1102 is a crucial step towards a safe, user-friendly decentralized web.Release notesMetaMask v6.3.0 is out and auto-updating in browsers near you. Next time you pop it open, check out some of the improvements listed below. These changes are new as of this month.Added MetaMetrics usage analytics system. Off by default but If you consent, we\u2019ll record anonymized events to better understand the features users gravitate towards, which features go unused, how funnels leak, and so on. (#6171)The gas chart is now hidden on custom networks. This change was made to avoid confusion when not on Ethereum networks. (#6300)We improved the design and the UX of the onboarding flow proving new users a more intuitive experience (#6192)We now cancel transactions and signature requests that populate in Metamask transaction history when you closing of notification window. (#6340)Fixed gas fees in the submitted step of the transaction details activity log Prior to this PR, transactions created outside of metamask could represent the submitted gas fee (incorrectly) as \u20180 wei\u2019 in the activity log. (#6301)Added wyre for fiat to Crypto onboarding. (#6302)Fixed notification popups not showing when screen size was abnormal for better user preference flexibility. (#6312)We added a new experimental API to allow apps to prevent reload when users change the selected network. This was added to help UX for sites that are willing to put in the extra work. Developers can learn to use it here: (#6330)Enable mobile sync for the Beta (#6332)Redesign of the settings screen for overall design improvement (#6333)Disabled the transaction \u201cCancel\u201d button when your balance is insufficient. This will prevent you from sending a Cancel transaction when you don\u2019t have enough gas to do so. #6341)Enable privacy mode by default for first time users. This essentially means that websites and Dapps will have to ask to see your Ethereum accounts.

Do you want to know why? Because I think we\u2019re about to see a new breed of application. One that is \u201cowned by everyone\u201d, or the entire network of participants, instead of a single entity. I affectionately call them Apps For All, and if we can get them to work they\u2019ll be a major new innovation.But there\u2019s a problem right now. Nobody knows how to design DApps, and nobody knows how to develop user-facing ones. We need to change that now.When I started to write my first DApp, I had no idea how the UI should work. What should the UI flow look like for allowing a user to write something to a blockchain? How do you let a user execute a transaction from the UI? Why is MetaMask necessary for a DApp, how do you integrate it, and at what point does it get displayed to the user?My goal in this article is to demonstrate how I designed and developed a \u201cUI Checkout Flow\u201d for a decentralized application that lets users register a photographic asset on the Ethereum blockchain. Along the way, I hope to explain to new Ethereum developers why MetaMask is a critical component of any user-facing DApp, and at what point in a UX interaction it should get displayed.MetaMaskMetaMask is a wallet and a Chrome extension. As a wallet, it holds Ether and allows you to pay for things on Ethereum. A lot of people use it as a convenient middleman wallet to buy ICO tokens with from a browser.But more importantly, MetaMask allows any regular user from a Web application to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with DApps. This is MetaMask\u2019s true strength. Without the MetaMask Chrome extension installed, users cannot interact with a DApp from a browser. They\u2019d have to set up their own independent Ethereum node.Metamask modal and extensionSetting up an independent Ethereum node is a lot of work. It means a user of your DApp would have to download the entire Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, constant updates from the blockchain would have to be downloaded and synchronized to the user\u2019s computer so that the user could stay current with fresh transactions from the network.Average users won\u2019t do that, so MetaMask is a requirement. If a user doesn\u2019t have MetaMask installed, you need to tell them to install it before they can use your DApp.Following good design principles, you should notify users to install MetaMask at the point in your DApp\u2019s UX interaction where it\u2019s obvious they intend to do something. Don\u2019t notify them when they first arrive at your DApp, that\u2019s bad UX. I\u2019ll show you what I mean in a moment.Notification popup if MetaMask is not installedThe Smart ContractI\u2019m going to show you the UI checkout flow for my DApp which is titled Proof Of Ex.Proof Of Ex (short for Proof Of Existence), is just a simple proof of concept at this point. It\u2019s also a good use case for a blockchain. The application lets users register their unique photographic assets to the Ethereum blockchain to prove authorship. Since blockchains are immutable and open for all to see, it\u2019s the perfect record for displaying to the world who created what and when.Proof Of Ex is backed by a very simple Smart Contract that provides functions to check if a photographic asset has already been registered. If it hasn\u2019t, it allows a user to register that asset. It does this by creating a SHA-256 hash of a digital asset (the photo), and maintaining a hash map of registered hashes in its permanent memory.Here is the simple contract that\u2019s behind Proof Of Ex.pragma solidity ^0.4.15;contract ProofOfExistence {  mapping (string => string) private proofs;  function storeProof(string proof, string email) {    proofs[proof] = email;  }  function registerAsset(string assetHash, string email) {    storeProof(assetHash, email);  }  function checkIfRegistered(string assetHash) constant returns  (string) {    return proofs[assetHash];  }}That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the main guts of this DApp prototype. Let\u2019s take a look at the sequence of views a user interacts with in order to register a digital asset.The UI Checkout FlowThese are the steps a user completes in order to register a photographic asset on the blockchain to prove authorship (and perhaps eventually earn royalties).Step 1 \u2014 Upload photographic assetThe first step a user takes in registering an asset is uploading it via the main interface (either drap \u2018n drop or upload file via HTML input box).In my case, I wanted to register this unique photo I took on Mount Shasta.Quart Crystal on Mount Shasta, CaliforniaStep 2\u2014 Verify MetaMask is installedRemember that MetaMask is required to make a DApp work from a Web interface. So what happens the first time the user tries to upload a unique photo and doesn\u2019t have MetaMask installed?The first thing your DApp needs to do is detect whether or not MetaMask is installed. You can do this easily since MetaMask provides a web3 object on the window object in your browser. I show developers how to properly detect MetaMask in my course How To Write A React DApp For Ethereum.So if MetaMask is not installed, a modal prompting the user to install it gets displayed when the user clicks \u201cRegister Photo On Blockchain\u201d.Please note that I don\u2019t display this notification modal when my DApp first loads. That\u2019s annoying UX. You only want to prompt users to install MetaMask when they perform an action that demonstrates their intent to actually use your DApp.If MetaMask isn\u2019t installed, notify the userStep 3\u2014 Enter credentialsIf MetaMask is already installed, after uploading a photo and clicking \u201cRegister Photo On Blockchain\u201d users will be immediately forwarded to the next view in order to enter personal credentials (no notification modal will be displayed).Users must include their email address to verify authorship. The MetaMask wallet ID is retrieved automatically from MetaMask and displayed to the user. After entering a valid email address, the user may proceed.Step 4\u2014 Check if asset has already been registeredNext, the application tells the user that it\u2019s generating a unique SHA-256 hash of the digital asset; however, what\u2019s going on behind the scenes is that the application is communicating with the Smart Contract to see if the hash has already been registered.If the hash of the asset has already been registered on the Ethereum blockchain, the user is notified.Otherwise, the SHA-256 hash is generated for the asset and displayed to the user. The user is now allowed to proceed to the next step in the checkout flow.Step 5\u2014 Confirm transaction detailsBefore you execute any type of transaction that may change the state of any database, you must confirm details with the user. So the application confirms with the user the information that was provided, and it allows the user to go back to previous views if there\u2019s any mistake.Step 6\u2014 Launch MetaMaskAfter the user reviews the information and clicks the \u201cRegister\u201d button, the DApp transacts with the Smart Contract from the UI to register the asset.This is where the MetaMask modal gets displayed to the user in the checkout flow.If a user\u2019s MetaMask wallet has sufficient funds to pay the transaction fee, then upon clicking the \u201cSubmit\u201d button in MetaMask, the transaction is executed on the Ethereum network and the asset officially gets registered on the blockchain.Step 7\u2014Confirm successful registrationOf course, visual feedback needs to be provided to the user indicating what the result of the transaction was. Did it fail or succeed?That\u2019s it!Get The CodeWould you like to get the code for this DApp? It was developed with React and Redux which is extremely popular at the moment (and for good reason).Do you want access to a professional and scalable front-end foundational boilerplate for your prototype or startup? Do you need to see how to connect a modern UI to a Smart Contract, and learn how to use Ethereum\u2019s Web3.js library so you can transact on the Ethereum network?Then check out my course How To Write A React DApp For Ethereum. In the course, I get you set up with the perfect modern front-end for a large-scale Single Page Application with the right JavaScript and CSS architecture that will save you time and headaches (seriously, I do).Not only that, I teach you (step-by-step) how to use the immensely effective design pattern Redux so you can build a UI for your DApp that\u2019s easy to manage and scale. Everything is integrated with Truffle, the leading DApp development framework today.My name is Mark, and I\u2019m a UI Engineer and Ethereum Developer in the San Francisco Bay area.

This month, we\u2019ve shipped even more improvements to reduce our traffic to Infura and eliminate unnecessary requests. v6.1.0 includes a set of changes that bring MetaMask very close to going network silent while not in use, and early reports suggest we\u2019ve reduced our overall number of requests by 50%. Laptop batteries around the world rejoice.MetaMetrics: help us help you \ud83d\udcc8MetaMask is a crucial tool for blockchain newcomers, traders, developers, and beyond. The qualitative feedback we get from these different user groups can vary widely. In pursuit of making more data-driven decisions in our UI, MetaMask will begin rolling out an opt-in metrics system starting next week. If you consent, we\u2019ll record anonymized events to better understand the features users gravitate towards, which features go unused, how funnels leak, and so on.Our metrics collection takes a strong stance on user privacy: it will never collect public addresses, private keys, transaction IDs, or transaction hashes. We\u2019ll also obfuscate the last nine digits of any IP addresses. Users can opt-out of metrics collection at any time. Last, MetaMask will never profit from sharing or selling your data, ever.We\u2019ll use this anonymized data to inform our development and create a better MetaMask for all. We also look forward to sharing high-level data with the community! To read more, check out last week\u2019s announcement.R.I.P. Old UI \u26b0\ufe0fAt long last, we\u2019ve removed the old legacy interface from the MetaMask codebase. For a full list of all the things the current UI can do that the old one couldn\u2019t, check out this support article. In addition to providing a better experience for users, this will simplify our testing suite and reduces our bundle size substantially.We received some great feedback from the community after announcing our plans to migrate users over to the new interface. In response, we\u2019ve shipped the ability to turn on \u201cadvanced\u201d gas editing, which adds plain text inputs to the Send and Confirm screens. While our simpler gas options work well for newer users, some veterans missed the no-click accessibility of granular gas control right on the confirmation page. If that sounds like something you\u2019d like, you can find the toggle in your Settings menu.Toggle between these display options from your Settings menu.Least Authority & MetaMask Mobile \ud83d\udd10We\u2019re still hard at work on MetaMask Mobile. As we get closer to launch, the team wants to make sure we\u2019re delivering the best-in-class security you\u2019ve come to expect. We\u2019ve partnered with Least Authority to do a security audit on MetaMask Mobile and make sure we continue to provide a safe experience on the decentralized web. Results of the audit will be published in mid-March!An update from Mustekala \ud83e\udd91Our light client team (codenamed Mustekala) is nearing completion of an MVP implementation of the KSN protocol. KSN is an open source protocol on top of libp2p that enables all kind of devices to share slices of the Ethereum Database, taking synchronization and reading to the next level. At the same time, the team is preparing for what comes next \u2014 maybe including a simple incentivization protocol on top of KSN.

In the article, you will find essential information about the token Public Sale and also token purchase instructions from start to finish, with the consideration that you have already registered for the Public Sale on Spectre.ai website.In order to participate in the token sale, you will need to have ETH available in your wallet. If you do not have the necessary ETH available, you can purchase the required amount from Cryptocurrency exchanges like Poloniex, Kraken and Coinbase.One will need to register for the Public Sale before gaining access to the Token Sale portal which is the only place to find the Spectre.ai token sale contribution ETH address.It\u2019s important to note the following regarding the dates of the Public Sale: *Token Sale starts on the 17th of November 2017 at 12:00pm (noon) GMT. *Token Sale ends on the 10th of December 2017 at 11:59:59am GMT.  *If the user logs in before the token sale has started, they will not see the Spectre.ai official contribution ETH address \u2014 this will be made visible as soon as the token sale initiates.It\u2019s important to note the following so that you receive the tokens for your ETH contribution:*The only place to find the ETH contribution address is inside the token sale portal on Spectre.ai . There are many sites and ads that will try to scam you, so please bookmark spectre.ai on your browser.*The last 4 digits of the ETH address will be available inside Telegram, our Facebook page and our Twitter account. Always double check this before submitting a contribution.*Do not make a contribution form an exchange ETH address or from a wallet of questionable reputation. MyEtherWallet, Metamask and Mist are the best options, with the former 2 being the faster ones to set up. A hardware wallet is also an option.*Minimum contribution is 1.00 ETH.*Users may contribute any amount (1.00 ETH minimum still applies) regardless of the pledged contribution amount defined during their registration.In addition to the above, here is some essential information about the tokens: *Upon contribution, the user will receive \u201cStem tokens\u201d within a few minutes and these will appear in their ETH wallets they used for the contribution. Corresponding bonus will appear along with, and in the form of the \u201cStem tokens\u201d. Please note that the users might need to manually add the custom tokens to their wallets. *The \u201cStem tokens\u201d will not be transferable until the end of the Public Sale on the 10th of December.*The \u201cStem tokens\u201d will become transferable shortly after of the Public Sale. Instructions on how to exchange them will be available inside the token sale portal right after the end of the token sale. *After the end of the Public Sale, users will have 28 days to convert their \u201cStem tokens\u201d to either Dividend or Utility tokens, depending on their preference. Any unconverted \u201cStem tokens\u201d will automatically become Dividend or Utility tokens, meaning they will not be lost. *Spectre Stem token\u2019s symbol is SXS *Spectre Utility Token\u2019s symbol is SXU *Spectre Dividend Token\u2019s symbol is SXDTime to go through the process of contributing to Spectre.ai ICO.Step 1Go to https://metamask.ioStep 2Select Get Chrome Extension.Step 3Select Add to Chrome.Step 4Select Add extension.Step 5The MetaMask icon should appear at the top right corner of the browser \u2014 click on it.

challenge due to the nature of how browsers were not designed with identity and payment mechanisms baked in. Generally, those selling a product wish to reach the broader global market, but are limited to credit card and Paypal payments that require permissioned systems and possibly paid APIs to work with. In addition, there are difficult problems to solve when deciding to handle customer payments, involving verifying who actually made a payment. Here is where MetaMask+EthJS+EthSigUtil come in. This suggested solution includes a 3 step technical workflow, and it is a surprisingly pleasant user experience: 1) register a public address with the site by digitally signing a challenge phrase with personal_sign. Signature of a hashed message is performed off-chain to prevent chosen cipher and replay attacks 2) server side personal_ecRecover is used to verify the digital signature was created by the address 3) allow acceptance of payment by giving the user easy access to seeing tokens and/or ether in a wallet on your site. Even if you do not want to manage customer sessions with this method, it is effective for solving the problem of accepting crypto payments and being able to verify a person that said they paid you, really did. A full demo is included and linked to at the bottom of this document to demonstrate the process. It uses Metamask + EthJS + EthSigUtil + TruffleBoxes + Angular components. At the backbone of all this, we use Elliptic Curve Cryptography.Introduction: You want to accept Ether and ERC20 tokens as payment for your service, but you don\u2019t have a way of performing KYC with a user, since this type of payment was fundamentally designed to be decentralized, which circumvents the entire banking infrastructure. This is by design, and avoids a centralized authority. In addition, you may not have the financial means to establish a business relationship with a bank, nor the legal right to establish API access with a payment processor. This proposes a solution to verifying payments from digital identities using signatures. You can then use this public address to associate payments with a customer on your site.Challenges: Transactions for cryptocurrency and digital \u201cUtility Tokens\u201d are recorded on a global, open blockchain, and you might have people that scan the transactions sent to your smart contract or designated wallet addresses. There are many benefits to a public, open decentralized ledger, but there might also be bad actors on the system that wish to make false claims that it was them that paid you, and not the person that actually paid you. This is a problem on multiple levels. It takes time to fend off false claims by investigating and tracking down the IPs and discovering evidence postmortem in order to determine who the actual sender of cryptocurrency / token payment was. This archeological endeavor is fraught with error, especially if the genuine payer took precautions on his or her end to anonymize his location through a tangled web of VPNs. Even after wasting precious time investigating the situation, you might credit the wrong user with the purchase. This will result in you losing a customer, and possibly end up refunding the wrong individual.Possible Method (Rejected - Traditional / Centralized): When a user establishes an account with your service, you generate a new address for that user to accept tokens to send to at the point of sale. Unfortunately, this means you have to keep track of a new private key, and a mapping of users to account keys. This is both mess, grows geometrically over time for each payment, and is hard to keep track of. Even worse, your centralized server becomes a target of DDoS and security attacks. For these reasons, I reject this approach and suggest a New Paradigm for accepting Payments and dealing with cryptocurrency / ERC20 token payments.Proposed Solution (New Paradigm / Decentralized): Reverse the paradigm for security. Store as little as possible about your customer. Only store their PUBLIC address. How would this work? At the point a user enters their address, issue a strong cryptographic challenge. Send the user a message that is unique and random that must be digitally signed. The message will be clearly visible to the user, which makes the user confident that they are not signing a transaction with devious intent. This message is then sent into a *one-way hash, is digitally signed by the unlocked user\u2019s account with the use of a Nonce and a private key on their own device, and the output is a digital signature that is sent to the server issuing the challenge. The server uses Elliptic Curve cryptography to recover the address used to sign the message, and compares that recovered address with the expected result.What Makes This Possible: We already have all the tools available to make this happen. ECDSA technology has existed since the early 1990s, however, many modern browsers still don\u2019t have identity of payments built in to the platform. A product called MetaMask offers users with an extremely easy way to securely store cryptographic key pairs. With this browser extension available on Chrome, a selected account acts as the \u201cavailable\u201d address that gets injected into a site that is Web3 enabled. These days we refer to Web3 enabled sites as the front-end UI for Dapps, apps that work with a decentralized blockchain like Ethereum. There are also plenty of other open source tools that have come available since the invention of the Bitcoin protocol and open source software through the most popular open source platform called Github. We will rely on several of the frameworks available, especially Web3JS, EthJS, and eth-sig-util. For the purposes of demo, we will use OpenZeppelin, the TruffleFramework, Angular and Node, as well as their dependencies.Why This is So Powerful: With cryptographic key pairs made available to the user in a very user friendly way, it makes cryptocurrency, Token Payments and also DIGITAL SIGNATURES extremely painless to work with. No longer will you have to be a tech guru with a console based application and know-how of a complex set of instructions in order to perform basic security operations that lie at the heart of public/private key cryptography.Digital Signatures provide a way to undeniably verify that only the owner of a private key could have possibly signed a particular message. 1) You can challenge a user to identify themself NOW, or at any point in the future, in real time, at the point of sale. 2) You can store a message signature that was signed by a user and hold 100% undeniable proof that the user authored it or had at one point in time. This is especially useful for assigning record of ownership, or maintaining contract and end user license agreements. 3) Because the message that is signed is first sent into a 1-way cryptographic hash, you can verify that the data was not manipulated in any way. The hash function has the properties of exhibiting the following properties: A) Irreversible; computationally infeasible to determine the message from its digest, B) Collision resistant; impractical to find more than one message that provides a given digest, and C) High avalanche effect; any small change has a significant change in digest.In the proposed solution, No Ether is Required for signing. Signatures can be performed without the use of public blockchain, which means that replay attacks of signed messages are not possible, preventing a user from appearing as a certain user, and you could extend this idea by having the digital signature verification server issue a cookie to the user in order to stay logged in.Concerns: Relying on public-key cryptography means that the user must protect his identity as if it was his money. His private key becomes his identity. If the user loses their private key or is compromised, there is no way to prevent other users from making payments from that address on their behalf. A user would still have to use the traditional methods of interacting with the website to re-establish a new payment address. Since we are dealing with payment methods and not full blown identities and logins in this solution, we do not suffer major consequences like we would if we were dealing with catastrophic loss of identity for a site.This isn\u2019t entirely new; what makes this special? True. We have had this cryptographically provable EC method since 1994, where y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. We have had tools like BitID, relying on public-key cryptography for e-commerce. The DIFFERENCE NOW, is that we finally have the tools to make the end-to end USER EXPERIENCE cleaner, seamless and enjoyable. It must be a user experience that is as painless as possible. That is what will allow us to have more widespread adoption of payments with cryptocurrency and ERC20 tokens. Using QR codes is less than ideal, let alone looking at one for very long. They are ugly and nearly impossible to visually verify accuracy.Simple Prerequisite: Install Metamask.io Chrome Plugin. MetaMask \u201cis a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows access to dApps without running a full node. Users securely manage identity and transactions. Upon installing and starting MetaMask for the first time, the user is given a 12 word seed phrase to restore accounts created within MetaMask. Users can Switch Accounts or Add new accounts as well. Private keys are stored locally and encrypted; they never leave the application, and are never sent to a server. When the user performs an action in the browser that requires a transaction to be signed, it asks Web3 to send a transaction, which prompts MetaMask for confirmation; the user accepts. No synchronization with a ethereum network is required for a user because nodes are maintained by Infura, remotely.Metamask is not a HARD requirement; any Injectable Web3 provider that supports the personal_sign and personal_ecRecover methods, as well as an intuitive UX would do. We use these methods as opposed to the eth_sign and eth_ecRecover to prevent chosen cipher attacks.Workflow: 1) User adds a method of payment for Ether or ERC20 tokens with MetaMask installed and Account selected. 2) Website \u201cchallenges\u201d user with readable text as well as a random message in the visible text. User accepts to proceed signing. 3) Back-end server uses elliptic curve functions to send in the digital signature and recover the public address used by the signer. 4) A match of the recovered signature and the expected signature is all that is needed to verify the user is who they say they are. 5) Optionally store this digital signature as proof of acceptance for a EULA agreement. 6) Allow wallet info to be displayed on the UI of the dApp for sending tokens.Repercussions: Any site that offers eCommerce can offer Ether & ERC20 compliant tokens as a Method of Payment today. This technology will work no matter if you are a large multinational conglomerate, or if you are just a kid sitting at home dreaming up an idea for a decentralized platform to disrupt the online marketplace. This technique has extraordinary implications. You can can easily accept payments from around the world without a service like Paypal. You don\u2019t need a relationship with a bank. You don\u2019t need to store personal information about your customer. This is a new paradigm that flips ecommerce on its head, especially for the purchase of digital assets or IP.Demonstration: Here\u2019s how it looks in practice. The point of the project is to demonstrate how the majority of web applications in existence could start doing this now. The UI has not been styled; there is no point to waste time on that since each app will already have its own styling and branding. Any interaction that requires the user to be prompted to CANCEL or ACCEPT the fully transparent digital signature challenge, will rely on the use of the MetaMask browser extension.Open Source Example: https://github.com/emmonspired/erc20-digital-signature-verifyAuthentication / Verification Example*User Signs a Random Message that is displayed to the user. This message is hashed and then is digitally signed by a Web3 provider, like MetaMask. In the future this could be some other provider that implements personal_sign like a Ledger / Nano, or even signed using a third party site like MyEtherWallet.com*Example Code that takes the Digital Signature and extracts information from it in the Elliptic Curve personal_ecRecover function to undeniably verify a particular address signer.Wallet Injection in the BrowserConnect to Web3Display Wallet / Account InformationAbility to Send ERC20 Tokens (Potential for improvement: instead of user specifying how many tokens to send, the application could present the user with an amount that fluctuates with the market value of ETH/USD or ETH/Token, or obviously a pegged price.Not Included: Room for improvement in the Demo Open Source CodeNode/Java backend; we simulate the verification step here with the click of a button, but it gets the overall point across and demonstrates the inputs/outputs required to verify.What to do to process payment on the backend, post blockchain transaction confirmation.Dependencies: Tech stack includes, but is not limited to:Truffle Framework, Truffle Boxes: LimelabsTech/limelabs-angular-boxAngular, SCSS, Typescript, Async/Await, Bootstrap3, AxiosWeb3js, EthJS, EthSigUtilThese dependencies provide a user-driven working example for understanding and developing the base of a Web3 enabled application for working with the truffle framework and Angular. It also provides a basic example for working with ERC20 compliant tokens. Screenshots below.Again, to give credit where it is due, several man-hours of research was poured over to come to this solution and standard for accepting payments while being able to verify them. I did not have to invent any of the following myself: ECDSA, MetaMask, EthJS, EthSigUtil, Angular, OpenZeppelin, and the many other open source projects that were relied upon to get here. I am just putting it all together in a demo in a user-friendly and developer-friendly package in hopes of sparking a decentralized payment fire and getting this in the hands of many developers.Dan Emmons February 7, 2018CBP | @emmonspired | LinkedIn ProfileSpecial thanks to Dan Finlay @danfinlay for all the work he has done sharing his work with the community, especially some of his examples that I incorporated into this Angular based solution.Special thanks to MetaMask @metamask for all the work Infura has done to bring Ethereum blockchain 1 step closer to feeling like Ethereum is a native part of the dApps browser experience for a user.Special thanks to Maxim Integrated for the massive amount of explanation and research provided regarding The Fundamentals of an ECDSA Authentication System.#1 Digital Signature Challenge Step#2 Verify Step#3 Verified Signature Allows Tokens to be Sent#4 User Accepts & Signs Transaction, Broadcasts to Network#5 Etherscan : : Broadcasted Transaction Pending#6 Etherscan :: shows Transaction included in Block#7 UI Reports Transaction Successful#8 Metamask Shows Successful Payment#2B Alternate Demo: Digital Signature 1 Character Off Fails Verification#2C Alternate Demo: High Avalanche Effect - Hashed Message 1 Character Off", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Erc20", "Metamask", "Payments"]}, {"title": "Using MetaMask to improve your wallet security", "post_link": "https://medium.com/tradeconnect/using-metamask-to-improve-your-wallet-security-ac540fc932f2?source=search_post", "author_name": "TradeConnect", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@tradeconnect", "publish_date": "2018-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-03", "readtime": "1.40", "claps": 9, "voters": 6, "content": "Using MetaMask to improve your wallet securityTradeConnectFollowApr 14, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readUsing MetaMask to improve your wallet securityMyEtherWallet is great, but trying to access your funds directly in this way could leave you vulnerable to hackers.

You will be glad to know that you can sync your entire wallet (accounts, nicknames, tokens, transaction history) to MetaMask on Mobile so all your info is now with you on the go. Your desktop extension will simply generate a QR code and when scanned by your mobile device a sync of information will happen in seconds.InstaPayMetaMask Mobile also lets users enjoy instant and free (gasless!) payments with the use of Payment Channels via Connext. With the exception of your initial deposit and withdrawal from the payment channel, this feature enables gas-free payments between users. This creates one fast and seamless experience between wallets, browsers, and applications.Adding your dapp to the homepageThe browser homepage features a number of popular dapps from around the decentralized web.If you\u2019re a dapp builder who is interested in being featured on the homepage, please fill out this form to be considered \u2192 HEREPrivacy Mode (Now on by default)Last year, MetaMask introduced Privacy Mode, an ecosystem-wide standard to improve user privacy on Ethereum. Rather than exposing users\u2019 Ethereum addresses to all sites, Privacy Mode (detailed in EIP 1102) requires that websites ask for user consent before wallets reveal an address. In MetaMask v7.0, this will be enabled by default. Read about the full details \u2192 Here!Address BookCopy and pasting to send to public addresses can sure be a hassle especially if it\u2019s one you transact with often. It sure would be nice if you could save nicknames for accounts that aren\u2019t yours but you frequently interact with. Well now you can thanks to our new address book feature which will be rolling out to your desktop extension in the next few days! The Address Book is designed to provide convenience, transaction history clarity, and decrease the risk of sending to to the wrong address because the details will be saved to your account.3Box integrationThis week we\u2019ll be rolling out a version of MetaMask that integrates with 3Box to preserve user preferences!We\u2019ll back up an encypted copy of users\u2019 preferred settings, saved contacts, account nicknames, and token preferences. When a user restores their wallet on a new browser or device, they\u2019ll have the option of importing those preferences to get set up immediately. That\u2019s right, no more having to re add a token contract addresses again!3Box is a decentralized storage system build on OrbitDB. They\u2019re helping build the layer of user data on Ethereum to help make applications more robust and user-friendly.If you\u2019d prefer not to back up your lightweight account data, you can always opt-out via settings. As always, you are in control of your seed phrase & keys, which are not being backed up or sent anywhere as part of this integration.Check out the demo below showing a restoration of language settings and contacts after restoring an existing seed phrase.Shoutout of the Month!ElkThis months shoutout goes to Elk!

This means that MetaMask can now support loading ENS website (.eth) that are hosted on IPFS. When visiting decentralized sites, users can simply type in the domain name instead of long bytes of hashes. It is definitely a big step towards a better solution for easier access to the decentralized contents.This has been one of the efforts that Portal Network has been putting for more user adoption in entire blockchain ecosystem.We are glad that our contribution to MetaMask has been accepted for their newest update!How to install MetaMask?Visit MetaMask official website and click \u201cGET CHROME EXTENSION\u201d. It will then guide you to the Chrome Store where you can easily download the MetaMask extension.Introducing ENSENS compatibility is the main feature of this update. This implementation deals with the mapping between ENS and the decentralized resources address in an elegant way. Simply type a \u201c.eth\u201d URL and MetaMask will resolve ENS domains to IPFS hash and redirect the browser to the related content. Hosting sites on ENS and IPFS reduce the risk of hacking and phishing that comes out one after another.Sites on IPFSDifferent Sites hosted on IPFSWith the newest MetaMask installed, you can now view any IPFS sites listed here:http://portalnetwork.ethhttp://game.portalnetworkweb.ethhttp://phyrextsai.ethhttp://christophershen.ethhttp://dtube.portalnetworkweb.ethhttp://blockwatch.portalnetworkweb.ethThe ambition for ENS is very promising, and will play a fundamental role in shaping the Ethereum development as the platform becomes more mature. Just like DNS, ENS definitely has the potential to become the cornerstone of Ethereum Network.Follow Portal Network\u2019s Channels for the latest update.>>>  Join telegram -> Telegram <<<>>>  Build your decentralized website -> Web Builder <<<Social Media: Telegram|Reddit|Twitter | Facebook | Github |Websites & Product: Official Website|Web Builder|Hackathon|", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Metamask", "Ens", "Blockchain", "Latest", "Domains"]}, {"title": "A complete guide to using MetaMask (updated version)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/publicaio/a-complete-guide-to-using-metamask-updated-version-cd0d6f8c338f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Publica.com", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@publicaio", "publish_date": "2018-08-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-24", "readtime": "7.74", "claps": 90, "voters": 6, "content": "A complete guide to using MetaMask (updated version)Publica.comFollowAug 23, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readHow to create a cryptocurrency wallet with MetaMask?If you are wondering how to create a new cryptocurrency wallet, consider creating one by installing the MetaMask extension.MetaMask is a free and secure browser extension that allows web applications to read and interact with the Ethereum blockchain.Step 1.

MetaMask enabled Ethereum users and developers to easily use ETH and ERC-20 tokens, and use DApps without needing to use command-line tools or run their own node (thanks to Infura).Aion realized this early on, which is why they had BlockX Labs build AIWA, a wallet and DApp interaction tool for Aion, for them. As Project Manager for AIWA, I\u2019d like to go over the process that we undertook when building \u201cMetaMask for Aion\u201d; specifically, both the inspiration as well as the differentiation. I\u2019ve written this for product people and executives so I\u2019ve kept the jargon quite light.Why do you need a wallet?Firstly, you need to justify why your blockchain needs its version of MetaMask. As mentioned above, you want developers and users to interact with it. They need to read and write data and possibly send and receive cryptocurrency, If your blockchain is like Ethereum and Aion, you\u2019ve got a distributed app ecosystem that needs to interact with it.Without a wallet, it\u2019s a lot more difficult for both developers and users to use your blockchain, so reduce the friction and provide them with tool(s) to make it easier.What do you love about MetaMask?Since you\u2019ve got a reason to build a MetaMask-like tool, think about what you love about MetaMask and decide whether you want or need those features. At BlockX Labs, we like that MetaMask is honest with how it maps Ethereum\u2019s features to its UI. MetaMask doesn\u2019t hide or abstract away complexity but exposes it to the user. For example, it shows the raw gas price (in GWei) rather than abstracting it away by converting it to USD.It also differentiates between seed-generated and imported wallets, so that the user can know which wallets are recoverable from the seed phrase. We also love that MetaMask doesn\u2019t keep the user inside MetaMask; it provides links to Etherscan for viewing more transaction details and embeds the ability to use Coinbase and ShapeShift for acquiring Ether. It supports third-party services and doesn\u2019t try to hold the user captive by doing everything itself.Forget about MetaMask!Once you\u2019ve found the features that you love about MetaMask, it\u2019s time to forget about it. Here at BlockX Labs, we use Agile with Scrum. I recommend writing user stories to figure out what user and developers will do with your tool and build your UI around that.In our case, some of the basic features like the receive screen and how the DApp popped up ended up working pretty similarly to MetaMask. But by focusing on our user stories and not trying to clone MetaMask, we came up with a unique hierarchical interface that is modeled around the Token < Wallet < Vault metaphor.As a result, we came up with the idea of a Vault to contain both seed-generated wallets and imported wallets in a single exported file. This makes it super easy for users to backup all of their wallets regardless of whether they\u2019re seed-generated or imported from private keys. Of course, we also built the option to export individually using the standard wallet format as well.</end>Although it\u2019s heavily influenced from my experience building AIWA, hopefully this article has given a decent overview of building something like MetaMask for your own blockchain. I didn\u2019t mention some things that aren\u2019t part of the core product but help make it easier to use (like Infura, and NodeSmith in our case). But perhaps a follow-up article could address the ecosystem partners that would be useful.Have any suggestions on building Metamask for your own blockchain? We\u2019d love to hear them!

One of our advisors, a blockchain consultant to F500 companies, made an introduction to the organizers of the Blockchain Unbound event. Brian Young was integral to getting our CEO Eric invited to speak at the Tokyo conference.Eric will be speaking about reducing cryptoasset volatility for general consumer use. His recently granted patent filed in 2014 elaborates on a system to do just that using smart contracts and liquid derivatives markets. There are some characteristics unique to digital assets that enable this reality and he will be expanding on it during his session. By introducing familiar tools to cryptocurrency trading, the distributed ledger market can become more efficient. This outcome is analogous to Pareto\u2019s concept of promoting market efficiency by identifying small integral changes to improve the markets as whole. With improvements in the market, the blockchain economy can move passed mere speculation.While in Tokyo, we have meetings arranged with Japanese financial institutions and blockchain companies.

Since rolling out our privacy-first metrics system last month, we\u2019ve learned that token transfers account for 45% of transactions initiated from within the extension (as opposed to those initiated by a dapp). Right now, this requires selecting a token from the left-side hamburger menu, then going through a \u201cSend\u201d flow specific to that asset. \u201cToken\u201d is also one of our most common keywords in support requests.To make this flow smoother and more discoverable, we now allow users to select the asset they\u2019d like to send right from the general-purpose \u201cEdit Transaction\u201d screen (#6445). Next time you want to transfer tokens, you can start just by clicking the \u201cSend\u201d button on the home screen. (And for the eager: support for sending & managing ERC 721 tokens is coming soon!)The new \u201cAsset\u201d field on Send screensMetaMask Supports Goerli \ud83d\udd78MetaMask now includes a network option for the new (ish) Goerli testnet. Goerli is a proof-of-authority network that aims to be a reliable piece of infrastructure for building and testing dapps on Ethereum (#6459).Incident Report \u26a0\ufe0fLast week we began a slow roll-out of v6.4.0, which included many of the features & fixes detailed in the release notes below. In an effort to improve the legibility of our confirmation screens, 6.4.0 introduced a feature that would ping an external API (4byte.directory) to look up human-readable function names using a transaction\u2019s method signature. (We primarily rely on a Parity on-chain method registry, but nearly half of all transactions are contract interactions not found in the Parity registry. To any dapp devs reading: register your app\u2019s function names to help your users!)When we increased our rollout percentage to 100% on Thursday night, we brought down 4byte\u2019s API due to ineffective caching in the extension. Due to an overly long timeout period, this caused many users to encounter a minute-long spinner in place of the transaction confirmation they should have seen.For more detail on the issue, our response, and our learnings, you can read the incident post-mortem here.Foxes in the Community \ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0fMetaMask dev Jenny Pollack spoke about open source development this weekend at Recolor, a conference organized by she256 out of UC Berkeley. Check out this thread for a pull-quote overview of the day\u2019s panels. We are particularly proud of our former intern (and she256 co-founder) Sara Reynolds for her incredible work promoting diversity and representation in the blockchain space!Community manager Jason Lee also went on the record last week to describe some of the key decisions and principles behind MetaMask\u2019s growth over the past three years.

A Little reminder to never share any private key with anyone, never.Metamask walletNow let\u2019s debunk what transaction a decentralized application can do using metamask. Let\u2019s say you are browsing an application that sells digital collectibles kittens. You can decide to adopt/buy an adorable kitten and therefor you click a buy button. Below\u2019s an example window that Metamask suddenly pop meaning that the application requires your signature to approve a transaction involving values. The amount in this example is 0.02 ETH and there\u2019s a fee of 0.003114 ETH that goes directly to the miner who\u2019s going to execute this transaction. Ethers goes from \u201cAccount 1\u201d wallet to the \u201cNew Recipient\u201d wallet, which he\u2019s going to receive 0.02 ETH.

Individually, it allows you to be confident in the integrity of the data transmitted to and from you. Collectively, a diverse network of nodes is important for a blockchain\u2019s health and resiliency. Status was recently reminded of this during their Chaos Unicorn Day experiment.Although third-party nodes are extremely convenient, they will always be prime targets for hackers and you may not know that a service has been compromised until it is too late. Only by using your own node can you ensure the validity of your data.Historically, this has not been an easy task. Only once you\u2019ve researched and chosen a client, then figured out how to configure and run it via command line, have you earned the right to watch it sync. Client teams have made great strides in optimizing the time it takes to sync a node, but participating in the network remains a UX challenge.One of the goals of Ethereum Grid is to offer a simplified, streamlined user experience for participating in the Ethereum network. We believe the next UX milestone is to make running your own node at least as easy as using a VPN.Step 0: Download MetaMaskMetaMaskMetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of\u2026metamask.ioIf you don\u2019t already have MetaMask, you can download it from metamask.io. MetaMask is a browser extension that injects a web3 provider into your browser, so dapps (decentralized apps) can access data on the blockchain and make requests to your account, like submitting a transaction or signing data.Step 1: Download GridEthereum GridGrid\u2019s mission is to empower users with the latest and greatest of the Ethereum ecosystem toolset.grid.ethereum.orgGrid is available for Windows and Mac, with Linux support coming soon. You can download it at https://grid.ethereum.org.Step 2: Enable Geth to Communicate with MetaMaskIn this example, we\u2019ll use the Geth Ethereum client. Within Grid, click on Geth in the list of clients. Go to the Settings tab, and under RPC API, toggle it to Enabled for MetaMask. Note the network you would like to be on and your sync mode. Grid defaults to Main and Light, respectively.An aside: please exercise caution any time you are changing client settings. Some settings can get you into security trouble. When in doubt, stick with defaults.Step 2A: \u26a0\ufe0f A Firefox caveat \u26a0\ufe0fIf you\u2019re using Firefox, there\u2019s one more tweak to make. Because Firefox creates a unique extension address for each user, you will have to manually provide that address to Grid.To find the extension address, open MetaMask, select the Account Options (three-dot) menu and choose \u201cExpand View.\u201d This will open MetaMask in a full browser tab and your extension address can be found in the URL bar.Within Grid, scroll to the bottom of Geth\u2019s Settings tab and opt to \u201cUse custom flags.\u201d The flag --rpccorsdomains accepts multiple comma-separated values, so either add your MetaMask extension address alongside the Chrome address, or just replace it.Firefox generates a unique extension address for MetaMask, so requires this extra step in Grid. (Replace the X\u2019s with your extension address.)Be sure to omit /home.html from the extension address when adding it to the generated flags.Step 3: Turn on and sync GethSyncing the full blockchain state requires a nontrivial amount of resources, but now with clients supporting Light Sync Mode, the process should only take a few minutes \u2014 even shorter if you want to interact with a testnet, rather than mainnet.Step 4: Connect to MetaMaskAfter fully synced, change your network within MetaMask to Localhost 8545. You can verify your account balance shows correctly. If you aren\u2019t fully synced, it may show an incorrect or out-of-date balance.Step 5: Go forth!You\u2019re ready to use any dapp in the ecosystem. When you initiate a transaction, MetaMask will continue to provide the user interface, but funnel RPC commands through your locally running Geth node.Join a Colony, breed some Cryptokitties, trade assets on Uniswap, or explore other dapps on the official site.

While using a dApp browser may be the norm to existing members of the Ethereum community, this seemingly small ask from external individuals can cause them to completely abandon signing up. Do you think that your friends outside of crypto would continue signing up for a dApp after seeing this?This sort of user experience only serves to impede the adoption of this technology amongst the majority. When do you think was the last time that they had to install an external piece of software to be able to use a website or webapp? Excluding dApps, the last time for me was over a decade ago when I was still playing flash games.The fact is that we live in a time where websites / webapps ask you for your email and a password or offer you the ability to sign in with existing credentials (e.g. Facebook, Google, etc\u2026). To do anything else only serves as a means of potentially confusing the user or pushing them away from your product / service.So, it\u2019s no surprise to see the decentralized applications gaining the most traction (per DappRadar) moving away from the dApp browser and instead opting for traditional user signup / login. Developers taking such measures additionally free themselves of the tech debt, bugs, and compatibility issues faced by the majority still reliant on their dApp browser.Now, this isn\u2019t to say that dApp browsers are bad \u2014 the MetaMask team has done an immense amount of work over the past few years to craft a great user experience and provide a single piece of software for users within the community to use across decentralized applications. The fact of the matter is that it has grown so big that many decentralized applications are now running into compatibility issues between versions of it and internal dependencies (we, ourselves, ran into issues between web3js and Metamask versions).Compatibility issues have historically been the bane of many an engineering team \u2014 and to the degree where most are now electing to instead completely ignore users on specific platforms and instead urge them to use one which is supported. And in the same light, teams building decentralized applications are beginning to internalize their external MetaMask dependency in the form of their own wallet or are adopting one which is API-Based.Bitski and Portis\u2019 Sidechain SupportUntil recently, developers were only accessing SKALE through MetaMask. But with Bitski\u2019s recent release and SKALE\u2019s updates, we are excited to inform our community that anyone building on SKALE can now use both Bitski and Portis\u2019 API-Based wallets!For those of you who don\u2019t know Bitski or Portis, they both provide wallet hosting services for users as well as an API to access those wallets. Everything is encrypted (much like LastPass, but for web3) so that you can trust that nobody (aside from you) can view your passcodes. And given that everything is hosted in one place, users can easily migrate between devices. More on Bitski, here.We believe that the combination of SKALE\u2019s speed with the usability of these wallets will serve to further accelerate the adoption of decentralized applications amongst individuals outside of the blockchain community. We look forward to continued development of technologies focused on improving the user experience for decentralized applications and the bright future that they bring with them.Learn MoreIf you or someone you know is working on software focused on improving user experience, we\u2019d love to see it integrated with SKALE!

Wenn Du mit Deinem Rechner und einem Webbrowser wie z.B. Google Chrome, Brave oder Firefox im Web surfst, ist die MetaMask-Extension eine gute Variante, um auf speziellen Websites Transaktionen in der Blockchain zu initiieren. In Deinem Fall hei\u00dft das, Du verwendest die digitale W\u00e4hrung Ether, um eth-Subdomains, CryptoPunks, CryptoKitties oder DADA-Art zu nutzen. Auf der Website von MetaMask findest Du Links zu der Google Chrome Extension und auch zum Download des Browsers \u201eBrave\u201c, falls Du den lieber verwenden m\u00f6chtest. In beiden Varianten arbeitet MetaMask identisch.MetaMask WebsiteWie richte ich mir eine Wallet ein, komme an eine Ethereum-Adresse und benutze beides? So startest Du mit MetaMask.Auf der Website von MetaMask kannst Du ein kurzes Info-Video zur Funktionsweise von MetaMask anschauen (meine deutsche \u00dcbersetzung des Videos findest Du hier). F\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger l\u00e4sst es aber noch einige Fragen zur Installation und Benutzung offen. Wie Du MetaMask einrichtest und damit arbeitest, beschreibe ich kurz im Folgenden:Lade MetaMask im Google Chrome Web Store (in Chrome erreichbar unter chrome://apps/) herunter und installiere die Extension. MetaMask wird dann im Browser als kleines Fuchs-Symbol oben rechts neben Deiner Adresszeile angezeigt. Aber Vorsicht bei der Installation: Manchmal gibt es Anbieter, die an Deine ETH m\u00f6chten. Achte bitte darauf, dass Du das MetaMask installierst, das von https://metamask.io angeboten wird; ein Hinweis auf die korrekte Extension ist oft auch die Anzahl der Nutzer und die Anzahl der Bewertungen f\u00fcr das Produkt.Klicke auf das Fuchs-Icon, um mit dem Einrichten zu beginnen.1. Dir wird zun\u00e4chst eine \u201ePRIVACY NOTICE\u201c angezeigt, die Du durch Klicken auf \u201eAccept\u201c annehmen musst.MetaMask Privacy Notice annehmen2. Darauf folgen die \u201eTERMS OF USE\u201c. Lies sie durch. Bist du damit einverstanden, scrolle bitte an das Ende und klicke auf \u201eAccept\u201c.MetaMask Terms of Use annehmen3. Jetzt wird Dir ein Feld f\u00fcr das Passwort angezeigt. W\u00e4hle ein starkes Passwort aus. Es wird empfohlen, eines zu verwenden, das aus einer willk\u00fcrlichen Kombination aus Zahlen, Buchstaben und Sonderzeichen besteht und m\u00f6glichst lang ist. Schreibe Dir das Passwort auf, kontrolliere es und deponiere es an einem sicheren Ort. Du wirst es in Zukunft brauchen, um Dich in die MetaMask-Extension einzuloggen.MetaMask Passwort setzen4. Nach der Passworterstellung kommst Du auf eine Seite, auf der Deine Seed Phrase angezeigt wird. Dieser Satz ist SEHR wichtig! Schreib ihn auf, am besten mehrfach, und deponiere ihn an unterschiedlichen Orten. Du ben\u00f6tigst diese Seed Phrase, um Deinen MetaMask-Account wiederherzustellen, solltest Du einen neuen Browser nutzen oder die Extension nach einer Deinstallation neu installieren wollen. Mit dem Button \u201eSAVE SEED WORDS AS FILE\u201c kannst Du Dir eine digitale Kopie des Satzes anlegen. Hast Du alles sicher gespeichert und deponiert, dr\u00fccke auf \u201eI\u2019VE COPIED IT SOMEWHERE SAFE\u201c.!! Wichtig! MetaMask hat weder Dein Passwort, noch Deine Seed Phrase. Sollte Du eines von beiden verlieren, kannst Du nicht mehr auf Deine Konten zugreifen!MetaMask Seed Phrase sichern5. Nun wirst Du direkt in den Account 1, Deine erste MetaMask Ethereum-Adresse, geleitet. Sie findes Du unter dem Accountnamen, den Du \u00fcbrigens beliebig umbenennen kannst. Deine Adresse kannst Du Dir notieren, damit Du einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber Deine Konten beh\u00e4ltst. Wie Du sie einfach kopieren kannst, steht im folgenden Abschnitt (\u201eDetails zum Men\u00fc\u201c). Du solltest es vermeiden, Adressen per Hand abzuschreiben. Es k\u00f6nnen sich leicht Fehler einschleichen, und die notierte Adresse ist unbrauchbar, weil falsch.MetaMask Der erste AccountDetails zum Men\u00fcDu findest aber neben dem Accountnamen drei Punkte. Dort kannst Du mit einem Klick auf \u201eCopy Address to clipboard\u201c Deine Adresse in die Zwischenablage kopieren. Hast Du einen QR-Code reader, kannst Du Deine Adresse auch so kopieren oder weiter geben (siehe Men\u00fcpunkt \u201eShow QR Code\u201c).MetaMask Men\u00fcWenn Du Deine Kontobewegungen anschauen m\u00f6chtest, dann w\u00e4hle \u201eView account on Etherscan\u201c. Etherscan ist ein Service, der die Blockchain-Aktivit\u00e4ten anzeigt. Hier findest Du nicht nur Infos zu Deinen Transaktionen und Deinem Guthaben, sondern auch alle anderen Ethereum-Adressen, deren Transaktionen und Guthaben und noch einiges mehr. Auf Etherscan kannst Du also auf die Transaktionen beobachten, die Du mit Deinem Konto t\u00e4tigst und nachvollziehen, wann Du mit wem und unter Einsatz welchen ETH-Betrags was mit Deinem Konto gemacht hast.In dem kleinen Men\u00fc findest Du auch noch den Punkt \u201eExport Private Key\u201c. Das ist mit Vorsicht zu genie\u00dfen! Der Private Key wird gerne mit dem Hausschl\u00fcssel verglichen. Man bewahrt ihn sorgf\u00e4ltig und sicher auf und gibt ihn nicht \u2014 NIEMALS \u2014 weiter, erst recht nicht an Fremde. Niemand in der Krypto-Welt wird Dich nach Deinem Private Key fragen, au\u00dfer, er oder sie m\u00f6chte an Dein Geld. F\u00fcr Katzen, Punks und DADA-Kunst ben\u00f6tigst Du Deinen MetaMask Private Key nicht. Also greife erst auf ihn zu, wenn Du wei\u00dft, warum und was Du da tust.Die erste Transaktion durchf\u00fchrenHast Du Guthaben auf Deinem Konto, kannst Du Transaktionen durchf\u00fchren. Websites wie CryptoPunks, CryptoKitties und DADA.nyc haben Funktionen eingebaut, die Du nutzen kannst, sobald Du Dich in MetaMask eingeloggt und das richtige Konto ausgew\u00e4hlt hast. Eigentlich erkl\u00e4rt es sich von selbst, was Du wann tun musst. Kaufst Du z.B. einen CryptoPunk, klickst Du auf \u201eBuy\u201c, wartest, bis sich MetaMask \u00f6ffnet, kontrollierst den Kaufbetrag (\u201eAmount\u201c), das \u201eGas Limit\u201c (wird automatisch gesetzt) und den \u201eGas Price\u201c (wird automatisch gesetzt). Die Maximale Transaktionsgeb\u00fchrt (\u201eMax Transaction Fee\u201c) ist das Maximum, das f\u00fcr die Transaktion an Gas ausgegeben werden wird (meistens liegt die Geb\u00fchrt aber darunter). Unter \u201eMax Total\u201c siehst Du die Gesamtkosten Deiner Transaktion, die sich aus den eben aufgelisteten Posten ergibt.MetaMask Transaktion best\u00e4tigenKleine aber wichtige Anmerkung: Gas Limit und Gas Preis kann man manuell \u00e4ndern. Vor einigen Wochen noch konnte man f\u00fcr Transaktionen, die Zeit haben, einen niedrigen Gas-Preis von ca. 1\u20135 Gwei eingeben, f\u00fcr Transaktionen, die schnell best\u00e4tigt werden sollen entsprechend mehr, z.B. 10 bis 30 Gwei; das Gas Limit war mit 21000 gut gesetzt. Weil zurzeit jedoch sehr viele Transaktionen durchgef\u00fchrt werden, kann es sein, dass die Werte standardm\u00e4\u00dfig viel h\u00f6her eingestellt sind. Aktuell (Anfang Dezember) liegt er der Preis bei ca. 50 Gwei, das Limit variiert stark und kann dabei hoch ansteigen. Checke besser den Betrag unter \u201eMax Transaction Fee\u201c und \u201eMax Total\u201c und w\u00e4ge ab, ob Dir die Transaktion das angegebene Geld wert ist. Wird Dir in diesem Fenster eine Warnmeldung angezeigt, dann dr\u00fccke auf \u201eReject\u201c und versuche zu einem sp\u00e4teren Zeitpunkt, die Transaktion zu wiederholen.m M\u00f6chtest Du versuchen, Gas Limit und Gas Price selbst einzugeben, informiere Dich vorab auf z.B. ETH Gas Station nach den aktuellen Gaspreisen. Was genau Gaspreis und Gaslimit sind, kannst Du auf den Hilfeseiten von MyEtherWallet nachlesen.Dr\u00fcckst du nun auf \u201eSUBMIT\u201c, ist die Transaktion initiiert. Doch Vorsicht auch hier: Ist die Transaktion einmal auf den Weg gebracht, gibt es kein Zur\u00fcck (jedenfalls nicht f\u00fcr Einsteiger)! Man kann Transaktionen nicht stornieren oder nachtr\u00e4glich vom Kauf zur\u00fccktreten. Einmal angesto\u00dfen, nimmt die Sache ihren automatisierten Lauf! Wenn Du den Verlauf Deiner Transaktion verfolgen m\u00f6chtest, dr\u00fccke in MetaMask auf die Transaktion. Es \u00f6ffnet sich die entsprechende Seite auf Etherscan. Schau Dir das einmal in Ruhe an und lerne dabei, wie das alles funktioniert. Ist nicht ganz einfach, aber auch nicht wirklich schwer zu verstehen. \u00dcbrigens: Weil jede Blockchain-Transaktion selbst dann eine Geb\u00fchr (\u201eGas\u201c genannt) kostet, wenn man gar kein Geld verschickt oder wenn die Transaktion fehlschl\u00e4gt, ben\u00f6tigst Du f\u00fcr jede Art der Transaktion mit der Blockchain ein paar ETH. ETH hast Du m\u00f6glicherweise auf Deiner Ether Card bekommen. Wie sie von der Ether Card auf Dein MetaMask-Konto kommen, beschreibe ich Dir im folgenden Tutorial.!!! Good to know: Was Du zur Anzahl an Wallets wissen solltest:Du kannst beliebig viele Konten (Wallets) anlegen. Sie sind kostenlos und schnell zu erstellen (in MetaMask durch einen einfachen Klick auf \u201eCreate Account\u201c am unteren Ende der Liste mit den Konten). Du solltest Dir aber eine Liste mit Deinen Konten anlegen, um den \u00dcberblick nicht zu verlieren. Vielleicht macht es auch Sinn, f\u00fcr unterschiedliche Arten von Transaktionen unterschiedliche Konten zu haben. Zum Beispiel eins f\u00fcr Kitties, Punks und Kunst, eins f\u00fcr das Bezahlen des Feierabendbiers, eins f\u00fcr das Anlegen von Ethereum \u2026 Wie es Dir passt und gef\u00e4llt.!!! Good to know: Was Du zu Passw\u00f6rtern, Seed Phrases und Private Keys wissen solltest:Es ist WICHTIG!, sich die Seed Phrase, die automatisch generiert wird, korrekt aufzuschreiben und an einem sicheren Ort aufzubewahren! Das Gleiche gilt f\u00fcr das Passwort, das man selbst w\u00e4hlen muss. Geht die Seed Phrase verloren, und MetaMask muss neu installiert und eingerichtet werden, sind alle in MetaMask angelegten Wallets inklusive des Guthabens, Domains, CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks, Kunst und anderen Tokens und Assets, die sich darauf befinden, verloren! Also sichern, Backups machen, und das ganze nochmal. Und aufpassen: Die Seed Phrase ist \u2014 genau wie der Private Key \u2014 das Herzst\u00fcck Deiner Accounts. Behalte sie f\u00fcr Dich, gibt sie nicht an Fremde weiter, auch, wenn Du danach gefragt wirst. NIEMALS! WIRKLICH NIEMALS!!!! Good to know: Was Du zur Dauer und zu den Kosten von Transaktionen wissen solltest:Zurzeit ist das Ethereum-Netzwerk stark ausgelastet. Das hat f\u00fcr Dich und andere Nutzer zur Folge, dass Transaktionen im Moment ziemlich teuer sind (wegen des hohen Gas-Preises) und recht lange dauern, bis sie best\u00e4tigt werden (f\u00fcr diese Best\u00e4tigungen sind die \u201eMiner\u201c zust\u00e4ndig; sie bezahlst Du mit dem \u201eGas\u201c. Aber das kannst Du gerne selbst nachlesen). Hab also Geduld. Je nachdem, wie Du den Gas-Preis gesetzt hast, kann eine Transaktion schon einmal zwischen mehreren Stunden und einigen Tagen dauern! An der Stelle musst Du einfach abw\u00e4gen: Ist Dir eine schnelle Bearbeitung mehr Geld wert, oder wartest Du lieber und zahlst daf\u00fcr weniger \u2026 Ist die Transaktion bearbeitet, siehst Du auf Deinem Ether Card-Konto auf der MEW-Website ebenso wie auf Deinem MetaMask-Konto den ge\u00e4nderten Kontostand. Einmal best\u00e4tigt, k\u00f6nnen Transaktionen k\u00f6nnen nicht mehr r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig gemacht werden. Bevor Du in z.B. MetaMask auf \u201eSubmit\u201c dr\u00fcckst, solltest Du Dir wenigstens sicher sein, dass die Empf\u00e4ngeradresse und der zu \u00fcbermittelnde Betrag korrekt sind.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Tutorial", "Metamask", "How To"]}, {"title": "How to participate in the Relest ICO via Metamask wallet", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@relest/how-to-participate-in-the-relest-ico-b3a6841dcd77?source=search_post", "author_name": "Relest", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@relest", "publish_date": "2017-09-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-04", "readtime": "1.56", "claps": 57, "voters": 5, "content": "How to participate in the Relest ICO via Metamask walletRelestFollowSep 17, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readStep 1: Go to https://metamask.io/ and install the Chrome extension.Step2: Accept the conditionsStep 3: Enter a secure password and press \u201cCreate\u201d.Step 4: Save the seed on a secure place.Step 5: Click to \u201cSend\u201d button.

on an hourly/daily basis, and for the most part, it works very well. I am a fan of the new update, especially the jazzed-up UI. It appears the MetaMask team is working hard to deliver a quality product for its users, which has one of the largest user base on the Ethereum network. As of This month (November) MetaMask reached 1.3 million users. That is an impressive feat for any decentralized project in this space.TL;DRWant to cancel an order on the Ethereum blockchainGet an error message that includes \u201cnonce too low\u201dGo to MetaMask desktop clientSwitch from Main Ethereum Network to Ropsten Test NetworkLet page reload, then switch back to Main Ethereum NetworkCancel orderWatch a short video hereWith the new update and the jazzed-up UI, there seems to also be errors that pop up more frequently. This is to be expected with any tech product in its infancy, especially within the ever so young crypto/blockchain space.The error that I got that initially halted my trading was \u201cnonce too low\u201d. There was actually a lot of other programming jargon, but that was the line that translated to me. As anyone in the tech space knows, when you run into an issue, you google it. I found myself on Medium, Stack Exchange and Reddit. To no avail, I could not fix the problem. I was in luck though.I am fortunate enough to work with a very talented team that is actively building on the Ethereum blockchain. I threw up a screenshot of the error message in our company Telegram. One dev, Dan Shapiro, was quick to suggest a solution. Ironically enough, that night I got the same error, successfully implemented the recommended solution, and was back to trading in no time.I think it is important for those of us that are active in the crypto/blockchain community to share solutions to roadblocks that we experience. This will ensure that the community will progress and grow. I hope you found this article helpful. Feel free to hit the claps a few times and subscribe to the Ethex blog.

We\u2019ve compiled a complete guide on how to participate here, but we thought we\u2019d make it easier and faster for you to buy your KCY tokens using MetaMask.MetaMask is more than just an Ether wallet, it is rather an Ethereum browser that allows you all the same functions, features and ease of access from regular Ethereum Wallets, and all without the need to download the blockchain or install any software. With MetaMask, you can just install it as a Google Chrome Extension, and you\u2019re good to purchase those tokens you\u2019ve been wanting to buy.Prerequisites:To follow this guide, you will need:A web browser.A certain amount of ether in the account that you control. Please notice, only ETH will be accepted for the KickCity Tokensale.Getting StartedIf you don\u2019t have a ERC20-compatible address to send from, or ether (ETH) to contribute, start from Step 1. Otherwise, go to Step 5.Step 1: Creating an accountFirst type \u201cmetamask chrome extension\u201d in to Google, and click the link that begins with https://chrome.google.com. You will be taken to the install page, where you can click \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d.Now you will see the Metamask fox in your browser tab.Click it to open your wallet.You will be prompted to create a secure password for your Metamask account. Make sure that the Ethereum Main Net network is selected (on the top left corner).Step 3: Importing an AccountIf you have a private key or JSON file for a wallet already, you can import that wallet in to Metamask. Simply click \u201c\u2263\u201d at the top right, choose \u201cImport Account\u201d.You will need to input your raw private key into the \u201cprivate\u201d key field, or the typical JSON keystore file. Otherwise, you can select Create Account to generate a new one.Step 4: Getting EtherTo be able to participate in the ICO, you will need to have some ether (ETH) in an account that you control. You can buy ETH from different cryptocurrency exchanges or using this Telegram bot.Important Security RemindersDO NOT send ETH directly from an exchange, otherwise your tokens might never be recovered.There is no need to increase default gas price (or the value you are used to). Unless there is an unusual traffic in the Ethereum network, 30 GWEI should be enough to get the transaction confirmed in a few minutes.Step 5: Buying KickCity TokensThe Tokensale is open until March 31, or whenever the supply of tokens reaches zero.Please ensure you are on our official and secure website. Our website address is: https://ico.kickcity.io and Tokensale address is https://tokensale.kickcity.io/.This is the main page of https://tokensale.kickcity.io/One last step is to add the token to your MetaMask, so you can see your balance. Click \u201cAdd Token\u201d, and paste in the following information:Address: 0x9d22c3bf2b51213a3572e865ecf78fab0294e75b Decimals: 18Token Symbol: KCYAnd that\u2019s it!When your transaction has been mined and entered into the blockchain, you will be able to see it under \u201cTokens\u201d in your Metamask account.Thank you for participating in the KickCity Tokensale.

Many of these sitres are earning by selling the information we entered.Also some of these sites have a auto-subscribe feature so that if we don\u2019t want any notification still get a mail from these sites which is very irritating.The solution to all these problems is not giving them the email address and still being able to login .And that is possible only through METAMASKPresent revolutionlogin using Facebook /google/ GitHubWhy is it preferred now a days?No more cumbersome form-filling.No need to remember yet another username/password pair.The whole process takes seconds instead of minutes.Problem With this system-Since you are using these centralized sites to login it has all info and access about your activities on this site and is storing and may be abusing your data for wrong deeds .Hence major concern of data privacy.Making these MNC\u2019s very-very powerful.Has to take permission from google and all etc hence slower.Mails and Newsletter from the site we logged in using google which creates a problem of spaming our Inbox and irritating sometimes.Solution-Login Using MetaMaskWhat the Heck is MetaMask-MetaMask is a browser plugin, available as the MetaMask Chrome extension or Firefox Add-on. At its core, it serves as an Ethereum wallet: By installing it, you will get access to a unique Ethereum public address, with which you can start sending and receiving ether or tokens.But there is more to it .It is also used to it .It is a web3 injection to our chrome browser.You must be thinking it is something kind of blockchain tool with no utils to general public .But the login method i am going to show u can be used for this toll.This will save your privacy and save u from the wanted website mails.Tech side of how it works-You give a public address to using MetaMask accountThe back-end generates a random nonceUsing the nonce the the person digitally signed the site to enter (by clicking SIGN IN)Verification of signatureSecurity- prevent the user from logging in again with the same signature (in case it gets compromised), we make sure that the next time the same user wants to log in, she or he needs to sign a new nonce. This is achieved by generating another random nonce for this user and persisting it to the database.Note- all this is done by the general overview and most highly secure method of JWT token.How it LooksWhy use MetaMask-Here\u2019s a list of arguments why this login flow is preferable over both email/password and social logins:Problems In The Present System-Users need to have MetaMask installed: This login flow obviously doesn\u2019t work without MetaMask or a web3-enabled browser. If your audience is not interested in cryptocurrencies, there\u2019s a small chance they would even consider installing MetaMask. With the recent crypto-boom, let\u2019s hope we\u2019re heading towards a Web 3.0 internet.Some work needs to be done on the back end: As we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s quite straightforward to implement a simple version of this login flow. However, to integrate it into an existing complex system, it requires some changes in all areas that touch authentication: Signup, database, authentication routes, etc. This is especially true because each account will be associated with one or more public addresses.It doesn\u2019t work on mobile: This deserves its own section \u2014 read on.Solved With Love By MetaMaskIncreased security: Proof of ownership by public-key encryption is arguably more secure than proof of ownership by email/password or by a third party \u2014 all the more so because MetaMask stores credentials locally on your computer, and not on online servers, which makes the attack surface smaller.Simplified UX: This is a one-click (okay, maybe two-click) login flow, done in a handful of seconds, without the need to type or remember any password.Increased privacy: No email needed, and no third party involved.Conclusion-While the blockchain may have its flaws and is still in an infant stage, I can\u2019t emphasize enough how this login flow could be implemented on any existing website today.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Security", "Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Web Development", "Consensys"]}, {"title": "How to participate in a test TGE XRT using Metamask and Etherscan?", "post_link": "https://blog.aira.life/how-to-participate-in-a-test-tge-xrt-using-metamask-and-etherscan-865febe71862?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mariia Vasileva", "author_link": "https://blog.aira.life/@mariavasss09", "publish_date": "2018-11-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-20", "readtime": "2.63", "claps": 55, "voters": 5, "content": "How to participate in a test TGE XRT using Metamask and Etherscan?Mariia VasilevaFollowNov 19, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readNot long ago Sergey Lonshakov announced in Airalab blog the upcoming TGE (Token Generation Event). In my article, I want to share with you one unusual way to conduct Token Sale using Etherscan. Why unusual? Etherscan is one of the default interfaces available for free to communicate with contracts that everyone used to work with through Parity or MyEtherWallet. Recently, Etherscan got two new functions \u2014 readContract and writeContract. These functions are especially interesting for those projects that do not yet have interfaces and dapp for conducting Token Sale. Usually in such cases Parity is used; Metamask is useless without a dapp, because with its help you can only send transactions. Let\u2019s move on to the guideline itself.The Guideline1. Open an auction contract on the Etherscan website2. Go to the writeContract tab:3. Connect Metamask. To do this, you should first unlock it. Then click \u201cConnect with Metamask\u201d:4. In the bid field indicate the amount in ETH that we want to transfer and the address to which we will receive the tokens. Click Write:5. A Metamask confirmation pop-up window will appear:6. Using \u201cView your transaction\u201d button you can check the status of the transaction:7. On the readContract tab you can see how much we transferred to the auction contract:? The difference in the amount sent and received is 2 times, because 2 transactions were sent from my account.8. To get XRT, after the end of the auction in the tab writeContract in the field claimTokens specify your address.? How to understand that the auction is over? In the contract on the readContract tab there are two properties endTime and finalPrice, now they are both equal to 0. When the TGE ends new values \u200b\u200bappear in them. And the auction itself will end when the planned amount of ETH is collected \u2014 the ceiling property (in this case 40 ETH), and the totalReceived field shows the amount that has already been collected.Now you know how to use Etherscan for Token Sale :)On the 21th of November visit our website robonomics.network, complete the survey and participate in the general public rehearsal of TGE XRT starting November, 28!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Etherscan", "Metamask", "Robonomics", "Tutorials"]}, {"title": "\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0cMetaMask [ 3 ]", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@iCaptainArk/%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6-metamask-3-b5c8fb9b511a?source=search_post", "author_name": "iCaptain", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@iCaptainArk", "publish_date": "2018-03-01", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-07", "readtime": "3.61", "claps": 153, "voters": 5, "content": "\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0cMetaMask [ 3 ][ \u6559\u5b78 ] \u65b0\u589e\u4ee3\u5e63iCaptainFollowMar 1, 2018 \u00b7 4 min read\u64b0\u6587\u6642\u9593 / BTC\u5c0dUSD / \u5340\u584a\u9ad8\u5ea6:2017.03.02 / 1BTC=10888USD / 511508\u64b0\u6587\u6642\u9593 / ETH\u5c0dUSD / \u5340\u584a\u9ad8\u5ea6:2017.03.02 / 1ETH=877USD / 5178686\u524d\u8a00:\u56e0\u6709\u4f4d\u670b\u53cb\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u5beb\u9019\u7bc7\uff0c\u66ab\u6642\u8df3\u904e\u767c\u9001\u4ee5\u592a\u5e63\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u4ecb\u7d39\uff0e\u5728MetaMask\u4e0a\u7684\u9019\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8207\u4e4b\u524d\u4e00\u7bc7\u5728MyEtherWallet\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u6a23\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5148\u53c3\u8003\uff0e\u7db2\u7ad9\uff0cMyEtherWallet [ 5 ][ \u6559\u5b78 ] \u4e3b\u8981\u529f\u80fd > \u767c\u9001\u4ee5\u592a\u5e63/\u4ee3\u5e63 > \u65b0\u589e\u5176\u4ed6\u4ee3\u5e63medium.com\u6b65\u9a5f:\u9078\u64c7\u53f3\u5074\u7684 \u201cTOKENS\u201d \u6b04\u4f4d\uff0c\u6309\u4e0b \u201cADD TOKEN\u201d2. \u9032\u5165\u8a72\u4ee3\u5e63\u7684\u9801\u9762\u67e5\u8a62SIRIN (SRN) ERC20 Token TrackerThe Ethereum BlockChain Explorer, API and Analytics Platformetherscan.ioEthplorer: Address: 0x68d57c9a1c35f63e2c83ee8e49a64e9d70528d25Chainy is a smart contract which allows to create and read different kind of data in Ethereum blockchain: AEON short\u2026ethplorer.io\u9019\u5169\u500b\u7db2\u7ad9\u90fd\u53ef\uff0c\u6b64\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f03\u6cdb\u7528\u7684 ethscan.io \u8209\u4f8b\u8aaa\u660e\uff0eContract Address\uff0c\u5716\u7247\u4e2d\u53cd\u767d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5373\u70ba\u5408\u7d04\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u8907\u88fd\u5230\u6b65\u9a5f3\u7684\u6b04\u4f4dToken Decimals\uff0c\u70ba\u8a72\u4ee3\u5e63\u5728\u5408\u7d04\u4e2d\u8a2d\u5b9a\u7684\u5c0f\u6578\u9ede\u4f4d\u6578\uff0c\u4e00\u6a23\u5728\u6b65\u9a5f3\u7684\u6b04\u4f4d\u586b\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u70ba18\u4f4d\uff0e\u6309\u4e0b\u6309\u9215\u201c\u4fdd\u5b58\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5c07\u6b64\u4ee3\u5e63\u5217\u8868\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u8207\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u7db2\u8def\u4e92\u52d5\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4f47\u5217\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u767c\u9001\u5230\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u92b7\u552e\uff0c\u6216\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u5740\u4fdd\u5b58\u7b49\u7b49\uff0e3. \u8f38\u5165\u6b32\u65b0\u589e\u7684\u4ee3\u5e63\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7d04\u5730\u57404. \u8a72\u4ee3\u5e63\u5373\u65b0\u589e\u5230 \u201cTOKENS\u201d \u6b04\u4f4d\u4e2d\uff0e\u9032\u968e\u8aaa\u660e:Token\u6c92\u6709\u5728\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u51fa\u73fe\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u5e63\u6c92\u6709\u6253\u9032\u4f86\u6216\u662f\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u5340\u584a\u93c8\u5730\u5740\u67e5\u8a62\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c07\u5730\u5740\u6216\u662f\u4ea4\u6613ID(TxID)\u653e\u5728\u641c\u5c0b\u6b04\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5f97\u5230\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u65e5\u5f8c\u518d\u8a73\u7d30\u4ecb\u7d39\uff0eEthereum BlockChain Explorer and SearchThe Ethereum BlockChain Explorer, API and Analytics Platformetherscan.ioEthplorer - Ethereum tokens explorer and data viewer.

In this second part, we explore secure remote access to this Ethereum node via MetaMask.We also cover how to make everything survive crashes and shutdowns.Setting up an SSH tunnelSetting up a what? This is the confusing process I mentioned earlier. I won\u2019t go into details here, but in effect, it allows requests made to your local machine to be forwarded automatically to another machine, in this case the VPS running your geth node. It'll become clear why we need this when we set up MetaMask later.Obtaining the IP address of your VPSIn order to forward requests to your VPS you\u2019ll need to know its IP address. This is determined by returning to your Linode dashboard and going to the Linodes tab on the left. You should see your node\u2019s IP address on the right, just below the geographic location of your VPS. It looks something like this: 172.16.389.54. Make a note of that IP; we'll be using it shortly.SSH on WindowsAs of the April 2018 update, Windows 10 has OpenSSH installed by default. This provides ssh.exe as well as several other SSH utilities. To check the state of SSH on Windows at the time of writing I downloaded the latest Windows 10 ISO and installed it into a virtual machine. OpenSSH was already installed and available from cmd.exe. If you have Windows 10 but OpenSSH is not installed, follow the instructions in this Microsoft article. If you have an older version of Windows there are several utilities available that will provide SSH capabilities.Initiating the tunnelWe\u2019re going from here with the assumption that you have command-line access to an ssh client. The following command sets up the SSH tunnel. This command is identical on all three platforms.ssh -N -v user@172.16.389.54 -L 8545:localhost:8545The -N switch tells ssh not to execute a remote command. We want a continuous connection, or tunnel, to our node. There's no command to execute remotely at this point. The -v switch makes ssh output some logging information as it executes. We then supply the username and IP address in order to log into our VPS. The rest sets up the tunnel itself, specifying that anything your local machine receives on port 8545 (the port on which your node is listening for RPC requests) should be forwarded to the same port on your node securely through the tunnel. That's the most important point: nobody else can do this except you. Your node is safe from exploits due to an exposed RPC port.Connecting MetaMask to the SSH tunnelThis is the easiest part of the whole tunnel kerfuffle. I\u2019m assuming you left the SSH tunnel running and that you can see its log output. In your browser, activate MetaMask by clicking on the fox head at the top right of your browser window. At the top of the MetaMask window is the currently-chosen Ethereum network. If you\u2019ve been using beta dApps, it\u2019s probably say something like Rinkeby Test Network. Click on that name and you see a dropdown menu. At the top is Main Ethereum Network. That\u2019s our final destination, but we don\u2019t want to use that menu item. If you do, MetaMask connects to an Infura node, defeating the entire purpose of this long journey. Further down the list you see Localhost 8545. Click on that, watching the output of your SSH tunnel. You should see lines appear similar to this:debug1: Connection to port 8545 forwarding to localhost port 8545 requested.debug1: channel 1: new [direct-tcpip]MetaMask should now have Localhost 8545 at the top and you should see Deposit and Send buttons in the middle. If so, you\u2019ve now connected your remote geth node to MetaMask, though MetaMask believes it has connected to your local machine.Making the impermanent permanentYou now have a fully-functioning geth node and are able to connect to it remotely and securely through MetaMask and an SSH tunnel. Congratulations! Of course, computers crash or are shut down deliberately. In order to avoid having to set everything up again on a restart, we need to do two things: one, set up our geth node to start automatically on the VPS and two, somehow do the same for the SSH tunnel on our local machine.Remote permanenceIn relative terms this is the easy part of the permanence process. We only have to deal with one operating system, Linux, and there\u2019s an established way to start tasks automatically: systemd. Linux politics aside, let's get started.systemd handles processes on most Linux systems, Ubuntu being no exception. In order to do so it reads .service files. To have our geth node start automatically on boot we need to provide a geth.service file. Go back and launch the console from the Linodes tab. If your geth node is still running you have to shut it down. As before, type the following to reconnect to your geth node:$ tmux attach -t 0Stop your geth node with ctrl-c. Again, wait until you're at a command prompt, then type ctrl-d to exit from tmux. Type the following at the command line, substituting user in User=user for the username you provided previously:$ cat > geth.service <<EOF[Unit]Description=Go Ethereum client[Service]User=userType=simpleRestart=alwaysExecStart=/usr/bin/geth --rpc --rpcaddr localhost --rpcport 8545 [Install]WantedBy=default.targetEOFThis creates a geth.service file in the current directory. You need to do a few things to make it available to systemd:$ sudo mv geth.service /etc/systemd/system/$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload$ sudo systemctl enable geth.service$ sudo systemctl start geth.serviceTo check on the status of the service, use this:$ sudo systemctl status geth.serviceSomewhere near the beginning of the output, you\u2019ll see active (running). If you don't, there will be error messages below. Good luck! To see continuous output from geth, type the following:$ sudo journalctl -f -u geth.serviceIf all is well you\u2019ll see a stream of lines containing Imported new chain segment. Type ctrl-c to stop the output. Don't worry, this doesn't shut down your geth node. It only stops showing the systemd log output.From now on, when your VPS restarts for any reason geth starts up again automatically.Local permanenceYou\u2019ve successfully started an SSH tunnel on your machine, but as soon as you close the terminal or put your laptop to sleep the tunnel disconnects and the connection is broken. This is obviously sub-optimal. Having to start up a terminal session and re-activate the tunnel is a bit of a drag. The problem is, the three major operating systems have three different ways to set up permanent services like our SSH tunnel.SSH key pairsIn order for any of the following to work automatically you need to have SSH private and public keys. If you regularly ssh into remote machines without needing to provide a password, you're already set up. Even in that case, you need to send your public key to the remote machine running geth. For instructions on how to do this \u2014 and how to generate an SSH key pair in the first place if you need to \u2014 this article from Linode or this one from Atlassian explains things fairly well. These articles are already very long and very technical; mucking about with SSH keys is a well-known process so it's not necessary to repeat those instructions here. If you can type:$ ssh user@172.16.389.54supplying your own username and the IP of your remote geth node, and you are logged in without having to supply a password, you're good to go. If this is not the case, none of the following will work.LinuxThe process of making an SSH tunnel permanent is similar to the way it was done on our VPS. We install a persistent.ssh.tunnel.service file and set things up so that the service starts with the system. The only major difference, aside from the necessarily different ExecStart line, is that we need to precede that line with a line specifying a slight startup delay to make sure the network is ready before the service starts. Remember, of course, to replace user in User=user with your own desktop username and user@172.16.389.54 with your username on the remote system and its IP address.$ cat > persistent.ssh.tunnel.service <<EOF[Unit]Description=Persistent SSH Tunnel[Service]User=userType=simpleRestart=alwaysExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 10ExecStart=/usr/bin/ssh -N -v user@172.16.389.54 -L 8545:localhost:8545[Install]WantedBy=default.targetEOFThis creates a persistent.ssh.tunnel.service file in the current directory. As before, you need to do a few things to make it available to systemd, this time on your local system:$ sudo mv persistent.ssh.tunnel.service /etc/systemd/system/$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload$ sudo systemctl enable persistent.ssh.tunnel.service$ sudo systemctl start persistent.ssh.tunnel.serviceTo check that the service started successfully, type the following:$ sudo systemctl status persistent.ssh.tunnel.servicemacOSApple\u2019s macOS has its own way of setting up persistent services using launchctl. Similar to systemd on Linux, you provide a configuration file \u2014 this time in the form of an XML document instead of an INI file \u2014 and then install and activate the service using that XML document. First, we create this file, providing as usual the username and IP address of our VPS for user@172.16.389.54. As well, provide your macOS username under UserName.$ cat > com.persistent.ssh.tunnel.plist <<EOF<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"><plist version=\"1.0\"><dict>  <key>Label</key>  <string>com.persistent.ssh.tunnel</string>  <key>UserName</key>  <string>user</string>  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>  <string>/tmp/persistent.ssh.tunnel.err</string>  <key>ProgramArguments</key>  <array>    <string>/usr/bin/ssh</string>    <string>-N</string>    <string>-v</string>    <string>user@172.16.389.54</string>    <string>-L</string>    <string>8545:localhost:8545</string>  </array>  <key>KeepAlive</key>  <true/></dict></plist>EOFOnce you\u2019ve created the com.persistent.ssh.tunnel.plist file, move it to a location in which launchctl expects these files to reside. Finally, give the command to install it into the system and start the process running in the background.$ sudo mv com.persistent.ssh.tunnel.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/$ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.persistent.ssh.tunnel.plistInstalling the .plist file into /Library/LaunchDaemons/ makes it available to any user on the system; it's not dependent on your being logged in for the tunnel to be active.WindowsIn order to set up a persistent service in Windows you need to download a utility that provides this functionality. The one I used is the free, open source, and public domain NSSM so you need to install that before proceeding.The steps below creates the persistent-ssh-tunnel service and sets various parameters so that you can use it to connect MetaMask to your geth node. I've provided the commands as well as the responses from nssm for clarity. To execute these commands you need to start a terminal session as a Windows administrator. You can do this by opening the start menu and typing cmd. This should bring up a Best match menu with Command Prompt highlighted. To the right choose Run as administrator. Click Yes to allow this app to make changes. If all goes well, you see a black terminal window open with the command prompt C:\\Windows\\system32>. Carefully type the commands below, making sure not to type the command prompt! Be sure that each command gets a response similar to the ones provided here. Substitute your Windows username for .\\user (keeping the .\\) and your Windows login password for password. Also provide your username and the IP address of your remote geth node in user@172.16.389.54.C:\\Windows\\system32>nssm install persistent-ssh-tunnel \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\OpenSSH\\ssh.exe\" \"-N -v user@172.16.389.54 -L 8545:localhost:8545\"Service \"persistent-ssh-tunnel\" installed successfully!

To test it out, open a browser that has MetaMask installed and follow the instructions above under Configuring MetaMask. MetaMask should again connect to Localhost 8545, but this time it\u2019s using the background service which tunnels requests to your geth VPS. You no longer have to think about establishing a connection to your remote Ethereum node.ConclusionFor the sake of expedience I\u2019ve made specific choices in these articles. For instance, I chose to use a VPS, and indeed a particular VPS provider, for our Ethereum node. As explained above, this costs money. dApp developers receiving income from their project should definitely consider this route. On the other hand, someone who is simply curious and would like to follow the steps outlined could set up a VPS, follow the tutorial, and after testing it out and learning all there is to be learned, shut down and delete the VPS. This would end up costing just a few cents: if it took you two hours to complete this tutorial you\u2019d be out 24\u00a2 US, assuming a Linode 16GB VPS. Even factoring in the synchronization time, you\u2019re still only out a couple of USDs.You\u2019re also free to choose a different VPS provider. Digital Ocean\u2019s Droplets are competitively priced. The process here should work equally well on a Droplet. Amazon\u2019s AWS is also a possibility. Using your own hardware would save the monthly cost, but the process gains much more complexity and would have been inappropriate for an article aimed at moderately technical people.Another choice I made was to use the Ubuntu Linux distribution as the operating system for our geth node. Ubuntu is one of the most popular distributions, but there are, shall we say, several other Linux distributions you could choose. If you're more familiar with another distribution, then you should be able to handle the differences between your choice and the Ubuntu-based instructions above.I chose a system service utility for Windows, offering no alternatives, and glossed over the SSH aspects on that OS. Again, these articles would verge on novella length if I were to go into every aspect of all of the software on all of the platforms. I apologize to those who wanted more detail. Please leave a comment if you have questions on these things.This has definitely been a long journey. I know it\u2019s all a bit ambitious, especially for those with a less technical bent. I hope you were able to follow these instructions and end up with your own remote Ethereum node, connecting to it with MetaMask through a secure SSH tunnel. If you have any questions or need any help with the process, please leave a comment here. I\u2019d be happy to help.Originally published at https://kauri.io.Disclaimer.

If you\u2019re new to crypto or even to ETH, maybe you\u2019d like to get a wallet, one that will really introduce you to the crypto world with security and ease.An important feature from MetaMask is the integration that developers can make between the wallet and DAPPs (Descentralized APPlications). And we are using this technology during the Vyral contribution period.Now, before learning how to use MetaMask to contribute to Vyral, first we need to install it. Please note that MetaMask only works with Chrome, so if you don\u2019t already use Google Chrome, then you\u2019ll have to install it too.Step #1: Installing MetaMaskIf you already have MetaMask installed, jump to Step #2.First of all, let\u2019s go to MetaMask.io. Now, click on \u201cGET CHROME EXTENSION\u201d.Once you do, you\u2019ll be redirected to the Chrome Web Store\u2019s page for downloading MetaMask. Don\u2019t worry it\u2019s free! Now, let\u2019s click on \u201cUSE ON CHROME\u201d. That will prompt you to accept the extension on your browser. Simply click on \u201cAdd extension\u201d and wait a moment.Now, the extension is probably installed on your Chrome, so you\u2019ll see a screen similar to this:At this point you want to click on the small \u201cFox\u201d icon that popped up on your top right corner and start using MetaMask. Once you do, a small screen will open and ask you to accept the Terms for using the extension. Scroll down and click \u201cAccept\u201d.After that, you\u2019ll need to choose your password for MetaMask. Please use a hard one and also remember it in the future. Hitting \u201cCREATE\u201d after that. Once you do, MetaMask will give you your Seed words, which will help you recover your address if you ever lose your password, computer or get another problem. Here you have two options, downloading the Seed words as a file or just agreeing you have saved them offline, like writing in a piece of paper that you can keep secure. We really recommend you doing the later since you\u2019ll be less susceptible to hacks.Now your MetaMask is created and you can access your ETH address by clicking on the three points and selecting \u201cCopy Address to clipboard\u201d. And this is a wallet you CAN use to contribute to Vyral.Step #2 \u2014 Purchasing SHARE tokens with MetaMaskPrior to purchasing SHARE tokens, you\u2019ll need to have ETH in your MetaMask\u2019s address. So, make sure you send it before the sale to your MetaMask ETH Address.Once you have ETH on your MetaMask Wallet and the purchase period has started, the first thing to do is go to https://contribute.vyral.network/. Now, unlock your MetaMask Wallet.Once your MetaMask Wallet is unlocked, let\u2019s proceed with the purchase. On Vyral\u2019s contribution page you\u2019ll see 5 boxes that need to be checked in order to continue with the process. Make sure you read and agree with all of them before hitting \u201cCONTINUE\u201d.Next step would be choosing MetaMask as your selected wallet to contribute. So, select MetaMask\u2019s icon and click on \u201cContinue To Contribute\u201d.After that you\u2019ll go to the actual purchase page. There you\u2019ll choose the amount of ETH you want to send. It can be ANY amount higher than 1 ETH, e.g. 1.2 ETH, 1.87 ETH, 10.889554 ETH, and so on. You\u2019ll also note another field, the \u201cReferral Vyral Key\u201d, in there you\u2019ll paste your referrer Vyral Key, which is also his/her ETH address. As you can see this is completely optional and if you do not have a referrer then leave it as it is. Once you\u2019ve set that, click \u201cPurchase\u201d.This will prompt your MetaMask to generate a transaction with the correct specifics. All you have to do now is click \u201cSUBMIT\u201d.After that the DAPP will take a moment while your transaction goes through the Blockchain. Once it does, it\u2019ll show your Vyral Link automatically.Congratulations! You\u2019ve successfully purchased your first amount of SHARE tokens. Now, go ahead and share your Vyral Link throughout your social media accounts and get a percentage of their purchase in tokens.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Metamask", "Ethereum", "Viral Marketing"]}, {"title": "A Cryptogamer\u2019s Comprehensive Guide to MetaMask", "post_link": "https://medium.com/the-notice-board/a-cryptogamers-comprehensive-guide-to-metamask-4d448cb1337c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Max Preusse", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@max_preusse", "publish_date": "2018-05-28", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-18", "readtime": "4.08", "claps": 13, "voters": 3, "content": "A Cryptogamer\u2019s Comprehensive Guide to MetaMaskWe explain what MetaMask is, and how to get started using it on BitGuildMax PreusseFollowMay 28, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readToday, MetaMask has become a crucial tool in interfacing with any blockchain game, but using it for the first time can be a little daunting. By the end of this guide, you\u2019ll be well-versed in the art of making simple cryptocurrency transactions.What is MetaMask?Simply put, it\u2019s an interface through which you access your cryptocurrency wallet. It holds, sends, and receives \u201ctokens\u201d. Tokens take many forms, and there are a lot of technical details regarding different token types that we won\u2019t go into here. Suffice to know that tokens take the shape of two major things for you on BitGuild: Your currencies, and your items.You\u2019re about to get pretty familiar with this friendly fox face.Getting StartedFirst, we\u2019ll tackle how to set up your MetaMask account and browser extension. If you\u2019ve already done this, feel free to skip to the next section.Step 1: Head over to MyEtherWallet.com (a.k.a MEW) to start the process of setting up your wallet. We recommend you read their disclaimer pop-ups carefully, in order to better understand and secure your wallet.Step 2: Select a password for your wallet. This password should be unique and complex, but most importantly: DO NOT LOSE IT. We can\u2019t help you recover your password, wallet, or other personal data, so write it down carefully, and keep it in more than one place. Better safe than sorry!Step 3: Once you\u2019ve selected a password and created your wallet, you will be prompted to save your keystore file. Click on the \u201cDownload Keystore File (UTC / JSON)\u201d button, save it, and then click \u201cI understand. Continue\u201d. This is also very sensitive data, so keep it in a safe place, preferably in more than one secure location (in case your computer crashes!)Step 4: Save your private key. Again, keep this in a safe place, as it can\u2019t be recovered if you lose it. We suggest keeping it in physical format, hidden away with your important documents.Step 5: Before you can use your new ETH wallet, you\u2019ll need to choose a way to access it. The only currently officially supported method to use your cryptocurrencies on BitGuild are via MetaMask.Now that you\u2019re all set up with a wallet ready to go, the first thing you\u2019ll need to do is load it up with some ETH. You can buy ETH from any reputable source of your choosing \u2014 here\u2019s a highly detailed guide for this process.The final step is to add an identifier for PLAT to your wallet. PLAT is the official BitGuild currency, and is necessary in order to play games on the BitGuild Portal. To enable MetaMask to identify PLAT in your wallet, follow these steps:1: Access your wallet by clicking on the MetaMask icon in your browser.2: Click on ADD TOKEN under the Tokens tab.3: Enter the following information in the corresponding boxes, then click ADD.Token Contract Address: 0x4118d7f757ad5893b8fa2f95e067994e1f531371Token Symbol: PLATDecimals of Precision: 18That\u2019s it! Your PLAT should now be displaying in your wallet.Once you\u2019ve registered on the BitGuild Portal, MetaMask takes a backseat to the action. Your items will be viewable through the website, and you\u2019re free to browse the portal, chat with users, and play as many games as you please. As soon as you initiate any transaction, be it in-game or by buying PLAT directly from the BitGuild website, you\u2019ll see a Metamask window pop up, prompting you to confirm the transaction.There are a few elements to these transactions, and we\u2019re going to detail them for you here. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not as complex as it looks. Because of the nature of the ethereum blockchain, all transactions require a fee, commonly known as gas, or gwei.The ethereum blockchain is a shared resource, and as such, transaction fees can vary based on network load. These fees are always small, averaging around 0.46 USD at the time of writing. MetaMask will suggest a gas price based on current network success rates. Should your transaction fail, simply raise the gas price slightly and try again, or wait until later when peak load times might have died down. You can learn more about the blockchain in this post.You are now armed with the knowledge and tools to venture forth and start exploring the world of cryptogaming. See you on BitGuild!BitGuild\u2019s mission is to revolutionize the global gaming industry by creating a platform for a brand new class of games that live on the blockchain. Blockchain games completely redefine the relationship between players and developers by facilitating full and true ownership of in-game assets, cheap & safe item trading, cross-game compatibility of items & currency, and more.Join the community on Twitter, Discord, and Facebook.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Metamask", "Gaming", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ax1mining/how-to-buy-ax1-tokens-using-metamask-c6029a3de6cd?source=search_post", "author_name": "AX1 Mining", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ax1mining", "publish_date": "2018-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-18", "readtime": "2.72", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "AX1 MiningFollowApr 18, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readHow to buy AX1 tokens using MetamaskIt is recommended that you use google chrome to purchase AX1 tokens as you will need to use an Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask which is a google chrome extensionIf you do not have an Ethereum wallet find out how to create a MetaMask wallet.You will need to send some ethereum to your walletNow SIGN INStep 1: Complete your profileFill in your first and last name, tick the boxes once you have read the information and confirmed you are not a resident of USA, China or South KoreaYou will need an etheruem wallet address to complete your profileNOTE: To get your address from MetaMask, please click the 3 dots and choose \u2018Copy address to clipboard\u2019Step 2: Buy AX1 tokensEnter the amount of tokens you wish to purchase and click Buy NowStep 3: MetaMaskWhen you click purchase MetaMask will either open in your browser or you will see a notification in the top right.

Truffle, Ganache and Metamask (Beginners Guide)Filza TariqFollowAug 28 \u00b7 8 min readIn this tutorial I am going to show you that how simply you can develop an ethereum dapp from scratch using Truffle, Metamask and Ganache. To setup your system with necessary dependencies refer to my previous article and setup your system to begin developing your first dapp.Before we dive into the development, let me give you an overview about the architecture of Ethereum Dapp we are going to develop and how different puzzles are going to fit into the picture. So let\u2019s start the journey to build your Ethereum DApp.What are Ethereum Dapps?Dapps are the decentralized applications that runs on a peer-to-peer network unlike traditional web apps that runs on centralized servers. When these dapps are built over ethereum network, these are known as \u201cethereum dapps\u201d. In decentralized apps, all the users\u2019 data is stored on immutable distributed ledger and every participating nodes have a copy of that ledger. These dapps logic that runs on the blockchain nodes is written in solidity language and traditionally called as \u201csmart contracts\u201d.Architecture of our Ethereum Dapp:Client\u2019s Browser: It is just like a normal browser of any web application written in html, css and javascript.Web3.js: Web3.js is a collection of libraries that enables your browser to interact with blockchain. It enables you to read and write data from smart contracts, transfer ethers between accounts and much more.Web3 Provider: Ethereum network contains nodes and all nodes share the same copy of data. Setting a \u201cweb3 provider\u201d in web3.js tells our code that which node we are going to read and write data from. We are using Metamask in our implementation that injects its web3 provider in the browser. Metamask is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that lets users securely manage their Ethereum accounts and private keys, and use these accounts to interact with websites that are using Web3.js.Ethereum Virtual Machine: Every ethereum node in ethereum network runs their own EVM implementation and responsible for running the same instructions of smart contracts over the ethereum network.Ok that\u2019s all about the theory, to wake you up let\u2019s start with the development.What we are going to develop?We are going to develop a simple decentralized newsfeed system. News publisher can post news on blockchain with their account addresses. These news will be immutable and displayed in the same order as they are posted.Our Final Dapp will look something like this:You can refer to the code at GitHub anytime you face issues. But I urge you to code each step yourself along with me.Step 1: Setting up the StructureI presume that you have set the development environment already. In command prompt create a new directory and unbox \u201ctruffle-box\u201d in that respective directory to get the structure of project.mkdir postnewscd postnewstruffle unbox pet-shopThis will set up the following basic structure in your folder:Let\u2019s examine the project structure Truffle Box gave us.Contracts: As obvious with the name, here all our smart contracts will reside.Migrations: Includes Migration files to migrate smart contracts to blockchain.Node_modules: Contains all node dependenciesSrc: Home for all client side application codeTest: Where we write tests for our smart contract either in solidity or javascript. We are not going to write any tests in our implementation because we are building a basic implementation of Dapp. But tests are important to write when you are working on commercial projects, because each migration of smart contract on blockchain causes gas cost. Thus, you want to make sure that your smart contracts are bug free and perform the intended functionality.Step 2: Writing Smart ContractCreate a new file news.sol in contract folder and write the following code in it.pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <=0.6.0;contract news{struct newsfeed{address publisher;string newsdesc;}mapping(uint => newsfeed) public newsfeeds;uint public newsCount;function addnews(string memory newsdesc) public {newsCount++;newsfeeds[newsCount].publisher = msg.sender;newsfeeds[newsCount].newsdesc = newsdesc;}}Let me explain this code. First we specify that the current code is runnable on the solidity compiler version greater than 0.4.0 and smaller than 0.6.0 with \u201cpragma solidity\u201d. Then we initialized the contract and initialized the structure of our newsfeed containing address of publisher (initialized with address data type) and news itself (initialized with string data type).To store this created structure we have created mapping that is just like a key value pair. The key to mapping is an unsigned integer and the value is the \u201cnewsfeed struct\u201d.\u201cnewscount\u201d keeps track of the number of posted news and initially 0. Addnews function will store publisher address and news in the struct referenced by the key value. \u201cmsg.sender\u201d gets the address of account which has called the contract.Simple. Isn\u2019t it? Now let\u2019s compile this smart contract to see if it runs properly. To do this, navigate to your project folder in console and writetruffle compileNow lets migrate our current smart contract on Ganache. To do this, create a new file in Migration folder named \u201c2_deploy_contracts.js\u201d. Paste the following code in that file to migrate your contract:var news = artifacts.require(\u201c./news.sol\u201d);module.exports = function(deployer) {deployer.deploy(news);};Save it and in console type:truffle migrateMake sure that Ganache is open and running while you migrate your contract. And hurrah! Your contract is successfully migrated to Ganache.Step 3: Developing Client-side application to interact with contractGo to your index.html file and paste the following code:<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\u201den\u201d><head><meta charset=\u201dutf-8\"><meta http-equiv=\u201dX-UA-Compatible\u201d content=\u201dIE=edge\u201d><meta name=\u201dviewport\u201d content=\u201dwidth=device-width, initial-scale=1\"><! \u2014 The above 3 meta tags *must* come first in the head; any other head content must come *after* these tags \u2192<title>Decentralized Newsfeed</title><! \u2014 Bootstrap \u2192<link href=\u201dcss/bootstrap.min.css\u201d rel=\u201dstylesheet\u201d><! \u2014 HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements and media queries \u2192<! \u2014 WARNING: Respond.js doesn\u2019t work if you view the page via file:// \u2192<! \u2014 [if lt IE 9]><script src=\u201dhttps://oss.maxcdn.com/html5shiv/3.7.3/html5shiv.min.js\"></script><script src=\u201dhttps://oss.maxcdn.com/respond/1.4.2/respond.min.js\"></script><![endif] \u2192</head><body><div class=\u201dcontainer\u201d><div class=\u201drow\u201d><div class=\u201dcol-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-push-2\"><h1 class=\u201dtext-center\u201d>Decentralized Newsfeed</h1><hr/><br/></div></div><div id=\u201dnewsRow\u201d class=\u201drow\u201d><! \u2014 NEWS LOAD HERE \u2192</div><! \u2014 <button class=\u201dbtn btn-default\u201d type=\u201dbutton\u201d class=\u201daaaaaddProd\u201d>Add Product</button> \u2192<! \u2014 Button trigger modal \u2192<button type=\u201dbutton\u201d style=\u201dalign:center;\u201d class=\u201dbtn btn-primary\u201d data-toggle=\u201dmodal\u201d data-target=\u201d#exampleModalCenter\u201d>Add News</button></div><! \u2014 Modal \u2192<div class=\u201dmodal fade\u201d id=\u201dexampleModalCenter\u201d tabindex=\u201d-1\" role=\u201ddialog\u201d aria-labelledby=\u201dexampleModalCenterTitle\u201d aria-hidden=\u201dtrue\u201d><div class=\u201dmodal-dialog modal-dialog-centered\u201d role=\u201ddocument\u201d><! \u2014 Modal Content \u2192<div class=\u201dmodal-content\u201d><! \u2014 Modal Header \u2192<div class=\u201dmodal-header\u201d><h5 class=\u201dmodal-title\u201d id=\u201dexampleModalCenterTitle\u201d>Add News</h5><button type=\u201dbutton\u201d class=\u201dclose\u201d data-dismiss=\u201dmodal\u201d aria-label=\u201dClose\u201d><span aria-hidden=\u201dtrue\u201d>&times;</span></button></div><! \u2014 Modal Body \u2192<div class=\u201dmodal-body\u201d><form><div class=\u201dform-group\u201d><textarea class=\u201dform-control postbox\u201d id=\u201dpost\u201d placeholder=\u201dAdd you story Here\u2026\u201d rows=\u201d5\"></textarea></div><button type=\u201dsubmit\u201d data-dismiss=\u201dmodal\u201d class=\u201dbtn btn-primary addNews\u201d>Post News</button></form></div><div class=\u201dmodal-footer\u201d><button type=\u201dbutton\u201d class=\u201dbtn btn-secondary\u201d data-dismiss=\u201dmodal\u201d>Close</button></div></div></div></div><div id=\u201dpostTemplate\u201d style=\u201ddisplay: none;\u201d><div class=\u201dcol-md-12\"><div class=\u201dpanel panel-default panel-pet\u201d><div class=\u201dpanel-heading\u201d><strong>Publisher Address</strong> <h3 class=\u201dpanel-title\u201d> Account Address </h3></div><div class=\u201dpanel-body\u201d><strong>Descrition</strong>: <span class=\u201ddesc\u201d> </span><br/></div></div></div></div><! \u2014 jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap\u2019s JavaScript plugins) \u2192<script src=\u201dhttps://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js\"></script><! \u2014 Include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed \u2192<script src=\u201djs/bootstrap.min.js\u201d></script><script src=\u201djs/web3.min.js\u201d></script><script src=\u201djs/truffle-contract.js\u201d></script><script src=\u201djs/app.js\u201d></script></body></html>Ok! Don\u2019t scare yourself it\u2019s just some simple html. Let me go through it. Add News Button is navigating to the model that opens a dialogue for adding news. \u201cposttemplate\u201d contains the layout of how your posts will be displayed on screen.To make this code in action lets write some code in app.js and see how it is going to link up with our smart contract.In your app.js file first add the following code to setup the web3 provider for web3.js in browser.App = {web3Provider: null,contracts: {},initWeb3: async function() {// Modern dapp browsers\u2026if (window.ethereum) {App.web3Provider = window.ethereum;try {// Request account accessawait window.ethereum.enable();} catch (error) {// User denied account access\u2026console.error(\u201cUser denied account access\u201d)}}// Legacy dapp browsers\u2026else if (window.web3) {App.web3Provider = window.web3.currentProvider;}// If no injected web3 instance is detected, fall back to Ganacheelse {App.web3Provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\u2018http://localhost:7545');}// App.web3Provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\u2018http://localhost:8545');web3 = new Web3(App.web3Provider);return App.initContract();},Extend app.js with the following code:initContract: function() {$.getJSON(\u2018news.json\u2019, function(data) {// Get the necessary contract artifact file and instantiate it with truffle-contractApp.contracts.news = TruffleContract(data);// Set the provider for our contractApp.contracts.news.setProvider(App.web3Provider);return App.init();});return App.AddNewsButton();},When we compile our contract \u201cnews.json\u201d is created in build folder. Truffle has a library called \u201cTruffleContract\u201d that keeps information about the contract. So using this library we set web3 provider for our contract. This enables our client side application to interact with our smart contract deployed on blockchain.Move forward and add the following code in app.js:AddNewsButton: function() {$(document).on(\u2018click\u2019, \u2018.addNews\u2019, App.AddNews);},AddNews:function(event){var post = document.getElementById(\u2018post\u2019).valuevar postInstance;App.contracts.news.deployed().then(function(instance){postInstance = instance;return postInstance.addnews(post);});console.log(\u201cNews posted\u201d);},};This code will take the user entered news and pass it to our add news function in smart contract. Smart contract will write the publisher address and news on blockchain using mapping.Finally add the following code in app.js to render the html template with data on every page reload so your news will be displayed.init: async function() {// Load Newsvar postInstance;App.contracts.news.deployed().then(function(instance){postInstance = instance;return postInstance.newsCount();}).then(function(result){var counts = result.c[0];console.log(\u201cTotal News : \u201c+counts);for (var i = 1; i <= counts; i ++) {postInstance.newsfeeds(i).then(function(result){console.log(\u201cPublisher Address:\u201d +result[0]);console.log(\u201cNews:\u201d +result[1]);var newsRow = $(\u2018#newsRow\u2019);var postTemplate = $(\u2018#postTemplate\u2019);postTemplate.find(\u2018.panel-title\u2019).text(result[0]);postTemplate.find(\u2018.desc\u2019).text(result[1]);newsRow.append(postTemplate.html());});}});\u2018i\u2019 initialized with 1 is passed as a key to newsfeeds mapping. This will fetch the structure details on index i. Structure details are just like an array having \u201cpublisher address\u201d at 0 index and \u201cnewsdesc\u201d at 1 index. This data will be retrieved from smart contract and append to \u201cpostTemplate\u201d in index.html.Now in your console type \u201cnpm run dev\u201d to run your dapp.This will open up the dapp in your browser.

Users can now create a smart contract based Nuo account with Metamask or a Web3 Wallet without the need for a password. Before this upgrade, users could only create an account with password and later connect Metamask or Web3 Wallet. See how it worksNew Signup with MetamaskWith this upgrade, we have completely eliminated the need for using a password on the platform and users can use the platform entirely with Metamask or Web3 Wallets (Trust, imToken etc). You can signup, login, transfer funds or create a loan, trade and reserve, all from the comfort of Metamask or your Web3 Wallet.Signup ProcessIf you are a new user comfortable using web3 applications, you can create an account on Nuo by clicking \u2018Signup\u2019 and \u2018Continue with Metamask\u2019.You would be paying gas cost for creating a smart contract based Nuo account and would need to sign a transaction and agree to our \u2018Terms of Service\u2019 and \u2018Privacy Policy\u2019.Once you sign this transaction, you need to create a username on the platform and enter your email address (optional).Your Nuo account creation process will be completed once your signed transaction is confirmed onchain. You can check the status of your Nuo account by clicking \u2018Check Now\u2019If the signed transaction fails, you would see an option to recreate the account by signing another transaction.Password SignupIf you aren\u2019t comfortable using Metamask or a Web3 Wallet, you can still signup on Nuo with password. Your Nuo account will be a smart contract owned by a private key which is encrypted with your hashed password. While signing a transaction, this private key is decrypted on the client side with your password. Please note: losing or forgetting this password can result in permanent loss of funds due to non-custodial nature of the platform.Signup with Metamask vs Signup with PasswordSignup with Metamask vs Signup with PasswordUsers signing up with Metamask or Web3 Wallet will pay gas cost for Nuo account creation, while account creation using password is completely free.Users signing up with Metamask or Web3 Wallet will have a permanent account on signup completion, while users signing up with password will have a temporary account which will become permanent, once you transfer some funds to this account.Users signing up with Metamask or Web3 Wallet will not be able to add password authentication to their account, while users signing up with password can connect Metamask or Web3 Wallet to their account.Users signing up with Metamask or Web3 Wallet will not be able to use Nuo across devices or platforms and would be restricted by their Web3 Wallet portability, while users signing up with password will be able to access Nuo from any device or platform by using password authentication.Signup with Metamask or Web3 Wallet is an important feature to give users complete control over their funds on the platform without using hashed password and encrypted private keys. Our goal has always been to create an easy to use product for all users without compromising on the ethos of the Ethereum community.We believe this product is now completely aligned with the community ethos and paves a way for onboarding users who are new to Web3. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our community for their feedback on this product feature and constant support throughout our journey. We build and strive hard for you.PS: If you are an early user who has already signed up with password, you can still login with a connected wallet. You can also create a new account with this feature and can access multiple accounts with the same Metamask or Web3 wallet.Multiple users connected to same Metamask Wallet", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Decentralized Finance", "Defi", "Lending", "Metamask"]}, {"title": "How to create an Ethereum wallet using the Metamask Chrome extension", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kbennett2000_46495/how-to-create-an-ethereum-wallet-using-the-metamask-chrome-extension-78c210ea735b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Kris Bennett", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kbennett2000_46495", "publish_date": "2018-02-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-01", "readtime": "2.33", "claps": 72, "voters": 3, "content": "How to create an Ethereum wallet using the Metamask Chrome extensionKris BennettFollowFeb 26, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readCreating an wallet for ETH or other ERC20 tokens is easy using the metamask chrome extension.

The tools make big assumptions about your technical knowledge and strange errors abound. What we want to do with this post is go step-by-step for anybody who wants to invest in ZetoChain but doesn\u2019t know how.MetaMaskThe tool we will use is MetaMask. This is a program linked to your browser that offers a clean, basic interface for your Ethereum wallet. You can send Ether and check token balances also. If you\u2019re completely new to Ethereum, this is the best tool to use because it is the simplest.Creating Your AccountBefore you can even purchase Ether, you need to create your MetaMask wallet. Install MetaMask using the instructions on their website. Alternatively, install the Chrome or Firefox extension directly (it\u2019s not available for Safari, Internet Explorer or Edge).Once installed, click the MetaMask fox icon to configure it:Enter a strong passwordOnce you\u2019ve copied the seed phrase, click \u201cI\u2019ve copied it somewhere safe\u201dThis is the main interfaceYou can copy the wallet address from the menuBuying EtherNow, you\u2019ll need some ether. Exchanges are the most common method to get Ether into your wallet: Changelly, Gemini and Kraken are some popular sites. We recommend Coinbase \u2014 it\u2019s simple and supports buying Ether with either credit/debit cards or SEPA bank transfers. It\u2019s an involved process registering and purchasing Ether with an exchange so take your time. Once you are done, you can transfer the Ether you purchase to the wallet address MetaMask gives you.Important: you must transfer purchased ether to the MetaMask wallet address. We do not support exchange walletsAt this point, you have some Ether waiting to be spent. Now you need to get whitelisted for ZetoTokens.WhitelistingWe use a Know-Your-Customer process to validate everybody purchasing ZetoToken. This is just a formality but it can take up to 24 hours to process. We already have a post explaining how to do this so check it out.Buying ZetoTokensOnce you\u2019re received the whitelist confirmation email, it\u2019s time to get those tokens. You will need the contract address from the ZetoChain website. Open MetaMask and follow these steps:Click the Send buttonEnter the contract address from the ZetoChain website, select the total amount of Ether to send and click NextEnter a gas limit of 140000 and click SubmitTransaction is in progress. Be patient, this can take a while.Success! The transaction is complete.You\u2019ve sent your Ether successfully! But where are your tokens? You need to view the balance at the token address of 0xec9eb73cdbe82b5d60144e6034741a167922acea.MetaMask supports this too:Open the Tokens tab and click Add TokenEnter the token address (MetaMask autofills the other fields) and click AddYou can now see your token countThat\u2019s it! A couple of simple recommendations:Always copy and paste addresses, never try to type them by handWrite down the seed phrase MetaMask gives you on a piece of paper and keep it safe. This is the safest option that costs no money. Don\u2019t lose it though!Send a small amount of Ether first to check you\u2019ve done the right thingAll going well, you are now the proud owner of some ZetoTokens. Do you want to buy some more now? \ud83d\ude09Next time round, we\u2019ll explain the purchasing process with MyEtherWallet, another popular tool for the Ethereum network.

You have two options: you can simply create a new account, and send Ethereum to this account, so that you can interact with the Kambria Portal to withdraw your tokens, or you can import your current wallet using either your private keys, JSON file, or a Ledger Nano S/Trezor hardware wallet. I will provide instructions for each of these options.How To Create a New AccountIf you have not downloaded MetaMask, you can find the link here. (Note: NEVER download an extension you are not completely sure about. Please visit the software creator\u2019s official website if you are unsure).Open the MetaMask extension by clicking on it in the top right-hand side of your browser toolbar, and click the \u201cfox\u201d get started. You will be instructed to either create a password, or import an account with a seed phrase. If you have a seed phrase from another wallet, you can enter it here; otherwise, create a password very complicated in nature (I recommend using a password generator like LastPass). Write this password down, on paper, by hand. Do not store it as a photo or plain-text file on any of your devices.Proceed through the next step and terms of use until you get to the \u201cSecret Backup Phrase\u201d Here is, again, where you want to hand-write your secret phrase. You will use this to recover your funds in the event of hardware/software failure. This is very important, and needs to be stored in several safe locations (safety deposit box, safe, etc).At this point, you can either deposit ETH into your account, and interact with the Kambria Portal, or you can continue on importing your private keys, JSON file, or hardware wallet. If you do not want to deposit, just click the \u201cx.\u201dImporting Your WalletClick on your unique image in the top right-hand corner of MetaMask, and select \u201cImport Account.\u201dFor Private Keys or JSON Files, click on the \u201cImport\u201d tab, and select from the drop-down box between the two options.For private keys, you must copy/paste your private key into the text box and import your account.For JSON files, you must upload the file into MetaMask, enter the password associated with your JSON file, and import your JSON file.Importing Your Hardware WalletFollow the same steps above, except instead of clicking on the \u201cImport\u201d tab, you will need to click on the \u201cConnect\u201d tab.Select the hardware wallet you own. For these purposes, I will demonstrate on my Ledger Nano S. The same process for the Trezor should be nearly identical to import your accounts.You may have to toggle between Ledger Live and Legacy Ledger in the drop-down menu. Once you find the wallet you want to use, select it with the radio button and import your wallet.That\u2019s it! If you run into any issues at all, feel free to reach out to me on Telegram or my e-mail. Thank you for your support!

But as with many other things in life, convenience often brings a sacrifice to security.I know we\u2019ve all had that experience of wanting to use a new software or update our phones and computers and we\u2019re presented a page that represents that company\u2019s terms of service and privacy policy. Of course these papers read like a dry legal document and that\u2019s because they are.If you\u2019ve ever just clicked the \u201cagree\u201d box just to get going with the process without reading it you are certainly not the only one. But don\u2019t you ever wonder what it is exactly that you\u2019re agreeing to?In the case of Metamask their privacy policy is available for anyone to read.It\u2019s actually not that long or difficult to get through and it\u2019s implications can have an impact on your experience using their wallet.Here\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about:Their privacy policy is worded in a way that seems to give them some wiggle room. For example, when it states that \u201cThe personal information we collect from you generally may include:\u201d(and it goes on to list:)\u201cNetwork information regarding transactions\u201d\u201cWe become aware of the first public key created by virtue of the system design\u2026\u201d\u201cWe may receive network information from you as a result of your interaction with our Service.\u201d\u201cOur service requires the highest level of browser permissions that could potentially lead to procurement of more personal information\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Any identifying information collected via Google Analytics is controlled by Google.\u201dThe preceding paragraph explains that the initial public key created is made aware to them because that\u2019s how their system is designed and that all public keys thereafter are anonymous.However, not only are they \u201caware\u201d of the initial public key that you produce on their plug in, they also store it.They also explain that your interaction with their service may result in their servers receiving information like your IP addresses and possibly more.Also since this plug in has \u201cfull browser permissions\u201d this may also lead to them receiving personal information about you. They say that these permissions are for \u201cextremely limited technical purposes\u201d yet go on to vaguely explain that they don\u2019t obtain anything beyond what is necessary, without detailing what it is that is necessary.The privacy policy also states that your information will be shared with their affiliates or any third party that is required for the provision of the \u201cService\u201dAlso, as I stated earlier, the policy reiterates that MetaMask uses Google analytics and for that purpose, any identifying information that is collected by Google Analytics is then controlled by Google.The next paragraph explains all of the scenarios where they will disclose your information.When it comes to securing your information that they\u2019ve collected, that section is a bit thin and explains that they store the personal information on limited access or encrypted computer systems.Now if you\u2019re wondering if these security measures are sufficient, there has been instances where some users\u2019 information, for whatever reason has been compromised. They were required to download a new web browser and create a new MetaMask account and transfer their funds into that new account.This all means that they do indeed collect your data, maybe not all of it, but it\u2019s data that could leave you vulnerable or exposed to outside third parties.Granted, I can\u2019t tell exactly how many others have had this same experience or how drastic this security breach was for their network, but regardless, it\u2019s something to be aware of when considering if this service is worth it to you.Again, I myself have used Metamask in the past, and this post certainly isn\u2019t meant to be FUD in any way.I think it\u2019s important to be educated when making decisions, especially when it involves your crypto investments.While we\u2019re on the subject of using of in-browser wallets, there\u2019s another thing I think we should all be aware of that also involves the sharing of your data.Did you know that if you use any type of Ethereum based in-browser web wallet you could be sharing the fact that you use Ethereum with nearly every website that you visit?This doesn\u2019t mean they can steal your crypto without you knowing, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d get a confirmation notification at least.But this does mean that you could be put on a hackers radar if they know you\u2019ve got an investment in crypto.To MetaMask\u2019s credit they are making efforts to address these security issues.You can check out their GitHub to see their progress.It\u2019s also important to note that this is still very much a new application that is still working out it\u2019s kinks.This is also the case for many crypto wallets, not just those that are based on your web browser.You are ultimately assuming the risk when you choose to store your cryptos. It\u2019s very much worth it to take your time and educate yourself on the status of any wallet you want to use and how the team behind it is addressing its issues.Additional Reading/Sources:MetaMask Privacy PolicySteemit User\u2019s Experience with Security BreachMetaMask GitHub Addressing SecurityRisks of Using Ethereum In-Browser Wallets", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Privacy", "Cryptocurrency", "Metamask", "Ethereum", "Security"]}, {"title": "MetaMask Plugin Guide For Chrome", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmineau/metamask-plugin-guide-for-chrome-97353a472108?source=search_post", "author_name": "Aaron Darr", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@syphen", "publish_date": "2018-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-28", "readtime": "2.13", "claps": 150, "voters": 3, "content": "MetaMask Plugin Guide For ChromeAaron DarrFollowFeb 19, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readWe recommend that our novice Token Generation Event (TGE) participants use the MetaMask Chrome plugin.

BitCar currently requires MetaMask for you to purchase fractions of a car, as it operates as a bridge between your Ethereum account and the BitCar platform.This guide will take you through installing and setting up MetaMask in the Chrome browser, but this should be very similar in all browsers.Installing the PluginLet\u2019s begin by browsing to https://metamask.io, from here you\u2019ll be able to pick which browser extension you require. Currently it supports Chrome, Firefox, Opera or the Brave Browser.Clicking on \u2018Get Chrome Extension\u2019 will take you to the Chrome Web StoreSelecting \u2018Add to Chrome\u2019 at the top of the store will start the installation process, you may also be specifically prompted to install (as shown below), just select \u2018Add extension\u2019 and the installation will proceed.Setting up MetaMaskOnce the plugin is installed, the browser will navigate to the MetaMask Getting Started screen, select \u2018Get Started\u2019 to proceed.You will now be presented with two options; the first allows you to import an existing wallet (this is more of an advanced function and we\u2019re not going to cover it here), the second allows you to create a wallet. Please click on Create a Wallet to carry on.The next screen allows you to decide if you will allow MetaMask to gather information about its usage, please select No Thanks or I Agree to continue.Now you have to create a password to be used with MetaMask this password needs to be incredibly secure as it will provide access to your wallets. We suggest using a third-party password generating application such as KeyPass so that a strong password can be generated for you, which is neither easy to guess nor easy to decipher by a third party.Create a very secure password; we recommend having it generatedThe next step in the MetaMask setup process is a crucial one; this is where a secret backup phrase of 12 words or a mnemonic seed is generated by MetaMask. These twelve words can be used by yourself to restore your wallets should anything happen such as; you lose your computer, you uninstall MetaMask, or you forget the MetaMask password.Anyone who obtains this seed can regenerate and access all of your wallets, so it is therefore crucial that you do not store them on your computer in plain text. Instead, we recommend keeping them offline on several pieces of paper and stored securely, in a safe, for example. Alternatively you can try to memorize the 12 words - in the same order - remember though: if you should lose this backup phrase and you lose access to your wallets, you will not be able to recover them.Neither BitCar, MetaMask nor anyone else is able to assist in recovering \u201clost\u201d wallets.Once you are ready to write the phrase down (in a secure location where you screen cannot be seen), click on the padlock icon to reveal your secret wordsTake your time when recording this phrase remember that the order is also important, reading left to right, top to bottom. Once you are ready, click Next to continue.To confirm that you have recorded the correct phrase MetaMask now asks you to re-enter that phrase, this is done by clicking on the words in the same order in which they would have been written down. If you get the wrong order, you can click on the \u2018Back\u2019 link at the top left of the screen to check what you have recorded.MetaMask asks you to reenter the phrase \u2014 image blurred for security \u2014 NEVER reveal your phrase to anyoneOnce you have re-entered the phrase, please click on \u2018Confirm\u2019 to continue. The final screen reminds you of the security aspects of your seed phrase and how important it is. Think of this phrase as a key to your safe, or to your bank accounts - NEVER share this phrase with anyone and keep backups of it in secure locations, split up the words too.Once again; neither BitCar, MetaMask nor anyone else is able to assist in recovering \u201clost\u201d wallets.Accessing MetaMask and basic Account-KeepingOnce you click on the \u2018All Done\u2019 button, you will be taken to the MetaMask expanded view, where you can see your current account that\u2019s been created and your Ethereum balance. You should also be able to see a MetaMask icon in the top right-hand corner of your browser; you can access MetaMaskat any time by left-clicking on this icon which will then show a condensedview of the expanded screen.The MetaMask icon is in the corner of your browser and can be accessed by clicking on itShould you wish to access the full screen at any stage, please open MetaMask, click on the three dots at the right-hand side of your account name and select \u2018Expand View\u2019.Each account in MetaMask relates to an individual public address on the Ethereum blockchain. Each of these addresses can store Ether and other tokens such as BITCAR and the CAR tokens you receive as a digital receipt for each fraction of a car you purchase from the platform. You can differentiate each of your addresses, or accounts, by the first and last four digits shown by MetaMask and the image displayed at the top.Alternatively, you can also name your accounts to do this, select \u2018Details\u2019 under the account name and click on the pencil icon next to the current name. Type in whatever you want to call your account and then click on the tick icon to save, or the cross to cancel.The same screen can be accessed via the MetaMask Icon and clicking on the three bars or \u2018Menu\u2019 that appears and following the same Details > Pencil > type name > Tick steps outlined previously.If you want to quickly access your full address, just left click on the address under \u2018My Account\u2019 and it will copy it to your clipboard. You can then paste it into a text document or anywhere else as required.We hope you have enjoyed this basic introduction to setting up MetaMask \u2014 please check out our other guides to getting

RoyleFollowSep 19, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readSo you want to get into crypto. Well first, you\u2019re going to need a cryptocurrency wallet.What is a crypto wallet, you may ask? Well, simply put, it\u2019s an online wallet that securely stores all your crypto. There are also hardware wallets available but this post will be focusing on one of the simpler online wallets \u2014 MetaMask.Basically, there are two parts to a wallet. The public key, which is how people can send you crypto, and the private key, which is paired to your public key and is how you access your crypto, so be sure to keep this key private to only you! There is no need to write your private key down or ever share it with anybody (unless you are storing your private keys in a safety deposit box).MetaMask is the wallet I use, and let\u2019s be real, i\u2019m not the most computer savvy person out there. Yet somehow even I managed to figure it out, so I\u2019m confident that you will too.Let\u2019s get started!First, MetaMask is a Chrome extension, so you will first need to download the Chrome browser. You can do that here. (There are other extensions such as for Opera Browser but Chrome is the most popular and will be used in this example)After downloading Chrome, you will need to open a new page. Sometimes you will need to restart your computer to complete the download.Next, you will need to add MetaMask to your Chrome bar, which can be done here.Once you are at the Chrome store, in the Chrome browser, click \u201cadd to Chrome\u201d.\u200b\u200bA small window will pop up on your screen. Click \u201cadd extension\u201d.\u200bOnce you\u2019ve completed this step you will be redirected to a MetaMask intro video. After watching the video, click the MetaMask icon in your toolbar (circled in red in the picture below). Read the Privacy Notice and the Terms of Use clicking \u201cAccept\u201d after each.\u200b\u200bNow create your password to encrypt your new DEN. Passwords consisting of letters, numbers, and symbols are most secure.\u200b\u200bThe next screen will show your 12 seed words. With these, you will be able to restore your MetaMask account. Be sure to write these down and keep them somewhere safe.\u200b\u200bOnce you\u2019ve saved your seed words you are all set. Click \u201cI\u2019ve copied it somewhere safe\u201d to see your new wallet. From here you can buy and send tokens as well as add other wallets to your MetaMask account for easy access to all your cryptocurrencies!\u200b*Note, MetaMask is in Beta for an updated platform, so your MetaMask may look slightly different from the pictures above. Don\u2019t worry though, all the actions are still the same!And there you have it. Your new MetaMask account is all set up!But what good is a wallet without crypto to fill it?Sending and Receiving Ether (or any other ERC-20 Token)As you can see from the above picture, I dont have any ETH. This makes me sad, so I\u2019m going to ask a friend to send me some.In order for anyone to send you crypto, they will need youR PUBLIC KEY.To access this, first click the \u2018Details\u2019 button under your account,then highlight and copy your PUBLIC KEY to your clipboard. Sent this PUBLIC KEY to whoever will be sending you crypto:After sharing my public key with a friend, she was able to send me .005 ETH.Now I have a balance, I can send ETH to any PUBLIC KEY.To do so, click \u2018Send in the top right corner. You will then be prompted to enter the PUBLIC KEY of where you are sending the crypto:Remember, every transaction on the blockchain requires gas (ETH) so the amount you send will be less than your current balance, even if you opt to send your entire balance. Once you have entered the details, click \u2018Next.\u2019You can check the details on the next screen, the click the blue \u2018Confirm\u2019 button.You will then be taken back to your main page where you will see that the transaction has been submitted. Once the transaction goes through, the page will look like this:Clicking on the transaction will take you to the transaction page on Etherscan.And it\u2019s as simple as that!For the latest updates and more information, follow MetaMask on Twitter.And remember\u2026.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Wallet", "Metamask", "Crypto", "Team Glasses"]}, {"title": "How import a wallet to your MetaMask account?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/publicaio/how-import-a-wallet-to-your-metamask-account-dcaba25e558d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Publica.com", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@publicaio", "publish_date": "2018-05-31", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-31", "readtime": "4.44", "claps": 34, "voters": 3, "content": "How import a wallet to your MetaMask account?Publica.comFollowMay 31, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readIn order to import an existing wallet to a MetaMask account, follow these simple step-by-step instructions.

EtherDelta, ForkDelta and Cryptokittens are all dApps.Traditionally, in order to interact with Ethereum dApps, you would have to set up a full Ethereum node on your PC \u2014 a daunting task even for technologically savvy users. However, Metamask simplifies this by allowing you to interact with Ethereum dApps directly in your browser, without the need of such a complicated set-up.But there is more to MetaMask in that it also functions as a more secure \u2018hot\u2019 wallet for Ether (for an explanation, see our beginner\u2019s guide to staying safe in the world of crypto). The extra security is down to MetaMask encrypting your private keys with a password of your choice.We always advise using cold storage, but in the case of a decentralised exchange like EtherDelta, MetaMask provides you with an excellent, secure and convenient alternative way to use the exchange. Just make sure that your MetaMask wallet only holds a number of tokens/Ether that you will actively use \u2014 plus enough for gas, of course.Installing the MetaMask extensionSo now that we now why you should use MetaMask, let\u2019s get around to installing it. MetaMask is a browser extension currently supported on all 3 major browsers (Chrome, FireFox, Opera) and also on a new up-and-coming browser called Brave.The safest way to get the MetaMask extension is by visiting their homepage and following the links provided. The best practice would be to also check the comments and reviews in order to make sure that you are downloading the real app, and not a fake version.Always make sure that you download the real appAfter installing MetaMask, you will need to set up a new identity/wallet by clicking on the MetaMask logo (the little orange fox) in your app bar. This will start up MetaMask.After reading through and accepting the terms and conditions, you will be prompted to create a new password to encrypt your account.Be sure to use a strong password.Once completed, you will be given the seed words for your new account. Make sure to write these down in a safe place as it is the only way to restore lost MetaMask accounts.You are now set up to use MetaMask with the ever-growing list of dApps!Using MetaMask\u2019s special featuresIn order to truly appreciate MetaMask, you should familiarise yourself with what it does, along with few of its special features that make using dApps easier.Multiple wallets in MetaMaskMetaMask allows you to create multiple wallets. This means you can create a new wallet for each different purpose you use MetaMask for. View the example image below to see a simple use case scenario; we\u2019ve made specific wallets for EtherDelta, ForkDelta and everyday use.Create as many wallets as you\u2019re comfortable managing.To create a new account, click on the account icon (second icon from the right). From here, you can create a new account, or import one that you used before.Locking your accountMetaMask offers its users extra protection; you can lock your account behind a password, encrypting your account. This means that if your computer is compromised by hackers, they would need to know your MetaMask password in order to access your wallets. So don\u2019t use the same password for your computer as for your MetaMask account!Always lock your account when you are finished using it,If you want to lock your account, simply click on the icon in the upper right corner. This will display a drop-down menu that gives you a logout option. Simply click it and your account will be locked until you manually unlock it again.MetaMask and dAppsFinally we\u2019ll look at how MetaMask works with dApps, and it\u2019s surprisingly straightforward.As long as MetaMask is installed, it constantly scans for whether or not the page that you are visiting is a dApp. If it is, MetaMask will sync up with the dApp automatically. Most dApps will then detect whether MetaMask is locked, and will possibly prompt you to unlock MetaMask and refresh the page in order to use it. Once MetaMask and the dApp are connected, all Ether that you have on your connected MetaMask wallet will be open for you to use with the dApp in question.This concludes our second article on how to stay safe with Cryptocurrencies. We hope that we\u2019ve helped you learn how to keep yourself safe using the MetaMask dApp.If you want to learn more about Hash Rush, take a look at our new website, visit us on Discord, or subscribe to our email newsletter.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Gaming", "Ethereum", "Metamask", "Safety"]}, {"title": "\u5b89\u88ddMetamask\u548c\u5c0e\u5165\u9322\u5305", "post_link": "https://medium.com/joyso/%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%9Dmetamask%E5%92%8C%E5%B0%8E%E5%85%A5%E9%8C%A2%E5%8C%85-3d411248d11f?source=search_post", "author_name": "heidi ho", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@heidi_52171", "publish_date": "2018-05-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-14", "readtime": "2.72", "claps": 16, "voters": 3, "content": "\u5b89\u88ddMetamask\u548c\u5c0e\u5165\u9322\u5305heidi hoFollowMay 10, 2018 \u00b7 3 min read\u9032\u5165\u6b64\u7db2\u5740\u5b89\u88dd Metamask \u63d2\u4ef6\u5230Chrome\uff1ahttps://goo.gl/LJxH6z----\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ede\u9078 Create Account \u65b0\u5efa\u4e00\u500b Metamask \u9322\u5305\uff0c\u6216\u662f\u9ede\u9078 Import Account \u5c0e\u5165\u4f60\u672c\u4f86\u7684 ETH \u9322\u5305\uff08\u5982 MyEtherWallet\u3001Imtoken\uff09\u3002-------\u82e5\u4f60\u9078\u64c7 Import \u4f60\u672c\u4f86\u7684 ETH \u9322\u5305\uff0c\u5247\u9700\u8981\u8f38\u5165\u8a72\u9322\u5305\u7684\u79c1\u9470\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e36\u51fa\u9322\u5305\u3002--------Metamask \u57fa\u672c\u529f\u80fd\u4ecb\u7d39\uff1a1\u3001\u66f4\u6539\u9322\u5305\u540d\u7a31\uff1a\u9ede\u9078 Edit \uff0c\u66f4\u6539\u8a72\u9322\u5305\u540d\u7a31\uff0c\u6211\u53d6\u540dH01\u30022\u3001Oxc099D\u2026\u70ba\u4f60\u7684\u9322\u5305\u5730\u57403\u30010.005669 ETH \u70ba\u4f60\u9322\u5305\u4e2d\u7684 ETH \u91d1\u984d\u3002\u4e0b\u65b9\u76844.28 USD\u70ba\u4f60\u7684 ETH \u76ee\u524d\u7b49\u503c\u7684\u7f8e\u91d1\u91d1\u984d\u30024\u3001SENT\uff1a\u6703\u986f\u793a\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528 Metamask \u9322\u5305\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u7d00\u9304\u3002\uff08\u82e5\u4f60\u662f Import \u5176\u4ed6\u9322\u5305\u5247\u4e0d\u6703\u986f\u793a\u7d00\u9304\uff09-TOKENS\uff1a\u6703\u986f\u793a\u4f60\u540d\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u5e63\u540d\u7a31\u53ca\u6578\u91cf\u3002\u4f46\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u9ede\u9078ADD TOKEN \u4f86\u986f\u793a\u4f60\u540d\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u5e63\u3002------\u8cbc\u4e0a\u4ee3\u5e63\u5408\u7d04\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u4e0b\u9762\u7684Token Symbol \uff08\u4ee3\u5e63\u7a2e\u985e\uff09\u548c Decimals of Precision\uff08\u5c0f\u6578\u9ede\u5f8c\u5e7e\u4f4d\uff09\u6703\u81ea\u52d5\u5e36\u51fa\uff0c\u4e4b\u5f8c\u8acb\u9ede\u9078 ADD\u3002JOYSO \u5408\u7d04\u5730\u5740\uff1a0xDDe12a12A6f67156e0DA672be05c374e1B0a3e57-----\u756b\u9762\u6703\u986f\u793a\u4f60\u6240\u6301\u6709\u7684\u8a72\u4ee3\u5e63\u6578\u91cf\u3002--------\u9ede\u9078 [\u2026]---------\u5247\u6703\u8df3\u51fa\u6b64\u9ed1\u8272\u8996\u7a97\uff0c\u900f\u904e Etherscan \u770b\u4f60\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u7d00\u9304\u986f\u793a\u4f60\u9322\u5305\u5730\u5740\u7684 QR Code\u8907\u88fd\u4f60\u7684\u9322\u5305\u5730\u5740\u5c0e\u51fa\u4f60\u8a72\u9322\u5305\u7684\u79c1\u9470---JOYSO\u5b98\u7db2\uff1a https://joyso.io/zh_TW/ Telegram \uff1a https://t.me/joyso_io_zhFacebook \uff1ahttps://www.facebook.com/Joyso.io", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Joyso Chinese"]}, {"title": "Getting Started with Metamask!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/openberry/getting-started-with-metamask-b9ac23a10c83?source=search_post", "author_name": "Markus Viola", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@markusviola.bit", "publish_date": "2019-02-13", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-20", "readtime": "11.4", "claps": 13, "voters": 3, "content": "Getting Started with Metamask!Markus ViolaFollowFeb 13 \u00b7 12 min readIn this tutorial, we\u2019ll be discussing about an essential technology that correlates with the core operation of Ethereum: transactions. Whenever you have to make transactions, you will and will always have to go through that fox dude above.What\u2019s the good news\u2026It\u2019s a great that you\u2019re here, because I\u2019m gonna discuss about the basic stuffs on how Metamask works, just enough for you to get started on your dApp developments.Understanding MetamaskMetamask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows you to run Ethereum DApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.Basically, when you do transactions on the blockchain network, these uses computing power which what we call, gas cost. And much like gas in real life, you have to pay for it. So in order for you to pay that gas cost, you will need a wallet that handles your money, and that\u2019s where Metamask comes in.Well, I guess that\u2019s enough information about Metamask for now, we don\u2019t have to dive in to every side of the box, I bet you get the gist of its purpose already. So without further ado, let\u2019s jump right into the first question!How can I install it?Before you could actually install Metamask, you have to know that Metamask only supports a couple of browsers. Metamask supports the following browsers:Google Chrome (or any Chromium browsers, Brave, a DApp Chromium browser.)Mozilla FirefoxOperaIf you already have any of the above, you can proceed, otherwise, you should download at least one that is listed browsers and you\u2019re good to go!So, for you to download Metamask, you should first go to this website:Metamask: https://metamask.io/You can also download Metamask on your browser\u2019s plugin extension web store, but if you want to be directed automatically to the download page dedicated for your browser, this is the way to go.Once you\u2019re inside, you should see Metamask\u2019s iconic fox head following your mouse direction. Under it, you should see the GET CHROME EXTENSION orange button, click that, and you\u2019ll be automatically directed to your browser\u2019s store.For Google Chrome browser\u2019s example, you should see something like this:Now after getting in, just add the plugin extension, and it will install itself on the browser after downloading. (in Chrome\u2019s case, click the Add to Chrome button.)Once it is installed, a new tab will suddenly pop up, it\u2019s the Metamask wallet\u2019s welcome page. But you\u2019ll get the same interface on the actual wallet so just close it. Once closed, go and click here:If you click that icon, you should trigger the Metamask wallet\u2019s user interface. This is how the wallet looks like:Now just click continue, and you\u2019ll be directed to creating your own password. Don\u2019t go import seed since you don\u2019t have an existing account yet. You will use that if you want to recover your account which will be tackled as well later on.After creating and confirming your password, you\u2019ll go through some terms and agreements, then you\u2019ll be given a secret backup phrase. That phrase is the heart of your account since it is derived from a unique hash created when you made created the account just now.As said, you shouldn\u2019t compromise the phrase to anyone, because if you\u2019re wallet has cryptocurrencies inside then that can be transferred to someone else. Although Metamask is a wallet made for developers, you still have to exercise secrecy.(The account I have shown is for demonstration purposes so it\u2019s totally fine.)After saving the phase, you will need to confirm it next. Then it will ask you if you want to deposit, skip, and close that for now.Finally, you\u2019re done! You have successfully installed Metamask, and made you\u2019re very own wallet. Yeah, we did install Metamask, but what is the catch about that wallet, what is it capable of. This leads us to the next point:What can it do?For the features of Metamask, there\u2019s actually a lot that you can do, but I\u2019m not gonna cover everything since my focus is to teach you just enough to get you ready for developing your Ethereum decentralized applications.Here are the basic features of Metamask that you will need:Add/Importing accountsSwitching accountsSwitch networksRequest tokens (Testnet Faucet)Sending tokens (Cryptocurrency)Add/Search tokenGet backup seedAlright, so that\u2019s all the things that you will learn about in this tutorial. Let\u2019s now head to the next question:How do I use it?To track our progress easier, let\u2019s just learn all those listed features from top to bottom. But before that, I\u2019m just gonna show you a few helpful things:Let\u2019s try to look at the highlighted portion on the top side.Below the name of the account: Account 1, you can see random-looking character string, something that looks like this, 0x557e\u20264c12. That is your account\u2019s wallet address, if you click it, the address will be copied on your clipboard.This is very helpful since you\u2019ll be using your account a lot on your smart contract development and on your dApps as a test account.Next is the one below, that is your transaction history. There, you will see the state of your transactions whether or not it is finished, pending or the transaction had failed, etc.Also, if you want to switch the value from Fiat to ETH you can do that by going to the top right highlighted button, as shown here:When clicked, a window will show up under it. From there, you can see from the bottom most part, which is the Settings button with the gear icon. Hit that button and it should this:You\u2019ll be taken to this interface, initally on the Settings tab. Without scrolling, you\u2019ll be able to see the Primary Currency section, from the Fiat radio button, switch it to *ETH, and that\u2019s it. If you go back to your Main interface by hitting the fox head button, it should change by now:So, too much for that, now let\u2019s head on to the first topic.Add/Importing accountsFor this feature, this lets you add more than one wallet. This can be useful both in development and in real life. Since you\u2019ll be making applications, you will need to test not only one account, you have to get your accounts interact with each other on a smart contract, makes sense right?Adding accountsFrom main, for you to add an account, just go to the highlighted top right button and click it. This will prompt a new window, showing a list of items.On the top side of that window, it shows the list of accounts that you currently have. As of now, you only have one account which is Account 1.To add another, just click the first option below it: + Create Account. When clicked, you\u2019ll be directed to a very self explanatory interface, which contains an input for the name your account and the button Create, hit it.When you go back, alas, you have your new account! It also has its own unique address, which is nice. You can make as much as you want. (I think? Haven\u2019t tried 100 accounts yet.)Importing accountsIf you have an existing account, you can hit the Import Account. You will be taken in an interface where you will have to put a secret backup phase in the private key string text input of the Private Key category. If you want to import JSON, you can do so by changing it in JSON. But it\u2019s very unlikely to use that one though. Last thing to do is to hit the Import button.Switching accountsSince you learned how to import and add accounts, I assume you made new ones too. So let\u2019s learn how to switch accounts!In the example above, you can see that I have already added 2 more accounts: Account 2 and Account 3. On the same window as before, if we want to switch to Account 2, from the list, just click it. That easy, you have already switched accounts!Switch networksSwitching networks is an important thing about Metamask. As you have recently seen, we\u2019re using the Main Ethereum Network. But that\u2019s not the development network, there\u2019s a network for one.As you can see on the picture above, we\u2019re on the Main network. But underneath it are developers\u2019 available networks. Most often, developers usually use the Ropsten Test Networkand Rinkeby Test Network. That is if you\u2019re using Remix directly with injected Web3 setting. Localhost:8545 however, is for your local Ethereum network, if you\u2019re using Truffle and you made your own blockchain network locally.Choosing a network is a case to case basis, but for a common action, let\u2019s choose Ropsten Test Network, click it and you\u2019re in it already!Request tokensIn making transactions, it costs gas amount, and gas costs money. So, we will need tokens everytime we interact/test contracts or sending tokens.In the Main network, you have three ways to deposit token:Directly Deposit Ether: by clicking the View Account, using QR code, your other wallet that has tokens can transfer tokens by reading it with a camera.CoinBase: this is usually the way if you\u2019re new to cryptocurrency. You can go to its site, and buy ETH tokens.ShapeShift: basing on its name, it shifts your non-Ethereum tokens to Ethereum ones.But all these are mostly used if you\u2019re actually going to spend and do real transactions on Ethereum. For the developers however, if you switch to a developer network such as Ropsten Network, you will see this:Instead of Coinbase and ShapeShift, you will see a Test Faucet. By clicking the Get Ether button, you will be able to get free tokens. But these tokens have no real value since it\u2019s a testing network. You\u2019ll be taken on a website, for example for Ropsten.By just clicking the green button, you\u2019ll be able to request ether. From there, for a short moment, it will take effect and give you tokens that you\u2019ll be needing as gas for testing in development.Here is the link of the Testnet Faucet, get yours now!Send tokensBefore proceeding, try getting tokens for at your one account from the Test Faucet on Ropsten Network. If you already have tokens, we can now try send tokens to another account. To see the effect, send it to your other created account.From the Ropsten Network, if you hit the Send button, you\u2019ll be sent to this interface. In the example, Account 3 has 3 ETH, and by hitting the recipient address input text, you\u2019ll be able to choose or paste down an address.In your case, use your account that has ETH, and send it to your other account. Set the amount on the Amount section, and you can set how fast the transaction will be beneath it, it\u2019s actually customizable if you choose Advance Options.After you had set everything, hit Next. And you\u2019ll be sent in this interface:Confirmation InterfaceThis is the exact interface whenever you make transactions on Ethereum using Metamask. You\u2019ll see a lot of this prompting interface once you start developing.From here you can also edit the gas fee, to make your transaction faster. In here, we are sending 0.457 ETH to Account 1. Hit Confirm and you\u2019re transaction will be processed and will also show up on your Transaction History on the Main interface.Add/Search tokensAside from ETH token, there are also different kinds of tokens that you can use based on what kind of DApp are you using, usually when you make a DApp they also make their own cryptocurrency. So in here, I\u2019ll show you how to search and add your own token.(By standard, cryptocurrency tokens should be ERC20 type.)Add tokensFrom the Main interface, go to top left menu icon beneath the fox\u2019s head or the Home button. Once you hit the menu, you\u2019ll be able to see this one slide:From what you can see above, your token shows up, under that is actually a supposed list for the other tokens. Since you only have the ETH token, you can\u2019t notice the list.With that said, you can add a token, it\u2019s either you add your own made token from an ERC20 standard contract or you search someone\u2019s token assuming that you have one already. Let\u2019s go with the adding your own first.On the Custom Token tab, is where you can add your own created token. There are 3 input fields. The last two fills in by itself once you fill in the Token Address input text field. So the first one is the only needed.If you plan to make your own token, you can try it on the Custom Token tab. Just hit Next then you\u2019re good to go, it is added to the list. If you choose one from the list, you can use it for your transactions related to that token.Now on to the searching of token.Search tokensSame as before, if you go to the menu icon again, on the Search tab, you will see this interface:As seen above, EOS is a known example of a crypto token. If in an instance, you have received EOS tokens, then you can search and verify it from here, and add it to your token list.Get backup seedIf in case you forgot your secret backup phrase, you can get it from your settings, so go back to settings from the top right menu button.When you get inside Settings, and if you scroll down on the middle you will find the Reveal Seed Words section. If you hit the Reveal Seed Words button, the secret backup phrase will be shown and you can copy it. Keep it safe!SummaryIt\u2019s finished! That tutorial sure was a bit long but I\u2019m pretty sure that what you learned just now, will equip you enough for your future or current developments for making your decentralized Ethereum applications.In case you forget some things you learned from here, you can always refer back here. It\u2019s natural if you don\u2019t remember everything in one go, every developer\u2019s been there. You\u2019ll get better soon enough!Look, even these non-blockchain related Microsoft developers are even happy for you:But really now, you did a great job out there. Hope you learned a lot and good luck venturing more about blockchain.Until then, signing out, and stay tuned!openberry is a tutorial marketplace, designed to allow anyone to learn blockchain programming.openberry | blockchain tutorialAnyone using openberry can become a blockchain engineer.

If you\u2019re holding Bela long term, you should be staking it as well.Every year, about 4.1 million Bela is created and goes to users who stake their Bela. Instead of earning a percentage interest on staked Bela, every user staking Bela is competing for a share of this pre-set amount. This decentralizes the power in a more equal manner among all Bela users. Here\u2019s how to stake your Bela on Metamask. If you already have Bela on your Metamask, you can skip to step 4.1.

\u00b7 3 min readSince the last update, we worked on more backend optimizations and other integrations that we hope to announce soon! While we work on those issues and improvements, we updated our frontend with really nice features for event creators. Plus we completed the mobile responsive updates so if you want to use cypher browser on iOS you can!Fiat Prices in Event CreationAs an event creator you will now see how much your ticket will be in the fiat currency of your choice (USD, Euro, Pounds). You no longer need to convert ETH to your currency before you set your price.This one is an obvious feature that has been missing and frequently requested. A user can select the dropdown arrow next to the currency icon and select the desired currency (USD, Euro, Pounds). If you want to have your currency added, please don\u2019t hesitate to email us at info@hellosugoi[dot]com.In the coming weeks, we will allow users to set the price in fiat and have the ETH field populated automatically.MetaMask Account Auto UpdateOnce source of problems has been the disconnect between the accounts seen in MetaMask and our dApp. If you changed your account in MetaMask while using our dApp, we would not notice the change. This would cause errors and make event creation/ticket purchasing annoying.We have eliminated this possibility, because our dApp now detects account changes in MetaMask. We detect changes by polling MetaMask every few hundred milliseconds and if there is a change, we update the dApp.This means creators do not have to refresh the page whenever they change accounts in MetaMask! This is a big win.Mobile ResponsivenessSome of you may recall that we had a few responsive issues in our app on mobile phones. I\u2019m happy to announce that we have gone through the entire app and cleaned up all the responsive issues! This means we look good on mobile.ConclusionThough it\u2019s been a while since our last update, we have made significant user experience updates to our dApp. The auto conversion to fiat makes event creation easy and transparent. The MetaMask account linking makes users lives easier and ours as well. We have to deal with fewer bug requests.To keep up with the latest HelloSugoi news as it\u2019s happening, we invite you join our mailing list, message us on Discord, follow us on Twitter @HelloSugoi, and visit our website hellosugoi.com.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "JavaScript", "Dapps", "Solidity"]}, {"title": "Don\u2019t expose yourself: Totle and the recent MetaMask updates", "post_link": "https://medium.com/totle/dont-expose-yourself-totle-and-the-recent-metamask-update-3191bc5fbe43?source=search_post", "author_name": "Totle", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@totlecrypto", "publish_date": "2018-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-15", "readtime": "1.56", "claps": 64, "voters": 2, "content": "Don\u2019t expose yourself: Totle and the recent MetaMask updatesTotleFollowNov 4, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readOn November 2nd, our friends at MetaMask released an update that will stop exposing user accounts by default. Today, Totle is breaking down what this important and exciting update means for you.The updateMetaMask released a \u201cprivacy mode\u201d update that will no longer expose users\u2019 public addresses to websites without their consent. In the past, MetaMask automatically injected an Ethereum provider and Web3 instance, meaning your public address would be shared with the dapp or website you were using.This exposed potentially sensitive information, including your balance and transaction history. This new \u201cprivacy mode\u201d feature is opt-in only, so users will need to enable privacy mode in their settings.From MetaMask: Over the next few months, users may begin to see more \u201cLogin\u201d or \u201cConnect\u201d buttons on dapps. These buttons will prompt a popup from MetaMask (or other dapp browser of choice) asking if the user wants to grant the site access to their public account information. The extension will remember which sites have been approved until the user clears their list.On November 2nd, 2018, MetaMask plans to release these changes with \u201cprivacy mode\u201d disabled by default. This option will eventually be enabled by default in a future release.What this means for youIf enabled, this update is reflected in the Totle web app each time you connect your MetaMask wallet. You will see a \u201cConnect Request\u201d pop-up, informing you that our web app will be able to see your public address.Privacy and security are the pillars of Totle\u2019s values; therefore, we recommend all of our users to enable this feature to protect themselves from malicious actors and anyone else looking to get a glimpse of your transactions.For more information about this update, check out MetaMask\u2019s detailed post: https://medium.com/metamask/https-medium-com-metamask-breaking-change-injecting-web3-7722797916a8Note: As of this publication, we haven\u2019t seen updates to the web UI for a privacy mode setting in our MetaMask extensions, but we\u2019re sure the MetaMask team is working diligently to get this out.Have questions?

It is comprised entirely of smart contracts and has an easy to use interface connected via Metamask to interact with the contracts.Tokenized bonding curves and curation markets have been at the front of the innovation discussion in the Ethereum community because of the power they enable the market with.Essentially a bonding curve is a smart contract that can issue tokens via staking value, or \u201cbonding\u201d based on a floating price point where the x axis is how many tokens have been generated and the y axis is how expensive they become. The value bonded stays in the contract ready to be redeemed for the secondary token at the price the graph is currently at. This means an early bonder can profit after others have entered the contract and the price function has moved.The first night the platform went live, the bonding curve for a simple Poloniex api call went over 14x without needing a market or liquidity to have people trade it.The possibilities for a curation market are still just being discovered but some of the most powerful currently being discussed are:Curating Oracles for trusted data feeds; The staked value creates an incentive for the provider to remain honest while giving an indicator to the developers as to which feed the community has decided is most valuable. This also allows the provider to have a fluctuating price point and make more money based on a higher demand.Ico launch platform; Generating a curve that issues erc20 secondary tokens eliminates the need for liquidity or exchange listings or market makers as participants can enter and exit positions and have an increase or decrease in value by interacting directly with the contracts.Prediction markets; In the simplest form 2 bonding curves are created for a long and short on bitcoin and at the end of a pre set period the losing curve pays out the staked value as a dividend to the winning curve. The truly exciting part about this is that the earlier one enters a curve the less expensive the position is, rewarding early prediction.Fundraising or Bounty Development competitions; Generate one master curve with a problem to be solved, and individuals stake value to this curve. Participants who want to enter the competition would each have their own curve. The community would then speculate on who they believe to be the winner by staking to one of the competitors curve. If the bounty is satisfied the winner would receive the original master value with the speculators on that winner receiving the value staked by the losing curves.These are just the first possibilities of an entirely new speculative curation market that is running live on Ethereum mainnet at admin.zap.org and you can use Metamask to easily interact with the contracts.Here\u2019s some links for more info on what a tokenized bonding curve curation market is:https://medium.com/@simondlr/tokens-2-0-curved-token-bonding-in-curation-markets-1764a2e0bee5The Emergence of Cryptoeconomic PrimitivesThe building blocks of a token-based societyblog.coinbase.comFull market live on mainnet: admin.zap.org (use Metamask)\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Also be sure to join our un-official Zap Community channels at https://discord.gg/QTGsczR and https://twitter.com/ZapUnofficial!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Oracles", "Bonding Curves", "Curation Markets", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "How to use MetaMask to transfer ETH to MVL Address", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@mvlchain/how-to-use-metamask-to-transfer-eth-to-mvl-wallet-how-to-join-mvl-ico-9768a2f0cddb?source=search_post", "author_name": "Trust-Driven MVL", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mvlchain", "publish_date": "2018-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-23", "readtime": "2.29", "claps": 51, "voters": 2, "content": "How to use MetaMask to transfer ETH to MVL AddressTrust-Driven MVLFollowApr 25, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readHi! MVL Team here.First round of Pre-ICO will start on April 26 at 9 pm UTC+9. In order to participate, you have to send ETH to MVL ICO Contract Address. You can use MetaMask to do so. Once you transfer ETH to MVL ICO Contract Address, you will in return get MVL Tokens.1. Sign up and log in our homepage (https://mvlchain.io). Go to My Page and click ICO(Token Sale) and see MVL ICO Contract Address. This is will appear after April 26 at 9 pm UTC+9. You have to add your ETH wallet first.2. Open Metamask and click \u2018Send.\u2019 See how to install Metamask here.3. In the first field, insert MVL ICO Contract Address and insert the amount of ETH you wish to transfer. Hit Next.4. Please check if the amount of ETH you want to transfer is correct. If you go back and change the ETH amount and come back to this page, the amount may not be changed. So click the arrow in the yellow box so the ETH amount is correct.The transaction fee occurs so you have to set gas price. We recommend Gas limit to 250,000 and gas price to 10~11. Unused as gas will be refunded. We will let you know how to check used gas amount below. The gas will be used from your ETH wallet. So you have to have 0.01 ETH more than the amount you want to transfer to the MVL ICO.5. Next, you will see this page. If you set a transaction fee that is not too low, transfer will occur within one minute. Now click \u201cView account on Etherscan\u201d.6. You will then go to https://etherscan.io/ where you can see your wallet address, MVL ICO Contract Address and used gas amount. Here you will see your transaction.7. Please visit MVL Official Homepage and check if the deposit status has been changed.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Mvl", "Mvlchain"]}, {"title": "Guide: How to view NAVI on Metamask extension and MEW?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/naviaddress/guide-how-to-view-navi-on-metamask-extension-and-mew-7054acc59dab?source=search_post", "author_name": "NAVIADDRESS", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@naviaddress", "publish_date": "2018-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-01", "readtime": "1.69", "claps": 31, "voters": 3, "content": "Guide: How to view NAVI on Metamask extension and MEW?NAVIADDRESSFollowApr 12, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readAdd NAVI to your Metamask:To add NAVI to your Metamask you should to go through following steps:Login to your Metamask.2.

Metamask and Ethereum WalletMaida BarrientosFollowNov 4, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readIf you\u2019d like to move around your CTB tokens, you sure can with this simple guide. You will just need two things metamask and wallet.ethereum.org on your browser.Step 1.Log in to your Metamask using Chrome and select the \u201caccount that has CTB tokens in it\u201d.You will see that I have 279 CTB tokens.Step 2.Then go to https://wallet.ethereum.org and you will instantly see your account in the dashboard. They\u2019re actually a great pair because with the Ethereum browser you can do transactions that you can\u2019t do with Metamask.This is what I see when I log into my Ethereum Online Wallet browser. When you want to switch accounts in Metamask, the Ethereum browser will also update.Step 3.Click \u201cSend\u201d in your Ethereum Wallet or check out this video below.

Writing lots of software will do that to you. It\u2019s interesting to me that over the course of my last decade of software engineering, the strength of this sentiment has maintained a consistent linear increase. I mean, there is a lot of software out there and frankly, most of it sucks.And this isn\u2019t a reflection of the skill of the authors of software, necessarily, but rather a reflection of how most engineers think. It seems to me that most people simply don\u2019t possess the type of adversarial mindset that is a prerequisite for building secure systems (and I imagine they lead happier lives because of this). Even those of us who have a sort of natural inclination towards designing around \u201cMurphy\u2019s Law\u201d gain the trust of others only to make catastrophic mistakes.That\u2019s why when you come across a project, expecting to discover the usual class of money-draining, key-stealing, and privacy-breaking issues that plagues cryptocurrency wallets, but instead find a well-documented, highly-modular, and defensively-designed project like MetaMask, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to give credit where credit is due.In my opinion, one of the things that makes MetaMask so important is how they have broken apart tons of the code into generic packages that can be used by the wider free software community. While this was actually a little concerning during the audit due the difficulty of tracing some pretty critical code paths through sometimes several dependencies, what we have now is not only a security audit that benefits MetaMask and its users, but one that benefits developers and users around the world using these generic packages in their own projects.While we didn\u2019t identify any critical vulnerabilities, we did find many areas of improvement to further harden the project. This feedback was received very well and the MetaMask team very promptly incorporated our feedback which we have verified. You can read the complete final report here for all the details. It\u2019s pleasing to see projects that protect the funds of thousands of users place the kind of importance on security that MetaMask has. I know that the next time someone asks me to recommend a secure Ethereum wallet, MetaMask will be one of my recommendations.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Wallet", "Security", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "How to generate your ERC-20 compatible wallet address to receive and send HLC token using Metamask", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@QitmeerChain/how-to-generate-your-erc-20-compatible-wallet-address-to-receive-and-send-hlc-token-using-metamask-e26c22ccce97?source=search_post", "author_name": "Qitmeer", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@QitmeerChain", "publish_date": "2019-04-28", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-28", "readtime": "2.16", "claps": 100, "voters": 2, "content": "How to generate your ERC-20 compatible wallet address to receive and send HLC token using MetamaskQitmeerFollowApr 28 \u00b7 3 min readHLC(HalalChain)Step 1: Install MetaMask in your browser (https://metamask.io/).

You gotta know the basics right! ;-DWhat is BlockchainBlockchain technology uses advanced cryptography to digitally store and secure information on a public, decentralized ledger. The information, whether it\u2019s a simple transaction or a more complex smart contract, is forever stored on the blockchain making it verifiable and transparent.The wikipedia page says: \u201cBlockchain distributed ledger technology is more a foundational technology \u2014 with the potential to create new foundations for global economic and social systems\u2026The use of blockchains promises to bring significant efficiencies to global supply chains, financial transactions, asset ledgers, decentralized social networking\u2026\u201dSo Blockchain technology allows for faster, more secure & transparent transactions. Value or goods in a supply chain can be accurately measured and verified while assets can be efficiently tokenized and distributed faster than shares of a company. Wow, looks like this is probably the biggest revolution since the world wide web! Some are even calling blockchain a new \u201cinternet of value\u201d. Fasten your seat belts coz here\u2019s some things you should know \u2014EthereumReleased in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and other developers, it is a global decentralized distributed ledger. Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain is also used to generate smart contracts and advanced decentralized applications (Dapps) like CryptoBots. It is said that if Bitcoin is digital gold, then Ethereum must be the digital oil of the 21st century!MetamaskAs new technologies and infrastructures are being built there is an ever growing need for awesome user-friendly applications that allow us to \u201cnavigate\u201d and operate in these new cryptographically advanced ecosystems. Metamask is a super simple wallet/browser that lets you easily interact with the Ethereum blockchain and its Dapps.\u201cMetaMask also lets the user create and manage their own identities, so when a Dapp wants to perform a transaction and write to the blockchain, the user gets a secure interface to review the transaction, before approving or rejecting it.\u201dSimply put: Metamask is your wallet for ether, CryptoBots and other Dapps that work on the Ethereum blockchain!Game theoryCryptoBots are more than just a simple game. By owning these contemporary crypto collectibles you will have access to a wide range of opportunities. Building, breeding, trading and battling your assets. Just like in game theory, strategy and execution will be the key to building your own super-cool bot army!We\u2019ll learn about breeding strategies & battling tips in the next lessons. For now, what you should keep in mind is that in the CryptoBots market you will notice lots of smart collectors who are building, breeding, trading and battling their bots to discover and generate even cooler one-of-a-kind bots!CollectiblesCollecting is probably one of mankind\u2019s greatest hobbies. Whether for passion, for economic reasons or for fun, people of all ages and origins have been collecting and trading all sorts of things, items, objects and artifacts for millennia.For some, collecting may seem like a waste of time, but there\u2019s more to it. Collectors know that everything has value. Sure, precious things have value due to their scarce nature (ex: gold, silver, diamonds, Bitcoin). But rare things, they have value because they are unique (ex: a painting, a limited edition baseball card, a rare CryptoBot!)More recently collectors of all ages have started gathering memorabilia (ex: sports, music and movies memorabilia). Whether it was your Star Wars posters or your favorite band\u2019s vinyl records, sometime in your life you have probably collected something too! Remember baseball cards or barbies? How about Pok\u00e9mon or those Magic cards? Let\u2019s face it. Whether you are 6 years old or 60 years old, starting a new collection is always something special!Well\u2026With the advent of blockchain technology the experience of collecting (as in trading rare, unique, physical/digital assets) will give birth to whole new \u2018breed\u2019 of Collectors \u2014 no pun intended! ;-)Take CryptoBots for example. When a new bot is manufactured, ownership of that bot is proven on the blockchain and no one except you has access to that new digital asset. You can then easily trade your assets on the market where there may be more than one person looking for that special bot you own (instead of having to wait years to sell that vinyl record on ebay\u2026). Remember, the power of blockchain is speed: your digital assets can now be exchanged quickly & cost effectively!We have already seen the potential of blockchain digital collectibles with last year\u2019s CryptoKitties \u201cmania\u201d. For those of you who are new to the crypto-world, with CryptoKitties you can buy a digital cat for some ETH (Ethereum). You can \u201csire\u201d (breed) kitties and if you are lucky enough you can get a rare cat and then hope to sell it for profit on the market. But that\u2019s just about it\u2026The game has no action, no strategy or gaming plans you can elaborate, no fights or other elements that create that extra fun.CryptoBots takes the whole blockchain digital collectable assets to a whole new level! Multiplayer battles, manufacturing, recycling (think 21st century Pok\u00e9mon cards, but on the blockchain!). You can send your digital assets to battle or you can breed them with other bots to generate new one-of-a-kind bots. Each bot belongs to a given generation, has a unique immutable genetic code and other specific traits/modules which will determine its power and/or rarity.With battles for example, CryptoBots will mathematically battle against each other (remember: they are unique smart contracts that operate on the Ethereum blockchain) counting every strike depending on antagonist modules and bot Power. We\u2019ll explain the battles in the next lessons, the important thing to know is that if you participate in battles and your bot is the winner, you will be rewarded with a new bot (usually generated from the genes of your winning bot). Kewl!!With manufacturing and recycling, you will be able to shuffle DNA from two bots in order to generate an even more unique little pal. As the platform evolves we\u2019ll be explaining the mechanics behind this awesome feature too.As a collector, what you should know is that at the time of writing there are just under 3000 CryptoBots. This means that if you\u2019re getting one now, you will be the proud owner of one of the first 3K bots EVER MADE!Market theoryCollectors\u2019 markets are very different from exchanges. When you trade BTC or ETH on an exchange, that 0.01 ETH you own is exactly identical to the 0.01 ETH of someone living on the other side of the world.When you trade CryptoBots though, each of these little bots is particular and special. Savvy collectors also look at a bot\u2019s parents and not just modules, bot power, generations etc\u2026You could be selling a super-rare bot at an incredibly cheap price unknowingly! That\u2019s why it will be of paramount importance that you DYOR and learn about your bots as well as how the market works before making any \u201cbig moves\u201d\u2026Put all of these elements together and you will soon realize that CryptoBots is more than just a fun crypto-game. It may bring a whole new level of blockchain experience for users of all ages. For some of you, purchasing your first little bot may be the the stepping stone into the incredible world of crypto, blockchain technology & digital assets!Finally, the last part of this lesson, which is probably the most important one of all\u2026HAVE FUN!!!ENJOY that victorious occasion when your bot wins its first battle. CELEBRATE that blissful moment when you see your newly manufactured bot for the first time. MAKE PROFIT from putting up a special bot for sale or MANUFACTURE that cool bot at a low price!Whether you are trading, sharing or breeding bots, these are your digital assets, your property, your fun! Choose them wisely together with your partner, ask your kids\u2019 opinions, unleash the child within you to pick & collect your favorite bots. After all, we\u2019ve all been kids before!In conclusion, you\u2019re absolutely going to love CryptoBots. They are massively FUN & INSPIRING!

Ethereum smart contract developers face a bunch of issues. One of them is proper function execution.In this post I highlight function execution in deployed Ethereum smart contract using React UI through Myetherwallet(MEW) and Metamask. This article is not intended for absolute beginners. If you make the first steps in Ethereum smart contract development, I encourage you to read this article(https://medium.com/crypto-currently/build-your-first-smart-contract-fc36a8ff50ca). It covers a variety of topics for beginners.In my github account (https://github.com/cyberbono3/mintable-erc20-token ) you can view the basic ERC-20 token contract (DecypherCoinContract) and React UI sources in src folder.Primarily, I address the function execution in Ethereum contract using React UI through MyEtherWallet(MEW). Please open App.js in src folder to view the source code.First of all, I define the following variables:1)ETHEREUM_CLIENT is web3 object in Kovan testnet;2)decypherCoinContractABI represents abstract interface of the contract;3)decypherCoinContractAddress is the address of the deployed contract in Kovan testnet;4)decypherCoinContract represents contract instance in Kovan testnetwork.var decypherCoinContract = ETHEREUM_CLIENT.eth.contract(decypherCoinContractABI).at(decypherCoinContractAddress)Eessentially, Ethereum is Turing state machine. It is important to distinguish two types of function calls in Ethereum:1)function calls that does not cause Ethereum state change. For instance, DecypherCoinContract contains totalSupply() property that specifies the total amount of tokens this contract has. Execution of this function does not alter the state of Ethereum and can be accomplished in the following fashion:var totalSupply =decypherCoinContract.totalSupply.call().Finally, it is free of charge.2)functions calls that change Ethereum state. DecypherCoinContract has mintToken() function that aims to append the total amount of tokens. Therefore, this function call leads to Ethereum state change and must be signed by private key. Additionally, you have to pay a certain amount of Ether for its execution. I explain this process in MEW below.In order to execute mintToken() function you have to :1)create a raw transaction with the following parameters in Hex formatvar rawTx = {nonce: ETHEREUM_CLIENT.toHex(ETHEREUM_CLIENT.eth.getTransactionCount(\u20180xaC24aB7Be05a8d42Ce958B6310990c95E1e69793\u2019)),gasPrice: ETHEREUM_CLIENT.toHex(20000000000),gasLimit: ETHEREUM_CLIENT.toHex(60000),to: decypherCoinContractAddress,from: \u20180xaC24aB7Be05a8d42Ce958B6310990c95E1e69793\u2019,value: \u20180x00\u2019,data: payloadData }, wherea)nonce represents the number of transactions initiated from the particular address. It is used to prevent dupicate transactions;b)to: contract address;c) acceptable gasPrice and gasLimit;d)from: address of contract creator;e)value is amount of Ether you would like to transfer. In our case it is set to zero.g)data = decypherCoinContract.mintToken.getData(this.numTokens). I use the method getData to call the function mintToken(this.numTokens) for contract instance decypherCoinContract. As you can see in DecyphetCoinContract.sol from my github repository, the function mintToken appends the new tokens to the contract. For additional security, only owner is allowed to execute it.function mintToken(uint256 _amountToMint) onlyOwner {balances[this] += _amountToMint;totalSupply += _amountToMint;}2)sign a raw transaction with your private keyThe private key is represented as a buffer in Hex format;var key = new Buffer(\u2018private_key\u2019, \u2018hex\u2019)The low level library \u201cethereumjs-tx\u201d is used to output tx object that is signed by private key.var tx = new EthTx(rawTx)tx.sign(key)3)send the signed transaction to the Kovan testnetvar stx = tx.serialize()ETHEREUM_CLIENT.eth.sendRawTransaction(\u20180x\u2019 + stx.toString(\u2018hex\u2019), (err, hash) => {if (err) { console.log(err); return; }console.log(\u2018contract creation tx: \u2018 + hash)Perhaps you already noticed the downside of this implementation. Exposure of private key in UI is a big deal. To overcome this issue, it recomended to use another wallet Metamask that represents Chrome extension. Unlike MEW, Metamask uses alternative workflow preventing exposure of private key. Metamask injects web3 object in any page that you are browsing.To execute arbitary functions in the contract you have to:1) access web3 object from global window, you can use the following Javascript code :var userEthereumClient;window.addEventListener(\u201cload\u201d, function() {userEthereumClient = window.web3;})2) get the contract instance as I described in the beginning of my postvar contract = userEthereumClient.eth.contract(abi).at(address);Hence, you are able to call various functions, e.g. namecontract.getBasicData(\u201cname\u201d, function(error, data) { console.log(data); });Through this post, I have explained the basics of function execution in Ethereum smart contract using Myetherwallet and Metamask. So, due to more secure workflow I encourage you to apply Metamask upon your Dapp developement.I would like to get your feedback. I apologize for my grammar skills in advance:)", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Metamask \uc774\ub354\ub9ac\uc6c0 \uc9c0\uac11 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@David_Park/metamask-%EC%9D%B4%EB%8D%94%EB%A6%AC%EC%9B%80-%EC%A7%80%EA%B0%91-%EB%B3%B4%EC%95%88-%EC%B7%A8%EC%95%BD%EC%A0%90-%EB%B0%9C%EA%B2%AC-9fe3eda5ad45?source=search_post", "author_name": "David Park", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@David_Park", "publish_date": "2018-05-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-02", "readtime": "5.16", "claps": 50, "voters": 1, "content": "Metamask \uc774\ub354\ub9ac\uc6c0 \uc9c0\uac11 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac\ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ud070 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uad00\ub828 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \uac00\uce58\uc788\ub294 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 Wannabit\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.David ParkFollowMay 2, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readMetaMask\ub77c\ub294 Chrome Extension \uc9c0\uac11\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc774\ub354\ub9ac\uc6c0 \ubcf4\uad00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ud5c8\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4 \uc774 \uae00\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\uacb0\ub860\ubd80\ud130 \ub9d0\uc500\ub4dc\ub9ac\uc790\uba74 MetaMask\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c 1.220153036 ETH\ub97c \ub3c4\ub09c \ub2f9\ud588\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud574\ubcf4\ub2c8 MetaMask\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uac78\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ud560 \uc218 \ubc16\uc5d0 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\u201cETH\ub97c \uc1a1\uae08\ud588\ub294\ub370 \uc1a1\uae08\uc740 \uc548\ub418\uace0 \uc9c0\uac11\uc774 \ub2e4 \ud138\ub838\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6d0\uc778\uc740 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc Chrome extension\ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc0b0\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294\uac74 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4\u201d\uc544\ub798 \uc601\uc0c1\uc740 1.220153036 ETH\ub97c \ub3c4\ub09c \ub2f9\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud574\ubcf4\uace0 \uc774\ub7f0\uc800\ub7f0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ucd2c\uc601\ud55c \uc601\uc0c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc601\uc0c1\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac78 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30\uc5d4 \ub2e4\uc18c \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc800\ud76c\uac00 \uacbd\ud5d8\ud55c \uc774 \ud669\ub2f9\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ub9d0\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac83 \ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uadf8\ub098\ub9c8 \uc601\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\ub4dc\ub9ac\ub294\uac8c \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc774\ub77c \ud310\ub2e8\ub418\uc5b4 \ucca8\ubd80\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\uc800 \ub2f9\uc2dc\ub9cc \ud574\ub3c4 \ub611\uac19\uc740 \uc0c1\ud669\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ucca0\uc800\ud558\uac8c \ucd2c\uc601\uc744 \uc900\ube44\ud558\uace0 \ucc0d\uc5c8\ub2e4\uae30 \ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ud639\uc2dc\ub098 \ud558\ub294 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc5d0 \uc800\ud76c \uc9c1\uc6d0\ubd84\uc774 \uac1c\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd2c\uc601\ud55c \uc601\uc0c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\ud754\ub4e4\ub9bc\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\ub2c8 \ucc38\uace0\ud558\uc2dc\uace0 \ub05d\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubd10\uc8fc\uc2dc\uae38 \ubc14\ub78d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\ub798 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ub4dc\ub9ac\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\uba3c\uc800, \uc704 \uc601\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc120 Recipient Address (\uc774\ub354\ub9ac\uc6c0 \uc8fc\uc18c) 0xf5DdFBFdB891835474a1b11D0ecb7709bB5772Fb \ub85c 0.08 ETH\ub97c \uc1a1\uae08\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.\uc601\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub358 ETH\uc758 \ucd1d \uc218\ub7c9\uc740 0.99139 ETH\uc774\uace0 \uc544\ub798\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac70\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4.1.

(if they know what their token address is), what the symbol is, what decimals are, why they should be 18 and many other things.So, since MetaMask now supports EIP 747, which defines a way for sites to suggest an asset to their users\u2019 wallet to track, I decided to build a DApp to do that in the simplest way.By using the DApp you can create a link for your token or an embeddable widget for your website.How to build your token page to suggest adding it to MetaMask?Here it is https://vittominacori.github.io/watch-token/You should only enter your token address and click on the Search button.Your token will be retrieved from your Smart Contract and you will see informations like Name, Symbol and Decimals.Enter a link with a logo for your token (suggested a square SVG or PNG with transparent background, recommended greater than 64x64px) and click on the Create token page button.A dedicated page will be created for your token by showing your token informations.You can:Add to MetaMaskBy clicking this button your token will be suggested to add in your MetaMask extension.View on EtherscanThis button will open a link on Etherscan in your token address explorer.Share or EmbedYou can also share your link with your customers or embed the widget in your site to make adding token more and more easy.Try it and start share your token.This will be the result.Want to create

They will provide more details for us soon:Initial Coverage:Google has really done it this time. An apparent policy change has caused the search engine giant to scrub any cryptocurrency mining applications from the Chrome store. Amongst those applications removed, some of us in the ecosystem were surprised to see MetaMask removed.It\u2019s evident that blanket purges don\u2019t always solve the problem, and in this case, what\u2019s even more surprising is that Google allowed a malicious actor to upload a version of MetaMask to the Chrome store which phishes information from users:Many people rely on MetaMask to interphase with Web 3.0 sites and allows for the sending and receiving of blockchain based transactions. MetaMask also provides some relief by blocking phishing sites, a common issue in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. If you downloaded MetaMask before the malicious one was uploaded, you don\u2019t have anything to worry about. For Chrome, the team is still trying to figure out how pushing updates to the platform will work.Once again, it is not advisable to download the extension available in the Chrome store; if you do you stand a good chance of getting phished. An official guide was provided by the MetaMask team on how to install MetaMask manually in the meantime:If you haven\u2019t already, It is highly recommended that you endeavor to install Cryptonite, a browser add-on from MetaCert that provides protection from phishing. Cryptonite also provides a visual indicator when you reach a validated resource in the sphere of cryptocurrency turning its black shield icon green. A lot of users choose to utilize Cryptonite alongside MetaMask as an extra layer of protection.The MetaCert Protocol is a trust and reputation threat intelligence system for verifying web resources. It addresses a number of attack vectors, encompassing solutions for anti-phishing, child safety, brand protection, crypto-address verification, and news credibility. Find out more about the MetaCert Protocol, ask questions, and leave suggestions on both our White Paper and Technical Paper. You can also join our Telegram community to stay up to date on our blockchain project. Remember to install Cryptonite to protect yourself from phishing scams before it\u2019s too late.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Cryptocurrency", "Security", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Devcon4 Highlights: Serenity, Metamask Mobile, & the Reversible ICO", "post_link": "https://medium.com/bitfishlabs/devcon4-highlights-serenity-metamask-mobile-the-reversible-ico-a9d19681762d?source=search_post", "author_name": "bitfish", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bitfish", "publish_date": "2018-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-22", "readtime": "2.55", "claps": 50, "voters": 1, "content": "Devcon4 Highlights: Serenity, Metamask Mobile, & the Reversible ICObitfishFollowNov 9, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readDevcon is the biggest event on the calendar for Ethereum developers and community members. Every year, blockchain developers, researchers, engineers, academics, designers, and community members assemble in the largest gathering of creative minds focused on the growth and development of the Ethereum ecosystem.Devcon4, hosted at the Prague Congress Center in the crypto-friendly Czech Republic from October 30 to November 2, featured a heavy emphasis on the immediate future of the Ethereum network \u2014 specifically, the ongoing collaborative effort to deliver layer 2 solutions that will solve the ongoing scalability problem. Other standout announcements include a long-awaited sitrep on the second phase of the Ethereum roadmap and the reveal of MetaMask\u2019s mobile client.Devcon4 Brings Serenity to the TableDevcon4 launched with a day one keynote from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who kicked off the event with the announcement of Serenity, the Ethereum scaling solution. Serenity, stated Buterin, is the culmination of four years of intensive development, presenting a new scaling solution that is \u201c100% organic, genuine, pure Casper.\u201dThe Serenity solution announced at Devcon4 will be implemented in four stages, beginning with the introduction of a new proof-of-stake based \u201cbeacon chain\u201d that will exist in parallel to Ethereum in order to facilitate the participation of Casper validators. Phase one will be followed by a simplified launch of the Serenity that will feature shards as data chains. The second stage will introduce cross-shard communication, while the subsequent third and final stage will focus on tweaks and optimizations.The Serenity keynote, interestingly, ended with a singalong led by songwriter Jonathan Mann and Buterin himself.MetaMask Mobile Client PremiereSince release, MetaMask \u2014 a highly popular browser extension that functions as a bridge between normal web browsers and the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 has been restricted to desktop users only through Chrome, Firefox and, more recently, Brave. Devcon4 saw ConsenSys co-founder and CEO Joseph Lublin announce the launch of the mobile MetaMask user interface, allowing smartphone users to interact with dApps, smart contracts, and Ethereum wallets.Devcon4 also featured a range of keynotes focusing on state channels, with FunFair Technologies CTO Jeremy Longley delivering detailed insight into the \u201cLessons learned Implementing State Channels.\u201d Day two of the event saw Raiden developer Lefteris Karapetsas provide an in-depth breakdown of the viability creating production-ready payment channel networks for Ethereum.Day 3 of Devcon4 focused heavily on Plasma implementation, with a panel consisting of Eric Scrivner, Jake Craige, and Pete Kim exploring the process of integrating Ethereum at scale followed by \u201cPlasma Cash: Towards improved Plasma constructions\u201c led by Georgios Konstantopoulos.In addition to a rapid-fire series of scalability improvement projects, Devcon4 also provided a platform for ERC-20 architect Fabian Vogelsteller to announce an improved initial coin offering model called the \u201cRICO,\u201d or Reversible ICO. Vogelsteller\u2019s anti-scam RICO model would allow investors to recover their investment at any time, eliminating the threat presented by exit scams and ICO fraud.The final day of Devcon4 included a keynote speech entitled \u201cDecentralization Against Isolation\u201d delivered by Microsoft Research New York City chief researcher Glen Weyl, emphasizing the importance of collective collaborative action in order to ensure the fundamental decentralization-focused axioms of blockchain technology are protected from corporate and government manipulation.The announcement of Serenity\u2019s impending implementation represents a significant milestone in the ongoing development of Ethereum, foreshadowing a dramatic scalability improvement.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Metamask", "Serenity",

It is a cryptocurrency wallet for the Ethereum ecosystem. It stores your crypto, such as ETH and any ERC-20 (Ethereum-compatible) tokens you buy. You can use it to make cryptocurrency transactions online, as well as to interact with dapps (decentralized apps) in other ways. For instance, a journalist can use MetaMask to publish an article to the blockchain so that it can\u2019t ever be deleted.  MetaMask is a so-called hot wallet, which means that it\u2019s connected to the internet and therefore can be vulnerable if your computer gets hacked. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not recommended to store large amounts of money in it. People who own a lot of crypto should consider also getting a cold wallet, which is a piece of hardware that you have to plug in to your computer to transfer money in or out.  MetaMask setup is fairly straightforward and takes only a few minutes.Step 1: Download MetaMask.  MetaMask is a browser extension. To download it from the Chrome web store, click here. For Firefox, click here. In Brave, you\u2019re automatically prompted to install it when you visit a dapp. When you are done, you should see it in the top right of your browser, next to the address bar.Once installed, you can find MetaMask in the top right of your browser window.Step 2: Opt in to the beta and click through a series of compliance screens.Step 3: Create a password.Step 4: Copy your seed phrase somewhere safe.  Your seed phrase is very important: it can be used to restore your very same wallet, along with its contents, at any time. If you lose access to this computer or browser, or if you delete MetaMask and you don\u2019t have this seed phrase, you will not be able to gain access to the contents of this wallet. That is why MetaMask asks you to copy it and store it safely.Step 5: Repeat back your seed phrase to prove that you have copied it somewhere.That\u2019s it! You have a wallet. You don\u2019t have to buy ETH at this time.How do you get your wallet address?  In MetaMask, you can copy your wallet address to your clipboard by clicking on \u201cAccount 1.\u201dYour wallet address is a long string of alphanumeric characters that you can share with others so they can send you ETH or tokens. It cannot be used to take any money out of your wallet.  You should never type out your (or anyone else\u2019s) wallet address. Always copy-paste. It\u2019s important to prevent errors, since Ethereum transactions can\u2019t be reversed.What network should your wallet be on?   Your wallet should be on Main Ethereum Network. The other networks are there to allow software developers to test out their dapps without spending real money.What can I do with my wallet right now?  After the conclusion of the Civil token sale, we\u2019ll deposit your CVL tokens into your new wallet. If you have not yet shared your wallet address with us, you should receive an email asking you to do so before October 22. Please contact support@civil.co if you don\u2019t.  In order to make any blockchain transaction, you\u2019ll need a little bit of ETH to pay gas. Gas is a small fee that you pay to cover the computing cost of adding your transaction to the Ethereum blockchain. If you feel confident buying ETH already, go for it, and don\u2019t hesitate to contact support@civil.co if you have questions.

This release will enable consumers with the ability to purchase genetic testings products either by OMX payment or fiat. Additionally, the team has made updates separating the login and creation for enterprise and consumer account and to the health and lifestyle questionnaire within the profile section.The release will be live to the public at 12:00 pm GMT on 23rd May. This is a major milestone for Shivom as it will not only enable consumers to purchase directly within Shivom\u2019s marketplace via either OMX token or fiat payment but also bring mainstream partners to Shivom\u2019s innovative blockchain eco-system.The first group of partners featured on Shop 1.5 include Vitl, Living DNA and Chronomics, which provide ancestry, vitamin and cholesterol and epigenetic testing, respectively. Consumers purchasing any of these kits or services will need to agree to both Shivom and its partners\u2019 terms of use and privacy policies.At this time, customers are only able to purchase Chronomics epigenetic test with OMX tokens, whilst Living DNA and Vitl\u2019s kits can be purchased with fiat via our partner\u2019s checkout page. This allows users who don\u2019t have tokens to be able to obtain their genetic data file and reports without having to buy tokens from an exchange. Customers who purchase with OMX tokens will receive an automatic email providing a voucher code. This can then be redeemed on Chronomics website for one month\u2019s subscription of EpiPlanner and a test kit. Please be aware, a minimum subscription of 12 months is required.All of our D2C partners have undergone a thorough screening from our research and development (R&D) team prior to being granted promotional status within the marketplace. Shivom implements quality control procedures for its marketplace items and criteria which covers a variety of considerations to include data privacy, security and scientific quality (e.g., is a report evidence-based). When products or services are not supported by adequate clinical evidence, Shivom\u2019s R&D team may request further evidence to support the potential partner\u2019s case. Here is the link to our blog which provides an in-depth explanation of the reasoning we have for listing Vitl, Living DNA and Chronomics on our marketplace.To mark this major milestone, for a limited time only Shivom is offering several exciting promotions. Customers who purchase either LivingDNA or Vitl kits and upload their data on Shivom\u2019s platform will earn OMX tokens and also be eligible to receive special discounts or rewards on select products or services offered by Shivom and its partners (to be separately announced).Additionally, for a limited time, only customers are also able to purchase Chronomics EpiPlanner Test Kit + 1 Month Subscription for only 1,000 OMX! That\u2019s right, you read that correctly; for ~ $1 USD you can get your hands on this kit. Don\u2019t miss out on this incredible opportunity!\u201cToday\u2019s Shop 1.5 release stems from the collective hard work, focus and diligent efforts of our tech, science and business teams over the past 12 months. This release provides our early supporters with the ability to earn rewards for participating in our blockchain-based ecosystem and utilize either OMX tokens or fiat to procure top of the line kits from our curated product offerings. Once on our platform, consumers will not only have control over their data and be able to gain considerable health and wellness insights but also have the ability to participate in clinical research and even monetize on personal data if desired. We\u2019re proud of early progress and also look forward to our upcoming MVP release, which will mark another significant milestone and showcase the first cut of our enterprise solution offerings and clinical functionalities.\u201d said Henry Ines, CEO of Shivom.For more information about Shivom please visit hereTo read more about our affiliation with Living DNA please visit hereTo read more about our affiliation with Vitl please visit hereTo read more about our affiliation with Chronomics please visit hereAbout ShivomShivom is a biotechnology data and analysis company optimising the way DNA is shared, secured and analysed.

We recommend that you use MetaMask Wallet. Do not use exchange addresses (Kraken, Bittrex, Coinbase, Binance etc.). You can download MetaMask wallet on your desktop. MetaMask is much more than just an ETH wallet. Like Mist, it is an Ethereum Browser which provides you with the same features, functions, and ease of access as that of any regular Ethereum wallet.

Can we just make it?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bI know.I can just make\u2026\u2026..\u200bI think I can improve the inconvenience and make a better wallet if I use current wallets myself.\u200bSo! This week, I tried two web wallets myself.Of course, I\u2019m not going to write technical details.\u200bI write down what I felt by using Ether wallet, so I hope you take it easy.\u200bI have used two wallets this week: MetaMask and MyEtherWallet.\u200bLet\u2019s create a MetaMask wallet first!\u200b\u200b1. Add to Chrome\u200b2. Password Settings\u200b3. Save 12-digit Mnemonic code (Backup is required!! You can\u2019t get your wallet back if you lose it.)\u200b4. Enter 12-Digit mnemonic code\u200b5. End\u200b6. Click on the fox icon to the right of the search window!\u200b\u200b\u200bWhat is it? Is that all?Yes! That\u2019s all. It\u2019s easy to make a wallet, right?Let\u2019s make MyEtherWallet too.\u200b\u200b1. Enter the password\u200b2. Store the keystore file\u200b\u200b3. Save the Private Key\u200b4. To select the way to send ETH and token:5. End\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bWow, it\u2019s really easy.\u200bI made my own wallet with several mouse clicks.If it\u2019s inconvenient to use it, no one will use it, right?So, both wallets were convenient to use.Personally, it\u2019s easier for me to approach MetaMask than MyEtherWallet.And for MyEtherWallet, there are a variety of ways to send ETH and token, which I find attractive.\u200b\u200bWhen creating a wallet, you should be careful because you keep your password, mnemonic code, and key store files.If you lose it, you won\u2019t be able to recover it.\u200bIf you lose it\u2026.??Give me my wallet!!!!No matter how hard You beat it, itwon\u2019t come out.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bNow, let\u2019s transfer some ETH.Of course, I\u2019m going to be a two-user exchange.Like this!!!I transfer ETH, and I get a token, I get a token, and also get ETH.\u200b\u200bWell, first of all, you have to get some tokens and ETH to exchange them, right?That\u2019s why I charged ETH and tokens like this much!\u200bMetaMask (Ether : 71ETH , G_Token : 5,000,000)\u200bMyEtherWallet (Ether : 46 ETH , G_Token : 0)\u200b\u200bNow\u2026I\u2019ve prepared this much!What do you think about my ETH and token? Do you envy me? HahahaHmm\u2026\u200bYou don\u2019t have to do that at all!It\u2019s free ETH and token for everyone.(If it\u2019s real money, I\u2019m gonna do\u2026.)\u200b\u200b\u200bFirst, let\u2019s send 20 ETH and 2,000,000 G_Token from MetaMask to MyEtherWallet!Sending ETHs and tokens is very simple, too.\u200bLet\u2019s transfer ETH first.\u200b1. Copy and paste MyEtherWallet wallet addresses to recipient!2. Enter the amount of ETH I want to send.3. Click the Next button\u200b4. Click the Approve button5. End\u200b\u200bNow, let\u2019s send G_Token right away.1. Copy MyEtherWallet Address to Receiver!2. Enter the amount of G_Token to send.3. Click the Next button.\u200b4. Click the Approve button5. End\u200b\u200bWhat if we check on MetaMask after sending it?\u200bWe can really see that the ETH and G_ToKen quantities have decreased.Let\u2019s go ahead and check out MyEtherWallet.\u200bPlease check the red box!ETH and G_Token were transmitted normally.\u200b\u200bWhat is it? Is it over?Yes, it\u2019s over!I hope it wouldn\u2019t be hard to transfer concurrency from my wallet to others, right?!\u200b\u200b\u200bNext, we will send 3 ETH , 30 G_Token from MyEtherWallet to MetaMask.\u200b1. I connected my wallet to MyEtherWallet using MetaMask.\u200b2. Copy and paste the MetaMask address in the address field!3. Enter ETH in the amount to be transfer.4. Click the Create Transaction button.\u200b5. Click the Send Transaction\u200b6. Yes, I\u2019m sure!\u2026Click the button.\u200b7. Click the Approve button(MyEtherWallet wallet is connected to MetaMask.)\u200b\u200bLet\u2019s send G_Token right away.\u200b1. Link a wallet made by MyEtherWallet to MetaMask\u200b2. Copy and paste the MetaMask address in the address field!3. Enter the amount of G_Token to transfer4. Click the Create Transaction button\u200b5. Click Send Transaction button\u200b6.

Haha\u200bI\u2019ve tried these two wallets myself and introduced them to you briefly.Some of you could already use it, but some of you who haven\u2019t, I think, read my article and may think like this, \u201cI can try it, now\u201dThen, I think it would be good to try it on your own.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b(Don\u2019t use it!!)

Pay2Play Smart Contracts will keep your Ether wagering secure, plus you\u2019ll earn PLAY tokens after every wager.How does it work?Online wagering has always been shady at best.

It allows users to set up an Ethereum wallet within minutes and use it within the browser. This is very convenient, simple, most Ethereum apps are web-based.Q: Does MetaMask provide any form of support for developers?A: MetaMask provides an extension that can be installed in Chrome and Brave. It is also open source and has a big community.Q: Of all the crypto-coins out there. Why Ethereum?A: Ethereum allows a special way of transferring value via programmatic rules. Developers can use Ethereum based smart contracts to express old and novel paradigms of business logic which either reduce cost, cut out middleman or otherwise are impossible in traditional fiat based systems.Q: What are Smart Contracts?A: We use smart contracts because they allow us to:1) Lock from miniscule to very large amounts of value2) programmatically mediate3) fully create and automate uninterruptible value transferQ: Any advice for blockchain developers?Create your first app, dissect other apps, reach out to more experienced developers.You can try out Pay2Play Crypto-Enabled Wagering System here: pay2play.ioIf you don\u2019t know any other crypto-gamers or are just looking for somebody to play with join the PLAY community: https://www.reddit.com/r/pay2play/Discord: https://discord.gg/XW6gtmATwitter: https://twitter.com/Pay2PlayIOFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pay2playio/Email: partner@pay2play.io", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Esport", "Cryptocurrency", "Gaming", "Metamask"]}]
